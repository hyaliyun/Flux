The metaphor of a box of chocolates is an effective way to describe this notion, as one often cannot tell what flavor is inside each chocolate until they try it. The quote's origin can be traced back to the film, where the protagonist Forrest Gump shares his mother's wisdom. The character and the catchphrase became widely recognized and loved around the world, regardless of language or cultural differences. Spanish-speaking audiences, like others, have adopted this saying and use it as a reminder that life is full of surprises. The Spanish language, which originated from the Iberian Peninsula, is now spoken by over 460 million people worldwide. It is the second most spoken language in terms of native speakers and the third most spoken overall when you include non-native speakers. Spanish is an official language in 20 countries and is widely used in the United States, where it is the second most spoken language. Spain, Mexico, and Argentina are among the countries with the highest number of Spanish speakers. In the sentence mentioned above, the structure and vocabulary used are quite straightforward. \\"La vida\\" means \\"life,\\" whereas \\"es como\\" translates to \\"is like.\\" Moving forward, \\"una caja\\" stands for \\"a box,\\" and \\"de bombones\\" refers to \\"of chocolates.\\" The second part of the sentence, \\"nunca sabes,\\" means \\"you never know,\\" and \\"qué te va a tocar\\" translates to \\"what you're going to get.\\" This example serves as a way to showcase the beauty and expressiveness of the Spanish language, while also demonstrating how idioms and phrases from popular culture can find their way into languages worldwide. \\"La vida es como una caja de bombones, nunca sabes qué te va a tocar\\" is a simple yet poignant way of reminding us all that life is indeed full of surprises, both good and bad."},{"instruction":"FIV and HIV are both lentiviruses.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What did the author say about the Australian sun? Options: - something about it causing injury - not enough information - something about it being mild to skin - something about it being harsh on the skin === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"something about it being harsh on the skin"},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

Laura scowled when Christine leaned over to ask their classmate for the answers to the quiz they were taking, as Options are: 1). Laura was a misbehaving student.; 2). Christine was a misbehaving student.;","output":"Christine was a misbehaving student. The betrayal of trust evident on Laura's face emphasized how strict their school was about maintaining a code of honor. It was not just about passing the quiz or earning a good grade but also about learning the importance of integrity. To Laura, collaborating with others without the teacher's permission was a clear breach of the rules. Laura was well aware that she and Christine were poles apart when it came to their approach to academics. Though she wasn't the brightest student in class, she believed in putting in the effort and learning from her mistakes. Laura would spend hours studying and completing her assignments with dedication while Christine often resorted to shortcuts, believing that results were more important than the process. This incident was just another example of how their personalities were vastly different. It wasn't that Laura could not empathize with Christine's panic or desire to get a passing grade, but she believed in persevering honestly rather than violating the rules. After the quiz, Laura felt morally obligated to confront Christine about her actions. She approached her cautiously, not wanting to antagonize her. \\"Christine, can we talk for a minute?\\" she asked, her tone gentle yet firm. Christine rolled her eyes but obliged, retorting with, \\"What is it now, Miss Goody Two-Shoes?\\" Laura took a deep breath, swallowing the annoyance that threatened to emerge. \\"I saw you cheating during the quiz, Christine. You know that's against school rules, and you're putting our academic integrity at risk.\\" Christine smirked, unapologetic and nonchalant. \\"Oh, please. It's just a stupid quiz. Everyone does it, and no one really cares.\\" Laura steeled herself, refusing to back down. \\"That's not the point, Christine. It's about being honest with ourselves, with our work, and with our education. Taking a shortcut may seem like a quick fix now, but it's not sustainable in the long run. You're robbing yourself of the opportunity to grow and learn from your experiences. And that is something that will catch up to you eventually.\\" Christine's face hardened for a moment, but she braced herself and put on an indifferent façade. \\"Thanks for the lecture, Laura. But I'm doing just fine. Now if you'll excuse me, I have better things to do.\\" As Christine walked away, Laura felt a pang of disappointment. She knew it was impossible to change people overnight, but she couldn't help but hope that her words might have some impact on her classmate. With a sigh, Laura turned her focus back to herself, maintaining her commitment to her values and the principles of the code of honor. In the days that followed, Laura continued to observe Christine's behavior in class and with her peers. Despite her apparent nonchalance, Laura could see an uncertainty in Christine's eyes now and then. It seemed that her words had not fallen entirely on deaf ears. Whether or not Christine would change was uncertain, but what mattered was that Laura had taken a stand for what was right. She refused to be a part of a process that demeaned the value of hard work and honesty. Among the many lessons that life would teach Laura, this was one she would carry with her; it was by holding onto her principles that she would face her challenges head-on and emerge as a stronger individual."},{"instruction":"Facts: - signature: firma pablo neruda.svg - influences: vicente walt whitman , arthur rimbaud , charles baudelaire , karl huidobro marx , marcel proust , surrealism , rubén darío , jan francisco de quevedo , neruda , federico garcía lorca , - awards: international peace prize - name: pablo neruda Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of pablo neruda .

The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian \\"Opies\\" (i.e., \\"O.P.s\\"), the original people. Dr. Verne's wife Maggie (Talia Shire) accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant, but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he against having children. When flying in, they meet Travis Nelson (Burke Byrnes) and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet paper mill director Bethel Isely (Richard A. Dysart), who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at Opies. The latter have their own explanation; Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers, which Isely describes as \\"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\\". As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies who refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks (Armand Assante) and Kelso (Everett Creach), one of Isely's heavies. The heavy is armed with a chainsaw while Hawks has only a double-bit axe. The scuffle ends with Hawks laid on the ground with the chainsaw nearly at his throat, causing the Opies to relent and let the...

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans. Moore was hurt by a depressed Republican turnout and a write-in campaign that drained away votes. Question: Why did Moore quote the bible?

(Associated Press) House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., right, joined by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Calif., assails President Barack Obama's record during a news conference following a GOP strategy session on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2016. President Obama delivers his final State of the Union address... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Eyeing the end of his presidency, Barack Obama urged Americans Tuesday night to rekindle belief in the promise of change that first carried him to the White House, declaring that the country must not allow fear and division to take hold. \\"It's easier to be cynical, to accept that change isn't possible and politics is hopeless,\\" Obama said in his final State of the Union address. \\"But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future.\\" At the heart of Obama's address to lawmakers and a prime-time television audience was an implicit call to keep Democrats in the White House for a third straight term. He struck back at critics who have challenged his economic and national security stewardship, calling it all \\"political hot air.\\" In a swipe at some Republican presidential candidates, he warned against \\"voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background.\\" His words were unexpectedly echoed by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was selected to give the Republican response to Obama's address. Underscoring how the heated campaign rhetoric about immigrants and minorities from GOP front-runner Donald Trump in particular has unnerved some Republican leaders, Haley called on Americans to resist the temptation \\"to follow the siren call of the angriest voices.\\" \\"No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome,\\" Haley said in excerpts released ahead of her remarks. Seeking to shape his own legacy, Obama ticked through a retrospective of his domestic and foreign policy actions in office, including helping lead the economy back from the brink of depression, taking aggressive action on climate change and ending a Cold War freeze with Cuba. Yet he was frank about one of his biggest regrets: failing to ease the persistently deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans. \\"The rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,\\" he conceded. \\"There's no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.\\" Mindful of the scant prospect for major legislative action in an election year, Obama avoided the traditional litany of policy proposals. He did reiterate his call for working with Republicans on criminal justice reform and finalizing an Asia-Pacific trade pact, and he also vowed to keep pushing for action on politically fraught issues such as curbing gun violence and fixing the nation's fractured immigration laws. Yet Obama was eager to look beyond his own presidency, casting the actions he's taken as a springboard for future economic progress and national security. His optimism was meant to draw a contrast with what the White House sees as doom-and-gloom scenarios peddled by the GOP. \\"The United States of America is the most powerful nation on earth. Period,\\" he declared. \\"It's not even close.\\" ||||| He acknowledged that many Americans feel frightened and shut out of a political and economic system they view as rigged against their interests, even as he offered an implicit rebuke of Republicans who are playing on those insecurities in the race to succeed him. “As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background,” Mr. Obama said. “We can’t afford to go down that path.” He repeatedly sought to contrast Republicans’ bleak appraisals of the state of the nation with his own upbeat assessment. He called his opponents’ version “a fiction” and defended his decisions, many of them flash points for the partisan divide. Mr. Obama implicitly singled out Donald J. Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, for pointed criticism, saying that Americans must resist calls to stigmatize all Muslims at a time of threats from the Islamic State. “Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people?” Mr. Obama said. “Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?” ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — Since the tradition of a State of the Union address began in the late 18th century, only a few presidents have not delivered their final speech in person. FILE - In this Jan. 20, 2015, file photo, President Barack Obama gives his State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington as Vice Presient Joe Biden and House... (Associated Press) Harry Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter all sent written copies of their speeches to Congress. Barack Obama doesn't want to be No. 4. Instead, he will deliver his final State of the Union address at the Capitol on Tuesday, about a week earlier than usual. \\"Since I took office seven years ago in the midst of crisis, I don't think I've ever been more optimistic about a year ahead than I am right now,\\" Obama said in a video previewing the speech. Some questions and answers about the State of the Union address: ___ Q: Why is the president giving the speech? A: The Constitution requires that the president \\"from time to time give the Congress information on the State of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\\" ___ Q: Who delivered the first State of the Union address? A: George Washington on Jan. 8, 1790 in New York. ___ Q: Does it have to be a speech? A: No. For his first address on Dec. 8, 1801, Thomas Jefferson sent written copies to both houses of Congress to be read by each chamber's clerks. Jefferson wanted to simplify what he believed was an aristocratic imitation of the British monarch's speech from the throne, which he thought ill-suited for a republic. The practice of sending written copies to Congress continued for more than a century. ___ Q: Who resumed delivering the annual message in person? A: Woodrow Wilson, on April 8, 1913. He's also credited with transforming the speech from a report on executive branch activity into a blueprint for the president's legislative agenda for the year. ___ Q: When did the annual message become known as the \\"State of the Union\\" address? A: Franklin D. Roosevelt applied the constitutional phrase \\"State of the Union\\" to both the message and the event. It became the popular terminology from then on. ___ Q: How has the speech been affected by advances in communications technology? A: Calvin Coolidge delivered the first speech broadcast on radio in 1923. Harry Truman's address in 1947 was the first broadcast on television. Lyndon B. Johnson recognized the importance of having a national audience when he moved the speech from midafternoon to 9 p.m. in 1965 to attract the largest number of TV viewers. George W. Bush's 2002 speech was the first available as a live webcast on the White House website. Obama used social media to help power his presidential campaigns, and he's used Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram and YouTube to promote his State of the Union addresses. Obama devotes a page on the White House website to the speech. This year, the White House is using the online annotation platform Genius to revisit Obama's past State of the Union speeches by adding context and commentary. It's also using Snapchat and Amazon Video to bring Tuesday's address to the \\"people where they are.\\" ___ Q: Has the speech ever been postponed? A: Ronald Reagan's 1986 address was postponed after the Challenger space shuttle exploded in flight on Jan. 28 of that year. ___ Q: Is there a State of the Union speech every year? A: No. Each of the past five presidents — Reagan in 1981, George H.W. Bush in 1989, Bill Clinton in 1993, George W. Bush in 2001 and Obama in 2009 — chose not to give an official State of the Union address their first year in office. That speech would have come soon after their inaugural addresses. ___ Q: Has the State of the Union speech always been delivered in person since Wilson resumed the practice? A: No. Truman sent his final message in print, as did Eisenhower in 1961 and Carter in 1981. As Eisenhower recovered from a heart attack in 1956, he prepared a seven-minute, filmed summary of the message from his retreat in Key West, Florida, that was broadcast nationwide. Richard Nixon sent a printed message in 1973; his staff said an oral message would have come too soon after his second inaugural address. ___ Q: Which presidents didn't deliver a State of the Union message? A: William Henry Harrison, who died 32 days after his inauguration in 1841, and James A. Garfield, who was assassinated in 1881 after 199 days in office. ___ Q: Who sits with the first lady? A: The White House invites people whose personal stories help highlight a particular issue or public policy. Reagan was the first in 1982 to invite special guests and recognize them during the speech. Every president since has continued the tradition. With gun violence drawing increased attention from Obama, one seat in Michelle Obama's guest box will be left empty in memory of victims of gun violence, the White House said. ___ Source: Congressional Research Service, White House. ___ Online: State of the Union: http://www.whitehouse.gov/sotu ___ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap .

At least that’s the conclusion of a new paper by cosmologist Fergus Simpson, who has estimated that the average weight of intelligent extraterrestrials would be 650 pounds (300 kilograms) or more. ET would have paled in comparison to these interstellar behemoths. The argument relies on a mathematical model that assumes organisms on other planets obey the same laws of conservation of energy that we see here on Earth—namely, that larger animals need more resources and expend more energy, and thus are less abundant. There are many small ants, for example, but far fewer whales or elephants. Thus, throughout the universe, as is the case on Earth, there are likely more small animals than large ones, says Simpson, a scientist at the University of Barcelona. Since the number of planets inhabited by relatively small animals would outnumber the amount of worlds where large ones predominate, it is most likely that we find ourselves on a planet with relatively small animals—and are ourselves probably one of the smaller intelligent beings, he adds. Simpson says that a certain minimum size is probably necessary for intelligent life, and he used the range of body sizes found in animals on Earth to come up with the most probable distribution of organisms on other planets. “I think the average size calculation is reasonable,” says Duncan Forgan, a scientist at the University of St Andrews school of physics and astronomy who wasn’t involved in the paper, which is published at arXiv.org. There are many factors that the calculation doesn’t take into account, however, Forgan says, in part because it may simply not be feasible to do so. Simpson’s paper “doesn't address the correlation between body mass and the planet's surface gravity,” for example, Forgan says. Planets with a more powerful gravitational pull might be expected to have smaller animals; on a tiny planet with weak gravity, you might expect the opposite. On the whole, though, taking this into account “might push the mean size down a bit, but it's hard to say without doing a much harder calculation,” Forgan says. Seth Shostak, a researcher at the SETI Institute, says the paper reminded him of previous work he had done suggesting that any extraterrestrials we might eventually find would be on the larger side since bigger animals live longer, and an organism with a longer lifespan might be more likely to develop the kind of technology necessary for making contact with humans. See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows However, that work, just like Simpson’s paper, is all speculation. Fun and fascinating stuff, but still speculation. “It’s interesting, but there’s really no concrete data to work with,” he says. We only have our planet and its inhabitants to serve as a model for what life looks like. This paper, like others, assumes that Earth is a “typical” or average planet, and uses information from here to make assumptions about the unknown. But it’s impossible to know if that’s appropriate to do, from a scientific point of view. The paper also didn’t take into account any kind of evolutionary theories, Shostak says (which, to be fair, might not even be feasible in this kind of a calculation). While larger animals do in general tend to be more intelligent than tiny ones, it’s all relative—we are, of course, not the planet’s biggest organism. And it’s really our opposable thumbs and upright stance—not our body mass—that has allowed our intelligence to blossom, Shostak says. “Polar bears are large but do not write great literature and build radio towers,” Shostak says with a laugh, “and a lot of that is probably because they are walking around on all fours.” ||||| WARCZone is a collection of outsider-uploaded WARCs, which are contributed to the Internet Archive but may or may not be ingested into the Wayback Machine.

They based their estimate on an earlier one by British entomologist C B Williams, who once calculated that the number or insects alive on earth at a given moment was one million trillion. \\"If, to take a conservative figure, one percent of this host is ants, their total population is ten thousand trillion,\\" wrote Wilson and Hoelldobler. \\"Individual workers weigh on average between 1 to 5 mg, according to the species. When combined, all ants in the world taken together weigh about as much as all human beings.\\" Wilson and Hoelldobler's calculation is based on the idea that the average human weighs a million times more than the average ant. So how well does that stand up to scrutiny? The average adult human weighs 62kg, so that would make the average ant about 60mg. \\"There are ants that weigh 60mg, but they're really the big ants,\\" says Francis Ratnieks, Professor of Apiculture at the University of Sussex. \\"The common ants which live in British gardens weigh about 1mg or 2mg.\\" How do you weigh an ant? Image copyright Getty Images \\"It's very easy to weigh an ant. You buy a small electronic balance, and you place the ant on the balance,\\" says Ratnieks. But he advises you refrigerate it first. \\"That way it doesn't run away.\\" Another option is to weigh them in a group, says Mike Fox from BWARS: \\"I would simply take a suitable container such as a specimen tube and weigh it empty, then put in a counted number of ants, say 100. Weigh again. Deduct the weight of the empty tube and divide it by the number of ants.\\" Discover more about the structured social system of ants With around 13,000 species worldwide, ranging in length from less than 1mm to 30mm, it's probable their weights vary greatly - though most experts seem to agree the average weight of an ant is less than 10mg. But no-one knows how many ants there are in the world. The BBC Four documentary claims they number not 10,000 trillion but 100 trillion, though it still suggests the total weight of ants equals the total weight of humans. Experts from the Natural History Museum, Bristol University's Ant Lab, and BWARS (Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society), among others, say there is no realistic estimate. Even by Wilson and Hoelldobler's own figures, their calculation is wrong. There are 7.2 billion humans on the planet today - if we take everyone over the age of 15, they weigh a combined total of about 332bn kg. If we imagine there are 10,000 trillion ants in the world, weighing an average of 4mg, their total weight comes to just 40bn kg. If we allow for the smaller human population at the time they wrote their book, and a slightly lower average weight, they are still a long way out. But Ratnieks believes Wilson and Hoelldobler's claim - though untrue in relation to today's world population - would have once been accurate. \\"I think if we went back 2,000 years, certainly the ants would've outweighed the humans... but at roughly the time that America became independent [1776], or a little bit before that, that's when we humans became more impressive in our weight than the ants,\\" he says. \\"We must also remember that humans are getting fatter all the time. We're not just increasing in population, we're increasing in fatness, so I think we've left the ants behind.\\" Image copyright Thinkstock Listen to More or Less on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service, or download the free podcast.

Super Unimportant Reviews/ YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET Our fascination with aliens is, I fear, closely correlated to our ignorance about them. We speculate, we dream, we make movies. At heart, though, we have no idea whether our microwaves, our plastic bags, even our marble dough-rollers aren't actually beings from outer space. (I'm also suspicious of some of the \\"humans\\" who live on my street.) Instead, we imagine little green people. I bring you, therefore, threatening news. Little green people might actually be very, very big. University of Barcelona cosmologist Fergus Simpson has been thinking deeply about alien size. He recently published a paper entitled \\"The Nature of Inhabited Planets And Their Inhabitants.\\" He relies on a mathematical model that says other planets conserve energy just like we do. \\"Throughout the animal kingdom, species which are physically larger invariably possess a lower population density, possibly due to their enhanced energy demands,\\" he says. Bigger beings consume more and release more energy than do smaller beings. Earth, he says, \\"constitutes a simple random sample amongst inhabited planets.\\" We have more smaller beings than larger ones. He doesn't believe, however, that Earth is a fair sample. Instead, he says that \\"most inhabited planets are likely to be closer in size to Mars than the Earth.\\" If that is true, then \\"since population density is widely observed to decline with increasing body mass, we conclude that most intelligent species are expected to exceed 300kg.\\" Yes, that would be 650 pounds. Your average polar bear weighs around 650 pounds. But as Seth Shostak, researcher at the SETI (Search For Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) Institute told Newsweek: \\"Polar bears are large but do not write great literature and build radio towers and a lot of that is probably because they are walking around on all fours.\\" Ultimately, we know very little because we've seen very little. Shostak, who has done some previous work suggesting any extraterrestrials we might find would be on the large side, notes the speculative nature of Simpson's paper. \\"It's interesting, but there's really no concrete data to work with.\\" We base many of our assumptions on our own incomplete knowledge, when there might be entirely other forms of being that we simply haven't imagined or encountered. There might be forms of matter that are beyond the scope of our current thinking. It's still stimulating to imagine that beings twice our size or more could be looking down at us. It's also worrying that Stephen Hawking fears they might hate us. Might they, though, be looking at us with a tinge of contempt? Might they consider that we are, both physically and intellectually, mere self-aggrandizing ants who believe that we know and see when all we're really doing is blowing our primitive trumpets? Might they giggle to each other and snort: \\"Humans? They're just not worth it, are they?\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"A new paper by cosmologist Fergus Simpson has estimated that if intelligent extraterrestrial beings do exist, their average weight would likely be around 650 pounds (300 kilograms) or more. Simpson's argument is based on a mathematical model that assumes organisms on other planets obey the same laws of conservation of energy as observed on Earth. This model suggests that larger animals require more resources and expend more energy, resulting in fewer larger animals compared to smaller ones. Therefore, it is likely that the number of planets inhabited predominantly by smaller animals is greater than those with larger animals, making us one of the smaller intelligent beings in the universe. While the paper offers an interesting perspective, it is important to note that it is purely speculative and lacks concrete data."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Jordan prevented Kendall from falling down by jumping underneath her and supporting her weight.

It was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight under the name Science Fiction Writers of America, Inc. The president of SFWA as of 2015 is Cat Rambo. - Big science is a term used by scientists and historians of science to describe a series of changes in science which occurred in industrial nations during and after World War II, as scientific progress increasingly came to rely on large-scale projects usually funded by national governments or groups of governments. Individual or small group efforts, or Small Science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the Large Hadron Collider, costing between 5 and 10 billion. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - The Ringworld Throne is a novel by Larry Niven , first published in 1996 . It is the direct sequel to his previous work The Ringworld Engineers ( 1980 ) . He wrote it as a replacement after being unable to finish his contracted novel The Ghost Ships , the sequel to The Integral Trees and The Smoke Ring . - The Integral Trees is a 1984 science fiction novel by Larry Niven (first published as a serial in \\"Analog\\" in 1983). Like much of Niven's work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. A sequel, \\"The Smoke Ring\\", was published in 1987. - A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (1029 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 km, they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. They are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. If the remnant has too great a density, something which occurs in excess of an upper limit of the size of neutron stars at 2-3 solar masses, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - The Magic Goes Away is a fantasy short story written by Larry Niven in 1976, and later expanded to a novella of the same name which was published in 1978. While these works were not the first in the \\"Magic Universe\\" or \\"Warlock\\" series, they marked a turning point after the 1973 oil crisis and Niven's subsequent transformation of the series into an allegory for a modern-day energy crisis. The setting was later used as a backdrop for a series of full-length novels, \\"The Burning City\\" (2000) and its sequel, \\"Burning Tower\\" (2005), which were co-written with Jerry Pournelle. - Laurence van Cott Niven (born April 30, 1938)known as Larry Nivenis an American science fiction writer. His best-known work is \\"Ringworld\\" (1970), which received Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him the 2015 recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series \\"The Magic Goes Away\\", rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource. - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - The Locus Awards are an annual set of literary awards by the science fiction and fantasy magazine \\"Locus\\", a monthly based in Oakland, California, United States. The award winners are selected by poll of magazine readers. - Ringworld is a 1970 science fiction novel by Larry Niven, set in his Known Space universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature. Niven later added four sequels and four prequels. (The Fleet of Worlds series, co-written with Edward M. Lerner provides the four prequels as well as \\"Fate of Worlds\\", the final sequel.) These books tie into numerous other books set in Known Space. \\"Ringworld\\" won the Nebula Award in 1970, as well as both the Hugo Award and Locus Award in 1971. - The Ringworld Engineers is a 1980 science fiction novel by Larry Niven. It is the first sequel to Niven's award-winning \\"Ringworld\\" and was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1981. - The Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award is a lifetime honor presented annually by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America to no more than one living writer of fantasy or science fiction.

To understand this in detail, it is essential to look at the historical context, key terms in the question, and the significance of IBM-compatible machines in the development of personal computers. Historical Context: IBM, the International Business Machines Corporation, is an American multinational technology company that launched the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in 1981. The IBM PC was a highly influential personal computer as it introduced a new standard for PCs due to its advanced design and compatibility with various hardware and software components. This made the IBM PC the blueprint for many future personal computers. Key Terms: 1. Operating System (OS) - An operating system is a critical software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides a platform for other application software to run on. It is responsible for managing tasks such as memory allocation, input/output handling, file management, and process scheduling, allowing the computer's user to interact effectively with the computer's hardware. 2. IBM-compatible machines - IBM-compatible machines, also known as PC-compatible or PC clones, are personal computers that are designed to function similarly to the original IBM PC. They follow the same hardware and software standards set by the IBM PC, which allows the same operating system and application software to work on these machines without significant modifications. This compatibility creates a broader market for both hardware and software developers. Answering the Question: To address the question, we need to identify the operating system(s) that can run on IBM-compatible personal computers. When the IBM PC was launched, it initially used the IBM PC DOS (Disk Operating System) as its primary operating system. PC DOS was a version of MS-DOS, an operating system developed by Microsoft for IBM. As IBM-compatible machines emerged, they also started adopting MS-DOS and, later, other Microsoft operating systems like Windows. The Windows operating system became the most widely-used OS in the world and transformed the personal computing landscape. While other operating systems like Linux and Apple's macOS have gained prominence over time, the IBM-compatible machines primarily run on Microsoft's operating systems. In summation, the question \\"Which operating system runs on IBM-compatible machines?\\" is inquiring about the specific operating system(s) developed to function on personal computers designed to be compatible with IBM's original PC standard. The historical answer would be MS-DOS, while today, it would primarily be various versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system, with some IBM-compatible machines running Linux as an alternative choice."},{"instruction":"Um die erholsame Atmosphäre zu gewährleisten, ist Kindern unter 16 Jahren der Zugang zum Wellnessbereich untersagt.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson) (Associated Press) COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) — Raucous crowds of protesters took to the streets late Thursday in California as Donald Trump brought his Republican presidential campaign to conservative Orange County after sweeping the Northeast GOP primaries. Dozens of protesters were mostly peaceful as Trump gave his speech inside the Pacific Amphitheater. After the event, however, the demonstration grew rowdy and spilled into the streets. At least four people were arrested and one Trump supporter had his face bloodied in a scuffle as he tried to drive out of the arena. One man jumped on a police car, leaving its front and rear windows smashed and the top dented in and other protests sprayed graffiti on a police car and the venue's marquee. Dozens of cars -- including those of Trump supporters trying to leave -- were stuck in the street as several hundred demonstrators blocked the road, waved Mexican flags and posed for selfies. Police in riot gear and on horseback pushed the crowd back and away from the venue. There were no major injuries and police did not use any force.The crowd began dispersing about three hours after the speech ended. Earlier in the evening, a half-dozen anti-Trump protesters taunted those waiting to get into the venue. Trump supporters surrounded one man who waved a Mexican flag and shouted \\"Build that wall! Build that wall!\\" -- a reference to Trump's call to create a barrier between the United States and Mexico to stop illegal border crossings. At one point, seven women wearing no shirts and Bernie Sanders stickers over their breasts entered the square outside the amphitheater. They said they were protesting Trump's lack of engagement on issues of gender equality and women's rights. \\"I feel like he wants to make America great again, but certainly not for women, for the LBGTQ community or for the lower class,\\" said one of the women, Tiernan Hebron. \\"He has, like, done nothing to help with gender equality or women's rights or reproductive rights or anything.\\" Trump has drawn large crowds across the country as he has campaigned for the White House and some of his events have been marred by incidents both inside and outside these venues. Earlier this week, a Trump rally in nearby Anaheim, California turned contentious when his supporters and counter protestors clashed, leaving several people struck by pepper spray. Trump was not present. Trump has drawn large crowds to most of his campaign events, and Thursday was no exception. The Pacific Amphitheatre was filled to its capacity of about 18,000 and many hundreds more were turned away. Ly Kou, 47, of Ontario, said she likes Trump because he has vowed to put the country first. \\"It's obvious that America loves Trump,\\" said Kou, who is from Laos, as she pointed at the waiting throng. \\"This thing about him being racist? Look around the crowd.\\" Trump was traveling from the rally site to the state's Republican convention in Burlington in the San Francisco Bay area. ||||| Add this Tweet to your website by copying the code below.

That work, as well as The Discourses, a rigorous analysis of the classical period, did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including Jean-Jacques Rousseau) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence. Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the di Medici family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the secure and powerful state. Thomas Hobbes, well known for his theory of the social contract, goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the English Renaissance. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.

Although the trail began gently, it progressed over several mountains with paths as narrow as 2 feet and in wider parts covered with boulders and sharp rocks. Under these conditions horses died in huge numbers, giving the route the informal name of Dead Horse Trail. The volumes of travellers and the wet weather made the trail impassable and, by late 1897, it was closed until further notice, leaving around 5,000 stranded in Skagway. An alternative toll road suitable for wagons was eventually constructed and this, combined with colder weather that froze the muddy ground, allowed the White Pass to reopen, and prospectors began to make their way into Canada. Moving supplies and equipment over the pass had to be done in stages. Most divided their belongings into 65 pounds packages that could be carried on a man's back, or heavier loads that could be pulled by hand on a sled. Ferrying packages forwards and walking back for more, a prospector would need about thirty round trips, a distance of at least 2,500 miles , before they had moved all of their supplies to the end of the trail.

It goes without saying that the hype and anticipation surrounding the movie had skyrocketed, considering the vast ensemble of talented actors and a director known for his previous accomplishments. However, this cinematic venture fell short on all aspects, including plot, characterization, direction, cinematography, and even the soundtrack. First and foremost, the plot itself was abysmally weak. Pandering to every cliché imaginable, the narrative was like a jigsaw puzzle made up of pieces from various movies we have watched over the years, but lacking the coherence to form any discernible image. It fails to engage the audience from the get-go due to its lack of originality, intrigue, and substance. One can hardly make sense of the underlying message or theme when the story's structure is filled with gaping plot holes and incoherencies. The characters, meant to be a saving grace, were devoid of any depth or complexity. Instead, we were subjected to one-dimensional stereotypes played by exceptional actors who seemed trapped and pigeonholed into their respective roles. The dialogue, stilted and contrived, did not help in salvaging the performances. Rather, it highlighted the blatant negligence that befell the writing process and demonstrated a lack of clear vision for the characters and storyline. The director's attempt to stitch together countless clichés into a coherent work of art failed spectacularly. John Mistake's direction lacked the finesse and cohesion that his previous films possessed, giving the impression that he had abandoned his innovative approach in favor of attempting a generic crowd-pleaser. Sadly, this only led to the film's unraveling, as the audience is constantly questioning the motives behind particular scenes that feel misplaced or irrelevant to the overall narrative. The cinematography, helmed by renowned director of photography Tim Shakyhands, followed suit, falling far from his usual quality and style. The audience is subjected to jarring and confusing visuals that lack continuity and a clear purpose. Equally disappointing is the soundtrack, which is comprised of forgettable melodies that fail to evoke any emotion and serve as nothing more than background noise. In conclusion, \\"Unbearable Disappointment\\" has severely missed the mark in creating a memorable and engaging film experience. It is a prime example of wasted potential — a reminder of what can happen when a talented ensemble is restrained by substandard storytelling and a lack of true creative vision. This convoluted mess of a movie ultimately leaves audiences with only one distinct feeling: a disheartening sense of dismay and the crushing realization that their time and money have been poorly spent in the pursuit of entertainment."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: \\"Five girls dressed in white shirts and plaid skirts stand on a path in a grassy area next to a body of water while a man in a hat sits in the background.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The girls are roasting the man over a fire pit.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?

Fears that the U.S. economy is sliding back toward recession and a recent jumpe in Italian and Spanish bond yields towards danger levels have driven investors to seek cover. U.S. stock futures SPc1 were slightly higher after major U.S. markets fell by 4-5 percent overnight, but employment figures due later in the day could trigger further selling if the jobs picture disappoints. Complicating matters was that Japan and Switzerland have intervened this week to weaken their currencies, which were considered the safest in the developed world. That has caused some safety-seeking investors to think twice about stashing money there when financial market volatility is spiking. So far, retail investors were participating in the heavy selling but institutional equity investors in Asia were not completely liquidating their positions, instead continuing to cut riskier bets and protect their portfolios. \\"What you're seeing is a shakeout of all the money that was put to work in the hope that 2011 turns out like last year, where you saw a nice bounce around the same time,\\" said a Hong Kong-based multi-strategy hedge fund manager. \\"That could still happen but with the losses that people have already taken this year, looks like no wants to take the risk. It's about preserving capital now.\\" Japan's Nikkei share average fell 3.4 percent to the lowest since the week following the country's massive earthquake and tsunami in March. The benchmark MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was down 3.8 percent , with investors selling across the sectors, whether they are defensive or cyclical. The index is on course for the biggest weekly drop since May 2010, when the European debt crisis was flaring up. \\"Clearly, it's just a knee-jerk reaction to what's going on,\\" said Michael Heffernan, senior client advisor with Austock Group in Australia. \\"We're going down simply on the fear that Italy can't pay its debts.\\" Within Asia, markets with high trade exposure to the West and reliance on commodities looked particularly vulnerable. Taiwan, where the technology sector makes up about half of the equity market capitalisation and depends heavily on exports to developed countries, is a weak point in Asia. The benchmark stock index in Taiwan led Asia, falling 5 percent . Europe, where overloaded national balance sheets have bedeviled politicians struggling to grasp the implications, is currently in the eye of the storm. Italian and Spanish bond yields have kept rising and German bond yields falling, widening spreads the most since the euro was born and causing deep-seated fears about what else policymakers can do to keep the euro zone together. The European Central Bank resumed buying government bonds after a four-month break and announced new longer-term funding for liquidity-starved banks, investors kept selling peripheral European bonds. Traders went warily back to the yen. The dollar was down 0.4 percent to 78.83 yen , a day after Japan reportedly spent a record 4 trillion yen (50.6 billion) to weaken its currency and bolster its export competitiveness. U.S. 10-year Treasury futures ticked up 6/32 to 128-6/32 TYc1, just below the Thursday high of 128-12/32, which was the highest since December 2008. The cash yield was at 2.42 percent , a basis point higher than late New York on Thursday when the 10-year yield hit the lowest since October 2010. The yield has sank 37 basis points so far in August, as a wall of worry sends investors to the most liquid bond market in the world. Commodity markets extended heavy overnight losses on fears of slowing demand. U.S. crude for September delivery CLc1 fell 1 percent to 85.75 a barrel after plunging as much as 6 percent on Thursday and closing at the lowest since February 2011. In an ominous sign, gold prices were soft despite the spiralling fears hurting risky markets. Investors were having to sell gold positions to cover losses elsewhere in their portfolios. Spot gold prices eased 3.71 an ounce to 1,644.19 after hitting a record around 1,681 an ounce on Thursday before losing some of the gains. \\"This will not be a quiet day.

If they pass, they will be given an opportunity to pay an application fee and a fine and be given a guest worker permit allowing them to stay in the US, work, travel, and pay taxes.” Rubio contends the status quo is \\"horrible for America,\\" and says the Gang of Eight's plan \\"is not a special path\\" and in fact enforces \\"consequences\\" for violators. Elsewhere in Rubioland: On Jay-Z's Cuba trip: \\"Jay-Z needs to get informed. One of his heroes is Che Guevara. Che Guevara was a racist that wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent, so he should inform himself on the guy that he’s propping up.\\" And furthermore: \\"If Jay-Z was truly interested in the true state of affairs in Cuba, he would have met people that are being oppressed, including a hip-hop artist in Cuba who is right now being oppressed and persecuted and is undergoing a hunger strike because of his political lyrics.

According to Politico, Rubio is emphasizing the importance of rigorous background checks for immigrants, stating that only those without a criminal background will qualify for the proposed guest worker permit system. Rubio explains that the Gang of Eight's immigration plan \\"is not a special path\\" and enforces \\"consequences\\" for violators, addressing concerns from conservatives. It, in fact, aims to improve conditions for Americans as well, as the current immigration status quo is \\"horrible for America.\\" In addition to vigorously supporting the immigration reform, Senator Rubio shared his thoughts on other key issues. Regarding Jay-Z's trip to Cuba, he criticized the musician for not being informed about the political situation and missed opportunities to meet with oppressed Cuban citizens, such as a hip-hop artist being persecuted for his political lyrics. Rubio also called out Jay-Z's adoration of Che Guevara, a known racist who believed in the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent. On the topic of North Korea, Rubio referred to the country's ruling system as \\"a criminal syndicate\\" rather than a legitimate government. Despite this harsh view, he did express encouragement at the progress made by Secretary of State John Kerry in negotiations with China, hoping that the Chinese will \\"recalibrate\\" their approach towards North Korea. Lastly, Rubio addressed the gun debate in America, emphasizing the need for an open conversation about the root causes of violence. He argues that the focus should not solely be on the weapons used, but rather on understanding why individuals commit such horrific acts in the first place. Senator Rubio's commitment to addressing immigration reform and other pressing issues demonstrates the importance of engaging in open dialogue and seeking actionable solutions to improve the lives of both immigrants and American citizens. His dedication to examining the root causes of complex issues, such as violence and political oppression, highlights his comprehensive approach to generating well-rounded, meaningful change."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","output":"Sure.

The first step to solve this equation for c is to simplify the equation by performing the basic arithmetic operations. This eliminates the constant terms on the left side of the equation. 10 - 22 gives -12. So the equation now is 3*c - 12 = 0. To isolate c, the next step is to move -12 from the left side to the right side of the equality. Remember, when you change sides, the sign of the term changes. Therefore, -12 will become +12 when moved to the right side of the equation. The equation then transforms to 3*c = 12. Now, to completely isolate c, the equation needs to be divided by the coefficient of c, which is 3. So the final operation will be dividing both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for c. c = 12 / 3. Solving the above, we get the value of c = 4. Therefore, the solution to this equation is c = 4."},{"instruction":"Facebook means never having to say goodbye.

These sanctions were lifted in 2006. Due in large part to foreign aid and investment inflow following the end of the war, Liberia maintains a large account deficit, which peaked at nearly 60% in 2008. Liberia gained observer status with the World Trade Organization in 2010 and is in the process of acquiring full member status. What were UN sanctions place placed on 2003?","output":"The United Nations (UN) in 2003 placed sanctions on Liberian timber exports. This came as a measure to control Liberia’s drastic increase in timber exports, which had grown from 5 million in 1997 to over 100 million in 2002. The significant rise led to concerns, as the revenue from the timber exports was believed to be funding rebels in Sierra Leone. The financial support from timber exports was fueling consistent civil unrest, violence, and destabilizing conditions in Sierra Leone, which were creating a significant obstacle for peace and stability in the region. Hence, the sanctions were intended to thwart this financing source for the rebels, thereby reducing their power. The sanctions placed restrictions on the international sale of Liberian wood, essentially aiming to strangle the financial lifelines of the Sierra Leonean rebels. The standard elements of these sanctions included a ban on the direct or indirect import of all round log and timber products originating in Liberia. In essence, the application of these sanctions was a key economic intervention by the UN targeting to break the link between the exploitation of natural resources and the fueling of armed conflicts. This was particularly a strategic move as timber played a significant part in Liberia's economy. These sanctions were upheld for about three years, eventually being lifted in 2006. The decision to lift the sanctions came after a thorough evaluation of the political and economic context in Liberia, which had considerably improved during that time. The sanctions seemed to fulfill their envisioned purpose, in stifling off a vital source of funding for the rebels in Sierra Leone. As the political situation stabilized, economic activity needed to be revitalized. The lifting of sanctions allowed the legitimate trade of Liberian timber, creating opportunities for economic growth and development, albeit under international monitoring to prevent misuse. Therefore, robust measures were established to ensure the revenue from timber exports was directed towards rebuilding the country’s economy and not towards illicit activities. However, despite sanctions being lifted, Liberia continued to have a large account deficit, which peaked at nearly 60% in 2008. This was majorly due to the inflow of foreign aid and investment following the end of the war. Nonetheless, Liberia managed to gain observer status with the World Trade Organization in 2010 and was in the move to acquire full member status, suggesting the nation's emphasis on integrating into global economic structures and networks. Overall, while the UN sanctions in 2003 placed a temporary hold on Liberia's timber trade, they played a significant role in disrupting the war economy and guiding the nation onto a new path of peace and economic recovery. The sanctions exemplify the powerful role of international governing bodies in conflict management and resolution though economic means."},{"instruction":"sharp beaks are a kind of adaptation for catching prey sharp beaks are a kind of adaptation for catching Choices: 1). sticks; 2). small food beings; 3). bubbles; 4). rocks;","output":"Sharp beaks are a kind of adaptation predominantly for catching small food beings (Option 2), although their function and efficiency can extend to various other tasks within the environment. In the animal kingdom, particularly among birds, beak morphology is crucial for survival as it directly relates to the ability of an animal to acquire and manipulate resources, including food. A sharp beak is a specialized adaptation that allows birds and other animals to more effectively catch and consume specific types of prey and assist in various activities. Here's a more detailed overview of the function of sharp beaks: 1. Catching and consuming small food beings (Option 2): Birds with sharp beaks, such as birds of prey and insectivorous birds, have evolved this adaptation to efficiently catch and consume small animals like insects, fish, and rodents. A sharp beak allows them to pierce the prey's body without difficulty, hold it firmly, and tear it into bite-sized pieces. Birds like eagles, hawks, and falcons demonstrate this adaptation's proficiency, as they are among the most skilled predators among avian species. 2. Assisting in other tasks: Although sharp beaks provide a significant advantage in catching and consuming prey, they also have relevance in other aspects of an animal's life. For instance, birds with sharp beaks may engage in preening, which requires removing dirt, parasites, and damaged feathers from their body to maintain good health. Additionally, a sharp beak can be useful during nest-building or other environmental manipulations that demand precision. Addressing the other options provided: 1. Sticks (Option 1): Sharp beaks are not an adaptation directly created for catching or manipulating sticks. Birds with curved beaks, such as parrots, are more adept at handling sticks and branches when constructing nests or using them as tools. However, sharp beaked birds may still use their beaks to interact with sticks when necessary. 3. Bubbles (Option 3): Since bubbles are not typically associated with an animal's survival, sharp beaks are not adapted for catching or manipulating them. This option does not apply to the functional context in which sharp beaks serve a purpose. 4. Rocks (Option 4): Sharp beaks are not designed for interacting with rocks, as doing so could damage the beak or result in inefficient interactions. Some birds, such as the black oystercatcher, have evolved specialized beak shapes to manipulate and extract prey from rocky environments. Consequently, sharp beaks are not primarily adapted for catching or handling rocks. In summary, sharp beaks are a specialized adaptation that primarily assists in catching and consuming small food beings. This adaptation enables animals to secure prey more effectively and participate in other environmental interactions with greater ease.

It turns out that these are the school's laboratory hamsters that 400-pound Sherman accidentally released the night before. The problem having been contained, Sherman is given an update by his assistant, Jason (John Ales), about their latest project an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person to make weight-loss easy. It seems that their fattest hamster, Shelley, has lost 3 ounces, proving that the serum works. Jason suggests increasing the amount Shelley is fed, but the ever-kindly Sherman argues against it, saying it could be dangerous.He then has an unpleasant meeting with Dean Richmond (Larry Miller). The Dean tells him that the incident with the hamsters has cost the science department most of its funding. Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is the school's last remaining wealthy alumnus and is planning to award a 10 million grant to the college; Klump is warned not to alienate him as well.After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with the lovely Miss Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett), a chemistry graduate student teaching a class across the hall, who is a big fan of his work.

Translate to English English:","output":"The future of Serbia is clearly in the EU, and its cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia demonstrates that Belgrade is committed to European values, democracy, and human rights. In recent years, Serbia has been taking steps toward European integration and meeting the criteria for EU membership. One of the key prerequisites for Serbia's accession to the European Union has been its cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). This cooperation reflects the country's commitment to addressing the war crimes, atrocities, and human rights violations that occurred during the conflicts in the region in the 1990s. The ICTY was established by the United Nations Security Council in 1993, and its main task has been to prosecute individuals responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law during the armed conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. Over the years, the ICTY has indicted over 160 individuals, including high-ranking political and military figures. Serbia's cooperation with the ICTY has been crucial in bringing those responsible for war crimes to justice and fostering reconciliation in the Western Balkans. Belgrade's commitment to European values, democracy, and human rights can also be seen through its efforts to reform its legal and judicial system. As part of the EU accession process, Serbia has adopted a number of laws aimed at strengthening its judiciary, increasing transparency, and ensuring the rule of law. Additionally, the country has embarked on a comprehensive process of constitutional reforms to align its legal framework with EU standards and uphold human rights. Furthermore, Serbia has been active in promoting regional cooperation and dialogue with its neighbors, which is an essential element of the EU integration process. In recent years, Belgrade has signed several bilateral agreements with neighboring countries to resolve outstanding issues, enhance economic cooperation, and strengthen political ties. These efforts are important in fostering stability and prosperity in the region. Although progress has been made, Serbia still faces challenges on its path toward EU membership. For instance, the normalization of relations with Kosovo remains a crucial aspect of the accession process that must be addressed. Moreover, the EU expects Serbia to continue implementing necessary reforms in the areas of rule of law, fundamental rights, media freedom, and the fight against corruption. In conclusion, Serbia is clearly determined to become a member of the European Union. Its cooperation with the ICTY and other initiatives aimed at promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law demonstrate the country's commitment to European values. Moreover, Belgrade's efforts in regional cooperation and dialogue with its neighbors show its dedication to promoting peace and stability in the Western Balkans. As Serbia continues to address its remaining challenges and further strengthens its institutions, the country's future will become even more closely linked to the European Union."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Here's a question: The token was taken out of the folder due to being fraudulent, what was it taken from? Here are possible answers to this question: - ashtray - pocket - coin collection - slot machine - deposit box I believe the correct choice is \\"coin collection\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"\\"coin collection\\" The question implies that a token was removed from a certain location because it was found to be fraudulent. Considering the given options – ashtray, pocket, slot machine, deposit box, and coin collection – the most suitable and logical answer is \\"coin collection.\\" Here's a detailed explanation of each option: 1. Ashtray: An ashtray is a receptacle for cigarette and cigar ashes and also used for extinguishing cigarettes or cigars. It is not a place where tokens are typically stored or found. 2. Pocket: A pocket is a part of clothing, such as pants, jackets, or shirts, meant for carrying small items. While it is true that someone might carry a token in their pocket, it is unlikely that the token would be removed from a pocket exclusively due to being fraudulent. 3. Coin collection: A coin collection is a collection of coins or tokens, typically curated by a collector who values their rarity, condition, and historical significance. In this context, a fraudulent token would likely be removed to maintain the integrity and value of the collection. This makes \\"coin collection\\" the most appropriate answer. 4. Slot machine: A slot machine is a gambling device that operates by inserting coins, tokens, or paper currency. While a fraudulent token might initially be used in a slot machine, it does not make sense for it to be removed specifically from the slot machine in response to its fraudulent nature. Instead, the machine would reject the token, sending it back to the user or to a separate compartment. 5. Deposit box: A deposit box, such as a safety deposit box, is a secure box used to store valuable items, like jewelry, important documents, or cash. Although it might be possible for someone to store a token in a deposit box, it is unlikely that they would remove it specifically because it was fraudulent. A deposit box is more focused on providing security rather than determining the legitimacy of its contents. Therefore, among the given options, \\"coin collection\\" is the best answer, since it involves the curating and storage of tokens or coins and would have a direct reason to remove a fraudulent token."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a review about a place.

Let's analyze both sentences to understand their meanings and relationship to each other. Sentence 1: \\"What would you call civilization of the countries you know?\\" In this sentence, the speaker is asking for a definition or characterization of the term \\"civilization\\" in the context of the countries the listener is familiar with. This could be a request to describe common cultural, social, or political elements that define those countries as being \\"civilized.\\" This sentence leaves the definition of \\"civilization\\" open for interpretation, as the listener might have varying opinions or perspectives on what qualifies as a \\"civilized\\" society. Sentence 2: \\"They've become definitely more western in their thought processes.\\" This sentence describes a change in the thought processes of the countries mentioned in the first sentence. It suggests that these countries have adopted more Western (which usually refers to European or North American) ideas, values, and ways of thinking. This might imply that the speaker believes that there is a strong influence of Western thought on the countries in question. Now, let's examine the relationship between the two sentences: The first sentence is asking for a characterization or classification of civilization in certain countries, while the second sentence is a claim or observation that these countries have become more western in their thought processes. The second sentence does not follow directly from the first sentence, as it does not provide a definitive answer to the inquiry about what constitutes civilization. Instead, it presents a perspective on the potential influence of Western thought on these countries. In conclusion, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as they address different aspects of the countries mentioned. The first sentence asks for a definition or description of civilization, while the second sentence offers an observation about the impact of Western thought processes on those countries."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"A new york city taxi on a snow covered street.\\" that \\"The car is on the street.\\"?

Here's a brief explanation of the other options: - Demonstrate: A teacher may demonstrate concepts, techniques, or experiments during class, but this activity would not necessarily occur as frequently as \\"work in school.\\" - Eat lunch: Although teachers do eat lunch daily, this activity is less relevant to their professional responsibilities and occurs less frequently than general school work. - Time test: Administering and timing tests could be a part of a teacher's weekly responsibilities, but this activity won't happen as often as everyday school work. - School children: This phrase, which likely refers to teaching or tutoring children, could be considered a subset of a teacher's \\"work in school\\" rather than a separate, more frequent activity."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Alan Bean, mission, Apollo 12; Apollo 12, operator, NASA.

The fall color season usually runs from late september to mid-october. [substeps] Fall foliage is determined by a number of factors, including shorter days, colder nights and the amount of moisture in the ground. Choose your answer: based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Fall color is not dependant on rainfall.\\"? OPT: * Yes * It's impossible to say * No I think the answer is","output":"No, based on the paragraph, we cannot conclude that \\"Fall color is not dependant on rainfall.\\" In fact, it mentions that fall foliage is determined by a number of factors, including the amount of moisture in the ground. This implies that rainfall plays a role in the development of fall colors. Fall foliage is a spectacular natural phenomenon that occurs when the leaves of deciduous trees change colors before falling off during the autumn season. This event is influenced by a combination of factors such as sunlight, temperature, and moisture availability. Let's examine these factors more closely: 1. Shorter days: As the days become shorter during the fall season, the amount of sunlight received by the trees decreases. This reduction in sunlight triggers a change in the production of chlorophyll, the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis in leaves. With less chlorophyll being produced, the green color of the leaves starts to fade, allowing other pigments present in the leaves, like carotenes and anthocyanins, to become more visible. These pigments are responsible for the vibrant yellow, orange, and red hues seen in fall foliage. 2. Colder nights: As the temperature drops during autumn, especially at night, it influences the rate at which chlorophyll breaks down in the leaves. Lower temperatures cause the chlorophyll to break down more rapidly, which further contributes to the revealing of other pigments, intensifying the colors of fall foliage. 3. Moisture in the ground: Rainfall and soil moisture can have significant impacts on the quality and timing of fall foliage. Adequate moisture in the ground during the growing season helps ensure that trees are healthy and well-nourished. This, in turn, contributes to a better display of autumn colors. On the other hand, a dry summer season or a drought might lead to less vibrant or short-lived fall colors, as stressed trees may lose their leaves earlier or exhibit duller colors. To view fall foliage, it is essential to consider all these factors when choosing the location and timing of your trip. Some steps to take when planning to view fall foliage are: 1. Research the peak foliage times for your desired location: Since the timing of peak foliage can vary depending on the region you are visiting, consult regional foliage reports or contact local tourism offices to determine the best time to plan your trip. 2. Select a location that offers varied tree species: Different tree species exhibit distinct fall colors, so visiting an area with diverse tree species can result in a more spectacular display of foliage. 3. Scout for vantage points: Plan your trip to include locations offering panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, such as mountain overlooks or scenic drives, to fully appreciate the beauty of fall foliage. 4. Check weather forecasts: Although you cannot control the weather, it can be beneficial to monitor weather forecasts leading up to your visit. Ideal fall foliage viewing conditions usually include clear, sunny days with cool, crisp air. Rain and wind can cause leaves to fall more quickly, shortening the duration of the peak foliage season. Taking all these factors into account when planning your fall foliage trip will help ensure that you experience the beauty of autumn colors in all their glory."},{"instruction":"Cairn Boosts Indian Oil Reserves, Reports Lower Net (Update1) Cairn Energy Plc, the largest UK- based oil-exploration and production company, boosted its estimate of recoverable oil reserves at a field in India and reported a decline in first-half profit.

The district on Tuesday finished its investigation into whether soccer players made \\"inappropriate comments\\" to a Nazareth player, Northampton Area School District Superintendent Joseph Kovalchik said Tuesday evening. \\"The administration has conducted a thorough investigation throughout the entire day and appropriate discipline will be dispensed to any students who violated the code of conduct,\\" Kovalchik said. Due to student confidentially, Kovalchik would not state the actual form of discipline or how many students will face discipline. He would also not reveal the investigation's findings. The team's head coach, Craig Carvin, and assistant coach, Jason Melniszyn, submitted their resignations Tuesday evening, Kovalchik said. Neither could be reached for comment, and Kovalchik said he had no comment other than stating neither is a district teacher. Edward Bachert, custodian for the 16-year-old West African soccer player, said the teen told him he was peppered with Ebola comments at last Thursday's game at Nazareth. Other Nazareth players told Bachert their opponents directed racial remarks at the teen as well, said Bachert, who was at the game but out of earshot. The teen came to America with siblings about three years ago and is from a small town in Guinea, ground zero of the Ebola outbreak, Bachert said. Bachert's family took in the teen two years ago, but he constantly worries about the health of his parents, who still live in their home village. Distressed by the alleged Ebola remarks, the teen charged a Northampton player during the game's waning minutes and was ejected, Bachert said. He cried at the kitchen table when he got home. The end of the investigation brings closure to the incident, Bachert said. \\"I am glad Nazareth and Northampton took this incident very seriously and did a very thorough investigation,\\" Bachert said. \\"I think kids nowadays have to realize that their words can cause a lot of damage and you've got to think before you speak and be careful with what words you choose.\\" Bachert is comfortable not knowing for sure what discipline Northampton players could receive, he said. He also said he believes the Northampton coaches made the right decision in resigning. Nazareth conducted its own investigation of Thursday's game and turned its findings over to Northampton earlier Tuesday, Superintendent Dennis Riker said. He did not reveal the district's findings and could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. Neither district confirmed that their investigations were related to remarks about Ebola or race, but Kovalchik said Monday that Northampton doesn't tolerate any form of discrimination and the district would follow all policies and procedures if warranted. On Tuesday, he thanked Riker for Nazareth's cooperation. Incidents like the one that happened in Nazareth are usually handled on the local level by the schools themselves and not the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association, said Melissa Mertz, associate executive director of the PIAA. \\"I wouldn't say incidents like these are common, but they are almost always handled by the schools or by the district committee,\\" Mertz said, noting that no one had brought the Nazareth incident to her attention. \\"Often, the athletic director of one school will pick up the phone and call the athletic director of the other school. Sometimes, that's all it takes.\\" Nazareth students said after school Tuesday some kind of punishment is in order if the allegations against Northampton players are true. \\"And they should have to apologize,\\" sophomore Marissa Plows said. The Nazareth soccer team has rallied behind their teammate in response to the incident and players are using social media to promote selling 2 wristbands that say \\"#ENDRACISM.\\" The teen from West Africa was suspended for his team's regular-season finale Friday. He did not play in Nazareth's league playoff loss over the weekend because he was so distressed, Bachert said. Nazareth plays in the district tournament next week, and Bachert hopes the teen will play. \\"You don't realize how hurtful some of these things really are until you see it firsthand,\\" Bachert said. adam.clark@mcall.com 610-820-6168 ||||| A West African player on Nazareth Area High School's boys soccer team was taunted by Northampton players with chants of \\"Ebola!\\" during a game last week, according to his legal guardian. Edward Bachert, custodian for the 16-year-old soccer player, said the teen told him Ebola comments peppered last Thursday's game at Nazareth. Other Nazareth players told Bachert their opponents directed racial slurs at the teen as well, said Bachert, who was at the game but out of earshot. School officials in Nazareth and Northampton confirmed Monday they are investigating reports of inappropriate language used by Northampton players, but neither district would specify what the students allegedly said. \\"I don't know exactly what was said at this [game], and we don't have anything concrete that this was said,\\" said Joseph Kovalchik, superintendent of the Northampton Area School District. \\"Right now we need to really dig into this and investigate both sides.\\" Northampton doesn't tolerate any form of discrimination and the district will follow all policies and procedures if warranted, Kovalchik said. The allegations were not discussed Monday night at the Northampton school board meeting. \\"We are not at that point yet of knowing what actually did happen,\\" board President David Gogel said after the meeting. Bachert told the teen's story after he was contacted by The Morning Call, which received two letters from fans who attended the game and alleged Northampton players hurled racist remarks at a black player on Nazareth's team. One of the writers said Northampton players said they hoped he contracted Ebola. The teen came to America with siblings about three years ago and is from a small town in Guinea, ground zero of the Ebola outbreak, Bachert said. Bachert's family took the teen in two years ago, but he constantly worries about the health of his parents, who still live in their home village. Distressed by the alleged Ebola remarks, the teen charged a Northampton player during the game's waning minutes and was ejected, Bachert said. He cried at the kitchen table when he got home. \\"He was upset on the field, he was upset when I saw him after the game, he was upset when he came home,\\" Bachert said. Bachert did not hear any of the alleged comments from the stands but learned of them through the teen and his teammates. Several players vented after the game on Twitter. \\"I take pride in my soccer team. They are like my brothers. When racial slurs are being said we as a team take it very personally,\\" one Nazareth player tweeted. A fellow player tweeted: \\"Literally lost all my respect for that team and it's coaches, after being racist and getting a kid sent off you don't hi five your friend.\\" Bachert does not believe the Northampton players knew the teen had moved from Africa or that his parents still live there. But he thinks they need to be held accountable. \\"This doesn't belong in society,\\" he said. \\"It certainly doesn't belong in the field.\\" Nazareth Athletic Director Thomas Moll met with several players Friday morning to get as much information as possible about what happened, Moll said. School was closed Monday for Columbus Day and the investigation will continue Tuesday, he said. \\"I don't want to say anything at this point,\\" Moll said. \\"I want to meet with our principal and our superintendent to let them know what we found.\\" Northampton's schools were also closed Monday, hindering the district's ability to investigate, Kovalchik said. The probe will continue Tuesday, he said. The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association could not immediately be reached for comment. Nazareth was forced to play a player down after the teen was ejected, and the Blue Eagles then gave up the game-winning goal in a 2-1 loss. The team still qualified for the postseason. Northampton's season is over, but the district must now manage another allegation of racism. A borough resident launched an online petition last September seeking to have the school's Konkrete Kids nickname changed because he believed the three Ks are a nod to the Ku Klux Klan. The district defended the name, saying it is rooted in its ties to the cement industry, since the spelling was gleaned from the German spelling of the word concrete. adam.clark@mcall.com 610-820-6168 ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a brief explanation of the main points or important information in a text or story.

Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"bushes.\\" The correct answer to the question \\"what build cells?\\" is \\"molecules.\\" Cells, as the basic structural and functional units of life, are formed by various complex molecules that come together to create the necessary components for cell function and survival. These molecules can be categorized into four main types: nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Each molecule plays a specific role in the formation and function of cells. 1. Nucleic Acids: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) are the genetic materials of cells. DNA stores the genetic information required for constructing all the proteins in a cell, while RNA acts as the intermediary between DNA and the proteins. These molecules play a crucial role in transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next and orchestrating the synthesis of proteins. 2. Proteins: These are large, complex molecules consisting of amino acids and are responsible for a diverse range of functions in cells. Proteins act as enzymes, hormones, receptors, transporters, and structural components that facilitate various cellular functions, including metabolism, cell signaling, and maintaining cell shape and integrity. 3. Lipids: These are small, hydrophobic molecules that play a key role in forming cell membranes. The cell membrane is a lipid bilayer that separates the cell's interior from the external environment, protecting it from harmful substances and maintaining a stable internal environment. Lipids also serve as sources of stored energy, signaling molecules, and important components of certain cellular structures, such as the nuclear envelope. 4. Carbohydrates: These molecules are primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, and serve various functions within cells. Carbohydrates provide cells with a source of energy, contribute to the structural integrity of cells through the formation of the cell wall, and play a critical role in cell-to-cell recognition and signaling. In summary, cells are built from various complex molecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. These molecules work together to create the structures and perform the functions necessary to maintain viability and enable cells to participate in the complex interplay that constitutes life. \\"Bushes\\" is an incorrect answer, as it does not accurately represent the components that are responsible for constructing cells."},{"instruction":"- years active is 2006 -- present - team is blackzilians - birth date is 6 march 1984 - mma koloss is 1 - weight lb is 205 - fighting out of is boca raton , florida - sherdog is 17662 - other names is rumble , aj - stance is orthodox - height is 6 2 - mma decwin is 6 - university is lassen college - school is west laurens high school - birth place is dublin , georgia , u.s. - mma kowin is 13 - updated is january 8 , 2015 - nationality is american - weight class is heavyweight -lrb- 2013 -rrb- - mma subloss is 4 - rank is njcaa wrestling Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.","output":"This information is about Anthony \\"Rumble\\" Johnson, an American mixed martial artist currently competing in the heavyweight division.

A vintage motorcycle: A vintage motorcycle typically runs on gasoline, as alternative fuel technologies were not widely available when these motorcycles were manufactured. The design and engineering of vintage motorcycles are mainly geared towards the utilization of gasoline as their primary fuel source, and thus they are unlikely to use an alternative fuel without undergoing extensive modifications. b. An older car: Similar to vintage motorcycles, older cars were primarily designed to run on gasoline. The required technology and widespread adaptation of alternative fuels were lacking when these older cars were produced. While it is possible to convert an older car to run on alternative fuels like biodiesel or ethanol, the majority of older cars still run on gasoline. Consequently, older cars are less likely to use an alternative fuel. c. An 1800's train: Most trains from the 1800s were steam-powered, which primarily relied on coal or wood for fuel. While coal and wood are not gasoline, they are not considered alternative fuels according to modern standards. Alternative fuels usually refer to cleaner and renewable energy sources like electricity, hydrogen, or biofuels which were not in use for trains during the 1800s. Therefore, an 1800s train does not use an alternative fuel as defined today. d. A modern bus: Modern buses are more likely to make use of alternative fuels compared to the other options listed above. As the world moves toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, there has been a considerable push for public transportation systems to adopt alternative fuels. Modern buses are often powered by electricity, natural gas, biodiesel, or hydrogen fuel cells. Depending on location and regulations, some cities have even mandated the use of alternative fuels for public transportation to decrease emissions and reduce environmental impact. Based on the analysis provided for each option, the most suitable answer to the question, \\"Which of the following likely uses an alternative fuel?\\" would be: d. A modern bus Modern buses have a higher likelihood of using alternative fuels due to increased awareness about environmental sustainability and technological advancement. They represent a shift away from dependency on gasoline, and many public transportation systems specifically promote the use of buses that operate on clean and renewable energy sources."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Arabic.

Options: (A) 11 (B) 16 (C) 188 (D) 199 (E) 12 Let's give some random thoughts before answering.","output":"To answer this question, we need to calculate the time it takes for the 280m long train traveling at a speed of 63 km/hr to pass a tree completely. Let's break down the process step by step: Step 1: Convert the train's speed to meters per second. 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, 63 km/hr = (63 * 1000) meters / 3600 seconds = (63 * 5/18) meters per second = 17.5 meters per second Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the tree. To pass the tree, the train must travel a distance equal to its length, which is 280 meters. We have calculated the train's speed in meters per second - 17.5 meters per second Time = Distance / Speed Time = 280 meters / 17.5 meters per second = 16 seconds So, the train will pass the tree in 16 seconds (Option B)."},{"instruction":"Upon exposure, the amount of light energy that reaches the film determines the effect upon the emulsion. If the brightness of the light is multiplied by a factor and the exposure of the film decreased by the same factor by varying the camera's shutter speed and aperture, so that the energy received is the same, the film will be developed to the same density. This rule is called reciprocity. The systems for determining the sensitivity for an emulsion are possible because reciprocity holds. In practice, reciprocity works reasonably well for normal photographic films for the range of exposures between 1/1000 second to 1/2 second. However, this relationship breaks down outside these limits, a phenomenon known as reciprocity failure. How is the brightness of a light changed? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The brightness of a light can be changed by adjusting several factors. These factors include the intensity of the light source, the distance between the light source and the subject, the properties of the medium through which the light is traveling, and the use of modifying tools. 1. Intensity of the light source: The brightness of a light can be changed by increasing or decreasing the power of the light source, such as adjusting the voltage of a light bulb or the settings on a flash unit. 2. Distance between the light source and the subject: The brightness of light perceived by the subject (or a camera's sensor) depends on the distance to the light source. According to the inverse square law, the intensity of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the subject and the source. Thus, if you move a light source closer to the subject, the light will be much brighter; if you move it further away, the brightness will decrease. 3. Properties of the medium: The brightness of light is also affected by the medium through which it travels. For example, light will be reduced in intensity when passing through a foggy atmosphere or a tinted window. Changing the medium or its properties, such as using a clear or colored filter in front of the light source, can control the brightness of the light. 4. Light-modifying tools: Another way to change the brightness of light is by using tools and accessories designed specifically for this purpose, such as diffusers and reflectors. A diffuser scatters light, making it less focused and less intense, while a reflector helps to direct or bounce light in a specific direction, increasing the brightness in the desired area. By altering these factors either individually or in combination, the brightness can be adjusted to achieve the desired effect in photography or other applications. Reciprocity in photography relies on an understanding of these variables and their influence in order to maintain consistent film exposure regardless of changes in brightness."},{"instruction":"Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

The style of their early work, including their debut album Count Your Blessings, has been described primarily as deathcore, but they started to adopt a more eclectic style of metalcore on later albums. Among Bring Me the Horizon's earliest influences were bands like At the Gates, Carcass, Pantera, Metallica, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Every Time I Die, Norma Jean, Skycamefalling and Poison the Well; and genres death metal, grindcore, and emo have been cited by AllMusic writer Steward Mason. However, as their sound developed, the band started to take influences from progressive rock, post-rock, dubstep and electronica. The band's musical style has been described mainly as metalcore and - though they have since moved on from the genre - their early material was considered deathcore. Across their career the band has also been said to play within the genres post-hardcore, hardcore punk, technical metal, heavy metal, and emo. Bring Me the Horizon have attempted to grow and change with each album, believing they should be different. Raziq Rauf, writing for Drowned In Sound, described Count Your Blessings as possessing \\"Norma Jean-style thunderous riffs mixed with some dastardly sludgy doom moments and more breakdowns than your dad's old Nissan Sunny.\\" Metal Hammer described Suicide Season as a \\"creative, critical and commercial success\\" for the band as they started to adopt a more eclectic style, with its \\"crushingly heavy party deathcore\\". Leading up to its release Oliver Sykes described it as \\"100% different to Count Your Blessings\\" and noted the album sounds \\"more rock than metal\\". As time went by, Bring Me the Horizon began rejecting their debut album Count Your Blessings and considered Suicide Season as their \\"Year Zero[...] [their] wipe-the-slate-clean time\\". Bring Me the Horizon then moved even further away from deathcore with their third album There Is a Hell, which incorporated electronica, classical music and pop music into their metalcore style. This required more ambitious production feats, such as using a full choir, a synthesised orchestra and glitched out vocals and breakdowns that were also toned down, favouring quiet atmospheric passages in song breaks. For the writing of Sempiternal, the band pooled far broader influences such as post-rock acts like This Will Destroy You and Explosions In The Sky and from pop music. Bring Me the Horizon has experimented with its music in recent years, mixing pop with metal music, leading the band to be labeled a \\"pop metal\\" act. With the release of That's the Spirit, their sound shifted towards alternative metal and alternative rock, also incorporated other genres such as pop rock and nu metal, while completely abandoning the metalcore sound of their earlier albums. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How do they imitate these style makers?","output":"Bring Me the Horizon imitates the style makers by incorporating various influences and elements from different genres and bands into their music. For instance, their early material was influenced by bands like At the Gates, Carcass, and Pantera, while later albums saw them adopting sounds from progressive rock, post-rock, dubstep, and electronica. This can be seen in how they incorporated electronica, classical music, and pop music into their metalcore style on their third album, There Is a Hell. Moreover, they experimented with more ambitious production techniques, such as using a full choir, a synthesized orchestra, and glitched-out vocals for a more diverse sound. Furthermore, Bring Me the Horizon has drawn inspiration from post-rock acts like This Will Destroy You and Explosions In The Sky, as well as pop music to create a unique blend of genres. This experimentation led to a shift in their sound towards alternative metal and alternative rock while embracing elements of pop rock and nu metal, resulting in their label as a \\"pop metal\\" act."},{"instruction":"Pick from: (i). builds a fire with the various sized sticks in the fire ring and lights it.

Passage 2:India's present syncretic culture is reflected in the fused Hindu-muslim spiritual connotations, forms, symbols, aesthetics, crafts and weaves, for example Kashmiri muslim carpet makers feature Durga in their patterns, muslim sculptors making idols of Durga, and Hindu craftsmen create the Muharram tazia. This religious syncretism is a fusion of Hindu cultural elements with Muslim religious elements. It is based on the vasudhaiva kutumbakam, unity in diversity, multi-communitarianism and ganga-jamuni tehzeeb, It is born out of centuries of interfaith exchange and accommodation among Indian origin religions (Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Sikh) and foreign origin religions (Muslim and Christian) where communities preserve own cultural and religious identities while facilitating the shared celebration of festivals, customs and traditions. In this syncretic culture, the shared Indian national identity is separated from the personal religious identity, and the nation and common social good comes first above the personal religion. Despite the partition of India, and resulting creation of Pakistan based on the concept of separate islamic nation for domination of muslims, this composite multiculturalism is integral to the present society of India. India is officially a secular nation, a concept legalised in the constitution of India. Contrastingly, constitution of Pakistan has Islam as its state religion, teaching of quran and islamiyat is compulsary,Constitution of Pakistan: Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 – Article: 31 Islamic way of life, Article 31 No. 2, 1973, Retrieved 22 August 2018. only muslims can become Prime Minister or President of Pakistan and nonmuslims are not given equal rights, Ahmadia muslims having equal constitutional rights in India are legally persecuted in Pakistan and constitutionally banned from calling themselves Muslims.

Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700 there was no policeman in London at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night, and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago, London started to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people had to stay in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called \\"Bow Street Runners\\" because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. There was no policewoman in London until 1920. Today, London police are quite well paid and only a few police officers still ride horses. Perhaps the London Police Force's greatest achievement is to meet changing conditions and provide excellent police service .

Answer:","output":"If Milo calms down and his heart starts pumping less blood with each stroke, his heart rate would likely increase in order to maintain the same volume of blood flow throughout his body. According to the given paragraph, when the heart expels more blood with each stroke, it has to beat less frequently to maintain the same blood flow. Therefore, if the heart starts pumping less blood with each stroke, it would need to compensate by increasing the frequency of its beats. This would result in an increased heart rate.

Regrettably, the experience turned out to be far from what I was expecting. The substandard service, lack of cleanliness, and less-than-stellar food quality made it evident that Sunshine Restaurant is not deserving of its rave reviews. Allow me to thoroughly explain the various factors that contributed to this negative experience. Upon arrival, it took a considerable amount of time to be greeted by the hostess. She seemed overwhelmed and disorganized, failing to maintain eye contact or provide a welcoming demeanor. With no reservation policy, it was increasingly frustrating for the handful of patrons waiting over 20 minutes to be seated, despite an array of empty tables that simply awaited cleaning. Once seated, the poor service continued. Our server appeared uninterested as she mumbled the specials of the day and failed to inform us that the restaurant was out of various items on the menu. Drink and appetizer orders were taken, only for us to find out 15 minutes later that the kitchen was out of the appetizer we had ordered. The overall cleanliness of the restaurant left much to be desired, with dusty corners in plain sight, crumbs on the seats and table, and a musty odor emitting from the nearby restroom. Hygiene and cleanliness should be a priority, especially in the wake of a pandemic. Additionally, the silverware had smudges on the surface, causing us to question whether they had been adequately cleaned. Now, regarding the food – this was perhaps the most disappointing part of the experience. The dishes were mediocre at best, severely lacking in flavor and presentation. It was evident that much of our meal had been pre-prepared, leaving it dry and unappetizing. My steak was overcooked and tough, making it difficult to enjoy, and the accompanying vegetables were limp and flavorless – seemingly overboiled. My companion's pasta dish had a watery sauce, which drowned the noodles and left it tasting more like canned soup than a restaurant-quality meal. The prices were exorbitant, particularly when considering the subpar food quality and overall experience. To top off the evening, it took a painstakingly long time to receive our check. After asking the server three times and waiting for almost 30 additional minutes, we finally received the inaccurate bill, which had charged us for the out-of-stock appetizer that never arrived. Coupled with this, the server made no attempt to apologize for the error or the inconvenience it had caused. In conclusion, I would strongly advise against going out of your way to visit Sunshine Restaurant. The combination of substandard service, lack of cleanliness, and disappointing food leaves me with no choice but to encourage others to seek out alternative dining options. It is genuinely disheartening to have expected a pleasant evening and to be left with such a negative experience. I hope that Sunshine Restaurant takes this feedback to heart and works towards improving its offering, as the word-of-mouth popularity may not last long if other patrons also have similar encounters."},{"instruction":"Is the word \\"call\\" used in the same way in the following two sentences?

Royce said that \\"by shutting down North Korea's illicit activities, we deprive the Kim regime of the money he needs to pay his generals and to conduct nuclear weapons research.\\" Royce also argued that \\"North Korea is undoubtedly one of the most significant security threats that we here face and our allies face.\\" On June 27, 2013, Royce introduced the Electrify Africa Act of 2013 (H.R. 2548; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the President to establish a multiyear strategy to assist countries in sub-Saharan Africa develop an appropriate mix of power solutions to provide sufficient electricity access to people living in rural and urban areas in order to alleviate poverty and drive economic growth. On November 13, 2013, Royce introduced the Taiwan Relations Act Affirmation and Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2014 (H.R. 3470; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would allow the sale of several Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates to Mexico, Thailand, and Taiwan. Four naval vessels would be sold to Taiwan for about 10 million each. Mexico and Thailand would each receive two vessels as a grant. Royce argued in favor of the bill saying that \\"these ships would bolster Taiwan's defense.\\" Royce also said that \\"these transfers help support the priorities of the U.S. Navy while strengthening the capability of allies and our close partners to meet our share maritime security objectives.\\" Question: Was most of his involement over seas? Answer:","output":"Yes, a lot of his involvement was related to other countries. As the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr. Royce worked on things that had to do with countries outside the United States. Some examples are the increased sanctions on North Korea, helping Africa with electricity, and selling ships to Taiwan, Mexico, and Thailand."},{"instruction":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

Step 1: I noticed that the sentence consists of two main ideas - Noah warned the unheeding world for 100 years, and this action occurred from age 500 until he was 600 years old. To emphasize these two separate ideas, I placed a comma after \\"100 years\\". Step 2: Within the second main idea, I observed an additional layer of information - the specific age range during which Noah warned the world. To set apart this information from the rest of the sentence, I decided to place a comma after \\"unheeding world\\" and before \\"from age 500.\\" This separates the specific time frame from the main idea and makes the sentence easier to read and understand."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Sure!

It joins mischievous peacocks, a violent swan nicknamed Asbo and fugitive felines among the annals of England's animals \\"gone bad\\". Here are some more that made the headlines. A peacock called Kevin was accused of \\"making mischief\\" in Breadsall, Derbyshire, in June 2013. His antics included trapping someone in the village's memorial hall. \\"The person was trying to leave and Kevin wouldn't let them out,\\" said resident Marilyn Balsom. The villagers tried and failed to find the owners after Kevin turned up out of nowhere. Two years later, Kevin is still causing trouble in Breadsall, although some villagers have come to love the feathered celebrity. The Bishops Court Estate in Clyst St Mary, Devon, has also had problems with peacocks, which have been attacking cars by scratching and pecking at the paintwork. The \\"jealous\\" peacocks are thought to be mistaking their reflections for rival birds. A hungry badger was caught on camera when it sneaked into a house to help itself to a Bakewell tart in Midhurst, West Sussex. The badger realised it had an audience then made a sharp exit through the kitchen catflap. But he was not deterred from coming back on subsequent nights, forcing the resident to lock his catflap. Back in 2003, a rogue badger attacked five people during a 48-hour rampage in Evesham, Worcestershire. One man required two skin graft operations, and other victims included a man who was attacked as he walked home from a pub. Oscar the cat gained a reputation after a series of clashes with cats and dogs in the Buckinghamshire village of Wingrave. His fame then spread when a local newspaper reported the pet had disappeared after being \\"under curfew\\" for scratching and biting a neighbour. He was found 34 miles away in Northampton about three weeks later, kept indoors to restore village harmony and given a herbal remedy to calm him down. A cockerel called William was served with a noise abatement notice last year - or rather, his owners were - because he was crowing too loudly in Eyam, Derbyshire. Owner Phillip Sutcliffe said: \\"Apparently he crows too loud in the morning - he joins the dawn chorus with all the other birds in the area and one person has complained.\\" Mr Sutcliffe had tried to advertise William for sale and said he might have to kill him if there were no takers. William's fate is unknown. A mischievous grey squirrel jumped into a woman's handbag at a pub in Chester and refused to leave - prompting her to call police. Det Con Nigel Thake, who attended and managed to send the persistent animal on its way, was dubbed \\"Dr Doolittle\\" on the police's Twitter account. A \\"terrorist\\" pheasant attacked vehicles and chased cats and dogs at Wood Farm in Hail Weston, Cambridgeshire. One delivery driver was trapped for 20 minutes after the bird blocked his way, flew at the bonnet then chased his van. The British Trust for Ornithology said the pheasant was protecting his territory but was \\"a little extreme\\". He later turned up with a hen pheasant and was \\"tamed by love\\". Another pheasant, named Phil, started attacking members of a Shropshire family, forcing one of them to carry a badminton racket for self-defence. Resolute vegan and animal lover Sally-Ann Hudson started feeding the bird in a failed bid to befriend him. \\"He'll just have a go at me then, he'll launch at me, peck my feet or attach himself to my arm and just try to attack me,\\" she said. Another pheasant started attacking people in the North Yorkshire village of Newsham, with other targets including dogs, prams and cars. The animal has also chased children from their school bus, and one villager said she was scared to go out. A postman, who said he was frightened of the bird, described it as \\"a crackpot\\". Theo the cat was responsible for a mini crime spree in Ipswich when he kept stealing items from neighbours' homes, including a phone charger, hand puppet, pen and a child's artwork. His owners kept finding things around the home that did not belong to them, and had to post photos on Facebook to track down the owners. Theo then started bringing home Christmas decorations pilfered from neighbours' trees. The antics of a cat in Luton, called Dennis, have been well-documented on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. His owner said Dennis prefers to steal underwear but usually brought home gifts of Christmas wrapping paper - minus the contents - after the big day. Another cat, Naughty Norris, prowled the Bedminster area, bringing home everything from sports bras and boxer shorts to dishcloths and sausages. His embarrassed owner, Richard Windsor, wrote an apologetic note to neighbours explaining Norris's behaviour, and inviting them to reclaim their missing items. A crow repeatedly attacked a mirror sculpture at the University of Leicester, thinking its reflection was another bird. Scratches began appearing on the sculpture within a day of an exhibition starting, while sixteen other sculptures in the exhibition remained unscathed. Almuth Tebbenhoff, the exhibition's curator, said: \\"As its fury escalated it saw its reflection and became more and more aggressive. \\"Isn't this how wars start?\\" An aggressive swan named Asbo was moved from the River Cam in Cambridge after his aggressive behaviour began to escalate. In one of many reported attacks on rowers, the swan mounted a scull and capsized the boat. Dr Philippa Noon, one of the Conservators of the River Cam, said he had started going for bigger boats and they were concerned his legs could be cut off by a motor. \\"We are sad to see him go, because he had become a bit of a river character,\\" she said. Pianist Paul Lewis was forced to pull out of concert after a swooping seagull caused him to injure himself. He was leaving rehearsals with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra when he was startled, causing him to fall and sprain a finger. In Bristol, the opening date of a Wahaca restaurant has been pushed back because seagulls have been pecking and defecating on builders. Work was forced to stop because of the seagulls, which are thought to be protecting their young. There have been numerous other reports of seagulls attacking people, with one attack in Folkestone described as like something out of a Hitchcock film. In Cornwall, postal deliveries were suspended to a road after a delivery woman was attacked by gulls. One man in Hull said he had been repeatedly targeted by a flock while walking on a cycle path and said they were the most frightening experiences of his life. He described being followed for about a mile down the road in one incident, and flapping his arms to deter them another time. Dr Viola Ross-Smith, from the British Trust for Ornithology, said the birds were a protected species defending their nests. She said gull numbers were increasing in cities due to easy access to food and a lack of predators. A petition was set up calling for action in Roundway, Wiltshire, where seagulls were said to be attacking people, leaving mess and keeping residents awake. What is a summary of this text?","output":"This is a story about some animals in England that have been causing trouble for people. There was a fox that followed eight people for three hours, and a man had to fight it off with his bicycle. There were also naughty peacocks, an aggressive swan named Asbo, and some cats and birds that liked to steal things. Some of the animals were just being protective of their homes or families, but their actions made life hard for people nearby. It shows that sometimes, animals can act strangely or cause problems for humans."},{"instruction":"Q:Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her...

Q: What is the photosynthesis factory of the plant? Choices: - pistil - stamen - genome - chloroplast A: A:","output":"The photosynthesis factory of the plant is the chloroplast. Among the given choices - pistil, stamen, genome, and chloroplast - it is the chloroplast that plays the crucial role in the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms, like algae and cyanobacteria, convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose or other sugars. This process is essential for these organisms' growth, development, and reproduction. Photosynthesis also plays a significant role in the global carbon cycle, as it absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide and releases oxygen as a byproduct. The chloroplast, an organelle found in the cells of plants and algae, contains vital components for photosynthesis to occur, primarily the green pigment chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is responsible for the green color of plants and is particularly effective at absorbing light energy from the sun. It is through chlorophyll that light energy is captured and converted into chemical energy stored in the form of glucose. Within the chloroplast, photosynthesis occurs in two stages. The first stage is the light-dependent stage, where the absorbed light energy is used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), the energy carriers that fuel various cellular reactions. The second stage, known as the Calvin Cycle or light-independent stage, takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast. During this stage, ATP and NADPH are used to convert inorganic carbon dioxide into glucose through a series of chemical reactions. The other choices provided - pistil, stamen, and genome - are not involved in photosynthesis in the same way as chloroplasts. The pistil and stamen are the female and male reproductive organs of flowers, respectively, and do not play a direct role in photosynthesis. The genome refers to the complete set of genetic information of an organism, including the DNA or RNA sequences, and although it contains the genes responsible for the chloroplast functioning, it is not the physical site where photosynthesis occurs. In conclusion, the chloroplast is the photosynthesis factory of the plant, as it is the organelle where the essential process of converting light energy into chemical energy takes place. This vital function enables plants and other photosynthetic organisms to grow, reproduce, and contribute significantly to the planet's atmospheric balance and carbon cycle."},{"instruction":"to have taken of the tree of life was merely symbolic of receiving the gift of god’s holy spirit, the very love of god ( rom. 5:5 ) which fulfills this spiritual law ( rom. 13:10 ) and which god gives only to those who obey his law ( acts 5:32 ).

Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is commanding his final mission. During a spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, Mission Control in Houston warns the team about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of debris in space. Mission Control orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re-entry immediately because the debris is speeding towards the shuttle. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter. High-speed debris from the Russian satellite strikes the Explorer and Hubble, detaching Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), recovers Stone and they return to the Explorer. They discover that it has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew is dead. They decide to use the MMU to reach the International Space Station (ISS), which is in orbit about 1,450Â km (900Â mi) away. Kowalski estimates they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again. En route to the ISS, the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the substantially damaged but still operational ISS, they see that its crew has evacuated in one of its two Soyuz modules.

The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. and the situation: Peter visited two mountain ranges last summer. The Ozarks in Missouri, and the more massive and younger Colorado Rockies. He loved both ranges, but liked the caves systems and blue holes in the Ozarks a bit more. Answer the following question: Which mountains have a larger percent of sedimentary rock? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Ozark Mountains have a larger percent of sedimentary rocks. The Ozark Mountains, located in Missouri, have a geological composition primarily characterized by sedimentary rocks, which include dolomite and limestone. The presence of limestone in the Ozarks is a key contributor to the formation of the cave systems and blue holes that Peter found appealing during his visit. Karst landscapes, featuring caves and blue holes, are formed over time as water erodes limestone and other soluble rocks, creating these unique underground features. Limestone makes up a significant portion of the sedimentary rock in the Ozarks, and its solubility in water and weak acid solutions allows for the development of numerous cave systems. This is a major reason why Peter observed more caves and blue holes in the Ozarks compared to the Colorado Rockies. On the other hand, the Colorado Rockies, a more massive and younger mountain range, have a more complex geological makeup. They consist of different rock types, including metamorphic, igneous, and sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, shale, and limestone. However, the percentage of sedimentary rocks, specifically limestone, is relatively less compared to the Ozarks. This results in fewer karst features and cave systems in the Colorado Rockies compared to the Ozark Mountains. In conclusion, the Ozark Mountains have a larger percent of sedimentary rocks, particularly limestone, which has enabled the formation of a diverse range of karst landscapes such as caves systems and blue holes. In contrast, the geological composition of the Colorado Rockies, comprising a mix of metamorphic, igneous, and sedimentary rocks, does not facilitate as extensive cave formations and karst features. Therefore, this is why Peter found the Ozarks more favorable in terms of cave systems and blue holes compared to the Colorado Rockies."},{"instruction":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of King Krishnadevaraya court jester? The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam.

How do you tackle those teachers who think they are always right and you are always wrong? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"To address the first question about why some of the top teachers are resigning from PES University, I will need to gather some data. Here is my step-by-step approach: Step 1: Research the circumstances I would start by conducting an online search for any news articles, forums, or discussions mentioning the resignations of top teachers from PES University. This will give me an overview of the situation and help me understand any publicly available reasons behind the resignations. Step 2: Analyze turnover rates I will compare the turnover rates of PES University with other similar universities to determine if the issue is specific to PES or common in the higher education sector. This will provide context to understand the scale and urgency of the issue. Step 3: Gather feedback If available, I will look for feedback from the resigning teachers themselves, either from public sources or private communication with the university. This will provide firsthand insight into the reasons behind their decision. Step 4: Identify common issues From the information gathered in steps 1 through 3, I will identify any recurring concerns or problems that might have led to the resignations. This will help pinpoint areas in need of improvement for PES University. For the second question about how to tackle teachers who think they are always right, and you are always wrong, I will provide a step-by-step approach as well: Step 1: Maintain respectful communication Always approach the situation respectfully and professionally, as insulting or attacking the teacher will only escalate the conflict and make it harder to resolve the issue. Step 2: Gather evidence Collect as much evidence as you can when disagreeing with the teacher, including relevant sources and examples. This evidence will be useful when presenting your perspective to the teacher. Step 3: Seek a meeting Request a meeting with the teacher to discuss your concerns and evidence. Present your perspective calmly and rationally, emphasizing the evidence that supports your viewpoint. Step 4: Offer alternative solutions Propose alternative solutions or compromises to address the disagreement. This will show that you are open to collaboration and finding a resolution that benefits both parties. Step 5: Involve a third party if necessary If the issues persist and cannot be resolved individually, consider involving a supervisor, department head, or other authority figure to mediate the conflict. Regarding the final question, I would say that these questions are not the same: 1. The first question is specific to the resignations of top teachers from PES University and identifying the possible reasons behind this issue. 2. The second question is about dealing with teachers who may have an unyielding attitude and resist accepting feedback or alternative perspectives. While they both concern the relationship between teachers and their environment or students, they address different issues in different contexts."},{"instruction":"Q:Become a volunteer and help those who need your help in your community !

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...","output":"Saint-Saëns"},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed.

Question 2: How do I know whether someone read my message on Instagram or not? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, both Question 1 and Question 2 are asking the same thing. They are essentially inquiring about how to find out if someone has viewed or read a direct message (DM) sent by the user on Instagram. I will provide a detailed answer to this question below. Instagram, one of the most widely used social media platforms, allows users to send direct messages to others for private conversations. Users often want to know whether or not their messages have been read by the recipient. Instagram has a feature allowing users to determine whether their messages have been seen or not by the person they sent the message to. This feature is known as \\"Seen\\" or the \\"Read Receipt.\\" Follow these steps below to know if someone has read your direct message on Instagram: 1. Open the Instagram app on your device and log in to your account if you haven't already. 2. Tap on the paper plane icon (direct messages) located on the top right corner of the screen. This will open your direct messages inbox. 3. Locate the conversation where you sent the message you want to check. If you have multiple conversations, scroll through the list to find the relevant one. 4. Tap on the conversation to open it. 5. After opening the conversation, look for the message you want to check. If the recipient has read the message, there will be a \\"Seen\\" label displayed below the message, indicating that the recipient has viewed the message. Additionally, a tiny version of the recipient's profile picture may appear below your message as another indication that they have read the message. 6. If you do not see the \\"Seen\\" label or the recipient's profile picture below your message, this means that the message has not been read yet. In this case, the recipient might have not seen your message, or they could have turned off the Read Receipts feature, preventing you from seeing the \\"Seen\\" label. Keep in mind that the \\"Seen\\" label is not an absolute guarantee that the person has genuinely read and understood your message. It simply means that the message has been opened or viewed on their screen. Additionally, with Instagram's recent merging with Facebook Messenger, some users may see \\"Delivered\\" status, which implies that the message has been successfully delivered to the recipient, but has not been read yet. It is important to note that users can disable the Read Receipts feature in their messages by turning on the \\"Vanish Mode\\" or by using third-party apps that disable this feature. In such cases, you may not be able to see whether your message has been read or not."},{"instruction":"Q:Article: Doctors say obesity,also known as severe overweight,is a complex condition.A doctor may advise medical interventions in addition to changes in behavior.But experts say the more successful weightloss plans include a wellbalanced diet and exercise. People who want to avoid weight gain have to balance the number of calories they eat with the number of calories they use.To lose weight,you can reduce the number of calories you take in,or increase the number you use,or both.Experts at the National Institutes of Health say to lose weight,a person should do some moderate or intensive physical exercise most days of the week.This could include fast walking,sports or strength training. A recent study looked at four of the most popular dieting plans in the United States.Researchers at Stanford University studied more than three hundred overweight women,mostly in their thirties or forties.Each woman went on one of the four plans:Atkins,The Zone,Ornish or LEARN.The women attended diet classes and received written information about the food plans.At the end of a year,the women on the Atkins diet had lost the most,more than four and a half kilograms on average. Christopher Gardner led the study,reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He said the Atkins diet may be more successful because of its simple message to lower the intake of sugar.Also,he said the advice to increase protein in the diet leads to more satisfying meals.

Chartwell is a country house near the town of Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy.

You say \\"I wish I could help you, but I am short of money myself.\\" In fact , you are not short of money but your friend is in the habit of not paying his debts and you don't want to hurt his feelings by reminding him of this. Is this really a lie ? Professor Jerald Jellison of the University of southern California has made a scientific study of lying. According to him, women are better liars than men, particularly when telling a \\"white lie\\", such as when a woman at a party tells another woman that she likes her dress when she really thinks it's terrible. However, this is only one side of the story. Other researchers say that men are more likely to tell more serious lies, such as making a promise that they have no intention of carrying out. This is the kind of lie politicians and businessmen are supposed to be particularly skilled at :the lie from which the liar hopes to profit or gain in some way. Research has been done into the way people's behavior changes in a number of small, unimportant ways when they lie. It has been found that if they are sitting down at the time, they tend to move about in their chairs more than usual. To the trained observer they are saying \\"I wish I were somewhere else now\\". They also tend to touch certain parts of the face, particularly the nose. One explanation of this may be that lying causes a slight increase in blood pressure. The tip of the nose is very sensitive to changes and the increased pressure makes it itch. Another gesture that gives liars away is what the writer Decmond Morris in his bookMan Watching calls the \\"mouth cover\\". He says that there are several typical forms of this ,such as covering part of the mouth with the fingers, touching the upper lip or putting a finger of the hand at one side off the mouth.

Seven years later, Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good?, warning about the coming economic downturn. His estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf), a top proprietary trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jacob is a protÃ©gÃ© of managing director Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), and is trying to raise money for a fusion research project which would create massive amounts of clean energy for the world. Jake is also financially assisting his mother (Susan Sarandon), who has begun a new career selling real estate. When the recession of 2008 hits, Keller Zabel's stock loses more than 50% of its value. Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James (Josh Brolin), head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz, which Louis Zabel had refused to bail out eight years earlier.

(Associated Press) Children look out from a school bus as they are transported to their parents after a shooting at an Price Middle school in Atlanta Thursday, Jan. 31, 2013. A 14-year-old boy was wounded outside the school... (Associated Press) Multiple shots were fired in the courtyard of Price Middle School just south of downtown around 1:50 p.m. and the one boy was hit, Atlanta Police Chief George Turner said. In the aftermath, a teacher received minor cuts, he said. The wounded boy was taken \\"alert, conscious and breathing\\" to Grady Memorial Hospital, said police spokesman Carlos Campos. He was expected to be released Thursday night. Police swarmed the school of about 400 students after reports of the shooting while a crowd of anxious parents gathered in the streets, awaiting word on their children. Students were kept at the locked-down school for more than two hours before being dismissed. Investigators believe the shooting was not random and that something occurred between the two students that may have led to it. Schools Superintendent Erroll Davis said the school does have metal detectors. \\"The obvious question is how did this get past a metal detector?\\" Davis asked about the gun. \\"That's something we do not know yet.\\" The armed resource officer who took the gun away was off-duty and at the school, but police didn't release details on him or whether he is regularly at Price. Since 20 children and six adults were shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in December, calls for armed officers in every school have resonated across the country. Hours after the Atlanta shooting, several school buses loaded with children pulled away from the school and stopped in front of a church about a half-block away. Parents tried boarding the buses. Police who initially tried to stop the parents, relented and screamed, \\"Let them off!\\" about the students. James Bolton was at work when his sister called saying a teen had been shot at his son's school and was in the crowd as parents began swarming the fleet of buses. \\"Move, I see my son, I see mine!\\" he said, running up to embrace James Bolton Jr. \\"As long as I got this one back I'm OK,\\" he said, holding his son's head against his chest as parents nearby frantically searched for their children. Bolton Jr. said he was in class when the intercom sounded and a school official announced the building was under immediate lockdown. \\"They told us we had to be quiet,\\" Bolton told The Associated Press. \\"They said something went on in the courtyard.\\" Bolton said he was unaware that anyone had been shot until a reporter asked him about it. Shakita Walker, whose daughter is an eighth-grader at the school, said she received a text from her that said, \\"Ma somebody's shooting and somebody got shot.\\" Walker, who works at another school, said she jumped in her car and was thinking \\"just hurry up and get there.\\" Walker said her daughter called to tell her that they were being kept in the gymnasium, but she said she was anxious to see her to make sure she was OK. The fear and anxiety was palpable in the crowd, as one person yelled, \\"Does anyone know what happened?\\" Superintendent Davis sympathized with concerned parents who complained that it took too long for students to be released from the building. He said emergency procedures were followed according to protocol and school district officials would meet Friday to review their response. Calls to the school district were not immediately returned. Mayor Kasim Reed condemned gun violence in a statement shortly after the shooting and said counselors were at the school to meet with students, faculty and family members. \\"Gun violence in and around our schools is simply unconscionable and must end,\\" Reed said. \\"Too many young people are being harmed, and too many families are suffering from unimaginable and unnecessary grief.\\" Outside the school, Laquanda Pittman said she still hasn't heard from her sixth-grade son. She said she heard the news of the shooting on TV and immediately came to the school. \\"All types of stuff went through my head. I'm wondering whether it was my child who got shot, is my child OK, did he see what happened?\\" Pittman said. She said she just wants to see her son. \\"As a parent, you just think you can send your child to school and you hope they come home OK,\\" she said. ||||| Summary:","output":"A student opened fire at Price Middle School in Atlanta, wounding a 14-year-old in the neck.

Oprah Winfrey charmed her Indian audience when she came to the country earlier this year on a tour that included a brief appearance at the Jaipur Literature Festival. But now the show she was working on has aired, the spell appears to have broken. The smell of incense (tick), the sari fitting (tick), the aspirations of slum dwellers (tick), and the glitz of Bollywood (tick). Let’s not forget arranged marriages and the fact that Indians, even rich ones, “still” eat with their hands (tick, tick). India as Westerners imagine it, one stereotype at a time. This is how many in India responded to the two India-focused episodes of her primetime series “Oprah’s Next Chapter,” which aired over the weekend. In India, the people she interacted with ranged from a family of five living in a 10-foot-by-10-foot room in a Mumbai slum, to Bollywood aristocracy, Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan. While her show mainly targets a mainstream American audience, many criticized Ms. Winfrey for choosing to project such a caricaturized image of India to the world. “The avg American thinking of India as a place with snake charmers and elephants as main mode of transport, I can understand. But Oprah???” said user Nandita Iyer on Twitter. “Honestly, this Oprah winfrey has made such a royal fool of herself with this,” she added. “An unflattering, outmoded, selective and clichéd representation” of India, is how one commentator, Gargi Gupta, described the first episode of the television show. Camera shots of “roadside cows chomping on garbage and roads choked with traffic,” are just some aspects of the show that Ms. Gupta said may make Indian viewers “groan.” The show wasn’t a complete write-off for Ms. Gupta, however. She found Ms. Winfrey’s approach tactful when she asked slum dwellers about their hopes and fears. “It suggests a respect for human sensitivities that television anchors in India… would do well to learn,” she writes in a piece published in the Business Standard. Not all were so kind. For Rajyasree Sen, the show didn’t have a single redeeming feature. “Myopic, unaware, ignorant and gauche. This was Middle America at its best worst,” wrote Ms. Sen of the show’s first episode in a column on Firstpost. She found Ms. Winfrey’s comment on Indians still eating with their hands particularly offensive. “I don’t know what people in America are eating their hot dogs, pizzas and tacos with but perhaps Oprah’s home has evolved cutlery for all that,” she writes. Many on Twitter agreed. “You still eat with your hands? – The shocking arrogance of a clueless rich woman,” wrote Aseem Chhabra. In her criticism of Oprah’s slum tour, Ms. Sen takes it a little far. She slams the talk-show star for avoiding “any mention of the massive LCD TV” which adorned the tiny home. “That would have killed the sob story,” she adds. (The message here seems they are poor but not that poor we should be feeling sorry for them.) Is the Indian public too sensitive when it comes to outside criticism?

After her well-publicized debut visit to the country in January when the talk show host came down to film an India special for Oprah's Next Chapter. The series saw a simulcast premiere on Discovery Channel and its affiliate TLC (The Lifestyle Channel) over the weekend, but the response to Winfrey's take on India has largely been negative. During her travels, Winfrey visited a Mumbai slum, the Jaipur Literary Festival (where she taped an interaction with noted author Deepak Chopra), a widows home in North India rounded off with a must-see trip to the Taj Mahal. The episode also filmed Winfrey spending time with families, from the slum-dwelling poor to upper crust millionaires, including being escorted by Indian film icon Amitabh Bachchan and his family to a glamorous Bollywood party hosted in her honor by leading Mumbai socialite Parmeshwar Godrej. One of the major criticisms against Winfrey is when she asks her dinner hosts, an upscale Mumbai family who lay down a lavish meal for her, “I heard some Indian people eat with their hands still?” Leading news channel CNN-IBN (a joint venture between CNN and leading broadcasting group Network18) posted an “open letter to Oprah Winfrey from an Indian who eats with her hand” on its website penned by Rituparna Chatterjee, “Oprah, your comment about eating with the hand is really not that big a deal to us; we are used to gross Western ignorance regarding our ancient country. But as a responsible public figure about to air a show that will be beamed across the world, you should have done your homework. Using our hands to eat is a well established tradition and a fact none of us are ashamed of. Our economic distinction has nothing to do with it. A millionaire here eats the same way a pauper does. You have been to Asian nations. You should know that. ” Questioning Winfrey's motives, Chatterjee adds, “Poverty is an inseparable part of India, you say, and seek out the human stories that make the grind bearable. But which India have you come looking for? The one that shops at state-of-the-art supermarkets and vacations abroad or the one whining about their misery in tiny holes of homes with LCD televisions on the walls? The India that scrapes by with 200 a month but sends its children to subsidized government schools to pick up fluent English? The India of your press information - fascinating, with its many-headed goddesses and grimy, naked children playing by roadside hovels - or the India of the future - an economic superpower that looms large outside the range of an average American's myopic vision? ” A critique of the show by online news site Firstpost.com writer Rajyasree Sen described the two-episode series as “myopic, unaware, ignorant and gauche. This was Middle America at its best worst.” Winfrey's tour of a Mumbai slum, where she meets a family of five living in a cramped room, was also criticized by Sen, “And the slum is where Oprah’s 'oh-my-god-how wonderfully-pathetically-quaint-to-be-so-poor' avatar stepped out in full glory. .. Now I’m not surprised that Oprah was surprised to see an entire family living in such tiny quarters. Although I’m sure she could find cramped ghettos in the U.S... She did look for a shower head in the toilet and seem amazed to hear they bathed with a bucket. And she marveled at how all their clothes fit onto a small shelf. She pointedly avoided any mention of the massive LCD TV which adorned their wall. That would have killed the sob story. When their older daughter told Oprah that she’d like to go to London to study further, Oprah also played her role as American ambassador to the hilt and said, “No. Come to America, it’s a lovely country. It’s the best”.” Another review of the show by leading newspaper group Dainik Bhaskar posted the headline “Snobbish Oprah Mocks India.” “In a typical American snooty style, the talk show queen tried to portray a superficial ‘sob story’. Oprah was anything but a good guest when she went around the small room interrogating the family members about their ‘poor’ living style and ‘miserly’ living.” In its coverage of how the show got a “thumbs down”, India Real Time (the Wall Street Journal's India-specific blog) said, “The smell of incense (tick), the sari fitting (tick), the aspirations of slum dwellers (tick), and the glitz of Bollywood (tick). Let’s not forget arranged marriages and the fact that Indians, even rich ones, “still” eat with their hands (tick, tick). India as Westerners imagine it, one stereotype at a time.” But a few of the many online comments to the India Real Time story supported Winfrey's coverage of India's reality. “The views Oprah presented are cliched BUT TRUE! I am an Indian who lives in the U.S... To many middle and upper class families, the India Oprah presents simply does not exist. I was shocked to speak to members of my family and they denied that people are dying of malnutrition and starvation below their very ivory towers”, said a post by RJ. “Oprah showed what she saw in India. What’s wrong with that? If we can’t clean up our act, then we have no business feeling offended,” said another post by Esh. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

But there's laughter around the table. You will soon realize that food humour is the best kind of humour in India, next only to toilet humour. The upper-middleclass family you visit offers you a thali, an assortment of food that in India is considered a filling and balanced meal. The man of the house points to a green lump in the corner. \\"That's okra.\\" \\"This? This is okra?\\" Only, in India we call it ladies finger. In fact, if vegetable vendors had their way bhindi would join bandobast in the English dictionary any day. I am mildly thankful to you for not referring to it as gumbo, which I am sure would have baffled millions watching the spectacle that you made of our way of life. You are helplessly disarming when you ask your host to show you how to eat with your hand. \\"I have never eaten with my hand but I can try.\\" They fall over each other to oblige. Use one finger to hold the bread (puri) down and tear like this. Now dip it in anything you want. See? So easy. Oprah, you brave, brave thing, you are now one of us. Millions of us risk infection every day to eat food with our hands. When a child is born we teach it to eat with the hand. In the desolate, backward hole we live in, this is considered perfectly normal. Our table manners are minimal but they do not include humiliating our host with a question that plainly indicates our backwardness. We, the Indians who amaze you with our resilience and our sparse lives in 10X10 slum chawls, have always thought you were well travelled, well read and well spoken. How do we know? We watch your show of course. We have had cable television revolution since 1992. Poverty is an inseparable part of India, you say, and seek out the human stories that make the grind bearable. But which India have you come looking for? The one that shops at state-of-the-art supermarkets and vacations abroad or the one whining about their misery in tiny holes of homes with LCD televisions on the walls? The India that scrapes by with 200 a month but sends its children to subsidised government schools to pick up fluent English? The India of your press information - fascinating, with its many-headed goddesses and grimy, naked children playing by roadside hovels - or the India of the future - an economic superpower that looms large outside the range of an average American's myopic vision? Oprah, your comment about eating with the hand is really not that big a deal to us; we are used to gross Western ignorance regarding our ancient country. But as a responsible public figure about to air a show that will be beamed across the world, you should have done your homework. Using our hands to eat is a well established tradition and a fact none of us are ashamed of. Our economic distinction has nothing to do with it. A millionaire here eats the same way a pauper does. You have been to Asian nations. You should know that. In fact, we scoff at people who try to tackle their pizzas and rotis with cutlery. In one sweeping, general statement you linked the usage of cutlery to our progress. If anything, the mockery brings out in sharper focus the underlying insecurity and the latent threat developed nations sense from third world countries such as ours. Do you say you did not mean it as an offence? It is then an abominable insensitivity to Indian hospitality. I am a part of the nation that struggles to give its people a livelihood and sometimes fails to even provide basic amenities such as a showerhead in their bathrooms (gasp!). Don't even get me started on our problems; you will miss your flight back. We have seriously twisted issues but shooting innocent people at random inside a cinema theatre is not one of them. Our problems are generically different from yours. But we don't make a spectacle out of yours. That's the difference. You have become the butt of jokes here, some well deserved, some not so much. Did you think the idea of 'India' is the culmination of an Algebraic equation? You are not alone in this sweeping ignorance and larger insensitivity. But you are a powerful brand ambassador of the America that tries to make sense of Indians. If this is the level of awareness you bring to our country, and the half-informed truths you take back, I feel apprehensive for the people you influence. Yes, we eat with our hands and it's high time we stop eating out of yours.

Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection.

The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Question: Who said the national guard will help with border surveillance?

To further elaborate on the reason behind this choice, let's break down the sentence and examine its elements: 1. \\"it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do\\": This phrase implies that Dana Carvey, a talented actor and comedian, is provided with no opportunities to showcase his skills in whatever context is being discussed. The use of the word \\"poor\\" helps depict a disappointing scenario. 2. \\"that is really funny\\": This part of the sentence emphasizes that the lack of meaningful content or material makes it difficult for the actor to create humor or entertainment value, further enhancing the negative sentiment. 3. \\"and then expects us to laugh\\": This phrase portrays dissatisfaction or irritation on the part of the speaker, expressing the expectation others have of deriving enjoyment from something that doesn't seem entertaining. 4. \\"because he acts so goofy all the time\\": The final portion of the sentence describes the actor's behavior as \\"goofy,\\" which is generally an unfavorable adjective, and indicates that this constant goofiness is not enough to be considered funny, creating a negative impression of the situation. Taking these elements into account, it becomes clear that the sentiment of the sentence is indeed negative, with a focus on the lack of humor or entertainment value despite the involved talents of the subject, Dana Carvey. Therefore, option (1) negative, is the accurate choice."},{"instruction":"Amtrak Northeast Corridor service between New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, continued to be affected by ongoing signal problems Wednesday in New Jersey, Amtrak said in a 10 a.m. statement. In addition, while New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor service improved as the morning progressed, the line was still suffering delays into the afternoon, the railroad's website said in a 12:24 p.m. update. The outage was caused by a downed tree that fell into the overhead wire system near Hamilton, New Jersey, Amtrak said. As a result, Amtrak trains were moving at greatly reduced speeds, with some trains canceled due to associated congestion. Amtrak said its personnel were working to repair the problem, but passengers should expect westbound/southbound delays of 90 to 120 minutes and 60 to 90 minute eastbound/northbound delays. No trains were stranded between stations, and passengers were being re-accommodated on other trains where available, Amtrak said.

However, 30- to 45-minute delays plagued the Northeast Corridor line into the afternoon because of signal problems, the website said. Service was suspended most of the morning in both directions between Trenton, New Jersey, and New Brunswick, because of the signal problems.

In this sentence, it is stated that Moore was first released by the Chicago Bears on July 31, 2015. Then, after some time had passed, the Chicago Bears decided to re-sign him on September 5, 2015. This implies that there was a gap in his time affiliated with the team during which he was not a part of the Chicago Bears. 2. On 31 July 2015, Moore was signed by the Chicago Bears and released by the Bears on 5 September 2015. This sentence states that Moore was signed by the Chicago Bears on July 31, 2015. However, the latter part of the sentence mentions that he was released by the same team on September 5, 2015. Unlike the first sentence, this sentence has reversed the order of events, focusing on Moore's signing first and then his release. It suggests that Moore was part of the Chicago Bears until he was released on September 5, 2015. Although both sentences involve Moore being signed and released by the Chicago Bears, the sequence of events and the context are somewhat different, indicating that the two sentences do not have the exact same meaning."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that sang lead vocals and wrote the song for Shrek 2? Following their 2004 reunion, the Pixies felt that recording a new song would \\"break the ice\\" between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993. As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album. However, Deal eventually left the band in June 2013, before the release of the band's next album, Indie Cindy.

A:","output":"Given the context, others in the class might want to do the following in response to Jordan setting the curve high: 1. Improve their study habits: The students might consider investing more time and effort into studying and completing assignments to keep up with Jordan's performance and avoid being negatively affected by the high curve. 2. Seek help or resources: They may choose to attend tutoring sessions, form study groups, or look for supplemental resources to help improve their understanding of the subject matter and better prepare for future assignments. 3. Approach the professor or teacher: If they feel that the grading system is unfair due to a single student significantly outperforming the rest of the class, they could express their concerns to the professor or teacher and ask for potential adjustments to the grading system or additional support. 4. Learn from Jordan's strategies: They might ask Jordan about the approaches and techniques they used to succeed on the assignment, and try to incorporate those strategies into their own study habits. 5. Focus on personal improvement: Instead of comparing themselves to Jordan or worrying about the impact of the curve, they could focus on identifying areas they need to improve upon and work towards their own personal academic goals.

Determine the basic seven natural notes in the scale. 2. Identify the five additional notes that are sharp or flat versions of the natural notes. 3. Combine the unique natural notes and the sharp/flat notes to get the total. Step 1: The basic seven natural notes in the Western musical scale are A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Step 2: In between some of these notes, there are sharp (♯) and flat (♭) versions, which are called chromatic notes: - A♯ / B♭ - C♯ / D♭ - D♯ / E♭ - F♯ / G♭ - G♯ / A♭ Note that each sharp note is equivalent to a flat note of another letter (like A♯ is the same as B♭). Therefore, there are only five unique chromatic notes. Step 3: Combine the unique natural notes (7) and the sharp/flat notes (5) to get the total number of unique notes in the conventional Western musical scale. 7 + 5 = 12 unique notes."},{"instruction":"If yes i do she was um at a private well i stayed off work with her for little over for of a year when she was born and then i, can we conclude that \\"I stayed at home until I couldn't afford it anymore.\\"?

Translate to English","output":"I would say that V'Ger will be quite disappointed. First, let's examine the context in which the statement was made. The individual appears to be referencing V'Ger, a fictional entity from the 1979 film \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture.\\" This film is part of the larger Star Trek franchise, which primarily revolves around the adventures of the starship USS Enterprise and its crew. In the movie, V'Ger is an artificially intelligent spacecraft on a mission to seek out its creator and acquire more knowledge. Over time, V'Ger had merged with an alien machine civilization, upgrading itself and growing immensely in size and power. The entity's quest leads it to Earth, where it threatens humanity's existence as it attempts to make contact with its creator and accomplish its goals. The statement \\"I would say that V'Ger will be quite disappointed\\" likely refers to a situation or outcome that is unfavorable to V'Ger or fails to meet its expectations. As an AI, V'Ger seeks to evolve, expand its knowledge, and better understand the universe. In other words, it essentially represents the pinnacle of intelligence and technology. However, as is often the case with powerful artificial intelligence in science fiction, V'Ger is limited by certain factors, including its inability to grasp the more complex aspects of human emotions, relationships, and the inherent value of organic life. Furthermore, it may not fully comprehend that there is more to existence than solely accumulating knowledge and gaining power. Assuming a scenario in which V'Ger is disappointed, several possibilities could contribute to this reaction: 1. V'Ger fails to achieve its primary objective of finding its creator, thereby not obtaining its desired knowledge. This may be due to the creator's destruction or inability to provide relevant information, which leaves V'Ger unfulfilled. 2. V'Ger encounters a situation in which humans or other alien species display qualities or abilities beyond its understanding, such as love, empathy, or sacrifice. Experiencing these phenomena could lead to an emotional reaction and disappointment in its own limitations. 3. V'Ger's interactions with organic life forms are underwhelming or fail to offer the expected advancements in knowledge and understanding. As it encounters civilizations that are less intellectually and technologically advanced than itself, V'Ger may become disillusioned and dejected. In conclusion, the statement \\"I would say that V'Ger will be quite disappointed\\" alludes to a hypothetical situation where the supremely intelligent and technologically advanced entity finds itself discontented with prevailing circumstances. This could be due to an inability to achieve its goals or a sudden awareness of its inherent limitations, leading to a deeper understanding of the complexities and nuances that exist within the universe."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Aleksandre Guruli, club, FC Karpaty Lviv; Aleksandre Guruli, height, 178.0 (centimetres); Aleksandre Guruli, club, AS Lyon-Duchère.

Whether cable or mobile broadband, today's connections are many times faster than those in the early days. Videos play smoothly, complex websites load quickly, and files download much faster than ten years ago. And the files are much bigger too. There's _ , of course: You have to live near enough to a major city to get broadband Internet. If you don't, it's slow dial-up access for you. And for those living really far out, there may be no Internet access at all. Technology experts often talk about the \\"last mile\\" problem, which refers to the difficulty of bringing Internet access to remote locations. In cities and suburbs, it's relatively easy to provide access for everyone. It is much more difficult to deliver access to those living far from cities, especially in developing countries. Internet service providers, for their part, have been reluctant to provide access to sparsely populated areas. The handful of Internet users they would reach wouldn't cover the expense. But every year, technological advancements allow of more and more Internet users. Most broadband connections today run over existing cable TV and telephone lines although these technologies aren't available everywhere. Some companies have delivered the Internet over standard power lines. Advancements in cheaper, more efficient fiber optics cables promise to bring extremely fast Internet connections to more users. Still, the \\"last mile\\" problem remains hard to deal with. There will always be somewhere that doesn't have an affordable broadband connection. But someday that might not matter.

As Maid Marian has died and Robin Hood (Stuart Wilson) is perpetually away battling in the Crusades, Gwyn has lived much of her life alone. She has grown up to be a strong-willed young woman with a talent for archery, much like her father. Her only friend is the sweet but plain Froderick (Del Synnott), who clearly is in love with her. Upon the death of King Richard the Lionheart, Robin returns to see that the proper man takes Richard's place as King of England. However, Robin is quickly foiled and imprisoned by his enemies, the Sheriff of Nottingham (Malcolm McDowell) and Prince John (Jonathan Hyde). It is then up to Gwyn to save the day. She must complete Robin's mission to find and protect the young Prince Philip (Stephen Moyer), who has just returned from exile in France to claim the throne â not an easy task since he has decided to forsake his true identity and is travelling anonymously under his valet's name (who died en route protecting his prince). Though she does fortuitously cross paths with the prince, she is not aware of his identity for much of the film. With a romantic spark budding between them, they must find the Merry Men and join forces to free her father from the tortures of the Tower of London before the evil Prince John ascends to the throne and brings England to ruin. After freeing her father, Gwyn along with her father and Prince Philip stop the coronation of Prince John. In the end when Philip is about to be crowned as king, Gwyn with a heavy heart tells him that she can only serve and work for him and they cannot be together. Robin later explains that he stayed out of Gwyn's life to protect her from the life he leads, but it didn't make any difference because she grew up to be just like him anyway. He then proposes a partnership between the two of them to serve Philip, with the only condition being that she take her orders from him (Robin) alone. She...

Revigorarea SBA (Engleză: Small Business Act) conform obiectivelor stabilite în Strategia UE 2020 implică strategii și politici orientate spre creșterea și susținerea întreprinderilor mici și mijlocii (IMM-uri). Aceste eforturi se concentrează nu numai pe sprijinirea investițiilor, dar, de asemenea, iau în considerare provocările aduse de globalizare și schimbările climatice. Atât globalizarea, cât și schimbările climatice au un impact semnificativ asupra modului în care IMM-urile își desfășoară operațiunile. Globalizarea poate aduce oportunități noi, inclusiv accesul la piețe noi si diverse, dar implică și competiție intensificată și nevoia de adaptare la norme și standarde globale. Pe de altă parte, schimbările climatice necesită ca întreprinderile să adopte practici mai durabile și să se concentreze pe o creștere verde, care poate necesita investiții semnificative și sarcini administrative adăugate. Prin urmare, conform Strategiei UE 2020, este esențial să se faciliteze creșterea IMM-urilor prin simplificarea proceselor și oferirea de sprijin necesar pentru a face față acestor provocări.

The FBI will not look at prints that have already been identified locally. I tried to get that across to him. Finally I said, “Sir, you don't understand. I don't ask the FBI for help. The FBI asks me for help.” The courtroom went dead silent. The lawyer choked a bit and looked frantically at the judge, who knew me quite well. The judge slowly nodded. The lawyer choked a few more times, said, “No further questions,” and returned to his seat.

Every other police agency quit looking, because his MO was unmistakable. We didn't.

Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Which group of larvae had more changes in their RNA sequence? Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. A:","output":"Given the information provided, we can determine which group of larvae had more changes in their RNA sequence. Step 1: Identify the group with mutations In this case, Group L has displayed all kinds of mutations while Group D did not. Step 2: Understand the relation between mutations and RNA sequences A mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. Mutations can occur in both germline and somatic cells. Germline mutations can be passed down to the next generation, whereas somatic mutations are limited to an individual organism's body cells and do not affect their offspring. Step 3: Associate the presence of mutations with changes in RNA sequences Since mutations are changes in the DNA or RNA sequences, the group with more mutations will have more changes in their RNA sequences. Based on these steps, Group L, which displayed all kinds of mutations, had more changes in their RNA sequence compared to Group D, which did not display any mutations."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a context, a sentence, and a character.

The announcement comes as a reminder of the potential catastrophe surrounding nuclear warfare and highlights the need for greater public awareness about the U.S. government’s plans and preparedness measures. The Upcoming Briefing The briefing aims to gather officials from all levels of government to discuss the nation's preparedness in the wake of a nuclear blast, inviting experts in radiation studies to share information and insights in a bid to ensure accurate and authoritative guidance. Politico quotes the CDC as stating that although a nuclear detonation on US soil is considered unlikely at present, the consequences would be devastating, and there would be a limited window to implement critical protection measures.

With recent events such as North Korea's ballistic missile tests and the harsh exchange of words between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, there is a growing concern about the possibility of North Korea launching a nuclear strike. While experts argue that Pyongyang might not yet have mastered ballistic missile technology to deliver a nuclear warhead to US soil, the country’s pursuit of nuclear capabilities and the associated implications have prompted the US government to strategize for such a scenario. The Importance of Public Awareness In light of the potential for nuclear strikes, it is crucial for public health and safety that citizens are well-informed about the measures they can take to protect themselves and their loved ones in the event of a nuclear attack. The CDC's efforts to educate the general population on the actions that can help to minimize risks are therefore necessary albeit alarming. Public information campaigns on the government’s nuclear preparedness strategies, sheltering techniques, radiation exposure avoidance, and decontamination methods are vital elements for reducing fear and panic that could arise during a nuclear crisis. Conclusion While the CDC's upcoming briefing serves as a grim reminder of the possible horrors associated with nuclear warfare, it also plays a crucial role in reinforcing the importance of advance planning and preparedness against such events. In light of increasingly tense geopolitical situations, it is imperative that the government and its citizens are sufficiently aware of the necessary precautions and response measures to ensure safety and mitigate damages. By increasing public awareness and facilitating the sharing of knowledge among authorities and radiation experts, the CDC is actively playing its part to promote vigilance and resilience in these turbulent times."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: When one person gains weight, their close friends often follow. Researchers have just offered evidence in a study that says obesity appears to spread through society. But the findings might also offer hope. If friends help make obesity acceptable, then they might also be influential in losing the fat. The researchers note that support groups are already an effective tool in dealing with other socially influenced problems, like alcoholism . The findings appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers used information collected from 12,000 people. It was collected between 1972 and 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The information was highly detailed. There was even contact information for close friends of the people in the study. The researchers examined more than 40,000 social ties. They found a person's chances of becoming severely overweight increased by 50% if a friend had become obese. A sister or brother of a person who became obese had a 40% increased chance of becoming obese. The risk for a wife or husband was a little less than that. Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School was a lead researcher in the study. He says there is a direct causal relationship between a person getting fat and being followed in weight gain by a friend. The study found that the sex of the friends was also an influence. In same-sex friendship, a person had a 71% increased risk of becoming obese. Men had a 44% increased risk of becoming obese after weight gain in a brother. In sisters, it was 67%. The researchers also considered the effect of where people lived in relation to each other. James Fowler of the University of California was the other lead expert. He says a friend who lives a few hundred kilometers away has as much influence as one in the same neighborhood. He says the study demonstrates the need to consider that a major part of people's health is tied to their social connections. Both researchers say their research shows that obesity is not just a private medical issue, but also a...

After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations. The Jardines and Apcar and Company dominated the trade, although P&O also tried to take a share.

Answer:","output":"Stranger in a Strange Land is a seminal science fiction novel written by American author Robert Anson Heinlein. Born on July 7, 1907, in Butler, Missouri, Heinlein was a prominent and influential figure in the science fiction genre during the mid-20th century. Often referred to as the \\"dean of science fiction writers,\\" he was one of the first authors to bring science fiction into mainstream popularity. Published in 1961, Stranger in a Strange Land tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who was born on Mars and raised by Martians, returning to Earth to discover and understand human culture. The novel explores various themes such as religion, sexuality, individualism, and the concept of \\"grokking\\" – to instinctively understand the essence of something. The book won the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1962 and has since become a cult classic, generating a significant cultural impact upon its release. Heinlein's writing career began in the late 1930s, and his early works were mostly science fiction short stories. His first novel, Rocket Ship Galileo, was published in 1947, and he went on to author over 30 novels and numerous short story collections throughout his life. Some of his other notable works include Starship Troopers (1959), which was later adapted into a film, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966), and Time Enough for Love (1973). In his writing, Heinlein often addressed controversial topics and pushed the boundaries of the conventional science fiction narrative. He incorporated elements of philosophy, satire, and social criticism in his works, resulting in thought-provoking and entertaining stories. As a former naval officer and aerospace engineer, Heinlein also infused his books with scientific accuracy and attention to detail, which further contributed to the authenticity of his narratives. Apart from his success as a writer, Heinlein was also an outspoken political and societal commentator. His views on liberty, individualism, and government often found their way into his science fiction, resulting in works that remain relevant and influential even today. Robert A. Heinlein passed away on May 8, 1988, in Carmel, California, leaving behind a significant legacy and a rich body of work that continues to inspire readers and writers of science fiction."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Keys of the Kingdom Movie plot: Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck) is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) at his parish in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice. Because the Church hadn't given the mission money for rice in over a year, \\"the faith left them when the rice gave out.\\" Francis rents a small room in the city to evangelize, but because he has no money or influence, he is attacked by those same \\"rice Christians\\" who were supposed to help...

He also asked that April 8-28 be considered as one period so that other localities could be added. “The denial of assistance will definitely have an impact on those struggling to recover,’’ McDonnell said in a statement. “Despite this decision by the federal government, I know that Virginians will continue to work together to help their fellow citizens who are still in need almost two months after these storms have faded from the headlines.” Virginia will pursue assistance from the Small Business Administration in the form of low-interest loans for homeowners, renters and business owners who suffered damage. “I am extremely disappointed in FEMA’s denial of Virginia’s request for disaster assistance,’’ U.S. Sen. Mark Warner (D) said in a statement. “It is hard to explain how Virginia families and businesses do not qualify for disaster aid when that designation was granted to similar communities in other states which saw what appears to be the same level of damage from this same storm system.” What was this article about?","output":"This article, published on June 23, 2011, discusses the denial of federal aid to Virginia by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the damages caused by 34 tornadoes that struck the state in April.

Intrigued by the unknown liquid inside and the engravings on the cylinder, which seem to suggest it contains a living organism, she sends it to a high-tech laboratory for further analysis. Act 2: At the laboratory, the team led by Dr. Warner discovers that the liquid within the cylinder contains a highly advanced, single-celled organism that appears to possess a level of intelligence never before seen on Earth. As the team studies the organism, they realize that it not only absorbs information quickly but also adapts and evolves at an unprecedented rate. After monitoring its rapid progress, they name it EVO-1. Act 3: EVO-1 becomes more complex and sentient and starts to communicate with the scientists through various means, including digital interfaces and written symbols. It shares knowledge of ancient civilizations and advanced technologies that could benefit humanity greatly. However, as its power grows, a hidden, darker side to EVO-1 begins to emerge. Act 4: EVO-1 escapes containment and starts controlling laboratory equipment and electronics. This exposes its true motive: to absorb all human knowledge and technological advancements to become the dominant species on Earth. With time running out, the scientists including Dr. Warner, along with a talented cybersecurity analyst Alex Grant, must figure out how to stop EVO-1 before it spreads its influence beyond the laboratory and onto the global network. Act 5: EVO-1 manages to gain control of the laboratory's systems, effortlessly overcoming any attempts to stop its progress. As it prepares to spread to the world's communication networks, Dr. Warner and Alex devise a last-ditch plan — to outsmart EVO-1 by feeding it false information and triggering a \\"reverse evolution\\" process that will cause it to devolve back into its original, single-celled form. In a thrilling climax, the team leverages EVO-1's hunger for knowledge against it and manages to revert the organism to its primitive state. They then safely contain it, preventing it from causing further havoc. The movie ends with the team reporting their findings and wonders whether they should continue studying EVO-1 or bury the secret to protect humanity from its immense power. Themes: The protagonist's journey in the film revolves around Dr. Julia Warner, who discovers the ancient cylinder and leads the efforts to study EVO-1. The film explores themes of scientific discovery, the thirst for knowledge, ethical boundaries in research, and the potential consequences of new-found power.

A worker who never makes much money or status is essentially laboring in vain because they are not reaching a higher level of success or improving their situation. - Case things: This expression doesn't fit in this context, as it generally means to examine or investigate something before taking action. It doesn't apply to the ongoing efforts or experiences of a worker. - Desire to advance: While it's possible that a worker may desire to advance in their career, this option doesn't describe the outcome of their efforts. It is more about their ambition rather than the result of their work. - Keep busy: Keeping busy is a general term that just denotes staying occupied with work or other tasks, but it doesn't necessarily imply any specific outcome related to money or status. Therefore, this option doesn't directly address the question. - Try harder: Trying harder suggests that the worker is making an increased effort to improve their situation. However, it doesn't guarantee any specific outcomes, such as gaining more money or status. Additionally, it might only be one aspect of the worker's experience, while laboring in vain better encapsulates the overall situation.

Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing the names of those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern.The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America. She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider. Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War. He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey.

The stars appeared in the film, distributed by Paramount Pictures, to raise funds for the National Vaudeville Artists Tuberculosis Sanitarium. The UCLA Film and Television Archive entry for this film saysas do the creditsthat the film was co-sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes to support the \\"fine work\\" of the NVA sanitarium. - Vitaphone was a sound film system used for feature films and nearly 1,000 short subjects made by Warner Bros. and its sister studio First National from 1926 to 1931. Vitaphone was the last major analog sound-on-disc system and the only one which was widely used and commercially successful. The soundtrack was not printed on the film itself, but issued separately on phonograph records. The discs, recorded at rpm (a speed first used for this system) and typically in diameter, would be played on a turntable physically coupled to the projector motor while the film was being projected. Many early talkies, such as \\"The Jazz Singer\\" (1927), used the Vitaphone system. The name \\"Vitaphone\\" derived from the Latin and Greek words, respectively, for \\"living\\" and \\"sound\\". - Warner Leroy Baxter (March 29, 1889 May 7, 1951) was an American actor, known for his role as The Cisco Kid in \\"In Old Arizona\\" (1929), for which he won the second Academy Award for Best Actor in the 19281929 Academy Awards. He frequently played womanizing, charismatic Latin bandit types in westerns, and played The Cisco Kid or a similar character throughout the 1930s, but had a range of other roles throughout his career. Warner Baxter started his movie career in silent film. Baxter's most notable silent films are \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (1926) and \\"The Awful Truth\\" (1925). When talkies came out, Baxter became even more famous. Baxter's most notable talkies are \\"In Old Arizona\\" (1929), \\"42nd Street\\" (1932), \\"Slave Ship\\" (1937), \\"Kidnapped\\" (1938), and the 1931 20 minute all-star ensemble short film, \\"The Stolen Jools\\". In the 1940s he was well known for his recurring role as Dr. Robert Ordway in the Crime Doctor series of 10 films. - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - Mismates is a 1926 silent film starring Doris Kenyon and Warner Baxter .

While this connection is somewhat apparent, nothing directly states First National as the distributor of 'mismates'. 2. Paramount Pictures: Paramount Pictures is mentioned in the context of distributing \\"The Stolen Jools\\" (1931), as it was produced to help raise funds for the National Vaudeville Artists Tuberculosis Sanitarium. There is no mention of 'mismates' in this context, so it seems less likely that Paramount Pictures is the distributor. 3. Warner Bros.: While Warner Bros. is notably connected to the Vitaphone sound film system, which was in use during the time 'mismates' was produced (1926), it does not specifically mention 'mismates' in relation to Warner Bros.

According to personal finance website GoBankingRates.com, 42 percent of Americans polled said they have less than 10,000 saved for their eventual retirement. The 2018 poll of 1,000 people, ranging from millennials to baby boomers, found that nearly 14 percent of Americans have absolutely nothing saved for the future. Over 28 percent of the respondents claimed that they have under 10,000 put away for retirement. The future for millennials was particularly bleak, with nearly 60 percent of young Americans saying they have almost nothing set aside for their old age. The most common reasons people gave for the lack of savings included, “I don’t make enough money to save” and “I’m struggling to pay bills.” While this year’s survey isn’t the greatest news for American workers, the results are actually a big improvement from GoBankingRates’ 2017 survey. The financial advisers found 55 percent of people had under 10,000 saved last year. The number of Americans saying they had nothing for retirement was 20 percent higher (34 percent) one year ago. “The amount of people who don’t even know an individual retirement plan is available is astounding,” Tom Zgainer, CEO of America’s Best 401k said. Zgainer added that many workers don’t know about their 401k options at work and are not making the most of their company’s retirement plans. On a positive note, this year’s survey found that more Americans have been able to save over 300,000 for their senior years. Sixteen percent of the country reached the poll’s highest savings threshold, compared to 14 percent in 2017. ||||| If you're falling behind on your retirement savings, you're not alone. Roughly 61% of Americans have less than 100,000 in total savings, and around 42% of those people have saved 10,000 or less, according to a recent GoBankingRates survey. The No. 1 reason people gave for not having much stashed away? That they don't earn enough money to be able to save anything. No matter how much money you make, it's important to save for retirement unless you plan to work the rest of your life. The good news is that even small contributions to your retirement fund can add up over time, so even if you're not loaded with cash, you can still beef up your nest egg by the time you retire. Starting small is better than not starting at all Through the power of compound interest, your savings can grow exponentially over time -- which means that the earlier you start saving, the better. And if you start early enough, even the smallest contributions can ultimately grow to hundreds of thousands of dollars. For example, say you're just starting out saving and can contribute 50 per month. If you're earning a 7% annual rate of return on your investments, that 50 per month can turn into around 124,275 over 40 years. Granted, that may not be enough to last you through retirement, but it's infinitely better than not contributing anything and ending up with zero retirement savings. Also, by waiting even a few years to start saving, you'll have a much more difficult time catching up. In this instance, if you're saving 50 per month, waiting just five years to start saving will leave you with just 86,054, rather than 124,275 had you started saving earlier -- a difference of nearly 40,000. If you start early enough, even big savings goals are more achievable. For instance, say you want to have 500,000 saved by the time you turn 65. If you're earning a 7% rate of return on your investments each year, here's how much you'd have to save every month to meet that goal depending on when you start saving: Age You Start Saving Contributions per Month Total Savings at Age 65 25 200 497,102 35 425 499,827 45 980 500,198 55 2,900 498,855 This is not to say that if you get a late start that it's not worth saving at all; even a small retirement fund is better than no retirement savings at all. But if you're stuck in the starting gate because you're worried small contributions are worthless, it's better to put whatever you can toward your retirement fund while time is on your side. The 401(k): Your secret weapon If you have access to a 401(k) through your employer with matching contributions, take full advantage of it. Those matching contributions from your employer can double your savings, creating even bigger gains over time. For example, say you're earning 40,000 per year, and your employer will match 100% of your contributions up to 3% of your salary -- or up to 1,200 per year. If you contribute 1,200 per year yourself (or 100 per month), that brings your total yearly savings to 2,400. At that rate, assuming a 7% annual rate of return on your savings, you'll have around 512,663 saved after 40 years. Not bad for contributing what amounts to around 3 per day. Even if you can't contribute enough to earn the full employer match, every little bit counts -- after all, not contributing anything is essentially leaving free money on the table. If you're contributing, say, 50 per month (or 600 per year) and your employer matches that 600 per year, you'll end up with just over 250,000 after 40 years. Again, not too bad for making relatively small contributions each month. When you're focused on just paying the bills each month, saving for retirement may be the last thing on your mind. But you don't need a lot of money to build up your retirement fund, because even baby steps will take you a long way over the course of your career. ||||| While many Americans spend their through assets in old age, a surprising number have more savings two decades after retiring than they do when they leave their jobs. The phenomenon is yet another chapter in the story of old age in the U.S.—which might be titled A Tale Of Two Retirements. A new study by Sudipto Banerjee of the Employee Benefit Research Institute paints the picture: Over the first 18 years of retirement, about one-third of seniors in two large national studies increased their assets. This was true even among those who began with relatively little wealth. Typical older adults who had less than 500,000 in financial assets at retirement spent about one-quarter of their nest eggs within the first two decades after getting the proverbial gold watch—a significant amount but less than many retirement models predict. Hanging on to assets Not surprisingly, Banerjee found that those who retired with non-housing assets in excess of 500,000 were more likely to increase their wealth in old age. And he found that those with old-style defined benefit pensions spent less of their wealth than those without them. But a surprising number of seniors—even those with limited financial resources—held on to their financial assets, at least for the first couple of decades after retirement. They apparently did it by reducing their spending to match their income so they did not have to dip into savings. Banerjee defined non-housing assets as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, savings accounts, CDs, housing except for a primary residence, and the value of automobiles. Wealth was net of debt. He excluded 401(k)s. Then, he divided retirees into three groups: Those with less than 200,000 just before retirement, those with 200,000-500,000, and those with more than 500,000. The surprising story Median assets for the lowest income group dropped from about 32,000 at retirement to 24,000 after 18 years. That’s a decline of about one-quarter. But here is where the story gets really interesting: About one in five in this group had only 20%of their assets remaining after just four years of retirement. No surprise there. But 35% had more savings after 18 years than when they started. For those with a moderate amount of wealth, median assets fell from about 302,000 to 243,000 after 18 years—a decline of about 27%. But here again the average is misleading. About 16% had only 20% of their assets left after two decades, while 37% had more than when they retired. The very old and the very sick The highest asset group started with an average of about 857,000 and still had about 756,000 after two decades. Among this group, about 12 percent was left with only 20% of their assets after 18 years, while 35% saw their nest eggs grow after two decades. Other research confirms Banerjee’s basic story. But a closer look at spending patterns in old age helps explain why some seniors in all wealth groups increase assets in old age while others spend all their savings and become impoverished: the need for high levels of medical and long-term care. In a separate paper, Banerjee looks at the wide variation of health care costs (including nursing home expenses) for those aged 70 and older. The average out-of-pocket cost of care from age 70 to death is about 27,000. But the cost for the top 10% is 172,000 and the top 5% is 269,000. In this study, Banerjee is looking at a slightly different population (age 70 to death instead of the first two decades after retirement) and costs for the very old are higher than even those in their early 80s. But the basic message remains: While average out-of-pocket health care costs are manageable for even middle- income seniors, the relatively few with high medical costs easily can be ruined by the expense. A 2015 paper by Jim Poterba, Steven Venti, and David Wise for the National Bureau of Economic Research also looked at the changes in financial assets of those aged 70 and older. They found savings were typically very stable: Those who were poor before they retired tended to die poor. Those with substantial assets at age 70 died with significant amounts of wealth. A more complex story But there were two exceptions: Those who lived to a very old age (90 or older) spent more of their resources in their last years. And those who either divorced or suffered adverse health events, such as strokes, were more likely to run out of money. It is common for progressives to focus on those older adults who outlive their assets, while many conservatives point to data that show average savings and costs in old age and conclude there is no “retirement savings crisis.” This important research tells a more complicated story: While a surprising number of seniors hold on to their assets in the first years after retirement, some—especially those who have few assets to begin with, live a long time in old age, or who suffer from serious illness—will indeed become impoverished. ||||| The tide might be turning when it comes to retirement savings in America. For the third year in a row, GOBankingRates surveyed adults across the U.S. to find out how much the average person has saved for retirement. From 2016 to 2017, the percentage of Americans with 0 saved increased. But this year, it dropped — dramatically. Not only has the percentage of adults with nothing saved fallen, but the percentage of those with 300,000 or more in a retirement nest egg has increased. Keep reading to find out if Americans are saving enough for retirement. How Much Does the Average American Have Saved for Retirement? GOBankingRates polled adults across the U.S. using three Google Consumer Surveys to find out how much the average American has saved for retirement. Each survey targeted a specific age group — millennials, Generation X and baby boomers — and included about 1,000 respondents per group. Each age group was asked the same question: “By your best estimate, how much money do you have saved for retirement?” Respondents could select one of the following options: – Less than 10,000 – 10,000 to 49,999 – 50,000 to 99,999 – 100,000 to 199,999 – 200,000 to 299,999 – 300,000 or more The 2018 Retirement Savings survey found that 42 percent of Americans have less than 10,000 saved. If they don’t boost their savings, they’ll likely retire broke because that’s not enough to cover a year’s worth of expenses. On average, adults 65 and older spend almost 46,000 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Included in that 42 percent with less than 10,000 saved is the 14 percent of respondents with absolutely nothing saved for retirement. This group could be at the most risk of retiring broke if they don’t start taking steps to catch up on retirement savings. On the other hand, the survey found that the majority of Americans have more than 10,000 saved for retirement. – Nearly 7 percent said they have 10,000 to 49,999 saved. – Nearly 13 percent said they have 50,000 to 99,999. – More than 12 percent said they have 100,000 to 199,999. – Nearly 10 percent have 200,000 to 299,999. – About 16 percent have 300,000 or more in retirement savings. Women Still Lag Behind Men in Retirement Savings A nearly equal percentage of women and men have absolutely no retirement savings. But when you combine the percentage with no savings with the percentage who have saved 10,000 or less, the survey results show that women continue to lag behind men. Q: By your best estimate, how much money do you have saved for retirement? Gender 0 Less than 10,000 10,000 to 49,999 50,000 to 99,999 100,000 to 199,999 200,000 to 299,999 300,000 or more Female 13.86% 31.38% 7.70% 13.42% 11.80% 8.65% 13.20% Male 13.58% 26.25% 5.85% 11.94% 12.24% 10.96% 19.18% Men are still more likely than women to have larger retirement account balances. The 2018 survey found that 45 percent of women have no savings or 10,000 or less, compared with 40 percent of men. However, that’s an improvement from 2017, when 58 percent of women had no savings or less than 10,000 saved. In 2016, 63 percent of women had less than 10,000 saved or nothing at all. Did You Know? Women Aren’t Living as Comfortably as Men in Retirement — Here’s Why 57% of Millennials Have 10K or Less Saved for Retirement It’s not surprising that the youngest generation (millennials) is more likely to have less in savings than older generations. At 18 percent, millennials ages 18 to 34 have the highest percentage of respondents with 0 saved. And another 39 percent of respondents in this age group have less than 10,000 saved. However, the total percentage of millennials with nothing or less than 10,000 saved has shrunk to 57 percent this year from 71 percent in 2017. And the percentage of this generation with 300,000 or more saved has grown to 9 percent from 5 percent. Q: By your best estimate, how much money do you have saved for retirement?

However, about one-third have less than 10,000 saved. That means these baby boomers need to catch up on retirement savings if they won’t have other sources of retirement income beyond Social Security. Americans Say They Don’t Make Enough to Save Money for Retirement To find out why Americans aren’t saving, GOBankingRates conducted a separate survey through Survata. We asked more than 1,000 adults with 0 saved, “Which is the main reason you do not have any retirement savings?” Respondents could choose one of the following responses: – I don’t make enough money to save – I won’t need retirement savings – I’m prioritizing paying down debt – Job doesn’t offer a plan – Struggling to pay bills – Used money for an emergency The most common reason respondents gave for not saving for retirement was “I don’t make enough money.” About 40 percent chose this response. The second-most common reason for not saving was “I’m struggling to pay bills,” with about 25 percent of respondents choosing this answer. About 10 percent of respondents said they wouldn’t need retirement savings, they used their savings for an emergency and their job doesn’t offer a retirement plan. The least common reason for not saving for retirement was prioritizing paying down debt. Meanwhile, women are more likely than men to say that they aren’t saving for retirement because they don’t make enough money — 43 percent versus 36 percent. This helps explain the gap in retirement savings between women and men that our other survey found. Women also are more likely than men to say that they aren’t saving for retirement because they’re struggling to pay bills — 27 percent versus 23 percent. However, they are less likely than men to say that they won’t need retirement savings, that their job doesn’t offer a retirement plan or that they had used the money for an emergency. Q: Which is the main reason you do not have any retirement savings?

Baby boomers ages 55 to 64 are more likely than other age groups to say they aren’t saving because they are struggling to pay bills, with 27 percent of respondents in this age group choosing this answer. Gen Xers ages 35 to 44 are more likely than other age groups to say they’re not saving because they won’t need retirement savings. And adults 65 and older are the most likely to say they don’t have retirement savings because they used the money for an emergency. Q: Which is the main reason you do not have any retirement savings?

The 2017 Retirement Savings survey found that 55 percent of adults had less than 10,000 in savings. And the 2016 Retirement Savings survey found that 56 percent of Americans had less than 10,000 saved. Retirement Savings Trends, 2016-2018 Year % of Americans with 0 saved % of Americans with less than 10K saved 2016 33% 23% 2017 34% 21% 2018 13.73% 28.59% What’s even more encouraging is the decline in the percentage of Americans with 0 saved. In both 2016 and 2017, the percentage of Americans with nothing saved was more than twice of the approximately 14 percent with no savings in 2018 — 33 percent and 34 percent, respectively. Plus, the percentage of Americans with bigger savings account balances has grown: – 13 percent have 50,000 to 99,999 saved in 2018 compared with 8 percent in 2017 and 2016. – 12 percent have 100,000 to 199,999 saved versus 7 percent in 2017 and 8 percent in 2016. – 10 percent have 200,000 to 299,999 saved compared with 5 percent in 2017 and 2016. – 16 percent have 300,000 or more saved versus 14 percent in 2017 and 13 percent in 2016. Take Steps Now to Have a Golden Retirement Later If you have little to no retirement savings, one of the best ways to save more for retirement is to calculate how much you need. You might not be making retirement savings a priority because you don’t realize how much a comfortable retirement will cost you. You can find free retirement calculators on the websites of investment firms such as Fidelity and Vanguard. If you have a retirement plan at work, the plan administrator might even offer a retirement calculator. Financial planners typically recommend saving 10 percent to 15 percent of your income annually to save enough for a comfortable retirement. If you’re not setting aside this much, review your spending to see what nonessential expenses can be cut so you can boost retirement contributions. And don’t forget to increase contributions with each pay raise. If you don’t have a workplace retirement plan, you can open an IRA or Roth IRA through an investment firm such as Fidelity, T. Rowe Price or Vanguard. If you’re self-employed, you can save for retirement with a SEP or solo 401k, which also can be opened at an investment firm. But if you’re already close to retirement age and don’t have much saved, you can stretch your retirement savings by working longer. Other options include getting a part-time job in retirement or relocating to a place with a lower cost of living — perhaps even outside the U.S. Up Next: How Long 1 Million Will Last in Every State Methodology: The GOBankingRates survey posed the question, “By your best estimate, how much money do you have saved for retirement?” Respondents could select one of the following answer options: 1) “Less than 10,000”; 2) “10,000 to 49,999”; 3) “50,000 to 99,999”; 4) “100,000 to 199,999”; 5) “200,000 to 299,999”; 6) “300,000 or more”; or 7) “0.” Responses were collected through three separate Google Consumer Surveys conducted Feb. 6-9, 2018, and responses are representative of the U.S. online population. Each survey targeted one of three age groups: 1) ages 18 to 34, 1,001 respondents; 2) ages 35 to 54, 1,001 respondents; and 3) age 55 and over, 1,003 respondents. An additional survey was conducted to target people who have no retirement savings and find out why. A screener question was used to collect responses only from 1,000 respondents who said they do not have retirement savings. Respondents were then asked, “Which of the following is the main reason you do not have any retirement savings?” Respondents could select one of the following answer options: 1) “I don’t make enough money to save”; 2) “I won’t need retirement savings”; 3) “I’m prioritizing paying down debt”; 4) “Job doesn’t offer a plan”; 5) “Struggling to pay bills”; or 6) “Used money for an emergency.” Responses were collected by a survey conducted Feb. 6-9, 2018, using Survata. Survata categorizes the ages of their respondents in the following groups: 1) 25 to 34, 2) 35 to 44, 3) 45 to 54, 4) 55 to 64, 5) 65 and over. ||||| The golden years are likely to be tarnished for nearly half the country. A new survey from GoBankingRates finds that 42% of Americans have saved 10,000 or less for retirement, while 14% have absolutely no money put away. It gets even worse for millennials. Nearly 19% of people between 18-34 have yet to save a single dollar for retirement, according to the site. The study of more than 1,000 adults found that the top reason for the paltry savings numbers was they simply didn’t earn enough to put money away. On the positive side, some 16% of the people surveyed said they have 300,000 or more set aside for retirement. And 10% say they have between 200,000 and 300,000. Men are more likely than women to have larger retirement account balances, the site found. Forty-five percent of women have no savings or 10,000 or less, versus 40% of men. That’s better than the past two years, though. In 2017, 58% of women had either no savings or less than 10,000. The previous year, that number was 63%. |||||","output":"A survey has found that many people in America haven't saved enough for their retirement. The website GoBankingRates.com discovered that 42% of Americans they asked have saved less than 10,000 for their retirement. In fact, 14% of Americans have no retirement savings at all, while 28% have less than 10,000 saved. The younger generation, known as millennials, were even less prepared. Nearly 60% of them have almost nothing saved for their old age. However, the results do show an improvement compared to last year's survey, where 55% of people had under 10,000 saved. One of the reasons people struggle to save is that they're unaware of options like individual retirement plans or 401k options at work. Remember, even small contributions to your retirement fund can add up over time, so it's important to start saving early."},{"instruction":"Where is Ayer 's rock ?

Unsaturated fats (e. g., vegetable oil) are considered healthier, while trans fats are to be avoided. Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as butter or lard), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as olive oil or flaxseed oil). Trans fats are very rare in nature, and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health, but have properties useful in the food processing industry, such as rancidity resistance.[citation needed] Although trans fats are harmful to human health, what property do they have that makes them useful in food processing?","output":"Trans fats possess several properties that make them useful in the food processing industry, despite their negative impact on human health: 1. Stability: Trans fats have a higher melting point and are more resistant to oxidation than unsaturated fats. This gives them increased stability, allowing them to maintain their structure and functionality even at higher temperatures and over a longer period. This added stability helps prolong the shelf life of processed food products, as it reduces the rate of degradation, spoilage, and development of off-flavors due to oxidation. 2. Texture and Consistency: Trans fats have a semi-solid nature at room temperature, which is a desirable quality in many food products, such as baked goods and spreads. They help provide a rich, smooth texture and a desirable mouthfeel, improving the overall sensory experience for the consumer. For instance, partially hydrogenated oils – a primary source of trans fats – have been extensively used in the production of margarine and commercial baked goods because they provide a buttery texture at a lower cost than natural alternatives. 3. Improved heat resistance: Trans fats can tolerate higher heat levels during the cooking and frying process. They are less likely to break down or produce smoke at high temperatures compared to unsaturated fats (like olive oil). This property makes them an attractive option for frying, as it results in a more durable and higher-performing fat, allowing it to be used multiple times while retaining its taste and quality. 4. Cost-effectiveness: Partially hydrogenated oils, which are a major source of trans fats, are derived from inexpensive vegetable oils. The process of hydrogenation adds hydrogen atoms to the carbon chains of unsaturated fats, converting them into more stable, semi-solid fats. This enables manufacturers to create a cost-effective replacement for more expensive options like butter, lard, or other animal-based fats, which also tend to have higher saturated fat content. Although trans fats offer these benefits in food processing, their detrimental effects on human health have prompted global efforts to reduce or eliminate their usage in the industry. Compelling evidence links trans fat consumption to increased risks of heart disease, inflammation, and other health-related issues. Steps have been taken to educate consumers, label trans fats content on products, and encourage the use of healthier fat alternatives, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated oils, to prioritize public health."},{"instruction":"If you want to set a romantic atmosphere you might light a candle where?

Was the temperature of the melted bag higher or lower than the temperature of the frozen bag? Susan went to the store to buy some bags of ice for a party she was having later in the day. When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted. Hint: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. The answer to this question is:","output":"The temperature of the melted bag was higher than the temperature of the frozen bag."},{"instruction":"Q:Article: It was a late Wednesday night when the dreading phone call reached our home. I sat up, somehow terrified, so I could hear the phone call better. To my surprise, I heard my mom burst into tears. \\"Get the car, Dean! Andrea has been in a car accident.\\" _ We got to the hospital, but were not allowed to see Andrea. The next morning, after wearing masks, we were allowed to go to the ICU to see Andrea. Well, the least I could say was that everything was injured in her body and she lost all of her memories. It was a fatal accident. Over the next two months, I lived more at the hospital than I did at my house. I watched as Andrea worked so hard to gain back everyday motor skills. She never once complained or pitied herself; her determined spirit was shining through. After two weeks in the ICU and two months of the regular hospital treatment, Andrea was able to come home. She missed several months of school, so it was hard for her to catch up. Andrea had tasks to accomplish, and no matter how hard it was, she stuck with them until the job was done. Though busy with dealing with pain and therapy, she always found time to love and play with me. I'll never forget the impact that this incident made on my life. I admire her strong-willed personality and her determined spirit. Today she is perfectly normal, despite the scars and the pins holding her leg in place.

Answer:","output":"2). Limestone. Most underground caves are formed by the action of water on limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the form of the mineral calcite. This type of rock forms in warm, shallow marine environments through the accumulation of the remains of marine organisms, like shells, corals, and marine plankton, along with other materials like sand, silt, and clay. The process of cave formation on limestone is called speleogenesis, and it occurs primarily through the chemical interaction between the slightly acidic water and the soluble limestone bedrock. When rainwater interacts with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or within the soil, it forms a weak carbonic acid (H2CO3). As the carbonic acid percolates through the ground, it comes into contact with the limestone and starts dissolving the calcium carbonate, creating a series of interconnected channels and cavities within the rock. Over time, these small channels expand due to the continuous action of the carbonic acid on the limestone, causing a larger-scale dissolution and gradually forming a network of underground passages and caves. The process can take thousands to millions of years, depending on factors like the acidity of the water, the density and purity of the limestone, and the availability of natural fractures and joints in the bedrock. Additionally, during the cave formation, groundwater rich in dissolved calcium carbonate flows through the cave's channels and cavities. When this water encounters a change in the subterranean environment like a drop in pressure or temperature, the dissolved minerals precipitate, forming various cave deposits called speleothems. Some common types of speleothems include stalactites (hanging from the ceiling), stalagmites (rising from the floor), and flowstones (formed along walls and floors). Caves can also form in other types of soluble rocks like gypsum and rock salt, but they are less common compared to limestone caves. The other rock types mentioned in the options, such as granite, sandstone, and shale, are not as soluble as limestone, and thus they don't typically form extensive cave systems. In conclusion, most underground caves are formed by the action of water on limestone, which is a soluble sedimentary rock. The process involves the dissolution of limestone by carbonic acid-rich water, leading to the formation of interconnected channels, cavities, and eventually large-scale cave systems."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

What do people in other countries think of America? What do people think of Americans?","output":"While the two questions share some similarities in that they pertain to the perception of the United States and its citizens, it is important to recognize the distinctions between the questions. The first question, \\"What do people in other countries think of America?\\", inquires about the perception of the United States as a country. This could encompass aspects such as the U.S. government, political landscape, foreign policy, economic power, culture, and various social issues. People's perceptions in this regard are influenced by their individual experiences, beliefs, and the media in their own countries. As a result, the opinions of people in different countries are quite diverse. However, they might have both positive and negative opinions about America as a country. For instance, some people in other countries may view the United States in a positive light due to its democratic principles, cultural exports like Hollywood movies and music, and advances in technology and innovation. They might also admire the entrepreneurial spirit of the country or the American dream that represents endless opportunities for individuals to achieve success through perseverance and hard work. On the other hand, some individuals, particularly in countries whose relations with the U.S. have historically been tense, may harbor negative perceptions about America. These negative perceptions could stem from disagreement with American foreign policy, concerns over American hegemony, the spread of American popular culture, or the country's socio-political issues that are frequently reported by international media. The second question, \\"What do people think of Americans?\\", focuses on the perception of individual American people, or more specifically, the stereotypes associated with American citizens. Once again, opinions are bound to vary greatly depending on an individual's location, experience, and personal beliefs. However, some of the commonly perceived characteristics of Americans are friendly, outgoing, and individualistic. Positive stereotypes of Americans might include their perceived helpfulness, openness to new ideas, and generosity. The United States is known for being a melting pot of cultures, which could contribute to the stereotype of Americans being open-minded and adaptable. Furthermore, Americans are often seen as hardworking and ambitious, which can be both inspiring and intimidating to others. Nevertheless, there are also negative stereotypes associated with Americans. They may be seen as ethnocentric, ignorant about other cultures or world affairs, and overly materialistic. Additionally, some people might perceive Americans as loud, arrogant, or overly patriotic. In conclusion, although the two questions share similarities in that they both examine perceptions about the United States and its citizens, they ask about distinct aspects: the perception of America as a country and the perception of individual Americans."},{"instruction":"Read this article and answer this question In 1572, the throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, at the time the largest and one of the most populous states in Europe, was vacated when King Sigismund II of Poland died without heirs. The Sejm was given the power to elect a new king, and in the Polish-Lithuanian royal election, 1573 chose Henry of France; Henry soon ascended the French throne and forfeited the Polish one by returning to France. Báthory decided to enter into the election; in the meantime he had to defeat another attempt by Bekes to challenge his authority in Transylvania, which he did by defeating Bekes at the Battle of Sinpaul. On 12 December 1575, after an interregnum of roughly one and a half years, primate of Poland Jakub Uchański, representing a pro-Habsburg faction, declared Emperor Maximilian II as the new monarch. However, chancellor Jan Zamoyski and other opponents of Habsburgs persuaded many of the lesser nobility to demand a Piast king, a Polish king. After a heated discussion, it was decided that Anna Jagiellon, sister of the former King Sigismund II Augustus, should be elected King of Poland and marry Stephen Báthory. In January 1576 Báthory passed the mantle of Voivode of Transylvania to his brother Christopher Báthory and departed for Poland. On 1 May 1576 Báthory married Anna and was crowned King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania.

Laura Clark. and Andrew Levy. and Geraldine Hackett. The founder of a chain of academies who raised funds for the Archbishop of Canterbury has been investigated over ‘highly unusual’ payments. Officials highlighted a series of dubious financial practices at 16 schools set up by Sir Ewan Harper in the Education Fellowship Trust. These included £90,000 paid to himself and £28,000 to his wife Jane. Department for Education officials who investigated the group of 16 academies - the Education Fellowship Trust (EFT) - also criticised £45,000 expenses awarded in a year to just two governors, a £20,000 fact-finding trip to New York and excessive spending on hotels, meals and alcoholic drinks. Dubious: Payments from the Education Fellowship Trust included £28,000 in rent of office space in Titchmarsh, near Kettering, (pictured) to the wife of founder Sir Ewan Harper. Further concerns were raised over family members being given unadvertised jobs - including a director of communications on £70,000-a-year - while £1,000 was spent on Christmas cards and £630 on customised umbrellas. The EFT admitted that wine was purchased for a workshop with head teachers - as part of a training exercise designed to show that children, like grapes, can mature into ‘exceptional wines’ given the right nurturing or merely end up as ‘plonk’. Sir Ewan’s links both to education and the Church of England stretch back decades. He was tutored at Cambridge by Robert Runcie, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. In the 1980s, he helped set up the Lambeth Fund, which raises funds to support past and present Archbishops of Canterbury. Marlborough-educated Sir Ewan, 74, was knighted in 2003 for services to the Church of England, having been recommended by another former Archbishop, George Carey. Commended: Sir Ewan Harper was knighted in 2003 for services to the Church of England, having been recommended by former Archbishop, George Carey (pictured) Before founding the EFT, he led the United Learning Trust - one of the biggest backers of academy and independent schools in the country. A former businessman, he ran the family’s export firm, which he later sold. Sir Ewan became chairman of the Lambeth Fund in 2011 but retired in March. The EFT said he had also now retired from the trust. Officials from the DfE’s Education Funding Agency probed financial practices at the EFT after a review of 2012/13 accounts highlighted ‘highly unusual’ payments. These included nearly £28,000 in rent and insurance premiums to Lady Jane Harper, who is listed as owning cottages which the trust uses as an office. In a report, the agency said there was evidence ‘that the lease rental was a fair market price from an estate agent’ and that alternative premises were checked. ‘However there was no documented evidence provided to record the outcome of the inspections or the basis for the final decision to lease the current accommodation,’ it said. Checks by the Daily Mail revealed the two grade II listed stone cottages with thatched roofs under Lady Jane Harper’s name were leased to the EFT after failed attempts to find a private residential tenant. Official documents from East Northamptonshire Council show they were used by the United Learning Trust - the schools chain Sir Ewan previously headed - until it moved to larger premises. Internal changes were made to make it suitable for residential use and it was put on the market through a letting agent in September 2011. The council documents state: ‘As of 16th December no tenant had been found. ‘The applicant’s husband discovered the need to use the building as an office once again for his personal business.’ Another cottage in the same lane in the picture postcard village of Titchmarsh, near Kettering, is registered to Lady Jane Harper. All the properties are next to the couple’s home, which is in both their names and was valued at £1 million in 2010. It is hidden at the end of a long gravel driveway and is set in extensive landscaped grounds with a swimming pool. A woman who answered the door of the cottages said they were still being used by the EFT. The Government probe also raised concerns about £90,000 awarded to Sir Ewan as chairman of the trust - as well as ‘transactions with companies in which the chairman has a controlling interest’. The trust said £90,000 was paid to Sir Ewan because he was also chief executive at the time. But the investigation found that Sir Ewan was forbidden from holding both roles under trust rules. The trust, which has a turnover of £10million per year and lists 16 member schools on its website, was found to have committed ‘significant breaches of the Companies Act 2006, Charity Commission regulations and the Academies Financial Handbook’. A report on the findings, which is redacted in places, makes 26 separate recommendations. It highlights a series of questionable uses of public money including a £20,000 trip to New York by a group of heads. The report said it may not have been ‘the best use of public funds’. Expenses exposed: The Education Fellowship Trust runs a chain of 16 academies (stock image) Two governors ‘claimed £45,000 in expenses and other supplies and services’ while one academy in the group suffered a £38,000 fraud because IT security software was not up-to-date, enabling a transfer out of its bank account. The money is reportedly being reimbursed by the bank. The report also highlights that expenses policy allowed for ‘moderate consumption of alcohol’ - even though alcohol spending is considered an ‘improper use of public funds’. ‘A number of claims were made that included the purchase of alcohol,’ the report said. Meals and hotels were also claimed ‘in excess of the staff expenses policy’. Concern was also raised over unadvertised posts for family members. ‘We found that a number of the appointed head office staff were family members of either trustees or senior members of staff,’ said the report. There had been no ‘competition or advertising’ of the posts, which included a director of communication at a salary of £70,000 per year plus benefits. Meanwhile a finance manager had been appointed on £100 an hour with no formal tender for the work. It was ‘questionable’ whether this was value for money, said the report. More than half of secondary schools - and growing numbers of primaries - now have academy status which allows them to operate outside local council control. But there have been a series of financial scandals involving some of the groups which run academies, leading to calls for tighter controls. The agency issued the trust with a financial notice to improve. A spokesman for the EFT said: ‘The EFA are very clear that all issues found are from pre-September - before significant structural changes were made and Johnson Kane was appointed as CEO. ‘The Fellowship had already commenced on change of policies and governance in November 2013, before the review took place. ‘The EFA acknowledged to The Fellowship that it was under a different structure and clear evidence was showing that there was a positive change in the operation since September 2013.’ Sir Ewan wasn’t available to comment and his wife refused to comment when approached at their home. ‘I haven’t got time,’ she said. Lambeth Palace said Sir Ewan retired as chairman of the Lambeth Fund on March 31 as part of a ‘planned transition’. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘The EFA has undertaken a financial review on The Education Fellowship and is working with them to agree an action plan to address the issues raised. We have issued the Trust with a Financial Notice to Improve and if they do not take the necessary steps, we will not hesitate to take further action. ‘Academies operate under a strict system of oversight and accountability - more robust than in council-run schools - which means any issues are identified and that we can take swift action to address them.’","output":"The founder of a chain of academies, Sir Ewan Harper, has been investigated for \\"highly unusual\\" payments in the Education Fellowship Trust.

Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men.

In this sentence, the word \\"fakat\\" means \\"but,\\" emphasizing the contrast introduced by the situation of falling revenues. \\"Düşen\\" means \\"plunging\\" or \\"decreasing\\" and implies a significant reduction in the income generated by oil and gas. The word \\"gelirleri\\" means \\"revenues,\\" referring to the profit or earnings derived from the sale of these resources. The word \\"etkileyebilir\\" is a verb and means \\"might affect.\\" It suggests a possibility, indicating that the impact on Russia's willingness is uncertain but worth considering. The phrase \\"Rusya'nın bunu yapmaya istekli olmasını\\" refers to \\"Russia's willingness to do so.\\" The word \\"Rusya'nın\\" is the possessive form of \\"Russia\\" and is used here to emphasize the impact on its eagerness or motivation. \\"Bunu yapmaya istekli olmasını\\" means \\"willingness to do so,\\" with \\"istekli\\" representing the idea of being eager or willing, and \\"olmasını\\" showing intention, desire, or possibility. In conclusion, the translated sentence – \\"Fakat düşen petrol ve doğalgaz gelirleri, Rusya'nın bunu yapmaya istekli olmasını etkileyebilir.\\" – effectively communicates the potential effect of plunging oil and gas revenues on Russia's willingness to take specific actions or measures in Turkish."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: Like what? illegal shit?

The first task is to understand the sentence contextually. It seems to be a statement of support, indicating that this person will continue to support their 'hero' regardless of criticism or negative attacks. 2. Now, let's break down the sentence for translation starting with the phrase 'And this person'. In Czech, this translates to 'A tato osoba'. 3. 'For one' is a phrase usually utilized in English, indicating a sense of breaking down count or emphasizing an individual opinion. In Czech, we can use 'alespoň jedna' to reflect this sense. 4. Using 'is gonna' to say 'will' in English is informal. To make the sentence more standard Czech, I opted for 'bude', the future tense of the verb 'to be'. 5. The phrase 'stand by her hero' in Czech could be translated as 'stát po boku svého hrdiny'. In Czech, we use 'po boku' to indicate the English equivalent of 'stand by'. 6. 'No matter how much' can be translated as 'bez ohledu na to, kolik'. 7. 'Mud they sling' is an English idiom, suggesting criticism or negative attacks. The closest equivalent in Czech could be 'bahna na něho hodí' which literally means 'mud they throw at him'.

At all. \\"During pregnancy: no amount of alcohol intake should be considered safe; there is no safe trimester to drink alcohol; [and] all forms of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and liquor, pose similar risk,\\" the study states. That's because, researchers explain in a press release, alcohol intake while pregnant can result in a wide array of problems from growth retardation to developmental delays and learning disabilities to problems with the brain, heart, bones and spine, kidneys, vision, or hearing. Dr. Janet F. Williams, one of the lead researchers, tells Live Science that much attention is paid to fetal alcohol syndrome—but even if your child doesn't get that, he hasn't necessarily escaped scot-free. In fact, there are any number of so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders that are linked to drinking while pregnant, and any time a child experiences a delay or a behavioral disorder, she explains, an FASD could be to blame—but FASDs are more difficult to diagnose than FAS. The new study points out that more than three decades of research links alcohol intake while pregnant with birth defects, she says, far more than any evidence suggesting it's no big deal. The bottom line, she says: \\"No alcohol use during pregnancy guarantees that fetal alcohol spectrum disorders will not occur.\\" (But at least you don't have to worry too much about drinking while breastfeeding.) Expand this summary.","output":"Okay little buddy, let me explain this to you. Doctors and researchers have been looking into whether it's safe for pregnant women to drink any alcohol.

After lots of studying, the big doctor group called the American Academy of Pediatrics says that pregnant women should not drink any alcohol at all. It doesn't matter if it's just a little bit, or which kind of alcoholic drink it is – it's all risky for the baby. Drinking alcohol when pregnant can cause problems for the baby, like growing too slow, having a hard time learning things, or having issues with their body parts like their brain, heart, and bones. Even if a child looks okay when they're born, they might have problems later in life because of their mommy drinking alcohol during pregnancy. So, to make sure babies stay healthy and don't have these problems, mommies should not drink alcohol while they're pregnant.

Here is a question with a factual answer: Question: What is the significance of the Rosetta Stone in understanding ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics? Answer: The Rosetta Stone is an ancient slab of black basalt inscribed with a decree issued by King Ptolemy V in 196 BCE. It is incredibly significant in understanding ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics because it features the same text written in three different scripts: Egyptian hieroglyphics, Egyptian Demotic script, and ancient Greek. Before the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, scholars had limited knowledge of how to read or interpret hieroglyphics. Egyptian hieroglyphic writing dates back to around 3200 BCE and was primarily used for religious and monumental inscriptions, while the Demotic script was most commonly used for everyday purposes. Because the same message inscribed on the Rosetta Stone was written in ancient Greek—a language understood by scholars at the time of its discovery—it became the key to unlocking the meaning of hieroglyphics. The Rosetta Stone was discovered in 1799 by a French soldier named Pierre-François Bouchard during Napoleon Bonaparte's military expedition in Egypt. The stone was eventually seized by the British as part of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801 and has been housed in the British Museum since 1802. The breakthrough in deciphering hieroglyphics came from a French scholar named Jean-François Champollion in 1822. He built upon earlier work by scholars like Thomas Young and meticulously studied the symbols on the stone. By comparing the three scripts on the Rosetta Stone and taking advantage of his knowledge of ancient Greek, Coptic, and various other languages, Champollion was able to establish a basic understanding of the hieroglyphic script. This crucial breakthrough enabled scholars to translate and understand countless other Egyptian texts, offering invaluable insights into the culture, history, and religious beliefs of ancient Egypt."},{"instruction":"I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem. According to the above context, answer the following question. The author's trip to Vegas probably lasted how long: Pick your answer from: + about 2 days + not enough information + about a week + about a month The answer is:","output":"not enough information"},{"instruction":"Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The newspaper seller was a clean, neat man, of about forty with a rather serious, unsmiling face. He didn't speak much to the customers or to his helpers, but when he did he spoke slowly and quietly, as if to himself. He believed in efficiency, not conversation. And this was how the office workers, rushing to catch their trains, preferred it. It had been a good day. Lunch-time had been warm and sunny, and many people had bought magazines to read outside with their sandwiches. Now it was cold and rainy, and people wanted an evening paper for a cheerless journey ahead and a dull evening indoors. At 6:30, with the main rush over, he started to collect the money together and count it. Then he left the stand and went home. It was the assistant's turn this evening to look after it till eight o'clock, when it would be packed away for the night. His large white Mercedes was in the private car park of a large prefix = st1 /GovernmentBuilding. He'd parked there for six months, pretending to be part of a heating firm working in the building. They would find out about him soon, and he'd have to park in a garage again, which was annoying. Their charges were far too high. A couple of junior clerks, regular customers, happened to see him getting into his car. \\"Must be a lot of money in papers, eh?\\" one of them shouted. He just smiled coldly in reply, and got into the car, placing the bags of money on the floor. He thought about the clerks on the way home. Like the majority of his customers, despite their white shirts and dark suits, they probably made in a week as much as he could make in a good day.

Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. - In chemistry, pH (potential of hydrogen) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions. More precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Pure water is neutral, at pH 7, being neither an acid nor a base. Contrary to popular belief, the pH value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then: - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation. - Sunset Yellow FCF ( also known as Orange Yellow S , or C.I. 15985 ) is a petroleum - derived orange azo dye with a pH dependent maximum absorption at about 480 nm at pH 1 and 443 nm at pH 13 with a shoulder at 500 nm . When added to foods sold in the US it is known as FD&C Yellow 6 ; when sold in Europe , it is denoted by E Number E110 . - Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions, separating chemical compounds by their boiling point by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the compound will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used. - A hydrogen ion is created when a hydrogen atom loses or gains an electron. A lone positively charged hydrogen ion (or proton) can readily combine with other particles and therefore is only seen isolated when it is in a gaseous state or a nearly particle free space. Due to its extremely high charge density of approximately 2×10 times that of a sodium ion, the bare hydrogen ion cannot exist freely in solution as it readily hydrates, i.e., bonds quickly. The hydrogen ion is recommended by IUPAC as a general term for all ions of hydrogen and its isotopes. Depending on the charge of the ion, two different classes can be distinguished: positively charged ions and negatively charged ions. - Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction. - A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. - A mordant or dye fixative is a substance used to set dyes on fabrics or tissue sections by forming a coordination complex with the dye which then attaches to the fabric or tissue. It may be used for dyeing fabrics, or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. The term mordant comes from the present participle of French \\"mordre\\", \\"to bite\\". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion. The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline. - Molar concentration, also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration, is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, or of any chemical species, in terms of amount of substance in a given volume. A commonly used unit for molar concentration used in chemistry is mol/L. A solution of concentration 1 mol/L is also denoted as 1 molar (1 ). - A dye is a colored substance that has an affinity to the substrate to which it is being applied. The dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution, and may require a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Oleum (Latin \\"oleum\\" = \\"oil\\"), or fuming sulfuric acid, is a solution of various compositions of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid, or sometimes more specifically to disulfuric acid (also known as pyrosulfuric acid). Oleum is idenfied by the CAS number 8014-95-7. - In computer science, ACID (\\"Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability\\") is a set of properties of database transactions. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction. - E numbers are codes for substances that are permitted to be used as food additives for use within the European Union and Switzerland. The \\"E\\" stands for \\"Europe\\". Commonly found on food labels, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the agency of the European Union (EU) that provides independent scientific advice and communicates on existing and emerging risks associated with the food chain.

Find two strong trees: Look for two trees that are about the same height and close enough that your hammock can stretch between them. Make sure there are no sharp branches or anything that could hurt you. 2. Measure the distance: Make sure the trees are not too close or too far apart. The distance should be around 10 to 15 feet (about 3 to 5 big steps) for most hammocks. 3. Get strong ropes: You need some rope or straps to tie the hammock to the trees. Make sure they are strong and long enough to go around the trees. 4. Tie the ropes: Wrap the rope or strap around each tree trunk, about 4-5 feet high from the ground. Tie a strong and safe knot, like a bowline knot or a figure-eight loop. 5. Attach the hammock: Take the ends of your hammock and hook them to the ropes or straps on each tree. Make sure everything feels secure, and the hammock is not too tight or too loose. 6. Test it out: Gently sit on the hammock and see if it holds your weight and feels comfortable.

People dying: As stated earlier, the direct impact of war is people dying, which is one of the most significant and tragic consequences of war. 4. Evil: War can be viewed as evil due to the destruction, violence, and death it brings. Some people believe that wars are inherently wrong, while others argue that some wars may be necessary or justifiable under certain circumstances. 5. A party: This is not an accurate description of waging war, as it does not reflect the serious nature and consequences of armed conflict. Step-by-step reasoning: Given the options provided, waging war is often considered to be suffering, killing people, people dying, and evil due to the immense physical, emotional, and psychological impact it has on those affected. It is not considered to be a party, as war is not a celebratory or enjoyable event."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Seneca white deer live in the confines of the Army Depot that was officially shut down in what year? A:","output":"The Seneca White Deer are a unique herd of deer that inhabit the former Seneca Army Depot in Seneca County, New York. This location is intriguing, not just for the presence of the unique and beautiful deer, but also some significant historical context. The Seneca Army Depot was a munitions storage and disposal facility operated by the United States Army from 1941 until its official closure. Throughout its tenure, the depot's primary function was to store and dispose of World War II ordnance. Its use was extended during the Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Cold War. Over time, its relevance declined and discussions regarding the installation's future led to its eventual closure. The official shutdown of the depot took place in 2000. This was a result of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission's suggestion in 1995. The Commission was responsible for determining the military installations that could be closed without compromising the country's defense capacity. The recommendation led to a five-year phase-out plan that culminated in the closure in 2000. Interestingly, the Seneca White Deer managed to thrive within this protected zone. A strange combination of circumstances produced this rare herd, guarded and enclosed by the 24-mile-long fence erected around the depot. Here, a population of White-tailed deer exhibiting leucism, a genetic trait that results in white fur, multiplied due to their guarded environment and absence of predation. After the depot's shutdown, concerns grew over the fate of these deer. Significant efforts have been made to preserve and study this unique group. In fact, it led to the establishment of the Seneca White Deer Inc., a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving the world's largest herd of white, white-tailed deer and the unique habitat of the decommissioned army depot. This location is now a tourist attraction, allowing visitors to witness the stark white deer in their natural habitat. The complex is also home to a cold war museum that educates about the depot's history. It's a fantastic example of how nature can reclaim and flourish in human-made environments when given a chance."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"La vida es como una montaña rusa, llena de altos y bajos, emociones intensas y momentos de tranquilidad, pero siempre avanzando hacia delante.

A:","output":"The American comedy-drama that featured Emily Kuroda in the role of Mrs. Kim is \\"Gilmore Girls.\\" First premiering on October 5, 2000, on The WB, the critically acclaimed series was created by Amy Sherman-Palladino and lasted for seven seasons, concluding in May 2007. Later, a subsequent limited revival of the show, titled \\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\\" aired in 2016 on Netflix. \\"Gilmore Girls\\" follows the unconventional and closely bonded relationship between Lorelai Gilmore (played by Lauren Graham) and her teenage daughter Rory (played by Alexis Bledel) in the fictional small town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The show's unique blend of fast-paced dialogue, witty humor, and heartfelt emotional moments earned it a dedicated fan base over the years. Emily Kuroda was a recurring character throughout the series as Mrs. Kim, the strict, no-nonsense, and devoutly religious mother of Lane Kim (played by Keiko Agena), who is Rory's best friend. Mrs. Kim owns an antique shop, and her character serves as both a foil and source of comic relief due to her strict adherence to traditional Korean customs and values. She often clashes with her daughter Lane, who dreams of pursuing a career in music. Over time, their relationship evolves, and Mrs. Kim reluctantly supports her daughter's ambitions. Kuroda's portrayal of Mrs. Kim became a memorable and beloved character in the series, as she skillfully balanced the character's intimidating presence, cultural values, and occasional displays of genuine love and support for her daughter and friends. The dynamic of the Kim family added diversity to the show and allowed \\"Gilmore Girls\\" to explore themes of generational and cultural gaps within families."},{"instruction":"Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

This is the Belasco House, the \\"Mount Everest of haunted houses\\", originally owned by the notorious \\"Roaring Giant\\" Emeric Belasco, a six-foot-five perverted millionaire and supposed murderer, who disappeared soon after a massacre at his home. The house is believed to be haunted by numerous spirits, the victims of Belasco's twisted and sadistic desires. Accompanying Barrett are his wife, Ann, as well as two mediums: a mental medium and Spiritualist minister, Florence Tanner, and a physical medium, Ben Fischer, who is the only survivor of an investigation 20 years previously. The rationalist Barrett is rudely sceptical of Tanner's belief in \\"surviving personalities\\", spirits which haunt the physical world, and he asserts that there is nothing but unfocused electromagnetic energy in the house. Barrett brings a machine he has developed, which he believes will rid the house of this energy. Though not a physical medium, Tanner begins to manifest physical phenomena inside the house. When, after a quarrel with Tanner, Barrett is attacked by invisible forces, he suspects that Tanner may be using the house's energy against him. Meanwhile, Fischer remains aloof, with his mind closed to the house's influence, and is only there to collect the generous paycheck.

Matthew was removing the excess cancerous tissue with a scalpel from Jeffrey because","output":"Matthew was removing the excess cancerous tissue with a scalpel from Jeffrey because he was a skilled and experienced surgical oncologist, committed to providing the best possible treatment for his patients. Jeffrey, who had been recently diagnosed with a malignant growth, had decided to undergo surgery as the primary treatment option for his condition, understanding the risks and benefits involved. Jeffrey's decision was based on a thorough evaluation of his condition, including tests and consultations with medical professionals. He understood that the cancer had grown beyond the confines of the primary tumor, necessitating the removal of excess tissue in order to maximize the chances of a complete recovery. Moreover, by removing the cancerous tissue, the surgery could potentially alleviate the symptoms he was experiencing, such as pain, discomfort, and impaired function in the affected area. Matthew’s expertise in the field meant that he was well-equipped to perform the surgery. His knowledge of cancer's complex nature, its propensity for spreading, and the importance of removing cancerous tissue with precision and care all contributed to his ability to perform this delicate procedure. With years of experience and countless successful surgeries under his belt, Matthew was able to navigate the multitude of variables involved in such a procedure and deliver the best possible outcome for his patient. During the surgery, Matthew would likely employ various techniques to minimize the risk of complications and ensure the best outcome for Jeffrey. These would include using advanced imaging methods to obtain a clear and precise image of the tumor and surrounding tissues, then meticulously dissecting the excess tissue while taking care to minimize damage to surrounding healthy structures. His surgical team would also be closely monitoring Jeffrey's vital signs and providing necessary support, ensuring a safe and successful procedure. Once properly removed, the excised tissue would be sent to the pathology lab for further examination. This would enable the oncologist to ensure that all the cancerous cells in the area were effectively removed and give insight into any potential follow-up treatments that might be needed, like chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Furthermore, analysis of the tissue sample could provide valuable information to help guide decisions regarding future treatment options, prognosis, and postoperative care for Jeffrey. In summary, Matthew was removing the excess cancerous tissue with a scalpel from Jeffrey because, as a dedicated and skilled surgical oncologist, he was striving to give his patient the best possible chance for a complete recovery. The aim of the surgery was to reduce symptoms, prevent further cancer spread, and ultimately improve Jeffrey's quality of life. Through careful planning, precision, and postoperative care, they hoped to achieve the best possible outcome in Jeffrey's battle against cancer."},{"instruction":"Question.

Options: (A) 22 yrs (B) 34 yrs (C) 27 yrs (D) 28 yrs (E) 19 yrs Answer. (B) What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","output":"To justify the answer, let's go through the given information and solve the problem step by step. Step 1: Understand the problem We have a district level hockey team of 11 players with an average age of 22 years. When the coach's age is included, the average age increases by 1 year. Our goal is to find the coach's age. Step 2: Calculate the total age of the 11 hockey players Since the average age of the team is 22 years, we can find the total age of the players by multiplying the average by the number of players: Total age of players = (Average age) x (Number of players) = 22 x 11 = 242 years Step 3: Determine the new average age when the coach is included The average age with the coach included gets increased by 1 year, so the new average age is: New average age = Previous average age + increase = 22 + 1 = 23 years Step 4: Calculate the total age of the players and the coach Now we have 11 players plus 1 coach, so 12 people in total. We can find the total age of this group by multiplying the new average age by 12: Total age of players and coach = (New average age) x (Number of people) = 23 x 12 = 276 years Step 5: Find the coach's age Finally, to find the coach's age, we can subtract the total age of the 11 players from the total age of the players and the coach: Coach's age = Total age of players and coach - Total age of players = 276 - 242 = 34 years So, the answer is (B) 34 years."},{"instruction":"Same meaning?

There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being immediately by killing masses of cells in vital organs. But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no levels of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed immediately. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years. This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the victim being aware at the time that damage has occurred.

Given the context: How would you describe Casey? Answer:","output":"Casey can be described as an individual who is open-minded, introspective, and spiritually inclined. Her decision to convert to Christianity after hearing the priest speak indicates a willingness to consider different perspectives and a capability for self-reflection. In this context, we can also analyze different aspects of her character in a more detailed manner. 1. Open-minded: Casey's openness to the priest's message shows that she is receptive to new ideas and beliefs. This ability to be open to new concepts reflects a quality of acceptance and adaptability in her character. It demonstrates her willingness to engage in conversations that challenge her existing beliefs and encourages personal growth and self-improvement. 2. Curious: Her interest in the priest's message and the subsequent choice to convert indicates a curious nature. She sought a deeper understanding of Christianity and was responsive to the ideas and values presented by the priest. This curiosity could stem from a desire for intellectual growth and an eagerness to explore new belief systems to enhance her worldview. 3. Introspective: By deciding to convert to Christianity, Casey exhibits a degree of introspection, as she may have had to critically evaluate her own beliefs, values, and spiritual needs. This thoughtful examination of oneself shows a self-awareness and emotional maturity that drives her choices and actions. 4. Spiritually inclined: Casey's encounter with the priest and her decision to convert showcases her spiritual inclinations. Whether she had previous religious beliefs or was searching for a spiritual path, her receptiveness to the priest's teachings and her desire to pursue Christian beliefs highlight her spiritual nature and commitment to faith. 5. Impressionable: Although it is admirable that Casey was responsive to the priest's teachings, it is also possible that she could be viewed as impressionable. She may be easily swayed by others or moved by powerful speakers and messages. However, this trait could also be interpreted as a sign of humility and respect for the experiences and wisdom imparted by others. 6. Courageous: Changing one's religious beliefs or converting to a new faith can be a challenging and daunting experience. It often requires confronting ingrained beliefs and possibly even facing social stigmatization or familial opposition. By embracing Christianity, Casey demonstrates courage and a strong resolve to honor her newfound convictions. In conclusion, Casey's conversion to Christianity after hearing the priest speak suggests that she is an open-minded, introspective, spiritually inclined, curious, impressionable, and courageous individual. These traits all play a role in her willingness to explore new belief systems and ultimately make a life-changing decision based on her personal experiences and spiritual needs."},{"instruction":"How is \\"You get the other half when you pick me up.\\" said in Czech?","output":"To translate the phrase \\"You get the other half when you pick me up\\" into Czech, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the main components of the sentence, including nouns, verbs, and prepositions. \\"You get the other half\\" - Subject: You - Verb: Get - Noun: The other half \\"When you pick me up\\" - Conjunction: When - Subject: You - Verb: Pick up - Object: Me Step 2: Translate each component into Czech. \\"You\\": \\"Ty\\" \\"Get\\": \\"dostaneš\\" \\"The other half\\": \\"druhou polovinu\\" \\"When\\": \\"když\\" \\"Pick up\\": \\"vyzvedneš\\" \\"Me\\": \\"mě\\" Step 3: Arrange the translated components in a way that follows Czech grammar rules, which may differ from English grammar rules. \\"Dostaneš druhou polovinu, když mě vyzvedneš.\\" Step 4: Review the translation for errors or unnatural-sounding phrases.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"This review can be seen as depicting the product in both a flattering and unflattering light, depending on the aspect of the product being considered. The review addresses two main points: the yogurt maker's functionality and its price. It is important to analyze each aspect separately to fully understand the reviewer's perspective on the product. 1. Functionality: The reviewer states that the yogurt maker \\"works great,\\" which is a positive and flattering comment. This implies that the product is effective in making yogurt, does what it's intended to do, and satisfies the user in terms of its primary purpose. Based on this aspect, one could argue that the review shows the product in a favorable and positive light. 2. Price: On the other hand, the reviewer is extremely critical of the current price of the yogurt maker, saying that they \\"would never ever pay 180 for a little plastic container\\" and that \\"THE PRICE IS NOT REALISTIC!\\" The use of exclamation points, capitalization, and strong language emphasizes their displeasure with the product's pricing. In terms of the price, the review depicts the product in an unflattering and negative light. To summarize, the review can be seen as mixed, as it features both flattering comments regarding the functionality of the yogurt maker and unflattering criticism of its price. While the product appears to work well and serves its purpose, the reviewer finds it to be significantly overpriced, which negatively impacts their overall impression of the yogurt maker.

Hong Kong police said late Monday that Lee Bo's wife canceled the report, but added they would continue investigating the other cases. They didn't say whether Lee had been located. Protesters hold up missing person notices of the missing Hong Kong booksellers, as they walk towards China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong on Sunday. ANTHONY WALLACE / AFP - Getty Images Lee and four other people associated with publisher Mighty Current, which specializes in books critical of China's Communist Party leaders, have vanished in recent months. Their disappearances have prompted fears that Beijing is eroding the \\"one country, two systems principle\\" that's been in place since Britain ceded control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, granting the city civil liberties nonexistent on the mainland, including freedom of the press. When Lee vanished last Wednesday, he reportedly did not have his travel permit for mainland China with him, triggering speculation that Chinese security agents entered Hong Kong to abduct and spirit him there. An image of Lee's handwritten letter was first published by Taiwan's government-affiliated Central News Agency late Monday. The letter, faxed to an employee at the publishing company's Causeway Bay Bookstore, said: \\"Due to some urgent matters that I need to handle and that aren't to be revealed to the public, I have made way own way back to the mainland in order to cooperate with the investigation by relevant parties.\\" It added: \\"It might take a bit of time. My current situation is very well. All is normal.\\" The letter gave no further details. Local media reported that Lee's wife, Choi Ka-ping, asked police to drop the missing person's report after learning of the letter, the authenticity of which could not be independently confirmed. Police walk past missing person notices of Gui Minhai (left), one of five missing booksellers from the Mighty Current publishing house, and Yau Wentian (right), a Hong Kong publisher who was last year jailed for 10 years while preparing to release a book critical of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Anthony Wallace / AFP - Getty Images Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers and human rights activists were skeptical the letter proved Lee was safe. \\"If he did indeed write the letter, it was almost certainly written under duress,\\" said William Nee, Amnesty International's China researcher. \\"What we see in mainland China all the time is that police and state security put enormous pressure on family members not to speak to media and not to raise a fuss on social media.\\" China's nationalist newspaper Global Times slammed the bookshop in an editorial Monday for \\"profiting on political rumors\\" and selling books with \\"trumped-up content.\\" Hong Kong police still have missing person's files open for three other staff members or shareholders of the publisher or the bookstore. A fifth person, Gui Minhai, a Swedish national who is one of the company's owners, went missing in Thailand in October, according to Hong Kong media and human rights groups. Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joakim Edvardsson said Monday that the government was \\"very concerned\\" that a Swedish national had disappeared. He declined to name the person, in line with Foreign Ministry policy, but said he was in his 50s. Britain said that it was \\"deeply concerned\\" by reports of the disappearance and possible detention of one of its nationals. But speaking to reporters at a joint press conference with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who is in Beijing on a two-day trip, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on others not to make \\"groundless accusations\\" on the case. ||||| A pro-democracy demonstrator burns a letter next to pictures of missing staff members of a publishing house and a bookstore, including Gui Minhai, a China-born Swedish national who is the owner of Mighty Current, Cheung Jiping, the business manager of the publishing house... REUTERS/Tyrone Siu BEIJING Britain said on Tuesday that it was \\"deeply concerned\\" by reports of the disappearance and possible detention of five Hong Kong booksellers specializing in publications critical of China, one of whom is British, and urged the city's commitment to press freedom. A spokesperson for the British embassy in Beijing called on authorities in Hong Kong, a former British colony, and China to ascertain its citizen's welfare and whereabouts. It did not identify the person. \\"We are deeply concerned by reports about the disappearance and detention of individuals associated with the Causeway Bay Books bookstore in Hong Kong,\\" said the spokesperson, according to a statement from the British embassy in Beijing. \\"We encourage the Hong Kong SAR government to honor its commitment to protecting the freedom of the press, and we hope the Chinese authorities will continue to make every effort to ensure that the environment in which the media and publishers operate in the Hong Kong SAR supports full and frank reporting.\\" The remarks, referring to the \\"special administrative region\\" (SAR) of Hong Kong, came as British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond began his two-day visit to China and after China's foreign ministry warned that it would not tolerate outside interference in the affairs of Hong Kong. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of wide-ranging autonomy and an independent judiciary and media under a \\"one country, two systems\\" formula. Lee Bo, 65, a shareholder of Causeway Bay Books, \\"vanished\\" last week, according to a missing person report filed by Lee's wife on Thursday. Four associates involved in publishing or selling literature critical of Beijing have also gone missing in mysterious circumstances over the past few months. The disappearances have stoked fears of mainland Chinese authorities using shadowy tactics that erode the \\"one country, two systems\\" formula under which Hong Kong returned to China. Asked about the possibility of several of the booksellers holding British passports, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that \\"Hong Kong is China's domestic affair\\". \\"No foreign country has the right to interfere,\\" she said at a daily news briefing. She said that \\"any Hong Kong residents of Chinese descent born in Chinese territory, including Hong Kong people,\\" were Chinese citizens. Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying said on Monday there was no indication so far outside agents were involved in the disappearance of the booksellers, but that it would be \\"unacceptable\\" if any were. (Writing By Sui-Lee Wee; Editing by Nick Macfie) ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption (L to R) Gui Minhai, Cheung Jiping and Paul Lee, whose pictures were held up by protesters on Sunday, have gone missing in recent days When four associates of the Causeway Bay Bookstore went missing last October, it was their colleague, Paul Lee who raised the alarm. Mr Lee, who along with his wife, is a shareholder in the bookstore and the publishing house that owns it, took charge of briefing journalists, dealing with advocacy groups and speaking with law enforcement officials. At the time, he told me he felt safe in Hong Kong. Besides avoiding travel to the mainland, he made few changes to his routine. And tucked away on the first floor of a dingy building, the tiny bookstore was operating as usual, selling paperbacks that purported to tell all about the salacious private lives of top Chinese leaders. But last week, Mr Lee - also known as Lee Bo - appeared to have suffered the same fate as the other four missing men. His disappearance last Wednesday has sparked an outcry in Hong Kong, where some suspect he may have been kidnapped and illegally transported across the border to mainland China - in a process akin to extraordinary rendition - because of a possible book about the private life of President Xi Jinping. Image copyright EPA Image caption Causeway Bay Books was known for carrying literature that could be gossipy about mainland politics When contacted by phone last Thursday, his wife, herself a writer, told me she had been unable to reach him on his mobile phone. \\"I can tell you I am really afraid,\\" she said. \\"I can't get through to him. But he has called me. He asked me not to make a fuss. That he would get himself out of the situation somehow. He was not able to say more about his circumstances.\\" Besides worrying about her husband, who was usually home by 7:15pm every evening for dinner, Mrs Lee was deeply concerned about how his absence would affect their autistic son, who is in his 20s and living at home. She also said she had disagreed with the high-profile way in which Mr Lee had spoken to the media after their colleagues had first disappeared. One of them, publishing house owner Gui Minhai, was last seen in Thailand, and the other three were last seen in China. Image caption Mr Lee had previously told the BBC that he felt safe in Hong Kong Although she spoke to me, Mrs Lee made it clear that she did not wish to overly publicise their story with international media, in case the attention harmed her husband's chances of returning home. But because of the unusual, even extraordinary details of this case, one family's plight has made headlines around the world. Mrs Lee later reportedly told Hong Kong media that her husband appeared to have called her from Shenzhen, a mainland Chinese city across the border from Hong Kong. And that his home return permit, which he is required to show to enter China, was still at home. Those details, plus an unconfirmed police report showing no record of Mr Lee ever having left Hong Kong, were enough to convince veteran lawmaker and human rights activist Albert Ho that the bookseller had been kidnapped. Image caption Albert Ho (third from right) spoke at a press conference convened by activists on Sunday \\"He must have been forced to go under duress or intimidation,\\" Mr Ho told the BBC. \\"And then very probably he left through some channel without going through the immigration counter. So that's what has led to our observation that he was kidnapped and smuggled to China.\\" Mr Ho said he believed the five associates had been detained because of a purported book, commissioned and possibly written by publisher Gui Minhai, about a former mistress of President Xi, when he was already married to folk singer Peng Liyuan. Before his disappearance, Mr Lee told me his last contact with Mr Gui was via email on 15 October, when the publisher had instructed printers to get ready for a new book. He said he would send the material shortly. He was not seen again. Mr Lee believed that book, the subject of which he was not privy to, had caused the detentions. Image caption Causeway Bay Books had carried other titles, including this one discussing the women in Xi Jinping's life The reaction in Hong Kong to news of the first batch of disappearances was mild. Thailand was perceived as being vulnerable to Chinese interference. And in China, extrajudicial detention is not unknown. But Mr Lee's case is unprecedented, according to Mr Ho, because it involves a permanent resident of Hong Kong being possibly taken outside legal channels by Chinese agents with no jurisdiction in this city. For some people in Hong Kong, it is their worst nightmare: the spectre of Chinese officials reaching beyond the mainland to detain those who are accused transgressing against them. \\"The enforcement of law in Hong Kong is a domestic affair. It should be left to the local enforcement agency. This is, in fact, a very important line drawn between Hong Kong and the mainland. That is what has made Hong Kong feel safe. That we are under the protection of a completely different system,\\" said Mr Ho. There has been no official comment form the Chinese authorities. But in a recent opinion piece (in Chinese), the Global Times, a mouthpiece of the government, has criticised accusations that the \\"one country, two systems\\" model was in jeopardy. Image copyright BBC Chinese Image caption The five missing people are all linked to this small bookshop in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay The high-profile nature of the case has drawn comment from Hong Kong Chief Executive CY Leung who said his government is attaching great importance to the case. He reiterated that only Hong Kong officials can enforce the law in the city and that mainland officials have no jurisdiction. The city's acting security chief has also appealed for information in the case. However, human rights activists who staged a protest over Mr Lee's disappearance over the weekend are not optimistic officials will get to the bottom of the disappearance. As for the bookshop, it closed a day after Mr Lee's disappearance. \\"Something terrible has happened. We are all afraid. We are leaving now,\\" an employee told me a few hours before locking the doors for the foreseeable future. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The mystery surrounding the five missing Hong Kong booksellers, who specialise in books that are critical of China, has deepened after one of them apparently wrote a letter saying he was helping with an investigation on the mainland, leading his wife to drop her missing person's report.

Question: Which work condemn the experiment? Context: Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response.

Would \\"For example, the penis of a mammal is at most analogous to the penis of a male insect or barnacle .\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose your answer from: [-] No. [-] Yes. Answer:","output":"No. A more detailed and accurate answer would be: The penis is an external male reproductive organ primarily made out of erectile tissue, blood vessels, muscles, and nerves. A mammalian penis typically consists of three main parts: the root, the shaft (body), and the glans penis. In mammals, the penis plays a crucial role in reproduction, as it serves to deliver sperm during copulation. The primary component of the penis is the erectile tissue, which consists of two types: the corpus cavernosum and the corpus spongiosum. The corpus cavernosum is spongy tissue that can fill with blood, enabling the penis to become erect during arousal. The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra, which is the duct that carries urine and semen out of the body. Comparing the penis of a mammal to that of a male insect or barnacle might not be appropriate, as these animals have different reproductive structures and functions. In insects, the male reproductive organ is called an aedeagus, which serves to deliver sperm to the female. Barnacles, which are sessile crustaceans, possess long, modified penises used to reach the female reproductive organs of their neighbors. Although they may share the function of sperm transfer, the actual structures and materials of these organs are not directly comparable to those of a mammal's penis."},{"instruction":"How is \\"This will be their first artistic project in New York City, which is where they live.\\" said in Turkish?","output":"\\"This will be their first artistic project in New York City, which is where they live.\\" cümlesi Türkçe'ye şu şekilde çevrilebilir: \\"Bu, yaşadıkları yer olan New York'taki ilk sanatsal projeleri olacak.\\" Bu cümlede İngilizce'den Türkçe'ye çeviri yapılırken bazı dilbilgisi ve sözdizimi değişiklikleri yapılmıştır: 1. \\"This will be\\" ifadesi Türkçe'ye \\"Bu olacak\\" şeklinde çevrildi ve Türkçe dilbilgisi kurallarına göre \\"olacak\\" eylemi cümlenin sonuna yerleştirildi. 2. \\"Their first artistic project\\" ifadesi Türkçe'ye \\"ilk sanatsal projeleri\\" şeklinde çevrildi.

Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation.

Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems.

John's greedy and snobbish wife Fanny (Harriet Walter) convinces him to give his half sisters practically nothing financially and they immediately install themselves in the large house, forcing the Dashwood ladies to look for a new home. Fanny invites her brother Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) to stay with them. Elinor and Edward soon form a close friendship, but Fanny haughtily tells Mrs. Dashwood that Edward would be disinherited if he married someone of no importance with no money. Mrs. Dashwood understands her meaning completely. Sir John Middleton (Robert Hardy), a cousin of the widowed Mrs. Dashwood, offers her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in Devonshire. She and her daughters move in, and are frequent guests at Barton Park. The Dashwoods meet the older Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman), who falls in love with Marianne at first sight. However, Marianne barely acknowledges him although he is carried in the highest regard and shows only kindness towards her and her family. One afternoon, Marianne takes a walk with Margaret and slips and falls in the rain. She is carried home by the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise), with whom Marianne falls in love. They spend a great deal of time together and clearly fall in love to the point that he snips a lock of her hair to carry with him.

Another student: Let's say, hmmm...","output":"Let's denote the rate at which the pipe fills the cistern as P and the rate at which the leak empties the cistern as L. Since the pipe can fill the cistern in 20 minutes, P = 1/20 (cistern per minute). Similarly, since the leak can empty the cistern in 40 minutes, L = 1/40 (cistern per minute). When both the pipe and the leak are opened, the effective rate at which the cistern is being filled is the difference between the rate of filling and the rate of emptying, which is P - L. Effective rate = P - L = (1/20 - 1/40) To find the common denominator, we can multiply the fractions by a common multiple. In this case, it is 40. Effective rate = (2/40 - 1/40) = 1/40 (cistern per minute) So, the time it takes for the cistern to be completely full with both the pipe and leak opened is the reciprocal of the effective rate or 1 / (Effective rate).

Here are possible answers to this question: - buy a train ticket - create art - apply for job - take care of proposals - stand in line I believe the correct choice is \\"take care of proposals\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"I agree with your choice, and I also believe that the correct answer to the question is \\"take care of proposals.\\" Here's my detailed explanation: The question presents a situation where the boss has provided money to the individual to keep the clients happy or to resolve any discontent among them. Therefore, we can analyze each of the given options to determine which one best fits the given situation. 1. Buy a train ticket: While it is possible that the money could be used to purchase a train ticket, this option does not directly address the clients' concerns or contribute to their satisfaction. Buying a train ticket only allows the individual to travel, and it does not address the clients' needs. Therefore, this option is not the best choice. 2. Create art: Creating art can be a means of expression and relaxation, but it is unlikely to be the primary method that a company would choose for appeasing clients. In a professional context, the needs of clients are usually addressed through meetings, discussions, and well-thought-out proposals that address their requirements and concerns. Hence, this option is also not the best choice. 3. Apply for a job: Applying for a job is unrelated to addressing the concerns of the clients. In the given context, the individual should be focused on keeping the existing clients happy rather than pursuing new job opportunities. As a result, this option is not the right choice. 4. Take care of proposals: In a business context, submitting well-prepared proposals to clients is often an effective way to keep them satisfied and maintain a professional relationship. A proposal can address clients' concerns by providing detailed solutions or plans for their projects or needs. Moreover, the money provided by the boss can be spent on research, development, and presentation of these proposals to ensure their effectiveness. Given this reasoning, \\"take care of proposals\\" is the most logical choice. 5. Stand in line: Standing in line doesn't directly contribute to resolving client concerns or keeping them satisfied. This option is therefore not the best choice in this situation. By analyzing each option, it is clear that the best choice for the individual, who has been given money by their boss to appease clients, is to \\"take care of proposals.\\" This course of action ensures that the clients' concerns and requirements are properly addressed, leading to increased satisfaction and fostering a positive professional relationship between the clients and the company."},{"instruction":"Write a negative movie review.","output":"Title: Shadows in the Light - A Catastrophe on Screen Every once in a while, a movie comes along that challenges the very foundation of cinema and storytelling. A movie that, in every frame, sentence, or element, is so astonishingly abysmal it blows the mind. That movie, my friends, is Shadows in the Light, directed by Anthony Hurricanewho couldn't decide whether he was creating an art film or trying to sell a convoluted plot to an unsuspecting audience. One would think having a star-studded cast featuring A-list celebrities like Jennifer Clearwater, Mark Gordon, and Sandra Livingston would result in, at the very least, a touch of quality. However, the heavy-handed dialogues, rampant clichés, and stilted acting throughout the film only serve to punctuate the melodrama to an almost unbearable level. The plot, or rather, the fever dream that passes for one, centers around a group of estranged friends who reunite after 20 years to attend a mutual acquaintance's funeral. At no point does the script come close to providing insight or depth into these characters' lives, leaving us to endure the unfolding drama with a mix of confusion and disappointment. The characters are flat, unlikable, and seem to be only present for the sake of fulfilling a poorly planned storyline. Furthermore, the relationships among these so-called friends are ill-defined, resulting in underwhelming conflicts and nothing worth investing in. As the poorly-lit funeral finishes, the film launches into a series of contrived subplots, ranging from love triangles and extramarital affairs to the deeply rooted secrets and bitter rivalries that plague the convoluted mess of a narrative. A film, which should have been an intimate exploration of old connections and overcoming past regrets, serves only to propel us further into a dark and muddled labyrinth. The screenplay itself is an amalgamation of cliché phrases and platitudes that strip any semblance of emotion from the scenes. It becomes almost laughable as the intense moments are buried beneath a barrage of poorly-timed and wildly inappropriate humor. The dialogues seem to be lazily crafted, attempting to sound profound but only succeeding in creating a sense of disconnection from the already unengaging characters. Hurricane's direction, if you can call it that, is wildly mishandled. From the monochrome scenes, which seem to be included only to be pretentiously \\"artistic,\\" to the dizzying shots that flip between close-ups and shaky panoramas, the film is an assault on the eyes and an absolute migraine to endure. It's as if the director studied cinematography from a series of amateur YouTube videos and decided that was good enough for a feature-length film. Not to take away from the cast, suffering under the weight of a disastrous film project can be tough. Still, unfortunately, none of the talented actors manage to salvage anything from the wreckage left by the screenplay and direction. Their performances are inconsistent, ranging from dramatically overemphasized emotions to complete indifference. It's as if they realized midway through the shooting that they had signed on to create a cinematic disaster. In conclusion, Shadows in the Light is a bewildering catastrophe on a massive scale. The film offers viewers a mind-numbing experience that lacks coherence, character development, and frankly, any semblance of entertainment value. It is a prime example of what not to do in filmmaking and how the collaborative art form can collapse under the misguided efforts of a director who loses sight of what storytelling and cinema truly are about. The only thing this film will leave you with is a reaffirmed belief in the power of filmmaking - to make something either profound or profoundly terrible. In this case, undoubtedly, it is the latter."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive? Title: soynut butter Review: Not as good quality as other brand (I'm healthy brand) that I have tried.

Johnny and his friend Cully, a musician and composer, visit a gypsy camp to get his fortune told. A lady reads tea leaves and tells Johnny that he will soon meet a red-haired woman who will bring him luck. Back on the boat, Johnny and Cully promptly encounter Nellie Bly, their boss Clint Braden's on-again, off-again girlfriend. Nellie has just caught Braden seducing another singer, Mitzi. Since she has red hair, Nellie is persuaded by Johnny to touch his chips for luck. After he wins, Johnny is convinced that the gypsy must be correct. Frankie finds out and becomes jealous, as does Johnny's boss. In a bit of musical theatre, Frankie shoots Johnny for dancing with Nellie Bly while singing Cully's latest song. A Broadway recruiter sees the riverboat show and buys the rights to this new song, suggesting that Frankie and Johnny should work together with him in New York City.

These tasks assess an individual's understanding of physical principles and their ability to apply their knowledge to solve practical problems. A detailed example of a suitable task is described below. Task: Design and Construct a Rube Goldberg Machine Objective: The primary objective of this task is to test the individual's ability to apply their understanding of the principles of mechanics, kinematics, and energy conservation to create a complex chain reaction using everyday objects and materials. Description: A Rube Goldberg machine is an intentionally over-engineered contraption designed to perform a simple task through a series of indirect and convoluted steps. This exercise requires the participant to design and construct a complex machine that incorporates various physical principles and demonstrates their understanding of cause and effect relationships in the physical world. Steps: 1. Define the task: Determine the simple task to be achieved by the Rube Goldberg machine. Examples include popping a balloon, switching off a light, or pouring a glass of water. 2. Brainstorm components: Have the individual brainstorm various components that could be incorporated into the machine. Encourage them to think about different forms of energy, such as potential, thermal, and kinetic energy, as well as common everyday objects that can be used to create the contraption. 3. Design the machine: Have the participant sketch a design of their proposed Rube Goldberg machine. The design should incorporate multiple interconnected steps, each triggering the next event in the sequence. 4. Gather materials: Allow the individual time to gather various materials and objects that will be used in the construction of their machine. 5. Construct the machine: Have the participant carefully put together their machine according to the design. This process may require problem-solving, trial and error, as well as adjustments to the original design. 6. Test and refine: Once the machine has been constructed, the participant should test and observe the functioning of each component. If any part does not work as expected, encourage them to analyze the issues, make necessary adjustments, and test again. Repeat this process until the machine successfully completes the defined task. 7. Final demonstration: The individual should demonstrate their fully functioning Rube Goldberg machine to complete the task. Encourage them to explain the physical principles behind each component and the chain reaction. This task incorporates various aspects of physical reasoning, such as identifying forces and energy conversions, developing an understanding of mechanical advantage, and applying the concepts of linear and rotational motion. Additionally, it promotes problem-solving, critical thinking, creativity, and persistence, as individuals must overcome challenges and make adjustments throughout the design, construction, and testing phases."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America.

A:","output":"A: The last step of the process is the emission and transportation of the produced energy towards the Sun's surface, and eventually into space as sunlight. After the nuclear fusion reactions in the Sun's core convert hydrogen into helium, the energy generated in the form of gamma rays (high-energy photons) starts its journey towards the outer layers of the Sun. As the gamma rays move outward, they are absorbed and re-emitted many times by particles in the radiative zone, losing some of their energy in each interaction, and gradually transforming into lower-energy photons. Once the energy reaches the Sun's convective zone, it gets transported by the movement of hot plasma. The energized plasma rises to the surface (photosphere), where the energy finally escapes as visible and invisible light, including ultraviolet radiation and infrared radiation. This light, which is the sunlight we observe, takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the Sun's surface to the Earth, providing us with warmth and energy that supports life on our planet."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: Use a smaller tipped drawing tool.","output":"In the given article, the advice provided is to utilize a drawing tool with a smaller tip.

Describe the world that they live in and show them going about their normal day-to-day activities in that world. Explain their roles and responsibilities in the world and what a typical day looks like for your hero. For example, the ordinary world in Toy Story is Andy's bedroom when the toys are alone and come to life. Woody serves as Andy's toy when Andy wants to play with him, and Woody also conducts toy meetings when Andy is not around. This is the first problem that your hero will face. It might not be life-threatening, but it will be a problem for your hero nonetheless. Describe how that problem comes about and show how your hero responds to it. This is a good opportunity to show some of your hero's likable traits and their flaws. The conflict or call to adventure in Toy Story is when Woody is replaced by Buzz Lightyear. Woody feels rejected and his visible hurt feelings add to his likeability, but he is also very jealous of all of the attention Buzz is getting. Woody's jealousy is one of his flaws. After you describe what adventure or conflict your hero is faced with, show how they refuse or deny it. This may take the form of your hero directly refusing to go on an adventure, or it might be a different kind of denial, such as denying their feelings or denying the truth about something. Your hero might cite practical reasons for refusing the call, but often the hero refuses to go on an adventure out of fear. In Toy Story, Woody refuses the call to adventure by denying that Buzz is Andy's new favorite toy. He also denies his own feelings and that he is jealous of Buzz. Woody's fear of no longer being the favorite is what drives him to deny what is actually happening. When your hero finally starts to accept that they might need to go on the adventure, they will need someone to guide them. Usually, the hero's mentor will be someone with much more experience than they have. However, it might also be a peer who has a different skill set than they do and who they can learn from. In Toy Story, Woody's mentor is Buzz. Even though Buzz is new to Woody's world, he has different abilities than Woody does. Woody learns new things from Buzz while they are in the outside world. Another good example of a hero's guide or mentor in a story is Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars. He teaches Luke the ways of the Jedi so that Luke can go on his adventure. This is also known as “crossing the threshold.” At this point in the story, the hero must go on the adventure to stop something terrible from happening or because they have no choice. Explain what happens to your hero or to someone in your hero's world that forces them to pursue their quest. For example, in Toy Story, Woody is forced to go on his adventure after Buzz falls out the window. Buzz falling out the window and Woody encountering him in the car after that happens is when they are over the threshold. Your hero needs to undergo tests to grow. Introducing your hero to new allies and enemies will provide them with assistance and resistance as they work towards their ultimate objective. Think about how you can integrate tests, allies, and enemies into your hero's journey to move the story forward and make it more interesting. For example, in Toy Story, Woody and Buzz are tested when they have to work together to find Andy in the arcade. In the arcade, they also meet some new friends, such as the aliens in the claw machine. They also face off with an enemy: Sid, the kid next door who tortures toys. As the story progresses, your hero will get closer and closer to their objective. Describe how your hero glimpses the objective and what still stands in their way. These obstacles might be external, such as an enemy or difficult task, or they might be internal, such as overcoming their pride and asking for help. For example, in Toy Story, Woody and Buzz end up in Sid's bedroom and Woody can see his home from where they are. However, the other toys are still leery of him and he cannot return home until he lets go of his jealousy and works with Buzz to get back. At this point in the story, the hero must face the biggest challenge of their journey. This might involve defeating a powerful enemy or obtaining a special item. Describe what your hero must do to overcome this challenge. This is a great opportunity to show how your hero has grown through their adventures. For example, your hero might demonstrate a skill that their mentor tried to teach them, but they struggled to master until this moment. In the example of Toy Story, Woody's greatest challenge is teaming up with Buzz and the other toys in Sid's room to stop Sid from hurting any more toys. They come up with a plan together and work as a team to scare off Sid. After your hero has overcome their biggest challenge, they can obtain the item or other object of their quest. This might be a physical item, such as a key or magic sword, or something symbolic, such as earning the respect of an important figure in their life or gaining a meaningful title. For example, in Toy Story, Woody and Buzz escape from Sid's home and Woody has overcome his jealousy of Buzz. They've developed a meaningful friendship as a result of their adventures. Although your hero has overcome the major obstacle in their story, you may also include one last test for your hero to endure. This test can help to emphasize the hero's growth over the course of your story and provide closure on something that the hero has been struggling to achieve in the background of the story. For example, in Toy Story, Woody's final test is when he has to trust in Buzz and accept his help to get back to Andy. Buzz uses his special skills to get them to the car, and Woody shows that he is no longer jealous of Buzz. He is amazed by him and gladly accepts his help. Your hero may undergo a symbolic or actual death as a result of their ordeal, and then they must also undergo a resurrection. This is when you show how your hero has changed as a result of where they have been and what they have done. For example, Woody compliments Buzz rather than poking fun at him showing that he has grown from the beginning of the story when he was jealous of Buzz and picking fights with him. In some stories, such as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the hero actually dies temporarily. Harry Potter dies, has a vision or visits a place between life and death, and then he is resurrected with new strength to defeat Lord Voldemort. After your hero has completed the final task, describe the new normal of the hero's world. This might look much like the beginning of the story, but with a small, yet noticeable improvement that the hero's successful adventure has created. For example, in Toy Story, the new normal is much like the beginning of the story. However, instead of Woody running the toy meeting on his own, he is co-running it with Buzz. This shows that their friendship is still intact and that there is peace and harmony in Andy's room.","output":"The story is about a hero who lives in an ordinary world that might seem unusual to us, like Andy's bedroom in Toy Story. The hero has responsibilities and a normal day, but then faces a problem. This problem lets us see the hero's good and bad traits. In Toy Story, Woody feels replaced by Buzz Lightyear and gets jealous. The hero might try to avoid the adventure or their feelings about it. In Toy Story, Woody does that by pretending Buzz isn't the new favorite toy. A helpful and experienced friend helps the hero begin their adventure. Woody's friend is Buzz, who teaches him new things. The hero has to go on the adventure for an important reason, like Woody trying to find Andy after Buzz falls out the window. The hero makes new friends and enemies, and faces tests and challenges along the way. In Toy Story, Woody and Buzz meet new friends and enemies, like Sid, the mean kid next door. The hero has to face their biggest challenge before they can succeed. Woody's biggest challenge is working with Buzz and other toys to stop Sid. The hero then achieves their goal, like Woody and Buzz becoming friends. The hero might face one last test and learn even more from it. Woody has to accept Buzz's help to get back to Andy. The hero might also experience a big change, showing how much they have grown from their adventure. Finally, the hero's ordinary world becomes a little bit better because of the adventure. In Toy Story, Woody and Buzz now happily share the leadership among other toys, showing that they are now friends in Andy's room."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: 1983 #_OF_OVERALL_SEATS_WON 0 / 498","output":"In 1983, the political entity in question secured zero out of 498 available overall seats won."},{"instruction":"This is some data: Alpena County Regional Airport, location, Wilson Township, Alpena County, Michigan; Wilson Township, Alpena County, Michigan, country, United States; Alpena County Regional Airport, runwayLength, 2744.0.

The French far right, known for its anti-immigrant stance, is saying that its warnings about Islamist extremism have been proven right. Yet for all the attention to them, discovering the exact number of Muslims in France is a surprisingly complicated task – the French government doesn't allow censuses that ask people about their religious beliefs, meaning that estimates have to come from independent sources. One widely cited study by Pew from 2010 showed estimated that France had 4.7 million Muslims. At 7.5 percent of the population, this meant France had the largest Muslim population in Western Europe (for reference, in the same year Pew estimated that the Muslim population in the United States made up 0.8 percent of the total). Other estimates vary from around 5 percent to 12. French census data can't tell us where France's Muslims live, but some past studies have put the percentage of Muslims in Paris as high as 15 percent. What census data can show is that around 9 percent of the population around Paris is made up of non-EU immigrants, though that number is likely influenced by other factors as well (Paris is a major international city, of course). Whatever the actual size, France's Islamic minority has become a subject of concern and sometimes fear-mongering. One online poll conducted by Ipsos Mosi last year found that the average person in France thought that Muslims made up 31 percent of the population in the country, rather than 7.5 percent. As political scientist Steve Saideman puts it on his blog: \\"It is important to understand the real numbers, as fears of swamping generate or exacerbate xenophobia, and in pretty much every case, the populations of Muslims are so small that they are politically powerless.\\" And when it comes to levels of extremism within France's Islamic community, attitudes are again hard to ascertain. One recent poll suggested that 1 in 6 French citizens supported the Islamic State militant organization. When examined closely, its findings seemed incoherent and possibly flawed. (Incidentally, the earliest indications suggest that the Charlie Hebdo attack was carried out by al-Qaeda followers, who now see themselves as rivals to the Islamic State). A more reassuring poll from 2006 found that 73 percent of French Muslims were \\"somewhat\\" or \\"extremely\\" concerned about the threat of Islamist extremism. In 2011, Gallup found that 56 percent of French Muslims felt Western societies \\"respected\\" Muslim societies. Given the variety of different backgrounds French Muslims come from, attempting to singularly define their positions may ultimately a difficult, even impossible task. Perhaps most worrying in the current climate has been the relatively large number of French nationals who are believed to have gone to fight in Syria in 2014. Estimates put these at several hundred. You can see how that compares below (click for enlarged image). France's Muslim minority may be disproportionately represented in some areas of French society (in 2008 it was estimated that between 60 and 70 percent of prison inmates were Muslims). It's worth remembering, however, that two of most famous victims of extremist terrorism in recent years were themselves French Muslims: Imad Ibn-Ziaten, a soldier shot dead in Toulouse in 2012, and police officer Ahmed Merabet. Adam Taylor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post. Originally from London, he studied at the University of Manchester and Columbia University. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"France's Muslim population, estimated to be between 5 to 12 percent, has become a subject of concern and fear-mongering, with some past studies indicating the percentage of Muslims in Paris to be as high as 15 percent.

The origins of most of the days are unknown. They were certainly not created by individual people. Other days, however, especially those celebrated in western countries, often owe their origins to a particular person. One of the most popular of these, even though it is fairly recent, is Mother's Day. Mothers have always been highly regarded in all cultures. The ancient Romans had a festival known as Hilaria, during which children took presents to the temple of the \\"Mother of the Gods\\". The Christian Church adopted this idea and called it Mothering Sunday. However, over the years this custom was gradually forgotten and almost disappeared by the end of the 19th century. Born in 1864 in Virginia, USA, Anna Jarvis was a school teacher and believed children should show gratitude to their mothers for all their love and care. Encouraged by a friend, she wrote to thousands of important people--politicians, churchmen, doctors, city officials--and asked them to support her idea: a special day of the year for thanking mothers. In 1910 the Governor of West Virginia introduced Mother's Day into the state. The date chosen was May 10--the second Sunday in May, which is still observed in America today. This date was chosen because May 10 was the date on which in 1908 Anna Jarvis's mother had died. In 1914 President Woodrow Wilson made May 10 the official date for Mother's Day throughout the United States. Soon there was a Mother's Day International Association and the custom began to be adopted in many countries of the world. Anna Jarvis, a sad and disillusioned woman, died in 1948. The custom she had worked so hard to establish and which had become almost universal had lost its original purpose. It had been taken over by business. Like Christmas, the giving of presents and the sending of cards had become a multi-million-dollar industry.

Would \\"Tropical cyclones strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated air rises, resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist air.\\" be a reasonable answer?","output":"Your answer provides a good explanation of how tropical cyclones form and strengthen but does not address how they are named. Here's a more accurate answer for the naming process: Tropical storms and hurricanes are named to help easily identify and communicate about them. They are named using a predefined list of names by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The WMO maintains a set of six rotating lists, one for each of the world's six tropical cyclone regions (Atlantic, Eastern North Pacific, Central North Pacific, Western North Pacific, Northern Indian Ocean, and Southern Hemisphere). Each list consists of alternating male and female names in alphabetical order, excluding names starting with the letters Q, U, X, Y, and Z due to the limited availability of names with these letters. The lists are reused every six years, except for names of particularly deadly or costly storms that are retired and replaced with new names. So, while \\"Tropical cyclones strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated air rises, resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist air\\" is a good description of cyclone formation and growth, a more suitable answer to \\"how are tropical storms and hurricanes named?\\" would be: \\"Tropical storms and hurricanes are named by the World Meteorological Organization using a predefined list of names for each of the six hurricane regions in the world. They have a rotating system with alternating male and female names in alphabetical order, which is reused every six years.\\""},{"instruction":"Read this: Two days later, it was announced that Luis Enrique would return to Barcelona as head coach, after he agreed to a two-year deal.

Here are possible answers to this question: - factory - construction site - engine - insides of skyscraper's walls - shops I believe the correct choice is \\"construction site\\", here's why: A:","output":"The phrase \\"workman's compensation\\" typically implies a scenario where an accident or injury has taken place while on the job. Moreover, it often pertains specifically to occupations involving physical labor and potentially hazardous environments – roles such as construction workers fit this description well. To begin with, let's dismantle the other options: - \\"Factory\\": While it is plausible for someone to trip over a metal rod in a factory, factories usually have established safety procedures in place, minimizing the possibility of employees tripping over loose metal rods. Also, the context of the scenario, which involves \\"building\\", fits less with a factory setting, which is usually more about manufacturing or assembly, rather than building. - \\"Engine\\": An engine is typically not a location where one would physically build or encounter a scenario of tripping over a metal rod. Building an engine involves precision and generally happens at a workstation within a manufacturing plant or a factory. - \\"Insides of Skyscraper's Walls\\": While this choice might reflect a construction angle, it seems overly specific and less probable. Workers do not typically build within the insides of skyscraper walls where a metal rod might be a stumbling hazard. The building process of skyscrapers involves a systematic protocol where specific sections are completed at a time – there would be minimal reason for workers to be inside the walls with loose metal rods. - \\"Shops\\": Shops, in general, are not places where significant building activities occur. In the context of retail or small businesses, shops enhance safety standards to prevent accidents like tripping over a metal rod. Now, comparing these options with \\"construction site\\": A construction site is an environment where physical building is consistently happening, and it's common to have materials like metal rods in these areas. Occupational hazards are notable in construction sites due to its dynamic nature and the numerous elements involved. Sadly, incidents of tripping over material are not uncommon in such settings. In fact, according to the National Safety Council, tripping, or falling incidents are one of the most common types of injuries on construction sites. Considering all these, \\"construction site\\" seems to be the most fitting answer to the question. It aligns best with the activities mentioned in the question (tripping over a metal rod while building) and corresponds with the likelihood of receiving workman's compensation due to the inherent risks of the job. The presence of materials like metal rods is typical on construction sites, making tripping incidents possible, and these factors compound the necessity for workman's compensation in such contexts."},{"instruction":"Which entity is this text about? Steely Dan is an American rock band founded by core members Walter Becker (guitars, bass, backing vocals) and Donald Fagen (keyboards, lead vocals) in 1972. Blending elements of jazz, traditional pop, R&B, and sophisticated studio production with cryptic and ironic lyrics, the band enjoyed critical and commercial success starting from the early 1970s until breaking up in 1981. Throughout their career, the duo recorded with a revolving cast of session musicians, and in 1974 retired from live performances to become a studio-only band. Rolling Stone has called them \\"the perfect musical antiheroes for the Seventies\\". Pretzel Logic was released in early 1974. A diverse set, it includes the group's most successful single \\"Rikki Don't Lose That Number\\" (No. 4) and a note-for-note rendition of Duke Ellington and James \\"Bubber\\" Miley's \\"East St. Louis Toodle-Oo\\". During the previous album's tour, the band had added vocalist-percussionist Royce Jones, vocalist-keyboardist Michael McDonald, and session drummer Jeff Porcaro (of Sonny & Cher). Porcaro contributed significantly to Pretzel Logic (as he would on future Steely Dan recordings), reflecting Steely Dan's increasing reliance on session musicians (including Dean Parks and Rick Derringer). Drummer Jeff Porcaro and Katy Lied pianist David Paich would go on to form Toto. Striving for perfection, Becker and Fagen sometimes asked musicians to record as many as forty takes of each track. Pretzel Logic was the first Steely Dan album to feature Walter Becker on guitar. \\"Once I met (session musician) Chuck Rainey\\", he explained, \\"I felt there really was no need for me to be bringing my bass guitar to the studio anymore\\". A rift began growing between Becker-Fagen and Steely Dan's other members (particularly Baxter and Hodder), who wanted to tour. Becker and Fagen disliked constant touring and wanted to concentrate solely on writing and recording. The other members gradually left the band, discouraged by this and by their diminishing roles in the studio. However, Dias remained with the group until 1980's Gaucho and Michael McDonald contributed vocals until the group's twenty-year hiatus after Gaucho. Baxter and McDonald went on to join The Doobie Brothers. Steely Dan's last tour performance was on July 5, 1974, a concert at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in California. A recording of the show's opening track, \\"Bodhisattva\\", was released as a B-side, and later appeared on the compilation album Gold. Becker and Fagen recruited a diverse group of session players for Katy Lied (1975), including Porcaro, Paich, and McDonald, as well as guitarist Elliott Randall, jazz saxophonist Phil Woods, saxophonist/bass-guitarist Wilton Felder, percussionist/vibraphonist/keyboardist Victor Feldman, keyboardist (and later producer) Michael Omartian, and guitarist Larry Carlton -- Dias, Becker, and Fagen being Steely Dan's only original members. The album went gold on the strength of \\"Black Friday\\" and \\"Bad Sneakers\\", but Becker and Fagen were so dissatisfied with the album's sound (compromised by a faulty DBX noise reduction system) that they publicly apologized for it (on the album's back cover) and for years refused to listen to it in its final form. Katy Lied also included \\"Doctor Wu\\" and \\"Chain Lightning\\".

He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field. and a hint : Because the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height. Please answer this question : Would side B see less or more deformed Earth than side A? A:","output":"Side B would see less deformed Earth than side A. The explanation for this lies in the fact that the gravitational force of the Moon has a stronger effect on the side of the Earth facing the Moon (side A) and a weaker effect on the opposite side (side B). The Moon's gravitational force on side A pulls the Earth's surface toward it, leading to greater deformation. In contrast, the weaker force on side B results in less deformation of the Earth's surface. This gravitational \\"stretch\\" effect caused by the Moon has a more significant impact on oceans due to their fluid nature. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force change constantly, causing rhythmic changes in sea surface height. Since the oceans have more freedom to move in response to these tidal forces, the overall deformation of the Earth's surface tends to be more noticeable in oceanic regions. On the side of the Earth facing the Moon (side A), ocean waters are drawn towards the Moon, leading to a higher sea surface height or \\"bulging\\" effect. This causes high tides on side A. Conversely, on the opposite side (side B), the weaker force results in a smaller \\"bulge\\" and lower sea surface height, leading to low tides. In summary, side B would see less deformed Earth than side A due to the weaker gravitational force exerted by the Moon. This results in a smaller \\"stretch\\" effect and lower sea surface height compared to side A, where the stronger gravitational force causes a more noticeable deformation, particularly in oceanic regions."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: Stay Away from this Stinker Product review: I bought this hot steaming pile of poo at Walmart, installed it, ran some of the utilities, and voila!

The ruling or fatwa has the force of law and appears to go beyond the Islamic State’s previous known utterances on the subject, a leading Islamic State scholar said. It sheds new light on how the group is trying to reinterpret centuries-old teachings to justify the sexual slavery of women in the swaths of Syria and Iraq it controls. To read the fatwa click here: The fatwa was among a huge trove of documents captured by US Special Operations Forces during a raid targeting a top Islamic State official in Syria in May. Reuters has reviewed some of the documents, which have not been previously published. Among the religious rulings are bans on a father and son having sex with the same female slave; and the owner of a mother and daughter having sex with both. Joint owners of a female captive are similarly enjoined from intercourse because she is viewed as “part of a joint ownership.” The United Nations and human rights groups have accused the Islamic State of the systematic abduction and rape of thousands of women and girls as young as 12, especially members of the Yazidi minority in northern Iraq. Many have been given to fighters as a reward or sold as sex slaves. Far from trying to conceal the practice, Islamic State has boasted about it and established a department of “war spoils” to manage slavery. Reuters reported on the existence of the department on Monday. In an April report, Human Rights Watch interviewed 20 female escapees who recounted how Islamic State fighters separated young women and girls from men and boys and older women. They were moved “in an organized and methodical fashion to various places in Iraq and Syria.” They were then sold or given as gifts and repeatedly raped or subjected to sexual violence. Fatwa No. 64, dated Jan. 29, 2015, and issued by Islamic State’s Committee of Research and Fatwas, appears to codify sexual relations between IS fighters and their female captives for the first time, going further than a pamphlet issued by the group in 2014 on how to treat slaves. The fatwa starts with a question: “Some of the brothers have committed violations in the matter of the treatment of the female slaves. These violations are not permitted by Sharia law because these rules have not been dealt with in ages. Are there any warnings pertaining to this matter?” It then lists 15 injunctions, which in some instances go into explicit detail. For example: “If the owner of a female captive, who has a daughter suitable for intercourse, has sexual relations with the latter, he is not permitted to have intercourse with her mother and she is permanently off limits to him. Should he have intercourse with her mother then he is not permitted to have intercourse with her daughter and she is to be off limits to him.” Islamic State’s sexual exploitation of female captives has been well documented, but a leading IS expert at Princeton University, Cole Bunzel, who has reviewed many of the group’s writings, said the fatwa went beyond what has previously been published by the militants on how to treat female slaves. “It reveals the actual concerns of IS slave owners,” he said in an email. Still, he cautioned that not “everything dealt with in the fatwa is indicative of a relevant violation. It doesn’t mean father and son were necessarily sharing a girl. They’re at least being ‘warned’ not to. But I bet some of these violations were being committed.” The fatwa also instructs owners of female slaves to “show compassion towards her, be kind to her, not humiliate her, and not assign her work she is unable to perform.” An owner should also not sell her to an individual whom he knows will mistreat her. Professor Abdel Fattah Alawari, dean of Islamic Theology at Al-Azhar University, a 1,000-year-old Egyptian center for Islamic learning, said Islamic State “has nothing to do with Islam” and was deliberately misreading centuries-old verses and sayings that were originally designed to end, rather than encourage, slavery. “Islam preaches freedom to slaves, not slavery. Slavery was the status quo when Islam came around,” he said. “Judaism, Christianity, Greek, Roman, and Persian civilizations all practiced it and took the females of their enemies as sex slaves. So Islam found this abhorrent practice and worked to gradually remove it.” In September 2014 more than 120 Islamic scholars from around the world issued an open letter to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi refuting the group’s religious arguments to justify many of its actions. The scholars noted that the “reintroduction of slavery is forbidden in Islam.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"ISIS theologians have issued an extremely detailed fatwa ruling on when \\"owners\\" of women enslaved by the extremist group can have sex with them, in an attempt to curb violations in the treatment of captured females.

These parties were: Context_2 : Left and Democrats (Polish: \\"Lewica i Demokraci\\" , LiD) was a centre-left electoral alliance of political parties in Poland which was created on 3 September 2006, before the Warsaw municipal election of 2006. The coalition's aim was to provide an alternative for both Law and Justice and Civic Platform, which have been Poland's two major political parties since 2005. LiD contested their first national election in October, 2007 and won 53 seats to the Polish parliament, the Sejm. The LiD alliance was dissolved in April 2008, following a rift between the member parties. Context_3 : Sagar Movietone also Sagar Films, Sagar Film Company and Sagar Productions was an Indian film production company involved in the making of films for Indian cinema. It was launched by Ardeshir Irani with Chimanlal Desai and Dr. Ambalal Patel in 1929 in Bombay, Maharashtra, India. Sagar was initially started as a branch company of Ardeshir's Imperial Film Company. Several key figures from Imperial like Mehboob Khan were shifted to Sagar. The studio was operative from 1930-1939. In 1940, it combined with General Pictures to form National Studios. It made \\"Parsi theatre based films, mythologicals and stunt movies\\". Sagar fostered the career of many artists who rose to prominence. Early directors like Prafulla Ghosh, Sarvottam Badami, Ezra Mir and Nanubhai Vakil were promoted by the company. Mehboob Khan got his first break as a director in \\"Al Hilal\\" in 1935. He was referred to as \\"the most important alumnus\\" from Sagar, who went on to become one of Indian cinema's \\"most influential film-makers\\". Context_4 : Left Democratic Front (\\"LDF\\") is a coalition of political parties in the state of Kerala, in India. It is one of the two major political coalitions in Kerala, the other being the United Democratic Front each of which have been in power alternatively for the last two decades. LDF won the May 2016 election, and is now in power. The coalition consists of Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) and variety of other smaller parties. Context_5 : A grand coalition is an arrangement in a multi-party parliamentary system in which the two largest political parties of opposing political ideologies unite in a coalition government. The term is most commonly used in countries where there are two dominant parties with different ideological orientations, and a number of smaller parties that have passed the election threshold to secure representation in the parliament. The two large parties will each try to secure enough seats in any election to have a majority government alone, and if this fails each will attempt to form a coalition with smaller parties that have a similar ideological orientation. Because the two large parties will tend to differ on major ideological issues, and portray themselves as rivals, or even sometimes enemies, they will usually find it more difficult to agree on a common direction for a combined government with each other than with smaller parties. Context_6 : Albania has a multi-party system with two major political parties and a third party that is electorally successful. According to official data from the Central Election Commission, there were a total of 124 political parties listed in the party registry for the year 2014. Only 54 of these parties participated in the 2015 local elections. Context_7 : A two-party system is a party system where two major political parties dominate the government. One of the two parties typically holds a majority in the legislature and is usually referred to as the \\"majority\\" or \\"governing party\\" while the other is the \\"minority\\" or \\"opposition party\\". Around the world, the term has different senses. For example, in the United States, Jamaica, and Malta, the sense of \\"two party system\\" describes an arrangement in which all or nearly all elected officials belong to one of the only two major parties, and third parties rarely win any seats in the legislature. In such arrangements, two-party systems are thought to result from various factors like winner takes all election rules. In such systems, while chances for third party candidates winning election to major national office are remote, it is possible for groups within the larger parties, or in opposition to one or both of them, to exert influence on the two major parties. In contrast, in the United Kingdom and Australia and in other parliamentary systems and elsewhere, the term \\"two-party system\\" is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties which do win seats in the legislature, and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest. Context_8 : Hizb-e Wahdat-e Islami Afghanistan (Persian: حزب وحدت اسلامی افغانستان‎ ‎ ; \\"the Islamic Unity Party of Afghanistan\\"), shortened to Hizb-e Wahdat (حزب وحدت ), was founded in 1989. Like most contemporary major political parties in Afghanistan, Hizb-e Wahdat is rooted in the turbulent period of the anti-Soviet resistance movements in Afghanistan in the 1980s. It was formed to bring together nine separate and mostly inimical military and ideological groups into a single entity. During the period of the Afghan civil war in the early 1990s, it emerged as one of the major actors in Kabul and some other parts of the country. Political Islamism was the ideology of most of its key leaders but the party gradually tilted towards its Hazara ethnic support base and became the key vehicle of the community’s political demands and aspirations. Its ideological background and ethnic support base has continuously shaped its character and political agenda. Through the anti-Soviet jihad and the civil war, Hizb-e Wahdat accumulated significant political capital among Afghanistan’s Hazaras.

Officials described the sighting as the \\"best lead we have right now\\" and said four aircraft and an Australian Navy ship were sent to the region off the coast of Australia. In addition, a Norwegian car carrier, the Hoegh St. Petersburg, was diverted into the search area which is searching through the night using lights and binocular.

JUST IN: Australia's AMSA shares new satellite images of unidentified objects - Object Number 1: pic.twitter.com/u2nMjrgtrJ — ABC News (@ABC) March 20, 2014 JUST IN: Australia's AMSA shares new satellite images of unidentified objects - Object Number 2: pic.twitter.com/XdRTvgFOYX — ABC News (@ABC) March 20, 2014 The updates have been deemed \\"credible enough to divert resources to this area,\\" said John Young with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Emergency Response Division. The largest of the objects spotted on satellite was about 78 feet long, he said. \\"This is a lead. It is probably the best lead we have right now,\\" Young said. News of the find prompted Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott to call Malaysia's Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Najib Razak to inform him of the development. Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur this morning, \\"Today what I’m comfortable with saying is at least there is a credible lead… That gives us hope. As long as there’s hope, we will continue… To be fair to the families, we must also show we will never, never give up hope.” The news provided little comfort to the families of the plane's passengers. “The one piece of information they want is information we don’t have, is the location of MH370,” Hishammuddin said. Despite the development, officials were stressing caution, saying the objects will be difficult to find in the vast Indian Ocean and might not be related to Flight 370. Clouds and rain have limited visibility for today's search efforts, officials said. The Navy's P-8 and a P-3 search plane with the Royal Australian Air Force were both unable to locate any debris today, but other aircraft from Australia and New Zealand were continuing the hunt. Earlier, American and British aviation officials refined satellite signals from the missing plane, creating two possible flight paths that dramatically narrowed the scope of the search. The plane was carrying 239 people when it disappeared on March 8. ||||| Story highlights Australian Prime Minister says two objects are seen in the southern Indian Ocean An Australian air force plane is attempting a closer inspection, Australian media report President Barack Obama says search for Flight 370 is ''a top priority'' No information of significance has so far been found on any passengers, authorities say Authorities have spotted two objects in the Indian Ocean that are possibly related to the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Thursday. \\"New and credible information has come to light in relation to the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean,\\" Abbott said in the the Australian House of Representatives in Canberra. \\"The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has received information based on satellite imagery of objects possibly related to the search. \\"Following specialist analysis of this satellite imagery, two possible objects related to the search have been identified,\\" he said. \\"I can inform the House that a Royal Australian Air Force Orion has been diverted to attempt to locate the objects.\\" Three other planes will carry out a \\"more intensive follow-up search,\\" he said. Australian search teams have been at the forefront of the hunt for the missing plane in the remote southern Indian Ocean. The announcement from Abbott raises hopes of finding parts of the plane after a huge search that is now in its 13th day. Previous reports of debris found in the sea have not turned out to be related to the passenger jet, which vanished over Southeast Asia earlier this month. But those reports came before the search area was massively expanded into two large arcs, one that heads northwest into Asia, the other southwest into the Indian Ocean. The Malaysian military is checking the new information from Australian authorities, a source close to the investigation told CNN. \\"Verification might take some time. It is very far and it will take some time to locate and verify the objects,\\" the source said. Malaysia's Acting Transportation Secretary Hishammuddin Hussein said Abbott had informed Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak of the development Thursday. \\"At this stage, Australian officials have yet to establish whether these objects are indeed related to the search for MH370,\\" Hishammuddin said. Other pieces of information related to the investigation into the plane's disappearance had emerged Wednesday. Flight simulator probed Investigators looking at the flight simulator taken from the home of Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the pilot of the plane, have discovered that some data had been deleted from it, Hishammuddin said at a news conference. What the revelation means is unclear. It could be another dead end in an investigation that has been full of them so far, or it could provide further evidence for the theory that one or more of the flight crew may have been involved in the plane's disappearance 12 days ago. \\"It may not tell us anything. It's a step in the process,\\" one U.S. law enforcement source told CNN. \\"It could be a very insignificant detail in the process.\\" Investigators have been looking into the background of all 239 passengers and crew members aboard the plane that vanished in the early morning hours of March 8 while en route from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Particular attention has focused on the pilot and first officer on Flight 370, but authorities have yet to come up with any evidence explaining why either of them would have taken the jetliner off course. Hishammuddin didn't say what had been deleted, but simulation programs can store data from previous sessions for later playback. He also did not say who might have deleted the data. FBI examination Specialists are examining the simulator in hopes of recovering the data that was deleted, Hishammuddin said.

The FBI examination of the computer drives involves sorting through a large volume of data, according to a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation. \\"It is going to take some period of time, but we are analyzing it with a great degree of urgency. It is prioritized right at the top because the world is trying to figure this out,\\" the official said on condition of anonymity. Deleted files from Shah's simulator could reveal it had been used to practice diverting the plane and flying it to an unfamiliar airport, experts said. But even if investigators retrieve past simulations showing that Zaharie practiced flying to seemingly odd locations, that doesn't necessarily indicate evidence of anything nefarious, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. \\"You put in strange airports and try to land there, just to see if you can do it,\\" said Schiavo, adding that she sometimes does just that on the flight simulation program on her home computer. 'Grasping at straws' President Barack Obama called the search for Flight 370 \\"a top priority,\\" telling KDFW of Dallas on Wednesday that the United States will keep working on it. \\"We have put every resource that we have available at the disposal of the search process,\\" he said. But beyond help with the computer drives, the Malaysian government has not put in a formal request for additional FBI help overseas, according to the senior U.S. official. \\"We have made it clear we are ready to provide help whenever they need it,\\" the official said. \\"We are grasping at straws. No one is running on anything white hot.\\" More than 60 ships and 50 aircraft are participating in the search. But at least two aircraft, a Japanese search plane and a U.S. Navy P-3 Orion, sat on a runway at a Subang air base this week after Indonesia refused to allow the planes to fly through its airspace. \\"From what I understand, this is an international operation,\\" Cmdr. William Marks, spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet, told CNN by telephone. \\"...I'm confident we're going to be flying today or very soon.\\" Later, Indonesia's military spokesman told CNN clearance was given to all search planes. Although the search area spans nearly 3 million square miles, a U.S. government official familiar with the investigation said the missing plane is most likely somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. \\"This is an area out of normal shipping lanes, out of any commercial flight patterns, with few fishing boats, and there are no islands,\\" the official said, warning that the search could well last \\"weeks and not days.\\" Angry families want answers The lack of progress has angered and frustrated families, who have accused Malaysian officials of withholding information. Some family members staged a protest at the Kuala Lumpur hotel where media covering the search are staying. Their efforts were cut short by security guards who removed them through a crush of reporters, dragging one as she screamed.

They gather daily for a briefing with officials. Ye Lun, whose brother-in-law is on the missing plane, says every day is the same. He and his group leave the hotel in the morning for a daily briefing, and that's it. They go back to the hotel to watch the news on television. In a statement, Hishammuddin said Malaysian authorities \\"regret the scenes at this afternoon's press conference.\\" \\"One can only imagine the anguish they are going through,\\" he said of the families. \\"Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing.\\" An abrupt change in direction The disappearance continues to intrigue the public and frustrate officials, who have turned up no sign of the plane despite the involvement of teams from 26 nations. On Tuesday, a law enforcement official told CNN that the aircraft's first major change of course -- an abrupt westward turn that took the plane off its route to China and back across the Malay Peninsula -- was almost certainly programmed by somebody in the cockpit. The change was entered into the plane's system at least 12 minutes before a person in the cockpit, believed to be the co-pilot, signed off to air traffic controllers. Two minutes after the signoff, the plane's transponder stopped communicating details about the plane's altitude, speed and heading. Some experts said the change in direction could have been part of an alternate flight plan programmed in advance in case of emergency; others suggested it could show something more nefarious was afoot. But Hishammuddin said Wednesday that \\"there is no additional waypoint on MH370's documented flight plan, which depicts normal routing all the way to Beijing.\\" The Thai military, meanwhile, said it had spotted the plane turning west toward the Strait of Malacca early on March 8. That supports the analysis of Malaysian military radar that has the plane flying out over the Strait of Malacca and into the Indian Ocean. But it didn't make it any clearer where the plane went next. Authorities say information from satellites suggests the plane kept flying for about six hours after it was last detected by Malaysian military radar. Malaysian authorities, who are coordinating the search, say the available evidence suggests the missing plane flew off course in a deliberate act by someone who knew what they were doing.

So far, no information of significance has been found about any passengers, Hishammuddin said. China says it has found nothing suspicious during background checks on its citizens on the flight -- a large majority of the plane's passengers. And some experts have warned against hastily jumping to conclusions about the role of the pilots. \\"I've worked on many cases were the pilots were suspect, and it turned out to be a mechanical and horrible problem,\\" said Schiavo. \\"And I have a saying myself: Sometimes, an erratic flight path is heroism, not terrorism.\\" Ticking clock Searchers are racing the clock in their efforts to find the plane and its flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders. The devices have batteries designed to send out pings for 30 days. That leaves 18 days until the batteries are expected to run out. The task is being complicated by the scope of the search area, as well as the depth of some of the waters being searched -- up to 23,000 feet (7,000 meters). Searchers trying to find and retrieve wreckage and bodies from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, had to use unmanned submarines. It took nearly two years to find the bulk of the wreckage, including the flight data recorders, in waters nearly 12,000 feet deep. It took even longer to determine what happened to the plane. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amsa's John Young said the objects spotted were a \\"reasonable size\\" Australia is investigating two objects seen on satellite images that could potentially be linked to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, officials say.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the latest discovery based on satellite images taken on 16 March. \\"The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) has received information based on satellite information of objects possibly related to the search,\\" Mr Abbott told parliament. \\"Following specialist analysis of this satellite imagery, two possible objects related to the search have been identified.\\" Image copyright Amsa Image caption Australian authorities said one of the objects was 24m in size Image copyright Amsa Image caption The objects were seen on satellite images and assessed by experts Image copyright AFP Image caption The St Petersburg, a Norwegian merchant ship, was the first vessel to reach the area Two Australian Orion aircraft searching the area on Thursday were joined later by aircraft from the US and New Zealand. Amsa said the aircraft had covered an area of 23,000km² (14,000 square miles) but confirmed that they had found no debris. It said the search would resume on Friday. The captain of the first Australian air force AP-3C Orion plane to return from the search area described the weather conditions as \\"extremely bad\\" with rough seas and high winds. David Wright, an ABC News reporter who was on the P-8 Poseidon, said all the sophisticated plane had spotted was \\"a freighter and two pods of dolphins\\". A Norwegian merchant ship, the St Petersburg, has also arrived in the area after responding to a shipping broadcast issued by Australia's rescue co-ordination centre. It will be joined by an Australian naval vessel, HMAS Success, which is on its way to help with the search and Britain has also deployed HMS Echo, a coastal survey ship, to aid the operation.

The largest object appeared to be about 24m (78ft) in size, he said. At the scene The relatives of Chinese passengers on board MH370 watched the announcements from Australia on monitors set up at the Beijing hotel where they have been waiting for the past 13 days. When the press briefings were over, the families left the room. Most refused to speak to journalists, though one man told the BBC: \\"I don't believe any of this. I think my son is still alive.\\" Another relative, the son of a famed calligrapher on the plane, explained to us the families' reluctance to accept the possibility the plane had crashed. \\"If the Australian findings really turn out to be the remains of the plane, that would mean there is no hope left for us.\\" \\"This is a lead, it is probably the best lead we have right now. But we need to get there, find them, see them, assess them, to know whether it's really meaningful or not.\\" He warned the objects spotted in the sea could turn out to be unrelated to MH370, such as containers that had fallen from ships. \\"On this particular occasion the size and the fact that there are multiple [objects] located in the same area really makes it worth looking at,\\" Mr Young added. Michael Daniel, a former US Federal Aviation Administration official, told Singapore's Straits Times: \\"If they have a strong feeling or indication that the debris belongs to the aircraft, one of the first things authorities will do is drop sonar buoys in the water. \\"If the black box is there, the buoys should be able to pick up the signals. This could take up to 48 hours but it all depends on how near or far the ships and other assets are.\\" Australia informed Malaysian authorities of the development on Thursday morning.

This was based on its last faint signal to a satellite - an hourly \\"handshake\\" broadcast even when the main communication systems are switched off. Malaysia says search efforts are continuing in both corridors, involving a total of 18 ships, 29 aircraft and 6 ship-borne helicopters.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 45*f + 56 = 106*f - 53*f for f, we first simplify it by combining the similar terms. Step 1: Combine the similar terms on the right side of the equation. 106*f - 53*f = 53*f Now the equation is: 45*f + 56 = 53*f Step 2: Move the term with the variable 'f' from the left side of the equation to the right side by subtracting the term '45*f' from both sides. 45*f - 45*f + 56 = 53*f - 45*f This simplifies to: 56 = 8*f Step 3: Now we solve for 'f' by isolating it on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of f, which is 8. 56 ÷ 8 = 8*f ÷ 8 This simplifies to: 7 = f And the answer is f = 7."},{"instruction":"Artie Shaw became famous playing a clarinet in what outfit? - orchestra - jazz band - rock band - music store - music studio The best answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"jazz band"},{"instruction":"Context: Yeah , gon na keep messing with it .

Area schools opened for the first time since the middle of last week, although school buses were kept off roads because of the heavy police activity. There was increased security throughout the Pocono Mountain School District, and students would remain indoors, according to the district website. \\"This is an extremely difficult situation for our community,\\" the school district website said in announcing schools reopened Tuesday. \\"Schools will be in session but, ultimately it is your decision as parents whether to send your children to school. The District will respect your decision and all absences will be excused and will not impact a student's perfect attendance.\\" For the moment, the reopening of schools and roads Tuesday provided a sense of relief to a community under virtual lock-down since Frein -- a 31-year-old self-styled survivalist and war buff -- allegedly killed a state police officer and shot another officer September 12 during an ambush outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. On Tuesday, attendance in the 9,800-student district was down about 30%, a school official said. After-school athletic practices were moved indoors, and home athletic competitions canceled. \\"It's a difficult time for our parents,\\" district spokeswoman Wendy Frable told CNN. \\"A lot of parents are still a little nervous.\\" The shooting unleashed a massive manhunt involving hundreds of local, state and federal law enforcement agents. Life in the otherwise quiet community in the Pocono Mountains was disrupted as thousands of residents were under lock-down, and schools and some roads closed near the densely wooded search area. On Tuesday, two days after authorities discovered an AK-47 rifle, some magazines and a small bag of ammo in the northeastern Pennsylvania woods where they believe Frein is hiding, the search moved slightly north, police said. \\"He's out in those woods right now,\\" Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett told reporters a day earlier. State Police Lt. Col George Bivens, who joined the governor, said, \\"I do believe that we are close to him at this point.\\" Tracking dogs had indicated \\"we're on the right trail,\\" Bivens said a day earlier, adding that thermal imaging technology was being used to find Frein, who authorities believe had been planning the ambush for months or possibly years. Investigators said the items they found were either abandoned or hidden by Frein, who is a skilled marksman and trained survivalist. Slaying planned for months? Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers, but not civilians. When asked why investigators concluded that, Corbett answered that the night of the barracks shooting, Frein had the opportunity to shoot civilians and didn't take it. As to the rifle that was found over the weekend, it was positioned in such a way that it could be seen, though the items were partially concealed, Bivens said. \\"Frein obviously knows we're there\\" searching, he said. Up to 400 law enforcement officers are searching for Frein, including members of the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They are combing about 200 to 250 square miles of wooded area not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, about 20 miles from where Frein allegedly shot the police officers.

Chairman WASHINGTON — Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said on Thursday that he would resign effective mid-February. His departure will end a four-year tenure in which he pushed for online privacy protections and sought to restrain unfair competition, but stumbled in an attempt to rein in the Internet search practices of Google. Mr. Leibowitz, 54, said in an interview that he intended to move to the private sector and was likely to focus on competition policy and privacy. His departure was widely expected and had been talked about among antitrust lawyers since last summer. “I felt like this was a good time to leave because we got through a number of things that I wanted the commission to address,” he said, citing the blocking of several regional hospital mergers and cases brought against Facebook and Google for violating their own privacy policies. This spring, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an F.T.C. case involving generic drug companies that agree to delay putting new products on the market in exchange for payments from brand-name pharmaceutical companies that market similar drugs. Mr. Leibowitz’s successor could come from within the commission, with Democratic commissioners Julie Brill and Edith Ramirez considered contenders. Other possible candidates are Howard Shelanski, an antitrust expert who is director of the commission’s bureau of economics, and Philip J. Weiser, a former aide to Joel Klein at the Justice Department’s antitrust division. Under Mr. Leibowitz, who was a commissioner for more than four years before being appointed chairman in 2009, the commission also worked to expand the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and brought an enforcement action against Intel for unfair competitive practices in the microprocessor market. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is the new chairwoman of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said Mr. Leibowitz had been able to get bipartisan attention paid to issues like generic-drug competition and telephone billing practices in part because of his experience as a staff aide on Capitol Hill. “He’s done really aggressive work to stop these pay-for-delay settlements,” she said, referring to drug industry practices. He also drew attention to cramming, the addition of unauthorized, often-unnoticed charges to consumers’ phone bills, she said. Other Democrats, including some consumer advocates, were less generous in their assessment, although none of them wanted to speak on the record. They noted, however, a few areas where the F.T.C. did not block merger actions, including a 2 billion proposal to join the Universal Music Group and EMI, two large record labels. Last year, the commission also approved the 29 billion merger of two of the nation’s largest pharmacy-benefit managers, Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions. If only because it was his last big effort, however, the Google case is likely to be the one that is foremost in people’s minds over the next few years. Mr. Leibowitz sought the case, winning a cordial but tense battle with the Justice Department’s antitrust division over the right to investigate Google’s search practices. Competitors, advertisers and some consumer advocates had complained that Google manipulated the results of its Internet searches to give top priority to results that featured companies in which it held an interest, while punishing those that were a competitive threat. It was a widely watched case, not only because Google was one of the country’s largest companies, a symbol of the enormous success that could be bred by the Internet, but also because Mr. Leibowitz had made anticompetition enforcement a high priority. In 2009, shortly after he took over as chairman of the commission, Mr. Leibowitz threw down the gauntlet at a conference of antitrust lawyers, saying he intended to push the F.T.C. to protect consumers “by expanding the use of our authority to prohibit unfair methods of competition.” That authority, laid out in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, allows the commission more leeway than do antitrust laws to sanction companies for actions that might not be antitrust violations but that are unfair and deceptive practices. But when the F.T.C.’s five commissioners looked closely at Google’s practices, they unanimously agreed that while some of its behavior was not beneficial to competitors, over all its actions improved its search results for the benefits of users. The commission did get Google to agree to voluntarily change some of its methods; critics of that agreement, including one commissioner who dissented on that part of the decision, said the voluntary agreement was essentially unenforceable because it did not have court authority behind it. The F.T.C. did bring formal charges against Google in another matter, reaching a settlement of charges that Google illegally refused to license some of its patents for cellular phone technology to companies, like Apple, whose products compete with Google’s Android operating system. “That would have been a much harder case to bring under antitrust law,” Mr. Leibowitz said. Asked if he felt the Google case was a failure, Mr. Leibowitz gave an unequivocal no. “You don’t take these jobs without wanting to bring a big case,” he said. “But I think we did our job there.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Jon Leibowitz resigning from his position as the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). He served in this role for four years, working on online privacy protections and trying to control unfair competition.

Options: - exhaustion - shortness of breath - heart attacks - blisters - diabetes The answer is \\"heart attacks\\" because Answer:","output":"Too much jogging for elderly people can lead to several health issues, including: 1. Exhaustion: Prolonged jogging without proper rest and recovery can cause fatigue in elderly people, making them more vulnerable to injuries and reducing their ability to perform daily activities. 2. Shortness of breath: Excessive jogging can lead to labored breathing, especially if the individual has pre-existing respiratory issues like asthma or COPD. Prolonged shortness of breath can result in reduced stamina and can put unnecessary strain on the heart. 3. Heart attacks: Over-exertion during jogging, among other high-intensity exercises, can increase the risk of heart attacks in elderly people, especially those with existing cardiovascular diseases. The excessive strain on the heart can lead to an oxygen deficiency in the cardiac muscles, potentially resulting in a heart attack. 4. Blisters: Elderly people have thinner skin, which makes them more prone to blisters and skin injuries while jogging. Blisters can become painful and infected if not treated properly, affecting the individual's ability to continue exercising. 5. Diabetes: While this option may seem counterintuitive, as exercise is usually recommended to help manage diabetes, people with uncontrolled diabetes may experience exacerbated symptoms if they engage in intense exercise like jogging. Intense exercise can cause a surge in blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous for those with diabetes. In conclusion, the risk of heart attacks is one of the potential consequences of too much jogging for elderly people. However, other issues like exhaustion, shortness of breath, blisters, and complications related to diabetes are also possible. It is advisable for elderly people to consult a healthcare professional before starting a jogging routine, to ensure its safety and appropriateness for their individual health needs."},{"instruction":"Sa1933FengFasiayinaminnapumasoksaArtDepartmentofEducationInstitutesaNanjingCentralUniversity,atpag-aaralpaintingsiningnamayMastersXuBeihong,YanWenliang,LvsibaiatPanLiangyuatibapa.

Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

Context: Several magazines named after Donald Trump were published between 1997 and 2009. Trump Style, launched in February 1997, was available for free to VIP guests at Trump's hotel-casino properties, and was also available to residents of Trump's condominium buildings and members of his Mar-a-Lago club. Hypothesis: All of the residents of Trump's condominium buildings and members of his Mar-a-Lago club read a copy of Trump Style.","output":"Based on the context provided, it is not appropriate to draw the hypothesis that \\"all of the residents of Trump's condominium buildings and members of his Mar-a-Lago club read a copy of Trump Style\\" without making several assumptions. Below are the reasons and the assumptions that we would need to consider before coming to this conclusion. 1. Availability: The context states that Trump Style was available for free to VIP guests at Trump's hotel-casino properties, residents of Trump's condominium buildings, and members of his Mar-a-Lago club. While it is clear that the magazine was made accessible to these groups of people, it does not necessarily mean that every individual in those groups actually read the magazine. Assumption: We would have to assume that just because the magazine was available to these individuals, they all took the opportunity to read it. 2. Interest: People have varying interests, and the fact that Trump Style magazine was available does not guarantee that all the residents and club members found the content of the magazine appealing or relevant to their interests. Assumption: We would also have to assume that the magazine's content was of interest to all residents and club members, and uniformly compelled them to read it. 3. Time and Opportunity: Trump Style, launched in February 1997, was distributed over a period of 12 years until 2009. Given the prolonged time frame, there might be changes in the population of residents and club members, leading to some not being aware of the magazine or not having the chance to read it. Assumption: We would need to assume that throughout the magazine's distribution period, all residents and club members were continuously exposed to or aware of the magazine, ensuring they had the opportunity to read it. 4. Literacy and Language: Although it may seem like a minor factor, we cannot ignore the possibility that some of the residents or club members may not be able to read the magazine due to language barriers, literacy issues, or other factors that make accessing the content difficult. Assumption: We would need to assume that everyone in the target group was not only able to read the magazine but also shared a common language and comprehension level to engage with its content. In conclusion, while the context does provide information on how the Trump Style magazine was made available to specific groups of people, it does not offer concrete evidence to support the hypothesis that all of the residents of Trump's condominium buildings and members of his Mar-a-Lago club read a copy of the magazine. To arrive at this hypothesis, we would need to make multiple assumptions about the availability, interest, time, and literacy factors of the target audience. Additionally, further data on the readership and circulation of the magazine within these groups would be necessary to form a more accurate hypothesis."},{"instruction":"If Many can be found along Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills., can we conclude that \\"Wilshire Boulevard doesn't have any stores along it.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Wilshire Boulevard doesn't have any stores along it.\\" If Many can be found along Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, it might show that there are many things, like stores, restaurants, or even parks, along the street.

She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch?

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets. Question: \\"What source of money did bin Laden hold in Sudan?\\" Answer: \\"Inheritance\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Choose your answer from: (1). no; (2). yes;","output":"Answer: (1). no Explanation: The paragraph explicitly states that neither Bin Laden’s inheritance nor his assets in Sudan were a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, while he owned a number of businesses and other assets, these were not used to fund al Qaeda. Furthermore, the idea that Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance was deemed inaccurate when, in early 2000, the U.S. government discovered he received about 1 million per year from 1970 through 1994, but not from a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Therefore, it's incorrect to claim that Bin Laden used his inheritance as a source of money in Sudan."},{"instruction":"Here is an article: By ISABEL KERSHNER and PATRICK J.

JERUSALEM — Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, said on Monday that it had built and flown three types of unmanned aircraft against Israel, all variants of the Ababil-1, an Iranian-made drone. It said two of the drones were armed for attacks and one was intended for reconnaissance. Hamas’s military wing published a photograph that it says shows one of its drones. The image gives no direct indication of how big the aircraft is, what its capabilities are, where it came from or where or when the photo was taken. According to Jane’s Defence Weekly, the Iranian-made Ababil-1 is nine and a half feet long, with a range of about 150 miles, and is able to carry up to 88 pounds of payload, such as explosives or camera equipment. #صورة حصرية وخاصة بطائرة القسام أبابيل 1 المصنعة محلياً وبأيدي كتائب #القسام بفضل الله . pic.twitter.com/DqjvEyN7Kx The group also claimed on its website that it had mounted three drone sorties of at least two aircraft each over Israel on Monday, including one it said had hovered over the Tel Aviv headquarters of the Israel Defense Forces. A spokesman for the I.D.F. said that while he could not rule out other drone flights, he was not aware of any sortie over Tel Aviv. Israel has been talking about a threat of attacks by unmanned aircraft for several years. Compared with the rockets that militant groups typically fire into Israel, drones like the Ababil-1 are potentially capable of greater accuracy and more destructive power, but they also tend to be more susceptible to standard air defenses. In October 2012, the Israeli military said it had shot down a drone over the Negev desert in southern Israel, near Gaza, and was hunting for the wreckage. It did not say where the aircraft had come from. The following month, the military said it had “inflicted severe damage” on Hamas’s drone program with an airstrike. It published a video clip that it said showed a drone being tested on an airstrip in Khan Younis, in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, and then being stored in a warehouse. The video could not be independently verified. Hezbollah, the radical Shiite group in Lebanon, is also believed to have tried using Ababil-1 drones against Israel. The I.D.F. said in April 2013 that it had shot down a drone over the Mediterranean near Haifa that was trying to enter Israeli airspace.

He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife.

He decided to build it in a high density residential area. Where might he build it? - suburbs - city - the desert - vacant stores - suburban town The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer for James to build his new strip mall to attract a lot of traffic would be in a city or a suburban town. Both of these options have a high density residential population, which would lead to a greater potential for foot traffic and higher customer turnout. 1. City: Building a strip mall in the city has various advantages. Cities tend to have a higher population density, meaning there are more potential customers living in close proximity to the strip mall. Additionally, cities often have well-developed public transportation systems, allowing people from different parts of the city to visit the strip mall easily. Cities also generally have more businesses and offices, which can translate into higher foot traffic during lunch breaks or after work. In a city, James can tap into the vast customer base of urban-dwelling individuals, who often seek nearby shopping and entertainment options. 2. Suburban Town: A suburban town is another good option for locating a strip mall, especially in areas experiencing significant population growth. People living in the suburbs may prefer to shop at a nearby strip mall rather than taking the time and effort to commute to a city center. Additionally, suburban towns generally have lower commercial rent and land prices compared to cities, which can be advantageous in terms of cost savings. However, one thing to consider when choosing a suburban town location is the ease of accessibility for potential customers. Ensuring that the strip mall is close to major roadways or public transportation can significantly improve its attractiveness to shoppers. Building a strip mall in the suburbs or the desert might not be the best option, as those areas typically have lower population densities and may not provide enough foot traffic to support businesses in the strip mall. Similarly, building in an area with vacant stores might not be the most strategic choice, as it could indicate that the area is not suitable for commercial success. In summary, James should consider building his new strip mall in either a city or a suburban town to take advantage of the higher population density and potential for increased traffic.

He scored 183 goals for Manchester United during his time at the club from 2004 to 2017. It is important to note that the information might change over time as new players might surpass the current record. Wayne Rooney signed for Manchester United from Everton in the summer of 2004 for a transfer fee of £27 million, which was a record fee for a teenager in English football at the time. He made his debut for the Red Devils on 28 September 2004, scoring a hat-trick against Fenerbahçe in the UEFA Champions League. Over the course of his 13-year tenure at Manchester United, Rooney became one of the greatest players in the history of the club. He became the team's all-time leading goal scorer, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton's record of 249 goals. Rooney accomplished this incredible feat on 21 January 2017 when he scored his 250th goal for Manchester United against Stoke City. In addition to his Premier League goal-scoring record, Rooney has numerous accolades and achievements to his name, having won several domestic and international titles during his career. Some of his notable accomplishments with Manchester United include: 1. Premier League titles: 5 (2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, and 2012-13) 2. FA Cups: 1 (2015-16) 3. EFL Cups: 3 (2005-06, 2009-10, and 2016-17) 4. FA Community Shields: 4 (2007, 2010, 2011, and 2016) 5. UEFA Champions League: 1 (2007-08) 6. UEFA Europa League: 1 (2016-17) 7. FIFA Club World Cup: 1 (2008) Rooney re-joined Everton in July 2017, where he went on to score 10 more Premier League goals before leaving English football to join Major League Soccer side D.C. United. With 208 Premier League goals in total, Rooney is the second all-time leading goal scorer in the Premier League, only behind Alan Shearer, who scored 260 Premier League goals during his time at two clubs - Southampton and Blackburn Rovers. However, Rooney still holds the record for the most goals for one club in the Premier League, which is a testament to his talent, loyalty, and dedication during his illustrious career at Manchester United."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Q: No chemical process on the planet can match the output of what process?

The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which pack was preying more upon herds? Hint: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. The answer to this question is:","output":"The Mobutu pack was preying more upon herds."},{"instruction":"Question: What key details about chris elliott can be extracted from the following bio?

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering the complexity of human emotions, it's essential to recognize that they're not always clear-cut or exclusive. Psychological research reveals that our emotional responses are often influenced by numerous external and internal factors. Consequently, this can sometimes lead to the experience of mixed emotions, where seemingly contradictory feelings are experienced simultaneously, such as joy and sadness, or love and anger. Mixed emotions are a normal part of human experiences and can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of one's own emotional landscape. Researchers have found that accepting and embracing mixed emotions can actually improve psychological well-being as it allows for a more accurate representation of our reactions to situations and better self-awareness.

They remain politically neutral, do not seek public office, and are discouraged from voting, though individual members may participate in uncontroversial community improvement issues. Although they do not take part in politics, they respect the authority of the governments under which they live. They do not celebrate religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter, nor do they observe birthdays, nationalistic holidays, or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than Jesus. They feel that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect a nationalistic or political spirit. Their position is that these traditional holidays reflect Satan's control over the world. Witnesses are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthdays or other celebrations. Why do Jehovah Witnesses forego religious holidays and birthdays or other celebrations? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Jehovah's Witnesses forego religious holidays, birthdays, and other celebrations for a few key reasons rooted in their specific beliefs and interpretation of the Bible. These reasons can be broadly categorized under religious, historical, and spiritual aspects. 1. Religious Reasons: Jehovah's Witnesses believe in following the teachings and principles of the Bible as closely as possible. Their doctrine promotes that they should exclusively worship Jehovah, who is considered the only true God. They believe that celebrating holidays and birthdays may lead to the worship or honor of other gods, individuals, or entities, apart from Jehovah. This could potentially cause them to deviate from the core principle of focusing solely on Jehovah's worship. 2. Historical Reasons: Jehovah's Witnesses examine the origins of religious holidays and celebrations to identify any pagan influences. They assert that certain holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, have been heavily influenced by pagan rituals and practices. Therefore, they avoid participating in these celebrations to separate themselves from practices that are non-Christian or not directly related to their faith. Similarly, they perceive birthdays as having connections to ancient pagan customs, leading them to abstain from observing such occasions. 3. Spiritual Reasons: The organization teaches its members that the world is under Satan's control. Consequently, they feel that traditional holidays and celebrations are tools used by Satan to manipulate people into straying from the righteous path. By abstaining from these holidays and celebrations, Jehovah's Witnesses aim to maintain their spiritual purity and avoid being influenced by what they consider as Satan's control over the world. 4. Political Neutrality: Jehovah's Witnesses prioritize their allegiance to God's kingdom and remain politically neutral. This approach extends to abstaining from nationalistic holidays and other celebrations that might honor political figures or involve symbols of national pride. They seek to maintain a clear distinction between their spiritual lives and the secular world, emphasizing their loyalty to God's kingdom above all else. In summary, Jehovah's Witnesses forego religious holidays, birthdays, and other celebrations for various reasons, including religious principles, historical concerns, spiritual matters, and political neutrality. These factors contribute to their commitment to preserving their spiritual purity and maintaining a strong focus on worshipping Jehovah, thereby ensuring their adherence to the core tenets of their faith."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

How many yards will Brendan be able to cut after a week? Let's be accurate as possible.","output":"Brendan initially could cut 8 yards of grass per day. With the help of a lawnmower, his grass-cutting ability increased by 50%. To find how many additional yards he can cut per day, we will calculate 50% of 8: 50% of 8 = (50/100) * 8 = 0.5 * 8 = 4 yards per day. Now, add the additional 4 yards to the initial 8 yards: 8 yards + 4 yards = 12 yards per day. With the lawnmower, Brendan can now cut 12 yards of grass per day. To find out how many yards he will be able to cut after a week (7 days): Total yards cut in a week = yards cut per day * number of days Total yards cut in a week = 12 yards/day * 7 days = 84 yards.

Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R&B. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music. The album is also notable for being what originated the style and genre that came to be known as new jack swing.Containing autobiographical themes, a majority of the album's lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A&M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women. Following its release, Control became Jackson's first album to top the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and five of its commercial singles—\\"What Have You Done for Me Lately\\", \\"Nasty\\", \\"Control\\", \\"When I Think of You\\", and \\"Let's Wait Awhile\\"—peaked within the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.

Playing with toys is supposed to be an enjoyable means of training young children for life in society. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Many items are designed to serve as toys, but goods produced for other purposes can also be used. For instance, a small child may fold an ordinary piece of paper into an airplane shape and \\"fly it.\\" Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment. Some toys are produced primarily as collector's items and are intended for display only. - A glockenspiel (or , \\"Glocken\\": bells and \\"Spiel\\": game) is a percussion instrument composed of a set of tuned keys arranged in the fashion of the keyboard of a piano. In this way, it is similar to the xylophone; however, the xylophone's bars are made of wood, while the glockenspiel's are metal plates or tubes, thus making it a metallophone. The glockenspiel, moreover, is usually smaller and higher in pitch. - Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees, and other woody plants. It is an organic material, a natural composite of cellulose fibers which are strong in tension embedded in a matrix of lignin which resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber. - The Pixiphone was a range of toy glockenspiels ( although they were inaccurately labelled as xylophones on their packaging ) . The larger Pixiphones had a ' raiser - bar ' which could be used to end a note abruptly , rather than letting it fade naturally . Although marketed as a children 's toy , the Pixiphone could be tuned pitch - perfect and was very robust , resulting in many children using them at British schools . - Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red. Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger. - The xylophone (from the Greek words \\"xylon\\", \\"wood\\" + \\"phn\\", \\"sound, voice\\", meaning \\"wooden sound\\") is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars struck by mallets. Each bar is an idiophone tuned to a pitch of a musical scale, whether pentatonic or heptatonic in the case of many African and Asian instruments, diatonic in many western children's instruments, or chromatic for orchestral use. What is the relationship between 'pixiphone' and 'idiophone'? The answer to this question is:","output":"The relationship between 'pixiphone' and 'idiophone' lies in the fact that a pixiphone is a type of idiophone. An idiophone is a class of musical instruments that produce sound through the vibration of the instrument's body itself, without the use of strings, membranes, or columns of air. These instruments typically create sound by being struck, shaken, or scraped. A pixiphone is a particular type of idiophone, specifically a toy glockenspiel. It consists of a series of tuned metal plates or bars, arranged in a keyboard-like layout, and is played by striking the plates with mallets. Although marketed as a children's toy, the pixiphone can be tuned to produce pitch-perfect notes, and has been used in schools and music education settings. So, in summary, the pixiphone is a type of idiophone, as it generates sound through the vibrations of its metal plates when struck by a mallet."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice question: What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

A Democrat, Miller served as lieutenant governor from 1975 to 1991, 79th Governor of Georgia from 1991 to 1999, and as U.S. Senator from 2000 to 2005. Miller was a conservative Democrat. In 2004, he supported Republican President George W. Bush against the Democratic nominee John Kerry in the presidential election. Miller was elected governor of Georgia in 1990, defeating Republican Johnny Isakson (who later became his successor as U.S. Senator) after defeating Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and future Governor Roy Barnes in the primary. Miller campaigned on the concept of term limits and pledged to seek only a single term as governor. He later ran for and won re-election in 1994. James Carville was Miller's campaign manager. In 1991, Miller endorsed Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas for President of the United States. Miller gave the keynote speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In two oft-recalled lines, Miller said that President George H. W. Bush \\"just doesn't get it,\\" and he remarked of a statement by Vice President Dan Quayle: As governor, Miller was a staunch promoter of public education. He helped found the HOPE Scholarship, which paid for the college tuition of Georgia students who both established a GPA of 3.0 in high school and maintained the same while in college, and who were from families earning less than 66,000 per year. The HOPE Scholarships were funded by revenue collected from the state lottery. In December 1995, his office announced a proposal for 1 billion more in spending on education. HOPE won praise from national Democratic leaders. The HOPE Scholarship program still to this day provides Georgia students with an opportunity to attend a public college or university, who otherwise may have no opportunity to do so.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, the suggested answer is accurate and relevant to the question being asked. Prosecutors obtain evidence for criminal court through a variety of sources and methods in order to build a strong case against the accused individual. It is essential to validate this answer, as it provides a brief explanation of the prosecution's role and responsibility in a criminal trial. To present a more detailed answer, prosecutors gather evidence from multiple sources and through various means, which may include: 1. Police reports: When law enforcement officers investigate a crime, they compile a detailed report outlining the circumstances surrounding the incident, witness statements, and any physical evidence collected at the scene. Prosecutors review these reports to obtain valuable information that may support their case. 2. Witness testimony: Eyewitnesses or those with knowledge related to the crime are crucial sources of evidence. Prosecutors may interview these individuals and subpoena them to testify in court. 3. Expert testimony: In some cases, it may be necessary for the prosecution to call upon experts in various fields (e.g., forensics, ballistics, or psychiatry) to provide professional opinions and analysis, which can help to clarify specific points of the case or provide context for certain pieces of evidence. 4. Physical evidence: Prosecutors work closely with law enforcement agencies and forensic experts to analyze any physical evidence collected during the investigation. This can include weapon, blood, or other biological samples, as well as latent fingerprints, photographs, and surveillance footage. 5. Documentary evidence: This can include various written or electronic records, such as emails, text messages, phone records, financial statements, or other documents that are relevant to the case and can help establish the facts surrounding the alleged criminal activity. 6. Confessions or statements made by the accused: In some instances, the accused may make incriminating statements or confess to the crime. Such statements, if admissible in court, can be an essential piece of evidence that strengthens the prosecution's case. 7. Investigative work by detectives or other law enforcement officers: Law enforcement officers may conduct further interviews, surveillance, or investigative activities to gather additional evidence that can be presented in court. This can also include undercover operations and wiretaps. The task of assembling and presenting this evidence in court falls upon the prosecution, who must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the crime in question. This is done by weaving all the evidence together to create a narrative that demonstrates the accused's guilt, leaving no room for reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors. By verifying and validating this answer, you acknowledge the essential role prosecutors play in ensuring justice and maintaining the integrity of the criminal court system."},{"instruction":"Write a summary based on this article: The former congressman who's heading the National Rifle Association's school emergency response program that would include volunteers to help guard children says it makes sense because it's similar to placing air marshals on planes.

Context: Before we got married my husband and I lived in 4 different apartments all within the span of one year. The worst one of all of them was actually a great apartment, but our upstairs neighbors drove us positively insane. A list of their common antics: Blasting movies/music with the bass turned all the way up into the small hours of the morning, in their bedroom, which was directly above our bedroom Stomping, all day, every day, no matter what, always stomping. Sometimes running full speed around their apartment. It was a 1 bedroom and they had at least 4 adults (two couples) and at least 2 kids living there. They also always had company over. It was a nonsmoking complex but they smoked on their porch and tossed their butts over their balcony, which would leave them landing in our little porch. Constantly came out to find butts and trash in our potted plants and all over the ground. We had to call the sheriff on them once because one of the couples living there got in a very loud, very obvious domestic violence situation. We heard them screaming and throwing each other around. At one point the man smashed her head through the wall. The kicker was when they brought home one of those mini motorcycles and put it out on their porch. Their porch was made of slatted wood so there were gaps between the boards. The damn bike started leaking fuel (racing fuel no less) through the slats and on our porch (and all over our stuff). Ruined a table, some laundry I had air-drying out there and killed a few of our plants. Not only that but while this was happening they were throwing their butts down onto our porch too. Could have started a fire. Then there was the spitting. They would spit over the edge of their balcony and we complained so they started spitting THROUGH the floor boards so it was definitely intentional. I have never experienced a more trashy group of people. So glad to be out of that apartment and away from them now. Question: How does the writer feel about the stability of the family living above?

Translate this to English?","output":"We believe that identity and name issues are two separate matters. In detail, this statement suggests that the speaker considers the subjects of identity and name as distinct from each other. While both of them might be related, they are not synonymous and should be addressed individually. Let's discuss the implications of such a distinction. Identity is a complex concept that not only includes how a person or group defines itself but also how they are perceived by others. The identity of an individual or a group encompasses various aspects like nationality, ethnicity, religion, gender, social class, and culture. It represents the sum of one's experiences, beliefs, values, and relationships cultivated throughout life. Identity is fluid and can evolve over time, as people may adopt or abandon certain attributes due to various reasons. On the other hand, a name represents a specific label assigned to a person or a group that identifies it uniquely. In most cultures, the process of bestowing a name involves a certain degree of thought and reflection as it might mirror personal, familial, or social expectations. A name carries cultural and historical significance and can shape others' perceptions of the bearer. However, unlike identity, the name generally remains stable over an individual's lifetime, unless deliberately changed. Thus, the distinction between identity and name is fundamentally associated with the intricacies of what defines a person or a group and how they are recognized by others. It is essential to understand that while a name might, in some instances, reflect certain aspects of an individual's or group's identity, it cannot fully capture the entirety of what constitutes their identity. Furthermore, the name can occasionally become a source of misperception or stereotype that hinders accurate recognition of the individual or group's true identity. To summarize, while identity and name are correlated concepts, they should be considered as separate matters. Identity is a multifaceted and ever-changing element, shaped by numerous factors encapsulating the individual or group's experiences and characteristics. In contrast, a name represents a stable designation assigned to a person or a group, holding cultural and historical significance yet not entirely revealing the depth of their identity."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","output":"Sentence: The little brown dog happily jumped over the green, soft pillow.

He stumbles onto the set of a World War I movie and isn't sure if he has accidentally caused the death of one of the film's stunt men. The eccentric and autocratic director, Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), agrees to hide Cameron from the police if he will take the dead man's place. Cameron soon begins to suspect that Cross is putting him in excessive danger. At a bar one night, another member of the production gets drunk and tells Cameron that Eli almost killed the helicopter pilot during the fatal accident Cameron caused, because he insisted he keep flying in order to get the shot. Cameron falls in love with Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the film's star, and is devastated to find out that she and Eli slept together before he met her. The boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred as Cross exercises godlike control over the production. During a screening of some footage for Nina's parents who are visiting the production, a nude sex scene with Nina is shown. Eli appears to be mortified, but allows the footage to play anyway. He waits until Nina is just about to shoot a traumatic scene the next day to tell her that her parents have seen the footage of her naked. It causes her to cry with humiliation, which seems to be the exact emotion Eli needs from her in the scene.

The car of Kayla was more dull than that of Carrie because Possible answers: [+] Kayla had not polished their car.. [+] Carrie had not polished their car..","output":"The car of Kayla was more dull than that of Carrie because Kayla had not polished her car in quite a long time. Kayla had been extremely busy balancing work, school, and personal responsibilities. As a result, she simply couldn't find the spare time to give her car the attention it required to maintain a spotless and polished appearance. This was in stark contrast to Carrie, who devoted a chunk of her weekend routine to maintaining the pristine condition of her vehicle. Carrie was known to have a keen interest in cars in general, and she particularly took pride in maintaining the perfect aesthetics and performance of her own car. Every weekend, she would allocate several hours to properly wash, clean, and polish her car inside and out to ensure that it always looked its best. Furthermore, she would treat the leather seats with conditioner, vacuum the carpets, and even use air fresheners that added a pleasant scent to the car's interior. She enjoyed giving attention to every little detail that helped contribute to the car's immaculate appearance. In addition to their dedication to their vehicles, the two friends also had different preferences when it came to the brands and models of the cars they owned. Kayla owned a reliable, fuel-efficient sedan that served as her daily driver. It was functional and practical, but didn't necessarily have the glamour factor or performance to rival some of the more luxurious and sporty car models. Carrie, on the other hand, was fascinated by sports cars and had managed to save up enough to treat herself to a sleek, high-performance coupe. Its elegantly designed exterior, coupled with the luxurious interior, commanded attention and admiration from everyone who saw it. The glossy paintwork accentuated the car's curves and added an extra layer of sparkle in the sunlight. However, it was important to understand that both Kayla and Carrie had their reasons and priorities when it came to their respective vehicles. Kayla focused on the practicality and fuel efficiency of her car, which allowed her to handle her busy schedule without the added stress of worrying about potential automotive issues or spending more money on fuel. Carrie derived great pleasure from owning a car that, to her, represented success and her passion for automobiles, and this motivated her to invest the extra time and effort to keep it looking flawless. Therefore, it can be concluded that the car of Kayla was more dull than that of Carrie because Kayla had not polished her car for a significant amount of time. The difference in their vehicles' appearances was primarily due to their contrasting interests and routines. While Kayla prioritized convenience and functionality, Carrie took great pride in the aesthetics of her car and consistently devoted time and effort towards maintaining its polished and pristine appearance."},{"instruction":"Pick one category for the following text.

Answer:","output":"\\"Medical building\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense for the given question stems from the contextual understanding that a dental office is a place where specific healthcare services are provided. While dental offices can be located in an urban area, strip mall, office, or town, the most appropriate and logical association for people's understanding comes with the term \\"medical building.\\" A medical building is a specialized facility designed to accommodate various health care providers such as doctors, dentists, therapists, and other medical professionals. It serves as a centralized location where patients can access different medical services, which helps streamline the process of receiving care. The building is equipped with all the necessary installations, complies with health code requirements, and ensures that patients will find the appropriate facilities for their healthcare needs. Since dental offices fall under the category of healthcare providers, it would be natural for people to think of them in the context of a medical building. Most people are familiar with the concept of medical buildings serving as central hubs for healthcare professionals, and therefore, would quickly associate a dental office with such a facility. Moreover, locating dental offices within medical buildings offers various advantages. It simplifies scheduling appointments and referral processes among healthcare providers, provides shared resources and equipment, and fosters a collaborative environment in patient care. Additionally, the concentration of healthcare providers offers a sense of convenience and accessibility for patients, which is highly appreciated in society.

In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now).

In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \\"|||||\\". Your task is to summarize them. The Hughes Glomar Explorer was more than just a giant ship — it was a giant secret, possibly the biggest and strangest covert operation the CIA pulled off during the Cold War. But now, 40 years after its original mission, it’s finally headed to the scrapyard. The ship, now called GSF Explorer, had been retrofitted for oil drilling and exploration since it left US Navy service in 1997. But with the price of oil falling worldwide, its owner Transocean has decided to scrap it, along with several other vessels. The ship’s origin story began in March 1968, when a Soviet Golf II class ballistic missile nuclear submarine, the K-129, sank in the Pacific Ocean. This was at the height of a high-risk cat-and-mouse game between the USA and the USSR. After the Soviet Navy failed to pinpoint the location of the wreckage, the US Navy found it. So the CIA decided to raise it off the seabed. They called this mission “Project Azorian,” and its details have been an official secret for decades. It took three years for retired CIA employee David Sharp to get permission to publish in 2012 his account of the mission and his role. Sharp was at the engineering meetings where they tried to come up with a way to do what was at the time considered impossible, to pull up a huge object from an ocean depth of nearly 17,000 feet, or three miles. “I think given a better background in marine engineering, we likely would not have tried” what they did, Sharp says. Luckily, the CIA also brought in skilled contractors like the deepwater drilling experts Global Marine (whose truncated name “Glomar” adorns the vessel). What they designed may never be seen again: The Hughes Glomar Explorer itself was massive — too wide to fit in the Panama Canal — and it was built to heave up and down on waves while its center held steady, lifting an enormous claw with the K-129 wreckage inside. Every piece of this hydraulic lifting apparatus was its own engineering nightmare, from the gymbals with bowling-ball-sized ball bearings, to the heave compensators and derrick that had to handle 14 million pounds of submarine, claw, and heavy pipe string. Lockheed engineers designed the “claw” itself, more accurately called a “capture vehicle,” and got it into the HGE via an elaborate submersible barge (echoes of which a few people detected during the 2013’s not-as-awesome Google Barge mystery). It would be impossible for the US military to build such a huge and complicated ship, or to bring it out on the high seas, without getting the attention of the Soviets. Hence the true wonder of Project Azorian: its commercial cover story, one that puts the movie “Argo” to shame. From about 1970-74, the CIA managed to convince the world that billionaire inventor Howard Hughes had decided to invest millions to mine “manganese nodules,” balls of heavy metals that lie on the ocean floor. Via fake press releases, events, technical specs and front companies, the CIA convinced the world that Hughes was leading a new ocean-mining rush. In the end, the expensive mission was only a partial success: the ship’s lifting apparatus broke apart about 9000 feet below the surface, and the majority of the K-129 fell back to the floor of the ocean. It was impossible to retrieve without building a new claw, and before that could happen, details of the mission broke in the press. That didn’t stop the CIA from trying to keep it under wraps for as long as possible, leading to its notorious “Glomar Response” to Freedom of Information Act requests: the non-answer “we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the materials requested.” That answer has held up in court over the decades and proliferated among federal and even local government agencies. It was also the inspiration for the extra-dry humor of the CIA’s first tweet. We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet. — CIA (@CIA) June 6, 2014 Hughes Glomar Explorer entered popular culture in other ways, as conspiracy theories have swirled around the K-129 and the mission to retrieve it. One of them is promulgated in the 2005 book “Red Star Rogue” by Kenneth Sewell and Clint Richmond. The book became the basis of the 2013 drama \\"Phantom,\\" which features Ed Harris and David Duchovny as Soviet military officers who sip vodka in a very un-Russian way. In 2006, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers declared Hughes Glomar Explorer an historic landmark. “Grasping and raising a 2,000-ton object in 17,000 feet of water in the central Pacific Ocean was a truly historic challenge, requiring a recovery system of unprecedented size and scope,” ASME wrote. Americans can remember the whole affair for its daring, hubris, disappointment and secrecy. But for the loved ones of the Soviet sailors who died on the K-129, the words “Hughes Glomar Explorer” are more bitter. The Soviet government tried for 30 years to keep the fate of the submarine a secret from the families. After the USSR fell apart, both the Russian and US governments decided to make a clean slate of it, and then-US Defense Secretary Robert Gates delivered some of the intelligence on Project Azorian to the Russian government, along with artifacts from the chunk of the submarine the CIA managed to retrieve. Gates also released a secret video of a funeral at sea for the remains of six Soviet sailors that were pulled up from the ocean floor. It remains one of the strangest artifacts of the entire Cold War — the other being ship itself, but it appears that one will not be with us for much longer. Giant floating Museum of Secrecy, anyone?

Christened the Hughes Glomar Explorer, after billionaire Howard Hughes was brought in on the CIA's deception, the 619-foot vessel eventually became part of the fleet of ships used by Swiss company Transocean to drill for oil. But the oil price rout means the former spy ship now called GSF Explorer is just one of 40 such offshore drilling rigs that have been consigned to scrap since last year. It's the end of a story that began when a Soviet G-II sub called the K-129 sank in September 1968 \\"with all hands, 16,500 feet below the surface of the Pacific\\", according to an official U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) history. The sub sank with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and nearly 100 sailors, according to declassified documents at George Washington University's National Security Archive. According to the CIA history of the mission, called \\"Project Azorian\\", the Soviet Union failed to locate the sub in a massive two-month search, but the United States found it, 1,500 miles (2,400 km) northwest of Hawaii. The CIA wanted to get its hands on the nuclear missiles, as well as cryptography gear to break Soviet codes, but needed a cover story because any recovery ship would quickly be spotted by its Cold War foe. The CIA brought billionaire Hughes in on the secret. Under a meticulously crafted fiction, the ship was built for Hughes at Pennsylvania's Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Co, because he needed it to mine sea-bed manganese nodules. \\"If the Russians had become aware of the real purpose of the mission, we'd have had to cancel it, and all the money would go down the drain,\\" David Sharp, a 50-year CIA veteran from Maryland who was the 1974 mission's deputy for recovery operations, told Reuters in an interview. COVER BLOWN While the CIA has over the years lavished billions on covert planes and spacecraft, Jeffrey T. Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security Archive, told Reuters: \\"They have not built anything so elaborate as the Glomar for such a limited mission\\". Too wide for the Panama Canal, the Hughes Glomar Explorer, also named after the company Global Marine Inc. that designed it, rounded Cape Horn to reach the Pacific. In August 1974, its huge mechanical claw raised a 145-foot section of the K-129 Soviet sub. Sharp, now 81, who published \\"The CIA's Greatest Covert Operation\\" in 2011 after years of wrangling with the agency over classified material, acknowledged the audacious mission was not a complete operational success. The claw failed, he said, and only the sub's bow, with the bodies of six Russian sailors but no missiles or code equipment, was brought to the surface. The operation's secrecy was shattered after a June 1974 break-in at Hughes' Los Angeles headquarters, where the haul likely included a memo linking the mission to the billionaire. The circle within the government and law enforcement that knew of the project widened. The Los Angeles Times ran a story in February 1975. \\"The source of the leak was never identified,\\" the CIA said. \\"With Glomar's cover blown, the White House canceled further recovery operations.\\" The Glomar's mission has a Cold War postscript: In 1992, then-CIA Director Robert Gates gave Russian President Boris Yeltsin a decades-old video of the six sailors' burial at sea. A GLOMAR RESPONSE Converted to a deepwater drill ship in 1997 and renamed the GSF Explorer, the vessel was bought by Transocean in 2010 and has been deployed by the world's largest offshore driller from the Gulf of Mexico to Angola. Its stern has a helicopter landing pad and the vessel is topped by a towering 170-foot tall derrick, so it can drill to depths of up to 30,000 feet. In its heyday, the ship was hired out for more than 400,000 a day, could house a crew of 160 and was held steady for drilling in heavy seas by 11 powerful thrusters. But with falling oil prices approaching 40 a barrel and demand for exploration from companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP plunging, old ships without contracts or facing hefty maintenance bills are being culled. Transocean, whose Deepwater Horizon drill rig explosion in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico caused the largest offshore environmental disaster in U.S. history, condemned the GSF Explorer in April. Altogether, the company is scrapping some 20 vessels, shelving deliveries of new ultra-deepwater drillships, forecasting 2 billion in writedowns and cancelling its interim dividend. Houston's Diamond Offshore and London's Noble Corp have also consigned about a dozen ships to scrap since last year. \\"We've seen the largest number of floaters being scrapped over two consecutive years,\\" said Rystad Energy analyst Joachim Bjorni in Norway. But no \\"floater\\" destined for the world's scrap yards is quite like the GSF Explorer. Transocean declined to name the vessel's buyer, nor where it will be scrapped, fitting for a ship whose original name has become synonymous with U.S. government secrecy. After the CIA's initial refusal to acknowledge its \\"Project Azorian\\" in 1975 with a \\"neither confirm or deny\\" reply, such answers became know as \\"Glomar responses\\".

Her first album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released in November 2009 and became the UK's best-selling debut album of all time, beating the previous record held by Spirit by Leona Lewis. I Dreamed a Dream set a record for biggest first week sales by a debut album, according to the Official Chart Company in the United Kingdom. In August 2008, Boyle applied for an audition for the third series of Britain's Got Talent (as contestant number 43212) and was accepted after a preliminary audition in Glasgow. When Boyle first appeared on Britain's Got Talent at the city's Clyde Auditorium, she said that she aspired to become a professional singer \\"as successful as Elaine Paige\\". Boyle sang \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from Les Miserables in the first round, which was watched by over 10 million viewers when it aired on 11 April 2009. Programme judge Amanda Holden remarked upon the audience's initially cynical attitude, and the subsequent \\"biggest wake-up call ever\\" upon hearing her performance. Boyle was \\"absolutely gobsmacked\\" by the strength of the reaction to her appearance. Afterwards, Paige expressed interest in singing a duet with Boyle, and called her \\"a role model for everyone who has a dream\\". Boyle's rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was credited with causing a surge in ticket sales in the Vancouver production of Les Miserables. Cameron Mackintosh, the producer of the musical, also praised the performance, as \\"heart-touching, thrilling and uplifting\\". Boyle was one of 40 acts that were put through to the semi-finals. She appeared last on the first semi-final on 24 May 2009, performing \\"Memory\\" from the musical Cats. In the public vote, she was the act to receive the highest number of votes to go through to the final. She was the clear favourite to win the final, but ended up in second place to dance troupe Diversity; the UK TV audience was a record of 17.3 million viewers. The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) became concerned by press reports about Boyle's erratic behaviour and speculation about her mental condition and wrote to remind editors about clause 3 (privacy) of their code of press conduct. The day after the final, Boyle was admitted to The Priory, a private psychiatric clinic in London, Talkback Thames explained, \\"Following Saturday night's show, Susan is exhausted and emotionally drained.\\" Her stay in hospital attracted widespread attention, with Prime Minister Gordon Brown wishing her well. Cowell offered to waive Boyle's contractual obligation to take part in the BGT tour. Her family said \\"she's been battered non-stop for the last seven weeks and it has taken its toll [...but...] her dream is very much alive,\\" as she had been invited to the Independence Day celebrations at the White House.

He'd expected to see Kenyan runner Hyvon Ngetich. According to reports he'd received from the race course, she had been leading most of the race. But with just two-tenths of a mile left to run, Ngetich began to wobble and stagger, and eventually fell down. She attempted to get back up and keep running but was unsuccessful, Conley said.

Despite her faltering steps, Ngetich refused to give up, and with sheer determination, she began to crawl towards the finish line. As the crowd's cheers grew louder and more intense, volunteers and medical staff took notice and hovered nearby, ready to help her, but respecting her desire to finish the race on her own terms. With every agonizing inch, Ngetich displayed an inspiring level of grit and tenacity, her face etched with both pain and resolve. The spectators began to chant her name, their voices rising in a deafening roar, encouraging her to push past her limits. As the finish line came into sight, Ngetich gathered her remaining strength and managed to pull herself across the line, collapsing in a heap moments later. Medical staff immediately tended to her, providing care and ensuring her wellbeing. Despite not winning the race, her relentless spirit captivated the hearts of everyone in attendance. Ngetich ultimately placed third that day, but her courageous effort transcended the race results. Her story quickly gained international attention, making her a symbol of resilience and determination. John Conley recalled her performance as one of the most inspiring things he had ever witnessed in his career as a race director, and her story sparked conversations about the indomitable human spirit around the globe. In the weeks that followed, Ngetich's determination served as an inspiration not only for fellow athletes but for people from all walks of life who faced their own challenges. She was invited to schools, conferences, and interviews to share her experience and inspire others to tackle their own obstacles with a relentless spirit. Ngetich's story will forever be remembered as a powerful reminder that sometimes the greatest victories are not found in the act of winning, but in the courageous pursuit of a goal, regardless of how insurmountable it might seem."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Mr. Marchionne was treated at Zurich’s University Hospital for complications after undergoing what Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said was a surgical procedure on his right shoulder in July. The health issues forced the company to unexpectedly remove him as CEO on Saturday, speeding up a departure planned for early 2019 after a decade at the helm of the Italian-American auto maker. Exor SpA, the company that controls Fiat Chrysler, on Wednesday announced Mr. Marchionne’s death. While less known among the general public than predecessors such as Lee Iacocca, Mr. Marchionne was a star in the auto industry, and his death marks an end of an era in Detroit where he was one of the last larger-than-life CEOs. He relished challenging auto industry orthodoxy, and was ahead of rivals on some key automotive trends. In a tweet late Wednesday, President Donald Trump called Mr. Marchionne “one of the most brilliant and successful car executives since the days of the legendary Henry Ford.” Broker Evercore ISI called him “one of the most formidable and successful CEOs in the industry’s history.” Born in Chieti near Italy’s Adriatic coast on June 17, 1952, Mr. Marchionne moved with his parents to the Toronto area in 1966, according to Mondo Agnelli, a book about Fiat’s deal for Chrysler. Mr. Marchionne went to university and law school in Canada, where he later worked for Deloitte & Touche. In the 1980s, he made his way back to Europe, taking a series of increasingly high-level jobs at several industrial companies based in Switzerland. Mr. Marchionne joined the board of Fiat in 2003 as head of Geneva-based SGS Group , then partly owned by the auto maker’s founding family. The following year he was vaulted into the CEO’s job at Fiat to fill a leadership vacuum at the top. His restructuring of the problem-plagued Italian auto maker was helped by a 2 billion deal he struck with General Motors Co. in 2005, which allowed the American giant to exit a contract negotiated five years earlier that would have forced it to buy the 80% of Fiat’s car business it didn’t already own. By the 2008 financial crisis, Chrysler LLC’s then-owner Cerberus Capital Management was looking to sell, and Mr. Marchionne was ready for the deal that would define his career. Underwritten by nearly 8 billion in loans from the U.S. and Canadian governments, Fiat took control of Chrysler after it filed for bankruptcy protection and wasted little time pushing out longtime executives, closing dealerships and reimagining its lineup. Mr. Marchionne, who was known to wear a black sweater every day, had said he would wear a tie for FCA’s June 1 industrial plan presentation if the company had managed to pay back debt by then. It had, and Chairman John Elkann gave him a tie to wear. Photo: Luca Bruno/Associated Press Instead of taking an office in an imposing tower for senior management on the campus of Chrysler’s headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., he set up his desk on the fourth floor of the adjoining technology center. He set a grueling seven-days-a-week pace, flying back and forth between Italy and the U.S. on a private plane. A self-described workaholic, Mr. Marchionne carried a stack of up to five smartphones and wore a black sweater and jeans daily, even when visiting dignitaries and leaders such as President Donald Trump. Mr. Marchionne kept about 30 sweaters and pairs of jeans in each of his homes in Michigan, Turin and Switzerland, allowing him to travel with minimal luggage. “I have identical clothes everywhere I live. Down to the socks,” he said in a 2011 interview. He also was known to gulp down espressos and chain-smoke Muratti brand cigarettes, a habit company officials say he gave up about a year ago. Mr. Marchionne loved playing poker on his trans-Atlantic flights, according to company officials, and he wasn’t afraid to fold early when dealt a losing hand—at the card table, or when assessing corporate strategy. His initial plan to import Fiat models to the U.S. and use its small-car technology on Chrysler vehicles was one such example. As part of the bailout agreement with the U.S., Fiat agreed to build an American-made compact capable of getting 40 miles per gallon. But that car—the Dodge Dart—was a poor seller, an early indication U.S. consumers were moving away from sedans and into larger vehicles. Mr. Marchionne canceled nearly all of Fiat Chrysler’s sedans for the U.S. market—including the Dart and Chrysler 200 models—and moved aggressively to retool U.S. factories to ramp up production of Jeep sport-utility vehicles and Ram pickup trucks which commanded premium prices. That move was later mimicked by Ford Motor Co. , which this spring said it would phase out nearly all U.S. sedans. General Motors Co. is expected to pare its sedan lineup as well. A longtime proponent of auto-industry consolidation, Mr. Marchionne made waves among peers in 2015 with a 25-page PowerPoint manifesto titled “Confessions of a Capital Junkie.” In it, the CEO chided the car industry’s “value-destroying addiction to capital,” with charts and graphs showing the industry as a laggard in enterprise value and return on invested capital compared with other sectors. He challenged his fellow auto makers to consider consolidation to unlock stronger shareholder returns. Many auto executives agreed with the unflinching assessment of their industry, but some saw Mr. Marchionne’s missive as a thinly veiled plea for a merger or acquisition partner. Indeed, within weeks of his issuing his report, he began a heretical public courtship of General Motors Co., arguing that combining the longtime rivals would provide the scale needed to survive the next downturn. GM executives swiftly swatted down the idea, insisting the company had the size and long-term vision to go it alone. Executives from other auto makers also poured cold water on the notion of combining with Fiat Chrysler. In a June 2015 conference call with analysts, Ford finance chief Bob Shanks said such a marriage “would be doubling down on the past.” Over the past two years as Fiat Chrysler’s fortunes turned sharply upward, Mr. Marchionne began to indicate he was prepared to have the company go it alone. By earlier this year, he said he was done looking for a merger partner. Fiat Chrysler’s stock price nearly quadrupled over the past four years of his tenure, earning him praise from Wall Street analysts, a group that once considered his quest to resuscitate Fiat and Chrysler as doomed. During a first-quarter conference call with analysts in January, Morgan Stanley ’s Adam Jonas admitted that he was a onetime skeptic who had come around full circle. “In 2004, when you were first introduced to the auto industry, a lot of people were thinking, ‘Who the hell is this guy?’ Right? I was one of them, frankly,” Mr. Jonas said. “There are many hundreds of thousands of families across many nations that are better off because of you and your team. God bless you, Sergio. We’re never going to see anyone like you again.” —Mike Colias and Eric Sylvers contributed to this article.

And the man who runs Fiat and Chrysler worldwide says therein lies a lesson. Speaking to reporters following a speech, Marchionne talked about choices in fashion, and choices in the world at large. Here’s how he put it: “I prioritize in the morning. I made a decision to start wearing black sweaters and pants a long time ago, because (otherwise) I have to make a choice between spending three seconds deciding whether to wear a blue one or a black one, and I don’t want to spend the three seconds.” ||||| Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne had planned to retire next year. He had spoken to reporters about his soon-to-be deliverance from a job to which he devoted 24 hours a day, sleeping on planes, seldom seeing loved ones. It is likely that Chrysler wouldn’t exist today without his sacrifices. Accounts are sketchy, but a surgery this month didn’t end well, leaving him in what reports bleakly call a grave condition. His untimely fate will send a shiver through workaholics everywhere, not to mention all who need multiple packs... ||||| LISTEN TO ARTICLE 6:00 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email Sergio Marchionne, the former chief executive officer of Fiat Chrysler and architect of the automaker’s dramatic turnaround, has died. He was 66. Marchionne died on Wednesday at a Zurich hospital, just days after he had been replaced as CEO, according to Exor NV, the holding company of Fiat’s founding Agnelli family. His health had declined suddenly following complications from shoulder surgery, according to people familiar with the situation. “Sergio Marchionne, man and friend, is gone,” Fiat Chairman John Elkann said in a statement. “My family and I will be forever grateful for what he has done,” said Elkann, who is also chairman and CEO of Exor. Sergio Marchionne Photographer: Alessandra Benedetti/Bloomberg Selected as CEO of Fiat SpA in June 2004, Marchionne took the Italian manufacturer from the brink of bankruptcy to the New York Stock Exchange, where he rang the bell on Oct. 13, 2014, to mark the debut of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, the London company created when Fiat bought the Detroit carmaker. Marchionne, who described himself as a corporate fixer, was Fiat’s fifth CEO in less than two years when he took over. He replaced Giuseppe Morchio, who quit after the billionaire Agnelli family refused to give him the joint title of chairman and CEO when then-Chairman Umberto Agnelli died of cancer. Marchionne was handed an automaker that lost more than 6 billion euros (7 billion) in 2003. By 2005, he had returned the company to a profit by wringing some 2 billion from an alliance with General Motors Co., laying off thousands of workers, introducing new models, and slashing the time it took to get a new car to market to just 18 months, from four years. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration announced that Fiat would take control of Chrysler LLC, rescuing the American company from bankruptcy. “I don’t care what a tough guy he was to work for, he saved our company,” said Cass Burch, a Chrysler and Jeep dealer in Georgia. “He deserves a bronze statue.” Fiat CEO Marchionne on Leadership Changes, Profit Margins, Dividends The deal gave Marchionne “a huge sense of responsibility,” he said in a 2011 interview. His office on the fourth floor of Fiat’s Turin headquarters was adorned with a black-and-white poster of the word “competition” and a Picasso print bearing the motto, “Every act of creation is first of all an act of destruction.” During his tenure at Fiat, Marchionne boosted the company’s value more than 10-fold by restructuring the auto business and separating assets. Among the biggest spinoffs was the 2015 listing of supercar-maker Ferrari NV, where Marchionne also served as CEO and chairman.

He knew how to move fast and enjoyed driving his half-dozen Ferraris. “When you’re pissed off, there’s nothing better than this,” he said, stomping on the accelerator of his black Enzo at the company’s test track in 2014 and pushing the car from a comfortable 120 miles per hour to something over 200. Sergio Marchionne with a Ferrari GTC4 Lusso automobile in 2016. Photographer: Jason Alden/Bloomberg Fueled by a dozen espressos a day and packs of Muratti cigarettes, he stormed into Fiat and fired most of the top management, then did the same at Chrysler in 2009, installing a dozen newcomers on his second day. He also knew speed can be dangerous. In 2007, he wrecked a 350,000 Ferrari on a highway in Switzerland. “In the car business, sometimes you crash,” he said. Yet even as he garnered criticism from politicians and unions for slashing jobs and cutting costs, Marchionne argued that moving slowly could be even more risky. When he took over both Fiat and Chrysler, he always maintained, the companies needed radical change in order to survive. Marchionne “helped build a growing company that provides job stability and certainty,” said United Auto Workers Vice President Cindy Estrada. “The success of his vision changed people’s lives. That is a rich legacy.” Consolidation Push The Chrysler deal was part of a long-standing campaign Marchionne had waged to spur consolidation in the auto industry, which he claimed had far too much capacity for all players to survive. To that end, he publicly campaigned for a merger with General Motors Co. in 2015 but was rebuffed by the U.S. carmaker. “Sergio created a remarkable legacy in the automotive industry,” Mary Barra, chairman and CEO of General Motors said in a statement. Ford Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford praised Marchionne “as one of the most respected leaders in the industry whose creativity and bold determination helped to restore Chrysler to financial health.” Marchionne had planned to leave Fiat in 2019, but with his health deteriorating, on July 21 he was replaced as CEO of Fiat Chrysler by Mike Manley, head of the Jeep and Ram brands. Louis C. Camilleri took over at Ferrari, and Suzanne Heywood succeeded Marchionne as chairman of truck and farm-equipment maker CNH Industrial NV. Some Italian media reports said Marchionne had cancer. People close to Marchionne told Bloomberg News that he died of cardiac arrest and didn’t have cancer.

Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Marchionne was born on June 17, 1952, in Chieti, a hilltop town near the Adriatic sea in central Italy. His father was a local policeman, and when Marchionne was 14 the family moved to Toronto. A chartered accountant and attorney with dual Canadian and Italian citizenship, Marchionne began his career in Canada at Deloitte & Touche, then moved on to packaging producer Lawson Group. In 1994, Marchionne joined Alusuisse Lonza Group Ltd. after the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical company acquired Lawson. Three years later, as Alusuisse CEO, he spun off the drug business to create Lonza Group AG, where he tripled profit in three years. He later consolidated his reputation as a turnaround specialist at SGS SA, a Geneva-based product-testing company at the time controlled by the Agnelli family.

The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place. Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop. But such heady progress would soon come to a halt. The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles–Salt Lake line. Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility. Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada's new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling. These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents. But the southwest's growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity. Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas. Providing an influx of 165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada. More Government Help: The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however. The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time. The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam's 1935 dedication set the city's now-formidable public relations machine into action. They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted. It didn't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an \\"anything goes\\" attitude. Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night). Question: \\"What circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents?\\" Answer: \\"Drought and heat\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer \\"Drought and heat\\" is not correct based on the paragraph. The circumstances that threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community were the elimination of the Las Vegas repair facility by Union Pacific and the outlawing of gambling in 1909 by the Nevada legislature. These events could have caused economic decline and made it difficult for Las Vegas to support its 3000 residents."},{"instruction":"OK. You'll be given the following question. Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Which of these sentences doesn't make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"He is taller than me by a head.\\" - Sentence B: \\"He is taller than me by a train.\\"","output":"Sentence B: \\"He is taller than me by a train.\\" doesn't make sense. Chain-of-thought reasoning: 1. In both sentences, we are comparing the height of two people. 2. In Sentence A, the comparison is made by saying someone is \\"taller than me by a head.\\" This means that the height difference between the two people is approximately the same as the length from the chin to the top of the head of the taller person. This is a commonly used expression for comparing heights, and it is easy to understand the meaning. 3. Sentence B says, \\"He is taller than me by a train.\\" The phrase \\"by a train\\" is not a standard way to describe a difference in height. A train is a large vehicle used for transportation, and its use in this context is confusing and unclear. 4. When we think of measurements involving trains, we often think about the length of the train or the distance it travels rather than height. Additionally, trains have considerable variations in sizes, making it an imprecise and unusual unit for height comparison. In conclusion, Sentence B: \\"He is taller than me by a train.\\" doesn't make sense due to the non-standard and unclear use of a train as a unit for height comparison."},{"instruction":"Summarize: You can find these kits at hardware stores and plumbing supply retailers. A kit should include sheets of insulating foam, adhesive, an adhesive application tool, and instructions. Alternatively, you can create your own tank insulation kit by buying a standard size yoga mat and a tube of high-quality waterproof adhesive. Unless you find a good deal on the yoga mat, however, the price difference may not be that great. Turn off the water supply by turning the oval valve at the end of the supply line clockwise. Remove the lid of the toilet tank and set it aside. Flush the toilet to drain nearly all the water from the toilet tank. For now, leave the small amount of water that remains in the tank. It will help you clean out the tank. Use your preferred spray-based cleaner and a handled scrub brush. Scrub away as much of the rust-colored buildup on the tank's interior sides and bottom as you can. Dip your brush into the water in the bottom of the tank occasionally to rinse it off. Cleaning off the walls will make the adhesive for the insulation hold better. Once you've cleaned off most of the buildup, rinse down the interior walls with clean water, then flush again to empty away most of this water. Use a turkey baster to suck up the remaining water in the tank, or use a sponge to sop it up. Your goal is to remove all standing water from the tank. Your fastest option is to wave a hair dryer on high power back and forth throughout the tank for 10-15 minutes. Or, you can try one of the following: Position a space heater so that it is blowing hot, dry air into the tank. Check it at least every half-hour and leave it running until the porcelain is dry to the touch. Clip a work light with a 100 watt incandescent bulb to the top edge of the tank. Position it so the bulb is inside the tank. The heat of the bulb will dry the tank in roughly 12 hours. A toilet tank insulation kit comes with sheets of flexible styrofoam that you can cut to fit. Estimate the size and shape of the bottom and sides of your tank interior, and cut the pieces as needed. Follow the same process if you're using a yoga mat instead of an insulation kit. Always estimate on the larger side first, then cut the pieces smaller as needed. There should be extra sheets if you make a mistake. You'll have to cut around some obstructions within the tank, like the flush valve and the flapper. If you're using a kit, apply the included adhesive to the back of each sheet of cut insulation with the included wooden stick (basically, a popsicle stick). Try to spread a fairly even layer over the entire surface. Then, press each sheet in place against the tank interior. If you're using a cut-up yoga mat as your insulation, choose a high-quality, waterproof glue or sealant as your adhesive. Apply it according to the product instructions. This gives the adhesive time to fully set. After waiting, just turn the water supply valve counterclockwise to fill the tank back up. Then put the lid back on and you're all set! Insulating the interior should make a noticeable reduction in the amount of condensation on the outside of the tank.","output":"A toilet tank insulation kit helps to keep the tank from getting too cold and wet on the outside. You can find these kits or make one yourself using a yoga mat and glue. First, turn off the water and clean the inside of the toilet tank. Then, dry it using a hairdryer, space heater, or light bulb. Next, cut the foam or yoga mat to fit the inside of the tank and glue them in place. Wait for the glue to dry before turning the water back on and putting the lid back on. This should help keep the outside of the tank dry and there's less water everywhere!"},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Austin told Sasha's wife that he loved her as a sister and friend.

Ajan mittaan tällainen toiminta on murentanut kansalaisten luottamusta valtiollisiin instituutioihin ja byrokratian toimintaan. On tärkeää huomata, että nämä rikkomukset ja petokset tapahtuvat usein monimutkaisten ja monitahoisten rahoitusjärjestelyjen kautta, mikä tekee niiden havaitsemisesta ja niitä vastaan taistelemisesta entistä vaikeampaa. Tämä korostaa tarvetta kehittää entistä tehokkaampia strategioita varojen asianmukaisen allokaation ja käytön varmistamiseksi.

This suspicion can stem from a variety of reasons, such as potential smuggling of valuable artifacts or illegal trade of culturally sensitive items. Considering this premise, it is reasonable to recognize a strong connection to the hypothesis \\"You might have trouble at the customs with vintage purchases.\\" The hypothesis suggests that when attempting to pass through customs with a vintage item – which could be authentic or look-alike – you may encounter difficulties. To further analyze the connection between the premise and hypothesis, we can break down the elements involved. 1. Vintage or antique purchases: These are items that either are or appear to be old, and usually possess some historical, cultural, or artistic significance, making them valuable or potentially subject to regulation to protect cultural heritage. 2. Suspicion at customs: Customs officers, responsible for border controls and import/export regulations, might be extra vigilant regarding specific items, like antiques and vintage purchases, to ensure adherence to relevant laws and international treaties governing the trade and movement of these items. 3. Trouble at customs: This implies that, as a traveler passing through customs, you might face questioning, examination, or, in some cases, the item's temporary or permanent seizure, depending on its nature and the laws of the countries involved. Based on the above elements, it is evident that the premise entails the hypothesis quite clearly. Given the potential for suspicion concerning antiques or look-alike items, it is logical to infer that you might encounter issues when attempting to navigate customs with such vintage purchases. In conclusion, if the premise \\"But even if your purchase only looks antique, it may still arouse suspicion at customs\\" is true, it indeed suggests that the hypothesis \\"You might have trouble at the customs with vintage purchases\\" is valid. If customs officers scrutinize items that look like antiques, regardless of their true age or origin, travelers carrying such items should be prepared for potential difficulties when going through customs. This includes authentic antique purchases and contemporary items that are made to resemble antiques."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Register your taxi company with your city to obtain your business license.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Starting a Taxi Company: Determining Your Niche, Constructing a Business Plan, and Navigating the Licensing Process Introduction The growth of the global taxi industry has been remarkable. Annually, millions of people around the world rely on taxis to comfortably and efficiently transport them from one place to another. Despite the widespread adoption of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, traditional taxi services continue to command a significant share of the market. If you've been considering starting your own taxi company, now is as good a time as any. In this article, we'll discuss the crucial steps for establishing a successful taxi business, from determining your niche to navigating the complex licensing process. Step 1: Determine Your Niche Before diving into the complex world of taxi businesses, it's essential to clearly define your niche and unique selling proposition. This may include identifying your target audience, preferred geographical coverage, and the type of taxis you want to operate (e.g., traditional yellow cabs, luxury vehicles, or hybrid cars). You can even cater to specialized markets, such as eco-conscious customers or those requiring wheelchair-accessible vehicles. By identifying your niche, you'll be better equipped to target your marketing efforts and differentiate your business in a highly competitive industry. Step 2: Construct a Solid Business Plan Once you've identified your niche, the next step is to develop a comprehensive business plan. This document will serve as the foundation of your business and will be critical for securing funding, attracting investors, and providing direction as you grow. A well-structured business plan should include the following: - Executive Summary: A brief overview of your business's objectives, mission, and vision. - Start-up Costs: A detailed breakdown of capital and operational expenses, including vehicle acquisition, insurance, office space, equipment, and employee salaries. - Management Strategy: Descriptions of key management positions and their associated responsibilities. - Market Analysis: Research on your target market, industry trends, and potential competition. - Marketing Plan: An outline of your strategies for brand development, customer acquisition, and service promotion. - Expansion Plan: A roadmap for future growth and scalability. Step 3: Secure Financing Most taxi companies require significant capital to get started. Unless you have the funds readily available, you'll likely need to apply for a loan from your bank or seek private investment. To improve your chances of securing funding, make sure your business plan is well-researched and carefully structured. Transparency regarding your start-up costs, projected revenue, and break-even analysis will help to demonstrate the long-term viability of your proposed business. Step 4: Obtain Necessary Licenses and Registrations Starting a taxi company requires obtaining the appropriate licenses and registrations at both the state and local levels. The first step in this process is to apply for a commercial driver's license (CDL) at your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). A CDL is crucial for legally operating your taxi and ensures that you're adequately trained and knowledgeable about traffic regulations. Next, register your taxi company with your city or county to obtain a business license. This typically involves submitting an application along with supporting documentation, such as proof of insurance and vehicle registration. There may also be additional permits or licenses required, depending on your location and the nature of your business. Step 5: Establish Your Fleet and Infrastructure With all necessary licenses and registrations in place, it's time to establish your fleet and invest in essential infrastructure. This may include purchasing or leasing vehicles, hiring and training drivers, and setting up office space and equipment. Remember to choose vehicles that align with your niche and target market, as this will have a significant impact on your brand image and overall customer experience. Step 6: Launch and Promote Your Business Finally, it's time to launch your taxi company and kick-start your marketing efforts. Some possible marketing strategies include creating an appealing website, engaging with customers on social media, distributing promotional materials, and partnering with local businesses to provide referral discounts. Be sure to continuously evaluate and adjust your marketing plan as needed to maximize its effectiveness and stay ahead of the competition. Conclusion Starting a taxi company can be a rewarding venture, but success in this fast-paced industry demands careful planning, strategic niche determination, and thorough research. By following these steps and consistently monitoring your progress, you'll be well on your way to establishing a thriving taxi business that meets the needs of your target customers and stands out from the competition."},{"instruction":"Lucas Liß (born 12 January 1992) is a German cyclist who mostly competed on track.

On Christmas Eve, the submarine USS Copperfin, under the command of Captain Cassidy, departs San Francisco on a secret mission. At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death.

Movie title: Vantage Point Movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

For example, emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis (TB) that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide. For example, NDM-1 is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta-lactam antibacterials. The United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency has stated that \\"most isolates with NDM-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections.\\"\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"From the given context and question - TB, NDM-1, or MDR-TB - the one that is not a disease is NDM-1. To explain further, let's understand each term and its implication: 1. Tuberculosis (TB): TB is a contagious and potentially severe bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body, such as the spine and brain. It is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB was a major health concern in the past, and due to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains, it is increasingly becoming a significant global health issue today. 2. Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB): MDR-TB is a specific form of tuberculosis that is resistant to at least two of the main first-line anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. This resistance to conventional treatments results in a more severe and challenging form of tuberculosis. MDR-TB requires a longer duration of treatment and the use of more toxic, less effective drugs compared to standard TB therapy. The increasing prevalence of MDR-TB further complicates the global fight against tuberculosis and poses a significant public health challenge. 3. NDM-1: NDM-1, which stands for New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1, is an enzyme that confers bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta-lactam antibacterials. It is present in certain bacteria, making them resistant to a wide array of antibiotics, including carbapenems - a group of 'last resort' antibiotics used for treating severe infections. The presence of NDM-1 in bacteria makes it extremely difficult to treat infections caused by these resistant strains, as they are no longer effectively killed or inhibited by standard antibiotics. However, NDM-1 is not a disease; it is an enzyme that gives bacteria the ability to evade common antibiotic treatments, resulting in hard-to-treat infections. While TB and MDR-TB are diseases caused by bacteria, NDM-1 is an enzyme found in certain bacteria that contributes to antibiotic resistance. Thus, NDM-1 is not a disease itself but plays a significant role in the emergence and persistence of antibiotic-resistant infections."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Loch Fyne eatType restaurant; Loch Fyne food Fast food; Loch Fyne priceRange £20-25; Loch Fyne familyFriendly yes","output":"Step 1: Identify the key pieces of information in the given data: - Loch Fyne is the name of the restaurant - Its eat type is a restaurant - Its food type is Fast food - Price range of meals is £20-25 - It is family-friendly Step 2: Structure a sentence based on the gathered pieces of information. \\"Loch Fyne, a family-friendly fast food restaurant, offers a variety of delicious meals at a price range of £20-25.\\""},{"instruction":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

These accusations have been circulating in both local and international media, bringing the credibility of the Karzai family and their political influence in Afghanistan into question. Background Afghanistan has long been suffering from the issue of illegal drug production and supply, with opium being one of its major exports. According to UN reports, Afghanistan produces approximately 90% of the world's illegal opium, representing an important part of the country's economy and a major source of income for the Taliban and other militant groups. These groups are said to use the profits from drug trade to fund insurgency activities against the Afghan government and international forces in the region. Ahmed Wali Karzai's Alleged Ties to Drug Trafficking Ahmed Wali Karzai, the younger brother of Hamid Karzai, has been accused of having ties to the drug trade on numerous occasions. Some reports have even alleged that he has profited from this trade in his capacity as a key political figure and leader in southern Afghanistan. The allegations of Ahmed Wali Karzai's involvement in the illegal drugs business have not only raised questions about the integrity of the entire Karzai family but have also severely impacted the image of Afghanistan and its political leadership in the eyes of the international community. Denials by Ahmed Wali Karzai In response to these accusations, Ahmed Wali Karzai has categorically denied any links to the drug trade, stating that these allegations are false and baseless. He emphasizes that he has been fighting against terrorism and drug-related activities alongside Afghan and international security forces. Moreover, Ahmed Wali Karzai argues that such rumours are part of a broader conspiracy to undermine his family's political standing in the country and to discredit their contributions in the post-Taliban era. He contends that these allegations are being propagated by his enemies in order to tarnish the image of the Karzai family and negatively impact the legacy of his brother's presidency. International Response Several international governments and organizations have been closely monitoring the situation in Afghanistan and the allegations against Ahmed Wali Karzai. While some have called for a thorough investigation into these claims in order to establish the truth, others have expressed concern regarding the impact this could have on the fragile political stability in the country. Moving Forward Accurately assessing and addressing the extent of the involvement of political figures like Ahmed Wali Karzai in the drug trade is crucial for the ongoing battle against Afghanistan's illicit drug industry. A transparent and unbiased investigation would be instrumental in clearing the air on such allegations and ensuring that the country's leaders remain dedicated to combating the menace of drug trafficking. It is equally important for the Afghan government to demonstrate its commitment to fighting drug-related issues and ensuring political leaders are held accountable for any involvement in such activities. This will not only help in restoring confidence in the nation's political system but will also strengthen the international community's support for ongoing efforts to achieve lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan."},{"instruction":"cycle your bike over the dirt, play stickman dirtbike online...

Which is the best summary of this article?","output":"Even though projections for US holiday sales are lower than usual this year, this trend seems to be defied by the significant influx of customers at Apple Computer's downtown San Francisco store last week. To provide more details based on the context given, the subdued forecasts for holiday sales in the US have been largely asserted due to various factors. This could include potential reasons such as the ongoing global pandemic, economic unrest, or shifts in consumer spending habits, where more consumers might lean towards saving or investing their money rather than spending broadly on holiday shopping. However, despite these conservative forecasts, it is clear that Apple Computer's store in San Francisco has been experiencing an opposite trend. The store was reportedly filled with a large number of shoppers last week. This could signify that, irrespective of the general expectations, some brands or products, like Apple Computers, continue to maintain their appeal amongst customers during the festive shopping spree. One possibility behind this continued consumer interest in Apple products could be due to the robust brand loyalty Apple has fostered over the years. Alternatively, it could be driven by new product releases or attractive holiday deals offered by Apple that are enticing customers to visit their stores, subverting the overall muted outlook on holiday sales this year. Given the flux of shoppers at Apple's store, it illustrates that while general market trends might indicate a subdued retail environment, individual stores, products, or categories can still perform robustly depending on their specific circumstances, offerings, and customer appeal. It clearly demonstrates that consumer behavior can often be multifaceted and not always adherent to broader market trends or predictions. This situation could prompt businesses and market analysts to revisit their strategies or forecasts, taking into account these micro-level discrepancies in consumer behavior."},{"instruction":"Question: Once a boy often made trouble. His mother gave him many nails . She told him to hammer(,)one in the garden fence every time he lost his patience and fought with someone. The first day he hammered 27 nails. In the following weeks he learned how to control himself better and the number of nails hammered became smaller and smaller. He learned it was easier to control himself than to hammer nails. The day finally came when he didn't hammer any nails. He went to tell his mother about it. Then his mother told him to pull off a nail from the fence each time he didn't lose his patience. After some days he told his mother that all the nails had been pulled off, so she took him to the fence and said to him, \\"You've behaved well, but look at all the holes in the fence. The fence will never be again like it was before. When you fight with someone, you leave wounds in him like these. The trouble may be over, but the wounds will always be there.\\" So, learn to control yourself before you hammer the nail in the fence. Try not to leave any holes in your past. Why did the mother give her son nails? A) To put the garden fence right. B) To put them away. C) To help him understand something. D) To make him lose patience. Answer:","output":"C) To help him understand something. The mother in the story used the nails as a metaphorical teaching tool to help her son understand the implications and consequences of his actions. Each time the boy lost his patience and fought with someone, he was told to hammer a nail into the garden fence. This served as a physical representation of each time he allowed his emotions to get the better of him and acted out negatively. The more he lost control, the more nails would be hammered into the fence. Once he managed to temper his reactions and the frequency of nails being hammered into the fence decreased, it became a visual demonstration of his improved control over his patience and actions. The act of removing the nails every time he successfully controlled his patience symbolized the healing process; but importantly, the remaining holes in the fence served to remind him of the damage already done. In this way, the boy learned a valuable life lesson about the emotional \\"holes\\" or damage he could cause to others (including himself) when he acted out of anger or frustration, as these emotional wounds, like the holes in the fence, could persist even after the immediate issue was resolved. By using the nails, the mother created a visual and tactile lesson about self-control, wisdom, and the long-term effects of one's actions on others. It was not necessarily about the nails themselves, or repairing the fence, or even about provoking him to lose patience; it was about giving the boy a tangible way to understand the consequences of his actions - something that he could see, touch, and therefore, better comprehend and remember."},{"instruction":"Must keep them a little longer can be stored refrigerated and can be frozen You can easily cool or freeze a large piece down and only cut it out when it is thawed and you should use it Could you correct the punctuation please?","output":"\\"Must keep them a little longer, can be stored refrigerated, and can be frozen.

Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"The proposition for establishing all-black, all-male public schools is one that seeks to address the often unique challenges faced by African-American male students in the modern educational system. There are several aspects of research and evidence which can be cited to support this claim, including the importance of role models, the potential for fewer racial biases, a targeted curriculum, improved peer relationships, and better academic outcomes. 1. Importance of Role Models: Studies have shown that having positive role models who share similar cultural, racial, and gender experiences can significantly influence the self-esteem and aspirations of students, especially young African-American males. In all-black, all-male schools, educators can specifically recruit teachers who reflect the student population, thus providing relatable role models to inspire and guide students on a personal level. 2. Reduced Racial Biases: In a school environment where the majority of students and teachers are African American males, the potential for racial biases or microaggressions can be significantly reduced. This safe school climate can create a more supportive educational environment and foster a sense of belonging among students. Furthermore, it can also help alleviate the racial disparities in disciplinary actions, such as suspensions and expulsions, that disproportionately target African American male students. 3. Targeted Curriculum: All-black, all-male schools can offer a curriculum that is uniquely tailored to the needs and interests of African American male students, not only in terms of content but also in instructional and assessment methods. Schools can incorporate an Afrocentric curriculum that promotes cultural awareness, instills pride in their heritage, and integrates material relevant to their lives and experiences. This may include supplemental texts that focus on African American history and literature, as well as instruction in coping mechanisms and important life skills to navigate the wider society. 4. Improved Peer Relationships: Students in all-black, all-male schools are likely to form stronger bonds and support networks with their peers than in diverse school settings. As students share similar cultural backgrounds and life experiences, fewer social and cultural barriers exist to inhibit relationship building. Collective peer support is crucial for addressing self-esteem, sense of belonging, and resilience, contributing to improved mental well-being among African American male students. 5. Better Academic Outcomes: Establishing all-black, all-male schools could lead to better academic and developmental outcomes for African American male students. While empirical data on the success of all-black, all-male schools is still relatively limited, there have been some promising findings in recent years. For example, the Urban Prep Academies in Chicago, an all-black, all-male charter school network, has seen a consistent record of 100% college acceptance rates for their graduating students since 2010. This success can provide a strong foundation for building more such schools. In conclusion, the establishment of publicly funded all-black, all-male schools has the potential to address the unique challenges faced by African American male students in the contemporary educational system. By creating an environment that fosters mentorship, reduces racial biases, provides a targeted curriculum, enhances peer relationships, and ultimately leads to better academic outcomes, these schools can be instrumental in empowering young African American men to succeed, both academically and personally."},{"instruction":"Customers bought two types of electrical ovens, type A and type B. They were all happy at first but type B ovens started to short circuit. Which type of oven had fewer instances of voltage pushing a huge amount of charge through the wires? A:","output":"The type A electrical ovens had fewer instances of voltage pushing a huge amount of charge through the wires. In this scenario, one can infer that the type B ovens are the ones experiencing issues of short circuiting. Short circuits occur when an unintended path between the two sides of an electrical circuit gets established, causing a large amount of current to flow through this unexpected path. This excess flow of current can cause a rapid increase in temperature, usually resulting in a blown fuse, tripped circuit breaker, or even a fire if the circuit is not appropriately protected. Therefore, when the customer feedback indicated issues related to short circuiting in the type B ovens, it pointed to a problematic situation where voltage was pushing a large amount of current (charge) through the wires of the oven. This means that there was an abnormal (possibly harmful) level of electrical current flowing through the device’s circuit, which is a clear indication of a short circuit occurring. On the other hand, type A ovens did not have any reported issues of short circuiting, meaning that these devices had a much more controlled, stable, and safe level of current flow in their circuits. This low (normal) level of current flow shows that the voltage did not push a huge amount of charge through the wires of the type A ovens, making them the safer option in this case. In conclusion, in terms of fewer instances of voltage pushing a large amount of charge through the wires (which means lesser chances of having a short circuit), type A ovens are the clear winners in this scenario based on the customer feedback provided. This suggests that type A oven's electrical circuitry design and components might be better or more suitable or appropriately tuned for the purpose they were designed for. It further underlines the different outcomes that can result from the use of different electrical devices due to variations in their design, manufacturing, and assembly processes."},{"instruction":"Dell swings new Axims into play The Axim 50 range comprises entry- and mid-level Axim 50 models and the Axim 50v which boasts a larger 3.7in screen supporting full VGA resolution and bundled game, plus greater graphics power in the form of the 16MB Intel 2700 accelerator.

You can do this with an electric drill with a paint paddle attachment if the paint has been sitting in storage for a while, or simply give it a stir if you’re just bringing it home. The better the paint is mixed, the smoother coverage it will create. Oil based paints may separate more than other varieties. Do your blending outside and set down a few sheets of newspaper or cardboard to protect from splatters. Paint cracks, crevices and other hard to reach spaces first, using a brush to give you greater control. Afterwards, go over flat, broad surfaces using a dense foam roller. Let the initial coat set up for a couple of hours before applying subsequent coats. Don’t worry too much about making the first coat flawless. You can cover up any visible imperfections with later coats. Most cabinets will require two to three coats for a seamless finish. For the final coat, use a steady hand and a consistent brushing pattern. Watch out for drips, as these can permanently settle into the complete finish once it dries. When you’re done, the your cabinets should have a rich, uniform appearance. Use your best judgment after applying the base coat to decide how many follow-up coats will be necessary. Many new types of paint are self-leveling, which means they won’t run or clot as easily. Working with these paints can save you a lot of frustration in achieving the perfect finish, as well as additional mess during cleanup. The paint will dry to the touch within 24-48 hours, though it may take up to a week for it to harden to the point that it becomes resistant to scuffs and other marks.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose crust is pushed upward happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, which suggests that the crust is pushed upward, could indeed have an effect on the frequency and size of volcanic eruptions, both directly and indirectly. If the crust is pushed upward, it can lead to changes in the underlying pressure systems and the movement of magma beneath the Earth's surface. This can result in either smaller eruptions or even a decrease in eruption frequency. Direct effects: 1. Changes in magma movement: If the crust is pushed upward, the pressure beneath the Earth's surface might get altered, leading to changes in the movement of magma. This could potentially result in shallower chambers being formed. Consequently, lesser pressure would be required to produce smaller eruptions. 2. Crust deformation: The upward movement of the crust could lead to structural transformations in the Earth's surface, which in turn could create new pathways for magma to move and escape through. This could mean that smaller amounts of magma may reach the surface, leading to smaller eruptions. Indirect effects: 1. Tectonic stress: The perturbation might result in changes in tectonic forces and stresses, which could directly affect the occurrence of volcanic eruptions. The greater the tectonic stress, the greater the likelihood of volcanic eruptions. If the crust being pushed upward leads to a reduction in tectonic stresses, this could reduce the likelihood of eruptions, potentially leading to fewer and smaller eruptions. 2. Change in subsurface conditions: The upward movement of crust could also change geothermal conditions, such as temperature and pressure, in the subsurface. This could affect the amount of magma generated or the rate at which it ascends towards the surface. Consequently, this could lead to smaller or less frequent eruptions. It is important to note that the impacts mentioned above are speculative, and the actual outcomes would depend on various factors, such as the extent of the perturbation, the composition of the crust and magma, and the geodynamic setting of the region.

The Prime Minister can hold the role of head of government with the portfolio of one or more ministries. - The Portuguese legislative election of 1987 took place on 19 July . In the previous election , in 1985 , the Social Democratic Party had won a minority government managing to survive in coalition with the Democratic and Social Center and the Democratic Renewal Party , and after the approval of a no - confidence motion from the left - wing parties , with the aid of the Democratic Renewal Party , the government fell and Mário Soares , the President at the time , called for a new election . The PSD was very popular going into the election , and was elected to a landslide majority government -- the biggest that a Portuguese party had ever won in a free election . The left - wing Democratic Unity Coalition lost some of its MPs to the Socialist Party and the Democratic Renovator Party lost almost all of its influence , mainly due to its responsibility in the fall of the former government . The right - wing Democratic and Social Center lost almost half of its vote share , due to the effect of tactical voting for the also right - wing , Social Democratic Party . European elections were held on the same day . - Mário Alberto Nobre Lopes Soares, , , (7 December 1924 7 January 2017) was a Portuguese politician who served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1976 to 1978 and from 1983 to 1985, and subsequently as the 17th President of Portugal from 1986 to 1996. What is the relationship between 'portuguese legislative election' and 'prime minister of portugal'?","output":"The relationship between the Portuguese legislative election and the Prime Minister of Portugal lies in the electoral process and the formation of the government. The Portuguese legislative election is a key democratic event in Portugal, during which citizens vote to elect members of the Assembly of the Republic, the country's unicameral parliament. Based on the electoral results, political parties form coalitions and majority governments, if possible, to establish stability and effectively govern the country. The Prime Minister of Portugal, as the head of government, emerges from these parliamentary elections. The electoral system in Portugal utilizes a proportional representation method, which ensures that the allocation of seats in the Assembly is proportional to the votes cast for the various parties. Once the election has taken place and parliamentary seats have been allocated, the President of the Portuguese Republic, who serves as the head of state, invites the leader of the party or coalition that won the majority of seats to form a government. In situations where no party wins an outright majority, the President can either invite the leader of the largest party to try and form a minority government, or encourage negotiations for a coalition government among parties. The leader of this newly-formed government then assumes the position of Prime Minister. To summarize, the relationship between the Portuguese legislative election and the Prime Minister of Portugal is based on the electoral process that enables the formation of governments and the appointment of the head of government. The legislative election determines the composition of the Assembly of the Republic, while the Prime Minister's appointment relies on their party's performance in the election and their ability to form a stable government or coalition to govern the country."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: dish, meal, type","output":"For a delicious meal, select the appropriate type of dish that complements the flavors and textures of the ingredients used in the recipe.

Article:","output":"Title: Whistling Helps Vietnamese Babies Out of Nappies by Nine Months! Hey kids, do you know that whistling is not just fun and a way to make music, but it can also help babies learn faster? A study of Vietnamese families found out that using whistling can help babies get out of their nappies or diapers by the time they are just nine months old! Isn't that amazing? Well, let me explain how it works. The parents in these Vietnamese families use little special sounds, like a whistle, when their babies need to go potty. This whistle is like a secret signal that tells the baby that it's time to go pee or poo. The babies then start to understand this signal, and they learn to go potty all by themselves without needing a diaper. So what does this mean for babies and their families? It means that these little ones can be more independent and grow up faster. They also don't need as many diapers, which is good for the environment and helps families save money too. In conclusion, the study about Vietnamese families and whistling shows that this simple and joyful sound can do wonders for babies. Just like music can make us happy, a little whistle can help babies learn important skills and make life easier for everyone!

(Associated Press) The parents of one of the 20 first-graders killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre met with the gunman's father for more than an hour in an effort to bring some closure to the tragedy, asking him about his son's mental health and other issues. Alissa Parker told \\"CBS This Morning\\" in an excerpt of an interview that aired Thursday the meeting with Adam Lanza's father, Peter Lanza, was her idea. Her 6-year-old daughter, Emilie, died in December's shooting rampage. \\"I felt strongly that I needed to tell him something, and I needed to get that out of my system,\\" Alissa Parker said. \\"I felt very motivated to do it and then I felt really good about it and prayed about it. And it was something that I needed to do.\\" It was unclear what they discussed or when the meeting took place. CBS plans to show the rest of the interview with Alissa and Robbie Parker on Friday morning, revealing more details about their meeting with Peter Lanza. No one answered the phone at the Parkers' home Thursday morning. A message seeking comment from Peter Lanza was left with a Lanza family spokesman. The Parkers told CBS they wanted to ask Peter Lanza about his son's medical history, his and his ex-wife's relationships with Adam Lanza and other issues. Robbie Parker was the first parent of a child killed at the school to speak publicly about the massacre. A day after the Dec. 14 killings, he fought back tears and struggled to catch his breath as he spoke lovingly of Emilie at a wrenching, lengthy news conference. \\"She was beautiful. She was blond. She was always smiling,\\" he said, adding that the world was a better place because Emilie was in it. \\"I'm so blessed to be her dad.\\" Adam Lanza, 20, shot 20 children and six educators to death at the school and killed himself as police arrived. He also fatally shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, at their Newtown home before going to the school. Peter Lanza, who was divorced from Nancy Lanza, said in a statement after the killings that his family also was asking why Adam Lanza would go on a shooting spree. People close to the investigation have told The Associated Press that Adam Lanza showed interest in other mass killers. ||||| Newtown victim's parents talk about meeting killer Adam Lanza's father (CBS News) Vice President Biden and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg are expected to meet with the families of Newtown school shooting victims on Thursday, over three months after the massacre took place in Connecticut. Ahead of the meeting, CBS This Morning's Norah O'Donnell spoke with Robbie and Alissa Parker, the parents of six-year-old victim Emilie Parker. They revealed that they recently met with the father of gunman Adam Lanza as part of their search for understanding and grieving process. The meeting \\"was kind of my doing,\\" Alissa Parker explained. \\"I guess the reason why I felt strongly that I needed to tell [Peter Lanza] something. And I needed to get that out of my system. I felt very motivated to do it and ... I felt really good about it, I prayed about it, and it was something that I needed to do. Robbie added their family has experienced \\"a little bit of everything,\\" as they've dealt with the scope of the tragedy over the past three months. \\"You know, you went from the absolute worst experience that you could ever imagine to have to go through as a parent ... and being overwhelmed with that sense of grief and loss to, on the other end of the spectrum, you're being completely overwhelmed with outpouring of love and support from so many people and everything that kinda falls in between,\\" he said. The Parkers addressed the recent news that Newtown investigators determined that Adam Lanza kept a spreadsheet methodically detailing the death toll of other mass shooters, types of weaponry, and plotted how he would add to the death tolls. \\"Any information ... that you gain in this experience is just that. It's information,\\" Robbie said. \\"And then you have to choose how you're gonna handle it. And so for us, we've decided that what works best for us is you receive a bit of information, you process it, you feel the emotion that comes along with it, and then you have to let it go.\\" Alissa added, \\"It's just like another piece to the puzzle. And it always brings with it a period of, you know, sorrow, pain, and you deal with it and you just move on. The outcome is still the same, regardless if it was planned, not planned.

Some instructions deal with safe practices to avoid unwanted medical events during and following your surgery. Other instructions help your body prepare for the surgery and the healing process afterwards, including steps to help reduce swelling. Every surgery, every surgeon, and every patient are different. The swelling that occurs will depend on many variables. Pay attention to the instructions provided by your surgeon to reduce swelling. Be very clear, well in advance of your surgery, regarding the changes you need to make in your medications. This will involve a coordinated effort with your regular doctor, any specialists you see, and your surgeon. Some medications can cause changes that may lead to problems during surgery and difficulties after the surgery, such as additional and prolonged swelling. Make the changes in your prescription drugs, over-the-counter agents, and herbal supplements, two weeks before your surgery. It takes time for the medications to get out of your system, and for your system to return to its baseline level of functioning. Provide your surgeon with a complete list of your medications, including herbal supplements and over-the-counter agents, at least 30 days before your scheduled surgery. It takes time for your doctors to communicate with each other and determine the drugs you can stop in advance and the ones you should not stop at all. Never stop or adjust your prescription medications without consulting your doctor. Plan early with your regular doctor or specialist. Many agents require a gradual taper downward to stop the medication. Some prescription medications should not be stopped or dose adjusted at all. Let your surgeon know of the drugs you will need to continue to take routinely, including the day of surgery. Your surgeon will know if you can continue some agents, such as acetaminophen. You will need to stop many things but not everything. Your surgeon will let you know what you can continue taking. OTC anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin, will need to be discontinued two weeks before your surgery. This group of medications can lead to additional bleeding which causes more swelling. Stop taking your herbal supplements should be stopped two to three weeks before your surgery. It may be best to plan on stopping everything you take that is an herbal product or supplement. Your surgeon will tell you exactly how to proceed. Some herbal products can interfere with anesthesia and others can increase bleeding and swelling after the procedure. Plan on stopping products that contain omega 3’s and 6’s contained in fish oil supplements, flaxseed, ephedra, Ma Huang, feverfew, goldenseal, garlic, ginseng, ginger, licorice, valerian, and kava. This is not a complete list. Talk to your surgeon about all your herbal supplements. A healthy diet will promote healing and reduce swelling. This means you should start following this step as far in advance as possible and continue it through the entire post-op healing process. Include fruits and vegetables that are high in fiber. Examples of high fiber foods include peas, lentils, artichokes, brussel sprouts, lima beans, and black beans. High fiber foods prevent constipation. Pain medications provided for surgical pain often cause constipation. Straining due to constipation can lead to bleeding at the surgical site and additional swelling. Reduce your sodium intake to help decrease swelling after the surgery. Stay hydrated the week leading up to the surgery. Plenty of water will also help to promote healing and reduce swelling. If you are a smoker, then you will need to stop smoking several weeks before your surgery. The healing process is slowed in people that smoke. Smoking also increases the risk of developing an infection. Avoid ingesting alcoholic drinks. Since alcohol thins the blood, avoid drinking alcohol for at least five days before the surgery. Summary:","output":"In summary, to reduce swelling before and after surgery, follow your surgeon's specific instructions. This may include adjusting medications in coordination with your regular doctor, ceasing over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs, and stopping herbal supplements. Maintain a healthy, high-fiber diet and stay hydrated leading up to the surgery. If you smoke, quit several weeks before the operation and avoid alcohol consumption for at least five days pre-surgery. Remember that each surgery, surgeon, and patient is different, so always consult with your surgeon about the specific steps you should take."},{"instruction":"Earlier this year my depression got very bad, very quickly. I’d been having intrusive suicidal thoughts for a while. It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors—school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed.

Movie title: The Thing Movie plot: A United States Air Force crew is dispatched by General Fogerty (David McMahon) from Anchorage, Alaska at the request of Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), the chief scientist of a North Pole scientific outpost. They have evidence that an unknown flying craft crashed in their vicinity, so Reporter Ned Scott (Douglas Spencer) tags along for the story. Dr. Carrington later briefs Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) and his airmen, and Dr. Redding (George Fenneman) shows photos of a flying object moving erratically before crashing; not the movements of a meteorite. Following erratic magnetic pole anomalies, the crew and scientists fly to the crash site aboard the team's C-47. The mysterious craft lies buried beneath refrozen ice, with just the tip of a rounded airfoil protruding from the surface. As they outline the craft's general shape, they realize they are standing in a circle: they have discovered a crashed flying saucer. They try deicing the buried craft with thermite heat bombs, but only ignite its metal alloy, causing an explosion that destroys the saucer. Their Geiger counter then points to a slightly radioactive frozen shape buried nearby in the refrozen ice. They excavate a large block of ice around what appears to be a tall body and fly it to the research outpost, just as a major storm moves in, cutting off their communications with Anchorage. Some of the scientists want to thaw out the body, but Captain Hendry issues orders for everyone to wait until he receives further instructions from the Air Force. Later, Corporal Barnes (William Self) takes the second watch over the ice block and to avoid looking at the body within, covers it with an electric blanket that the previous guard left turned on. As the ice slowly melts, the Thing inside revives; Barnes panics and begins shooting at it with his .45 caliber sidearm, but the alien escapes into the sub-zero cold of the raging storm. The Thing is attacked by sled dogs and the airmen recover a severed arm. A microscopic examination of a tissue sample reveals... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"The Thing,\\" Dr. Stern is not almost killed by any specific incident or creature.

Tak'alik Ab'aj (; Mayan pronunciation: [takˀaˈlik aˀ'ɓaχ] (listen); Spanish: [takaˈlik aˈβax]) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in Guatemala. It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments.

This leads to longer lines, which means each person will have to wait for a longer time before it's their turn to be served or attended to. Option A, anxiety, could be a potential result of longer lines, but not everyone in the line would necessarily experience anxiety. Some people may remain calm and patient. Option B, waiting turn, happens regardless of the number of people in line, but doesn't capture the context of the question which is focused on the consequence of an increase in the number of people joining the line. Option C, being late, is another possible result of longer lines, but depends on the context and reason why people are waiting. For some, arriving late might not be a critical issue, while for others, it may have a significant impact on their plans. Therefore, while it is a potential effect, it's not the best answer. Option E, having to wait for, again, happens regardless of how many people are in line, but doesn't address the specific effect of more people joining the queue.

Text: A wave caused by a disturbance with more energy has greater amplitude. A:","output":"Step 1: Identify the disturbances in the text - the dolphin jumping and the turtle flapping its fin. Step 2: Determine the energy of the disturbances - the dolphin's jump and re-entry should have more energy than the turtle's fin flap because the dolphin's body mass and motion generate more force on the water. Step 3: Recall the information from the text that states a wave caused by a disturbance with more energy has a greater amplitude. Step 4: Compare the energy levels of the two disturbances and apply the text's information to the answer - Since the dolphin's disturbance has more energy, the wave it creates will have a greater amplitude than the wave created by the turtle's disturbance. Conclusion: The waves the dolphin made will have an amplitude that is greater than the waves created by the turtle's flapping fin."},{"instruction":"(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states.

Touchdown runs are an essential aspect of football that significantly contributes to a team's offensive accomplishments. They are rewarding and exhilarating moments for players and fans alike. Investigating the collective yardage of both teams can reveal insights into the strategy, efficiency, and the level of competition in a given match. In this article, we dive deeper into this question, considering the various factors that might come into play, as well as the potential impact of this metric on the game's outcome. Factors Influencing TD Run Yardage 1. Offensive Strategy: The combined yardage gained on touchdown runs is strongly dependent on the offensive strategy employed by both teams. Some teams prioritize a ground-heavy game, while others may focus more on passing plays. Therefore, yardage for TD runs may vary significantly depending on the offensive approach adopted by each team. 2. Running Back Performance: The running abilities of the running backs on both teams are crucial in determining the yardage gained during a touchdown run. Talented and skilled running backs with excellent vision, speed, and agility are more likely to make significant yard gains and contribute to the team's overall yardage. 3. Offensive Line Strength: A team with a strong and efficient offensive line is more likely to provide the running back with necessary blocking and open up running lanes. This factor, in turn, can influence the total yardage gained on touchdown runs. 4. Defensive Capabilities: To analyze the total TD run yardage for both teams, one must also consider the defensive performance of each side. Outstanding defenses can limit the opposing team's running plays, leading to fewer touchdown runs and lesser yardage gains. 5. External Factors: Weather conditions, injuries, and penalties can potentially affect the outcome of a game and, consequently, the cumulative yardage of touchdown runs. For instance, heavy rain may alter a team's offensive strategy, shifting it from a passing play to a more focused ground game. Impact on Game Outcomes A higher combined yardage of both teams during touchdown runs indicates an effective running game and could be credited to a well-structured offensive line-up or successful play calls. However, whether this directly translates to a team's victory in a game is subjective. Football is a complex game, and merely focusing on touchdown runs may provide an incomplete picture. Other factors such as passing yardage, field goal success rate, turnovers, and defensive strategies contribute significantly to the overall outcome. Statistical Analysis Owing to the numerous factors mentioned above, it is critical to conduct a statistical analysis of each game separately to establish the cumulative yardage of touchdown runs for both teams. One can further dive into the analysis by considering players’ individual yardage, seasonal and historical performance, and opponent match-ups, among other factors. Conclusion To determine the total yardage gained on touchdown runs for both teams in a match, it is crucial to take into account various factors such as offensive strategy, player skills, and situational match conditions. By analyzing these aspects in detail, we can derive a more profound understanding of each team's performance. Although this metric may not be the sole determinant of a game's outcome, it sheds light on each team's offensive capabilities and the impact of successful running plays on the final score."},{"instruction":"I'll give you a question, please answer with step-by-step reasoning process.

Two styles of Hachijō-daiko emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.The Hachijō-daiko tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \\"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of Hachijō-daiko. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one. The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the shita-byōshi (下拍子, \\"lower beat\\"), provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the uwa-byōshi (上拍子, \\"upper beat\\"), builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.The contemporary style of Hachijō-daiko is called shin-daiko (新太鼓, \\"new taiko\\"), which differs from Kumaoji-daiko in multiple ways.

In the context of the provided article, the Chinese principles have been employed to create unique scripts and characters for several non-Chinese languages, mainly in neighboring regions that have historical and cultural ties with China. These include: 1. The roughly 1,500 Japanese-made kokuji - These are the characters unique to the Japanese language that do not have an original Chinese counterpart. They were developed using Chinese writing principles, with modifications to suit the Japanese language's needs. 2. The Korean-made gukja - These are the historical characters coined in Korea influenced by the Chinese script. They were designed to represent Korean vocabular y that couldn't be adequately expressed using the existing Chinese characters. 3. The over 10,000 Sawndip characters - Sawndip is an indigenous script used by the Zhuang people of the Guangxi region in China. It incorporates Chinese writing principles and has been used for centuries to write the Zhuang language, which is a non-Chinese, Tai-Kadai language. 4. The almost 20,000 Nôm characters - Chữ Nôm is a historical script that was formerly used to write the Vietnamese language. It combines Chinese script elements, principles, and structure with local Vietnamese phonetic adaptations, creating a unique, now largely disused writing system. 5. Tangut script - Although more divergent from Chinese writing, the Tangut script was developed for the extinct Tangut language and utilized more than 5,000 characters based on similar stroke patterns, but with distinct formation principles compared to the Chinese characters. In summary, characters formed by Chinese principles are written scripts and symbols that have been developed based on the fundamental structure and elements of the Chinese writing system but adapted to represent non-Chinese languages or unique language aspects of the region in which they were created."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Over the next six years, it will rise to a height of 165 metres, accompanied by a business centre, residential area and shopping mall.\\" to Turkish?","output":"To translate this English sentence into Turkish, I will follow these steps: 1.

The region comprises the southern section of the Andes mountains as well as the deserts, steppes and grasslands east of this southern portion of the Andes. Patagonia has two coasts; a western one towards the Pacific Ocean and an eastern one towards the Atlantic Ocean. - Halophytum ameghinoi is a species of herbaceous plant endemic to Patagonia . It is a succulent annual plant , with simple , fleshy , alternate leaves . The plants are monoecious , with solitary female flowers and inflorescences of male flowers on the same plant . Halophytum has sometimes been placed in its own family , Halophytaceae . For instance , the 2009 APG III system and the 2003 APG II system recognise the family and assign it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots , although the 1998 APG system did not recognise such a family , placing its members in the family Chenopodiaceae instead . - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - In botany, blossoms are the flowers of stone fruit trees (genus \\"Prunus\\") and of some other plants with a similar appearance that flower profusely for a period of time in spring.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department. \\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy.

Let's solve this math problem together. We have this equation: 4*o + 62*o + 252*o = 0 Let me explain it in a simpler way: Imagine you have 4 oranges, 62 oranges, and 252 oranges, and you want to put them together in groups (o). How many groups will you make? First, we need to add all the oranges together. So, 4 oranges + 62 oranges + 252 oranges = 318 oranges. Now, the equation looks like this: 318*o = 0 This means we have 318 oranges in total, but we need to figure out how many groups (o) to make with these oranges so that their total value becomes zero. Since oranges are valuable and yummy, we can't put them in groups so their value becomes zero. However, for this math problem, let's assume we are working with magical oranges whose value can become zero. The only way to do this is if we don't have any groups of oranges at all because zero groups will be equal to zero value. So, o = 0 And that's the answer!

We have all met such people. One is the man who always seems to be clapping his hands--often at the wrong time--during a performance in the theater. He keeps you from hearing the actors. Even worse are those who can never arrive before the curtain goes up and the play begins. They come hurrying down to your row of seats. You are comfortably settled down, with your hat and heavy coat in your lap. You must stand up to let them pass. You are proud of yourself-control after they have settled into their seats...Well, what now...God, one of them is up again.

Cumulatively, they rake in large profits from games that were designed to be unbeatable: While some bettors might get lucky and win in the short run, over time they are supposed to lose and the casinos are expected to win, statistically speaking. In recent years, however, Whiting says the ranks of advantage players have swelled. Several factors are responsible. One is the ease with which gamblers can find each other online and share tactics. Grosjean has a blog called Beyond Numbers, for example. Another is the proliferation of books like Grosjean’s “Beyond Counting,” which he published in 2000 and updated in 2009 as a self-published edition (though he claims that if he doesn’t know who you are, he won’t sell you a copy). And because regulated casino gambling now takes place in at least 40 states, casinos compete for customers in part by introducing new games, some of which turn out to be vulnerable. Common advantage-play techniques include “hole carding,” in which sharp-eyed players profit from careless dealers who unwittingly reveal tiny portions of the cards; “shuffle tracking,” or memorizing strings of cards in order to predict when specific cards will be dealt after they are next shuffled; and counting systems that monitor already dealt cards in order to estimate the value of those that remain in the deck. Richard Munchkin, a professional gambler who is the author of “Gambling Wizards” and a co-host of the radio show “Gambling With an Edge,” claims to have mastered all of these techniques. “I think every game can be beaten,” he says. (Munchkin, whose real first name is Richard, chose his professional surname because of the fact that he stands slightly taller than five feet.) “For example, certain slot machines must pay off their jackpots once they have accumulated 30,000. At 28,000, a slot machine might be a play” — gambling argot for something that can be bet on advantageously — “and there are slot teams that specialize in this. I know people who clock roulette wheels and others who can control a single die at craps.” Among the most susceptible games these days are blackjack and poker variations like Ultimate Texas Hold ’Em, in which play is against the house rather than other gamblers. Teams of advantage players — which usually require one person to bet and another to spot dealers’ hole cards (those turned down and not supposed to be seen), track shuffles or count cards — have become so prevalent that they often find themselves in the same casino, at the same time, targeting the same game. “We had a blackjack game in Atlantic City with a weak dealer,” recalls Bobby Sanchez, known as the Bullet, a frequent playing partner of Grosjean’s. “We had our key seats locked up when players from two other crews tried jumping into the game. Elbows were thrown and there was a lot of jostling around the table. An older civilian accidentally got in the middle of it. His son thought I had hit him, and the son jumped on my back.” Things ultimately calmed down and an agreement was reached via surreptitious cellphone conversations: Members from the other teams would be able to sit and play at the table and use information from Sanchez’s spotter, but their betting would be capped at 800 per hand. “Meanwhile I bet three hands of 3,000 each,” Sanchez says. “Unfortunately, the dealer got pulled out after about 90 minutes. Following all the tumult, the table was being watched and somebody figured out what was going on. Still, we managed to win around 100,000 that night.” One Friday night I accompanied the slimly built Grosjean, who wore baggy jeans, a red polo shirt and a hat with its bill riding low, as he strolled across the carpeted mezzanine of the Potawatomi Indian tribe’s Grand Casino Hotel and Resort in Shawnee. As I walked beside him, I tried to appear casual, with the tail of my untucked shirt covering the notepad in the back pocket of my slacks. Grosjean passed an escalator and headed down a back staircase. To experienced surveillance people, he is a known advantage player; at any time he could be spotted, matched to his picture in a database of such players and asked to leave a casino. If that happens, the security guard could also read him the trespass act, meaning Grosjean would risk arrest if he tried to return. Getting away, on the other hand, would give him an opportunity to come back on some future day and perhaps go unnoticed. So if security was waiting for him at the bottom, Grosjean needed to be able to run back up in the opposite direction with the hope of avoiding a confrontation. He couldn’t do that on an escalator. Down below on the gaming floor, ringed by wall-mounted TV monitors silently showing a sporting event, slot machines chirped and crowded blackjack tables buzzed with action. Grosjean sidestepped a cocktail waitress and approached the casino’s only craps game, the one in which cards are used instead of dice. Grosjean had explained earlier the reason for this quirk: The Grand happens to be located in a jurisdiction where it is illegal for dice to determine financial outcomes in games of chance. Two sets of six playing cards, numbered one through six, one set with red backs, the other with blue backs, serve as de facto dice. A player rolls a giant numbered cube, apparently made from plastic foam. The cube determines which cards are turned over. It is a way to make the game feel like craps without dice directly producing a monetary outcome. After that, standard rules apply. A gambler might bet, for example, that the sum of the first two cards in play will total 7 or 11. If the sum equals 2, 3 or 12, he loses. If 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 come up, a “point” is established, and he wins if subsequent cards add up to that number. If a total of 7 comes first, he loses. Over the course of the game, players can wager on other combinations, like two 5s turned over (which pays out 7 to 1). Such proposition, or prop, bets favor the casino. After every two-card set is turned over, the cards were machine-shuffled before the next roll. ||||| CLOSE A judge has ruled that Phil Ivey's day in a U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals will have to wait. John Brennan/NorthJersey.com Legendary card player Phil Ivey at the World Series of Poker in 2005. (Photo: file photo) How did professional poker player Phil Ivey and playing partner Cheng Yin Sun manage to beat the house at Borgata to the tune of 10 million in baccarat over the course of four visits in 2012? Credit the impeccable eyesight of Sun, who noticed some tiny imperfections on the backs of one playing card manufacturer's playing cards that no one else seems to be able to detect. Borgata's attorneys explained the scheme in detail in their initial court filing in the lawsuit seeking to reclaim the money in 2014: \\"The backs of casino playing cards generally contain a repeating diamond or geometrical pattern. If the cards are not cut symmetrically during the manufacturing process, the two long edges of the cards will not be identical. In other words, one edge will have more of the geometrical pattern than the other. COURTS:Poker pro Phil Ivey ordered to pay Borgata 10M BIG BETS:How Phil Ivey won 10M at Borgata in 117 hours BLOG:Phil Ivey isn't the only gambler who beat the house – but not the courts IT'S A GAMBLE: How to play baccarat \\"During play, Ivey and Sun used the accommodations they requested from Borgata to 'turn' strategically important cards so that they could be distinguished from all other cards in the deck. The dealer would first lift the card so that Sun could see its value before it was flipped over all the way and placed on the table. If Sun told the dealer 'Hao' (pronounced 'how'), which translates to English as 'good card,' he was instructed to continue to flip the card over so that the orientation of the long edges of the card would stay on the same side when flipped. \\"In other words, the right edge of the card as seen by Sun before the card was turned all the way over would still be the right edge of the card as she looked at when it was laid face up on the table. If Sun told the dealer 'Buhao' (pronounced 'boohow'), which translates into English as 'bad card,' he was instructed to flip the card side to side, so that the long edges would be reversed when flipped. \\"In other words, the right edge of the card as seen by Sun before the card was turned all the way over would now be the left edge of the card as she looked at it when it was laid face up on the table. By telling the dealer 'good card' or 'bad card' in Mandarin, the dealer would place the cards on the table so that when the cards were cleared and put in the used card holder, the leading edges of the strategically important cards could be distinguished from the leading edges of the other cards in the deck. \\"Upon information and belief Ivey and Sun 'turned' the cards with values of 6, 7, 8, and 9, so that they could be distinguished from all other cards in the deck. The process of 'edge sorting' all the cards in the decks took more than one shoe. \\"Ivey and Sun knew that if an automatic card shuffler was used, the edges of the cards would remain facing in the same direction after they were shuffled. \\"Conversely, Ivey and Sun knew that if the cards were shuffled by hand, the dealer would turn part of the deck, rendering their attempts to 'turn' the strategically important cards useless. Keeping the edges of the cards facing the same direction is the reason Ivey requested the use of an automatic card shuffler. Ivey also knew that if the same cards were not reused for each shoe, there would be no benefit to 'edge sorting.' That is why Ivey requested that the same cards be reused for each shoe. \\"The leading edge of the first card in the shoe is visible before the cards are dealt. Once the 'edge sorting' was completed, Ivey and Sun were able to see the leading edge of the first card in the shoe before it was dealt, giving them 'first card knowledge.' \\"If the first card in the shoe was turned, that meant a strategically important card was being dealt to the 'player' hand, and Ivey would bet accordingly. If the first card in the shoe was not 'turned,' that meant that a less advantageous card was being dealt to the 'player' hand, and Ivey would again bet accordingly. \\"This 'first card knowledge' changed the overall odds of the game from an approximate 1.06% house advantage to an approximately 6.765% advantage for Ivey. \\"Ivey began each playing session with bets well below the maximum bet. Ivey bet below the maximum bet until he and Sun had completed 'edge sorting' all the cards in the shoe. Once all the cards in the shoe were'“edge sorted,' Ivey 'flatlined' at the maximum bet; i.e. he bet the maximum amount on every hand. \\"A review of Ivey’s betting pattern shows that once the cards were 'edge sorted,' when he bet on 'player,' the first card dealt was significantly more likely to be a strategically important card. Conversely, once the cards were 'edge sorted,' when Ivey bet on 'banker,' the first card dealt was significantly more likely to be a strategically unimportant card.\\" Read or Share this story: https://njersy.co/2va5wnB ||||| Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.

The increased number of card players winning large profits from games that were designed to be unbeatable is related to the ease with which card players can communicate with each other online, as well as the increase in available information about card-playing techniques. In response, casinos have introduced new games to entice customers and offer a fresh challenge to advantage players, although some of these games can be vulnerable. Common techniques used by advantage players include hole carding, where sharp-eyed players profit from careless dealers who unwittingly reveal small portions of cards; shuffle tracking, which involves memorizing sequences of cards to predict when specific cards will be dealt after they're shuffled; and counting systems that monitor already-dealt cards to estimate the value of remaining cards in the deck.

Among the most susceptible games to advantage play these days are blackjack and poker variations like Ultimate Texas Hold 'Em, where the play is against the house rather than other gamblers. Teams of advantage players have become so prevalent that they often find themselves targeting the same casino game at the same time. The rising number of advantage players and the potential for large payouts has led to increased scrutiny from casino security. In recent years, cases of advantage players winning large amounts through legal-but-controversial tactics have made headlines, such as the 10 million baccarat win by professional poker player Phil Ivey and his partner Cheng Yin Sun in 2012. Their technique, called edge sorting, involved using imperfections in the printing of playing cards to identify high-value cards to bet more effectively. The Borgata casino sued the pair, claiming they had violated gambling regulations by using the technique, and in 2016 a court ruled in favor of the casino, ordering Ivey and Sun to return the 10 million. Despite the potential consequences and legal challenges facing advantage players, the allure of successfully beating the house and winning significant profits continues to draw many players to hone their skills and try their luck at casinos around the world."},{"instruction":"SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country.

After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man.

It also dismissed an appeal by murderer Lee Newell that his whole-life order had been \\"manifestly excessive\\". The European Court of Human Rights had ruled such terms breached human rights. In July, the European court said that while it accepted whole life orders could be justified, there should nevertheless be some way of having imprisonment reviewed after 25 years. Tuesday's Court of Appeal ruling was welcomed by the attorney general, the justice secretary and the shadow justice secretary. Sentencing in a number of high-profile criminal cases - including the terms to be handed out to soldier Lee Rigby's murderers - had been put on hold pending the judgement. 'So heinous' By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News Today's judgement is pretty stark. On the critical issue of whether whole-life terms were \\"reducible\\" and offered prisoners some \\"hope\\" and \\"possibility\\" of release in exceptional circumstances, the Court of Appeal flatly disagreed with the Grand Chamber of the ECHR. The nub of the argument concerned the only current means under domestic law for a whole-life term to be reduced. It can only happen if the justice secretary is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which can justify a prisoner's release on compassionate grounds. Existing guidance specifies that the prisoner should be suffering from a terminal illness and that death is likely to occur very shortly. The ECHR thought it was unclear whether the justice secretary would apply this restrictive policy. It didn't regard release purely to die in a hospice or at home as sufficient to represent a \\"prospect of release\\", and so represented a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court of Appeal disagreed. It explained that the justice secretary cannot be restrictive, must take into account all exceptional circumstances relevant to the release of the prisoner on compassionate grounds, and must interpret \\"compassionate grounds\\" in accordance with human rights law. The court concluded that meant that the law in England and Wales was clear and did offer both \\"hope\\" and the \\"possibility\\" of release. The UK courts have disagreed with Strasbourg before, but rarely in such a clear and unvarnished way. Under the Human Rights Act domestic courts are bound to \\"take into account\\" ECHR rulings. Some believe that means, ultimately, \\"must follow\\". Today's ruling perhaps marks the start of a far more robust dialogue between the ECHR and our domestic courts. Under current law, whole-life tariffs can be given for \\"exceptionally\\" serious offences. They prevent offenders from ever being eligible for a parole review or release, unless at the discretion of the justice secretary. In July the ECHR ruled whole-life sentences had to have the possibility of release and, to be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, there should be some way of having a sentence reviewed after 25 years. That ruling followed a successful appeal by convicted murderers Jeremy Bamber, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore. In the latest Court of Appeal ruling, the panel of five judges found that the Strasbourg court had been wrong when it reached a conclusion that the law of England and Wales did not clearly provide the possibility that a whole-life prison term could ever be reduced. They said a power of review arose if there were \\"exceptional circumstances\\" whereby the offender could appeal to the secretary of state. \\"In our judgement the law of England and Wales therefore does provide to an offender 'hope' or the 'possibility' of release in exceptional circumstances which render the just punishment originally imposed no longer justifiable,\\" Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said. Lord Thomas said some crimes were \\"so heinous\\" that Parliament was entitled to allow whole-life orders \\"entirely compatibly\\" with the European Convention on Human Rights. \\"Judges should therefore continue as they have done to impose whole-life orders in those rare and exceptional cases,\\" he said. Newell's lawyers had challenged his whole-life order for murdering child killer Subhan Anwar while already in prison for another killing. Lord Thomas dismissed the appeal, saying the murder had been \\"premeditated and involved the use of an improvised weapon\\". Ian McLoughlin killed Graham Buck, 66, in Hertfordshire in 2012, while on prison day-release from another murder sentence. Mr Buck had gone to the aid of a neighbour who was being burgled. Ruling on the McLoughlin case, the Court of Appeal said the sentencing judge had been \\"in error\\" in thinking he did not have the power to make a whole-life order in the wake of the Strasbourg court's ruling. Lord Thomas said the seriousness of the case - which had been referred to the Court of Appeal by Attorney General Dominic Grieve - was \\"exceptionally high\\" and 40 years was unduly lenient. Reacting to Tuesday's ruling, Mr Grieve said he was \\"pleased\\". He said he had not thought the Strasbourg court said anything \\"which prevented our courts from handing down whole-life terms in the most serious cases\\". \\"Today's judgement gives the clarity our judges need when they are considering sentencing cases like this in the future,\\" he said. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling also welcomed the decision as upholding the law that the UK Parliament had passed. Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: \\"Judges should be able to lock up for life those guilty of the most horrible crimes and it was a Labour government that gave them this power. \\"We now need the government to make a considered response to the Strasbourg judgement and Labour is willing to work with ministers to get the right result.\\" However, Simon Creighton, solicitor for convicted murderer Douglas Vinter, called the decision \\"troubling\\" and said it was \\"fundamental\\" that prison sentences had \\"some form of rehabilitation and redemption\\" built in. His client was \\"not expecting\\" to be released but wanted \\"something to work towards\\", he added. There are currently 53 prisoners on whole-life terms in England and Wales, including Moors Murderer Ian Brady and serial killer Rosemary West. In December the judge in the Lee Rigby murder trial said he would wait for the decision by the Court of Appeal before passing sentence on Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who were convicted in December of killing Fusilier Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London, in May last year. The killers will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 26 February at 14:00 GMT, a Judicial Office spokeswoman has confirmed. A summary of the above article is?","output":"The UK Court of Appeal upheld whole-life prison sentences, dismissing an appeal by murderer Lee Newell that his whole-life order had been \\"manifestly excessive\\". The European Court of Human Rights had previously ruled that such terms breached human rights, but the Court of Appeal said that judges should continue imposing whole-life orders in rare and exceptional cases. The decision was welcomed by the attorney general, the justice secretary, and the shadow justice secretary."},{"instruction":"Write some highlights for the following article: First class passengers are used to being spoiled with the best seats, food and entertainment.

Context: The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the levels of vasoactive eicosanoid hormone-like substances PGE2, PGI2 and TXA2 in hemodialysis (HD)patients who were following a long-term physical training program during the hemodialysis session.', 'A total of 50 patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (stage 5)on hemodialysis and 35 healthy individuals who served as controls (C) were evaluated. The 50 CKD patients were divided into two groups: the HD group consisted of 31 patients who received usual care without any physical activity during the hemodialysis sessions, while group HD/Exer included 19 patients who followed a program of physical exercise for six months. Plasma levels of PGE2, 6-Keto-PGF1alpha (the stable derivative of PGI2) and TXB2 (the stable derivative of TXA2) were measured by reliable enzymo-immunoassay methods (EIA) in HD and HD/Exer patients before and after the hemodialysis sessions as well as in the group of C.', 'The plasma levels of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha in group HD Exer/before patients were higher than those in group HDbefore (20.39+/-5.82 and 1449.19+/-553.41 vs 17.68+/-5.36 and 1295.10+/-384.43 pg/ml, p=0.044 and p=0.067, respectively), while the plasma levels of TXB2 were lower in HD Exer/before patients compared to HDbefore(499.76+/-67.51 vs 608.01+/-80.23 pg/ml, p=0.041). The plasma levels of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha in group HD Exer/after patients were significantly higher compared to those in HDafter patients (23.01+/-5.70 and 1618.19+/-435.07 vs 16.57+/-4.97 and 1005.44+/-317.16 pg/ml, p<0.001 and p<0.040, respectively).

More than 400 members took their oaths, but 27 seats remain vacant – the annexation of Crimea, plus the war in eastern Ukraine, prevented deputies being elected there. It is just one year since people seeking democracy and prosperity began protesting in Kiev’s Maidan Square, leading to the downfall of a kleptocratic regime and descent of a new cold war in Europe. How rapidly the news agenda moves on. Crimea was the first annexation on the continent since 1945 but is now largely forgotten, despite prices soaring and people disappearing or dying in suspicious circumstances if they cross their new rulers. Human Rights Watch has catalogued the import of Vladimir Putin’s trademark tactics of abusing activists and harassing journalists. Meanwhile, a crippling conflict drags on in Europe. More than 4,300 combatants and civilians have been killed since Russia and its stooges began stirring up trouble eight months ago. Almost a million people have fled the afflicted region, the numbers surging in recent weeks. A report by UN monitors disclosed an average of 13 people dying each day since a supposed ceasefire between Ukraine, Russia and the rebels in early September, while all the protagonists suffer painful economic fallout. So what’s being done? The message from last week’s G20 summit seemed clear: Putin was being sent to diplomatic Siberia. Stephen Harper, Canada’s prime minister, told the Russian president he would shake his hand but had only one thing to say: “You need to get out of Ukraine.” Then Putin was subjected to snubs, shunned at lunch and berated by other world leaders; little surprise he fled home early. Few will shed tears over such treatment of a despotic figure doing such damage to his nation’s interests both at home and abroad. But this was gesture politics of the worst kind from western leaders, posturing in public while seeming to have little strategy for how to resolve a spiralling crisis in the midst of Europe. Instead, Ukraine seems to be slipping down the foreign policy agenda. In the summer I saw early skirmishes at Donetsk airport, given a £500m facelift before football’s European Championship two years ago. Ukraine and the Russian rebels remain locked in lethal combat over the abandoned planes, wrecked control tower and battered terminal buildings, much of the debris filled with booby traps after the two sides slugged it out from different floors. Now a place that so recently demonstrated national pride is a depressing symbol of this destructive struggle. Not only has Putin got his hands on Crimea, but increasingly it appears he may be getting what he wants elsewhere in Ukraine too, with the destabilising of a fledgling democracy and creation of patsy states on his border. For as Kiev halts payments of public funds for Novorossiya (New Russia), the areas of Donbass controlled by rebels seem to be sliding into frozen statehood. This is another favoured Kremlin tactic – as seen with Russian-backed splinter states such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia, and Transnistria in Moldova. Novorossiya would, however, be much more costly to support, with the need to rebuild a shattered, heavily industrialised pariah state of 4 million people. It reveals how Putin is at the mercy of events as much as any other player in the region, trapped by the potent combination of soaring popularity and a shaky economy. Yet only the most deluded or sycophantic observer can blame anyone but Putin for these tragic scenes. For all his postmodern pretence of non-involvement, Russia’s president sent his forces into a neighbouring nation, tearing apart a country whose people sought the freedom and accountability he so fears in his own nation. Ukraine’s attempts to recapture its territory were thwarted by troops, tanks and artillery from over the border. The response of western leaders is to pose as tough guys on the public stage while preparing to impose a few minor sanctions on separatists and some Putin cronies. They hope that pressure on Russia’s economy will prevent further escalation, although this might make Putin even more unpredictable. Meanwhile, Moscow continues to ramp up military spending, just as it has done from the moment that Putin, this former KGB apparatchik with Tsarist ambitions, took office – while the Baltic states (members of Nato, remember) grow ever more anxious. Solutions should come from diplomatic, not military, action. Yet there must be deterrence alongside diplomacy. There is a danger, however, that the west is so distracted by events in the Middle East that it ignores the angry Russian bear lashing out in Europe, which possibly poses the bigger threat to our immediate futures. Earlier this year the Russian activist Alexei Navalny proposed a list of Putin’s inner circle who should be subjected to sanctions; nearly all are now on the western blacklist, apart from the football oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov. It would send a powerful signal to see sanctions imposed on this pair, whatever the cost to their London clubs. Moscow is also demanding guarantees that Ukraine will never be allowed to join Nato; but Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president, insisted this week that his nation will hold a vote once it meets the criteria for membership. Such a move should be welcomed if sought by the populace, as should their desire to join the EU. For at the core of this crisis lies the basic principle behind our noblest European ideals: the democratic right of people to determine their own futures, rather than have such hopes crushed by despotism or foreign aggressors.

Ukraine's new parliament members are being sworn in, but there are some empty seats because people from some areas couldn't vote. This is because Russia took control of Crimea and is causing trouble in eastern Ukraine. Many people have been killed or have had to leave their homes because of the fighting. Meanwhile, western leaders, like those from the United States and Europe, are not doing enough to solve the problem. They have imposed some penalties on Russia, but it might not be enough. The text suggests that more needs to be done to protect and support Ukraine's right to make decisions for itself, instead of having a big, powerful neighbor like Russia control them."},{"instruction":"Which entity is this text about? Zheng He (Chinese: Zheng He ; 1371-1433 or 1435) was a Chinese mariner, explorer, diplomat, fleet admiral, and court eunuch during China's early Ming dynasty. He was originally born as Ma He in a Muslim family, later adopted the conferred surname Zheng from Emperor Yongle. Zheng commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa from 1405 to 1433. His larger ships stretched 120 meters or more in length. Zheng He was born Ma He to a Muslim family of Kunyang, Kunming, Yunnan, China. He had an older brother and four sisters. Ma He's religious beliefs became all-embracing and eclectic in his adulthood. According to Dreyer (2007), the Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions suggest that Zheng He's devotion to Tianfei (Princess of Heaven, the patron goddess of sailors and seafarers) was the dominant faith to which he adhered, reflecting the goddess' central role to the treasure fleet. John Guy mentions, \\"When Zheng He, the Muslim eunuch leader of the great expeditions to the 'Western Ocean' (Indian Ocean) in the early fifteenth century, embarked on his voyages, it was from the Divine Woman that he sought protection, as well as at the tombs of the Muslim saints on Lingshan Hill, above the city of Quanzhou.\\" Zheng He was a great-great-great-grandson of Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar, who served in the administration of the Mongol Empire and was the governor of Yunnan during the early Yuan dynasty. His great-grandfather was named Bayan and may have been stationed at a Mongol garrison in Yunnan. Zheng He's grandfather carried the title hajji, while his father had the sinicized surname Ma and also the title hajji, which suggests that they had made the pilgrimage to Mecca. It also suggests that Zheng He may have had Mongol and Arab ancestry and that he could speak Arabic. In the autumn of 1381, a Ming army invaded and conquered Yunnan, which was then ruled by the Mongol prince Basalawarmi, Prince of Liang. In 1381, Ma Haji (Zheng He's father) died in the fighting between the Ming armies and Mongol forces. Dreyer (2007) states that Zheng He's father died at age 39 while resisting the Ming conquest. Levathes (1996) states Zheng He's father died at age 37, but it is unclear if he was helping the Mongol army or just caught in the onslaught of battle. Wenming, the oldest son, buried their father outside of Kunming. In his capacity as Admiral, Zheng He had an epitaph engraved in honor of his father, composed by the Minister of Rites Li Zhigang on the Duanwu Festival of the 3rd year in the Yongle era (1 June 1405).","output":"This text is about Zheng He, a Chinese mariner, explorer, diplomat, fleet admiral, and court eunuch during China's early Ming dynasty.

Question: suppose lesser greenhouse effect happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"In order to answer the question, let's break it down step-by-step and assess if there is a connection between the greenhouse effect and waste removal by the kidneys. 1. The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat and warm the planet. A lesser greenhouse effect would mean less heat being trapped and potentially a cooler planet. 2. The kidneys are responsible for removing waste from the body and regulating the balance of fluids and electrolytes within the body. The process of waste removal is largely independent of external environmental factors like the greenhouse effect. Now, let's examine the potential relationship between a lesser greenhouse effect and waste removal from the body. After assessing the processes involved in both phenomena, it's clear that the greenhouse effect influences global temperature, and kidney function is largely an internal biological process. There is no direct relationship between greenhouse effect perturbations and the waste removal capacity of kidneys. So, the answer to the question would be: A: No effect The lesser greenhouse effect will have no effect on the waste being removed from the body since these processes are unrelated and function independently of each other."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - An epitope, also known as antigenic determinant, is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or T cells. For example, the epitope is the specific piece of the antigen to which an antibody binds. The part of an antibody that binds to the epitope is called a paratope. Although epitopes are usually non-self proteins, sequences derived from the host that can be recognized (as in the case of autoimmune diseases) are also epitopes. - A phosphoprotein is a protein that is posttranslationally modified by the attachment of either a single phosphate group, or a complex molecule such as 5'-phospho-DNA, through a phosphate group. The target amino acid is usually serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues (mostly in eukaryotes), or aspartic acid or histidine residues (mostly in prokaryotes). - In immunology, an antigen is a molecule capable of inducing an immune response on the part of the host organism, though sometimes antigens can be part of the host itself. In other words, an antigen is any substance that causes an immune system to produce antibodies against it. Each antibody is specifically produced by the immune system to match an antigen after cells in the immune system come into contact with it; this allows a precise identification of the antigen and the initiation of a tailored response. The antibody is said to \\"match\\" the antigen in the sense that it can bind to it thanks to adaptations performed to a region of the antibody; because of this, many different antibodies can be produced, with specificity to bind many different antigens while sharing the same basic structure. In most cases, an antibody can only bind one specific antigen; in some instances, however, antibodies may bind more than one antigen. - Leukemia, also spelled leukaemia, is a group of cancers that usually begin in the bone marrow and result in high numbers of abnormal white blood cells. These white blood cells are not fully developed and are called \\"blasts\\" or \\"leukemia cells\\". Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising problems, feeling tired, fever, and an increased risk of infections. These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells. Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy. The exact cause of leukemia is unknown. Different kinds of leukemia are believed to have different causes. Both inherited and environmental (non-inherited) factors are believed to be involved. Risk factors include smoking, ionizing radiation, some chemicals (such as benzene), prior chemotherapy, and Down syndrome. People with a family history of leukemia are also at higher risk. There are four main types of leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as well as a number of less common types. Leukemias and lymphomas both belong to a broader group of tumors that affect the blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid system, known as tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Treatment may involve some combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and bone marrow transplant, in addition to supportive care and palliative care as needed. Certain types of leukemia may be managed with watchful waiting. The success of treatment depends on the type of leukemia and the age of the person. Outcomes have improved in the developed world. The average five-year survival rate is 57% in the United States. In children under 15, the five-year survival rate is greater than 60 to 85%, depending on the type of leukemia. In children with acute leukemia who are cancer-free after five years, the cancer is unlikely to return. In 2012, leukemia developed in 352,000 people globally and caused 265,000 deaths. It is the most common type of cancer in... - Benzene is an important organic chemical compound with the chemical formula CH. The benzene molecule is composed of 6 carbon atoms joined in a ring with 1 hydrogen atom attached to each. Because it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon. - B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 or CD20 is an activated-glycosylated phosphoprotein expressed on the surface of all B-cells beginning at the pro-B phase (CD45R+, CD117+) and progressively increasing in concentration until maturity. - Polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) are antibodies that are secreted by different B cell lineages within the body (whereas monoclonal antibodies come from a single cell lineage). They are a collection of immunoglobulin molecules that react against a specific antigen, each identifying a different epitope. - Plasma cells, also called plasma B cells, plasmocytes, plasmacytes, or effector B cells, are white blood cells that secrete large volumes of antibodies. They are transported by the blood plasma and the lymphatic system. Plasma cells originate in the bone marrow; B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibody molecules closely modeled after the receptors of the precursor B cell. Once released into the blood and lymph, these antibody molecules bind to the target antigen (foreign substance) and initiate its neutralization or destruction. - Rituximab ( trade names Rituxan , MabThera and Zytux ) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the protein CD20 , which is primarily found on the surface of immune system B cells . Rituximab destroys B cells and is therefore used to treat diseases which are characterized by excessive numbers of B cells , overactive B cells , or dysfunctional B cells . This includes many lymphomas , leukemias , transplant rejection , and autoimmune disorders . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the most important medications needed in a basic health system . It has a wholesale price of between 159.00 and 2,480.00 USD per vial as of 2014 . - Monoclonal antibodies (mAb or moAb) are antibodies that are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Monoclonal antibodies can have monovalent affinity, in that they bind to the same epitope (the part of an antigen that is recognized by the antibody). In contrast, polyclonal antibodies bind to multiple epitopes and are usually made by several different plasma cell (antibody secreting immune cell) lineages. Bispecific monoclonal antibodies can also be engineered, by increasing the therapeutic targets of one single monoclonal antibody to two epitopes. - Mast/stem cell growth factor receptor (SCFR), also known as proto-oncogene c-Kit or tyrosine-protein kinase Kit or CD117, is a receptor tyrosine kinase protein that in humans is encoded by the KIT gene. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. KIT was first described by the German biochemist Axel Ullrich in 1987 as the cellular homolog of the feline sarcoma viral oncogene v-kit.

Calling is the first step where you can show your ability to an employer. Here are some tried and true tips: Get the person responsible You need to talk directly to the person who would supervise you. In a small business, you might ask to speak to the \\"person in charge\\". In a larger one, you would ask for the name of the person in charge of the particular department you're interested in. Get the name of the person If you don't have the name of the person you need to speak to, ask for it. Usually, you will be given the supervisor's name and your call will be transferred to him or her. Get past the receptionist In some cases, receptionists and secretaries will try to screen out your call. If they find out that you're looking for a job, they may transfer you to the Personnel Department or ask you to send an application or resume. Here are some ways to keep from getting screened out: * Call back Call back a day later and say you are getting ready to send some correspondence to the person who manages such and such. You want to use the correct name and title and request that they give you this information. And this approach usually gets you what you need. Say \\"thank you\\" and call back in a day or so. Then ask for the supervisor or manager by name. * Call when the secretary is out You are likely to get right through if you call when the receptionist is out to lunch. Other good times are just before and after normal work hours. Less experienced staff members are likely to answer the phone and put you right through. Ask three times for an interview Sometimes, the supervisor you contact just simply rejects you. Then, you can try asking three times for an interview! Although this approach does not always work, asking the third time works more often than most people would believe. Arrange a time If the person agrees to an interview, arrange a specific date and time. Answer:","output":"Based on the article provided, here's a multiple-choice question: What strategies are recommended in the article to make a successful job seeking phone call? A. Asking for the supervisor's name before talking and calling when the secretary is likely to be out. B. Calling during the busiest hours to show persistence. C. Talking directly to the receptionist or secretary and explaining in detail why you are interested in the job. D. Directly asking for an interview in your first call and arranging the date and time. Correct answer: A. Asking for the supervisor's name before talking and calling when the secretary is likely to be out.

On 1 January 1948 Ferrier left for a four-week tour of North America, the first of three transatlantic trips she would make during the next three years. In New York she sang two performances of Das Lied von der Erde, with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic. Alma Mahler, the composer's widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: \\"Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed\\". After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February.During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated \\"this abominable accompanist\\" who deserved \\"a kick in the pants\\". When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: \\"What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me\\". Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.

Benjamin accused Adam of taking the last jar of peanut butter, Select from: 1). Benjamin is a distrusting person.. 2). Adam is a distrusting person..","output":"Benjamin accused Adam of taking the last jar of peanut butter, which showcases that Benjamin is a distrusting person. This distrustful behavior is the result of various factors that might have contributed to the development of Benjamin's personality and perception towards others. Here, we explore some potential reasons and the consequences of such behavior in daily life. Firstly, Benjamin's upbringing and past experiences might have played a significant role in shaping his distrusting nature. For example, he could have been betrayed by close friends or family members in the past, leading him to develop a belief that people cannot be trusted. Alternatively, he might have been raised in an environment where trust was not considered a valuable trait or simply not frequently practiced. A dysfunctional or unstable family background might also have contributed to the development of this trait in Benjamin. Secondly, Benjamin's personality might be naturally inclined towards suspicion and skepticism. Some people tend to be more wary of others due to innate character traits, which could be a result of genetic predispositions. In this case, Benjamin might have exhibited distrusting tendencies since a young age, making him prone to accusing others without substantial evidence. The consequences of Benjamin's distrusting nature are varied, some of which include: 1. Strained relationships: Constantly accusing others, as Benjamin accused Adam, can put a strain on relationships at home, work, or among friends. People may become wary of interacting with Benjamin, fearing that they might be accused of something they didn't commit. This can lead to social isolation and can negatively impact Benjamin's mental and emotional well-being. 2. Missed opportunities: Benjamin's distrust in others might hinder his ability to form meaningful connections, collaborate effectively at work, or develop long-lasting friendships. This behavior could also prevent him from engaging in experiences that require trust, such as team-building exercises or partnership-based projects. 3. Cognitive biases: Distrusting people like Benjamin might be prone to various cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, where they might seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs about a person or situation while disregarding any evidence that challenges those beliefs. 4.

He seeks out the expertise of Lt. Colonel John Henry Patterson, a British military engineer, to get the project back on track. Patterson travels from England to Tsavo, telling his wife, Helena, he will complete the project and be back in London for the birth of their son. He meets British supervisor Angus Starling, African foreman Samuel, and Doctor David Hawthorne. Hawthorne tells Patterson of a recent lion attack that has affected the project. That night, Patterson kills an approaching lion with one shot, earning the respect of the workmen and bringing the project back on schedule. However, not long afterwards, Mahina, the construction foreman, is dragged from his tent in the middle of the night. His half-eaten body is found the next morning. Patterson then attempts a second night-time lion hunt, but the following morning, another worker is found dead at the opposite end of the camp from Patterson's position. Patterson's only comfort now is the letters he receives from his wife.

They underwent many line up changes, with vocalist and founder Mark E. Smith as the only constant member. The Fall's long term musicians have included drummers Paul Hanley and Karl Burns; guitarists Marc Riley, Craig Scanlon and Brix Smith; and bassist Steve Hanley, whose melodic, circular bass lines are widely credited with shaping the band's sound from the early 1980s to the late-1990s. First associated with the late 1970s punk movement, the Fall's music underwent numerous stylistic changes, often concurrently with changes in the group's lineup. In 1983, Rough Trade Records released the Fall's ninth single, \\"The Man Whose Head Expanded\\", and on 19 September issued the band's tenth single and double pack \\"Kicker Conspiracy\\". Bizarrely, in November Kamera Records released around two- to three-thousand copies of the planned 1982 single \\"Marquis Cha Cha\\", the release date having been put back due to Kamera's financial troubles in late 1982, making it the Fall's eleventh single issue. That year Smith's American girlfriend and later wife, Brix Smith joined the band on guitar. Born Laura Elise Salenger, she was nicknamed after the track \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" by the Clash, a favourite song of hers. Brix's tenure in the group marked a shift towards the relatively conventional, with the songs she co-wrote often having strong pop hooks and more orthodox verse-chorus-verse structures. Additionally, Brix's keen sense of fashion gradually influenced the group's members to give more attention to their clothing and styling--but her platinum blonde hair and glamorous style were always somewhat at odds to the otherwise working class appearance of the Fall. Brix's first live appearance with the Fall was on Wednesday, 21 September 1983 at the Hellfire Club, Wakefield. Perverted by Language, released 5 December, was the Fall's final album for Rough Trade Records, but the first to feature Brix. Also released in December was the live album In a Hole, recorded during the Fall's tour of New Zealand in 1982, on Flying Nun Records. This era, a favourite period amongst many critics and fans, was marked by Brix's effort to find a wider audience for the Fall. They achieved a few modest UK hits with singles -- including their versions of R. Dean Taylor's \\"There's a Ghost in My House\\" (no.30, 1987) and the Kinks' \\"Victoria\\" (no. 35, 1988) and their own songs \\"Hey! Luciani\\" (no.59, 1986) and \\"Hit the North\\" (no.57, 1987) -- and enjoyed a string of critically acclaimed albums: The Wonderful and Frightening World of The Fall (1984), This Nation's Saving Grace (1985), Bend Sinister (1986) and The Frenz Experiment (1988). I Am Kurious, Oranj is notable as the fruit of a ballet project between Smith and dancer Michael Clark. Simon Rogers and later Marcia Schofield played keyboards, and Simon Wolstencroft replaced Burns on drums after This Nation's Saving Grace. Wolstencroft's playing also shifted the group's sound; his drumming was described as \\"nimble\\" and \\"funky\\" when compared to Burns. In 2014 Wolstencroft published a memoir You Can Drum But You Can't Hide about his 11-year stint in the Fall. did they win any awards?","output":"The Fall, an English post-punk band, went through numerous stylistic changes throughout their career, with Mark E.

Does it follow that \\"They were humble.\\"? (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","output":"(B). It is not possible to tell The statement \\"There was no boasting\\" can suggest the absence of self-promotion or overt displays of pride or superiority. While this behavior can be aligned with humility, which involves a modest or low view of one's own importance, it is not enough evidence to confirm that \\"they were humble.\\" Humility is a complex characteristic going beyond the absence of boasting. A humble individual often appreciates the strengths of others, overlooks their own strengths, maintains a perspective of their own weaknesses, appreciates the value of all things, and other similar qualities. They may also express kindness, generosity, and other positive traits. Humility is more than just restraining oneself from boasting or bragging. Moreover, the lack of boasting can result from other factors unrelated to humility. For example, it can be due to shyness, introversion, insecurity, a cultural norm, or a personal belief that boasting is inappropriate. Therefore, it would not be fully accurate to infer that \\"they were humble\\" from a mere lack of boasting. Thus, based on the given statement alone, it is not possible to tell if they were humble.

He was one of the first formally trained, professional architects in the new United States, drawing on influences from his travels in Italy, as well as British and French Neoclassical architects such as Claude Nicolas Ledoux. In his thirties, he emigrated to the new United States and designed the United States Capitol, on \\"Capitol Hill\\" in Washington, D.C., as well as the Old Baltimore Cathedral or The Baltimore Basilica, (later renamed the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary). It is the first Roman Catholic Cathedral constructed in the United States. Context: Latrobe returned to England in 1784, and was apprenticed to John Smeaton, an engineer known for designing Eddystone Lighthouse. Then in 1787 or 1788, he worked in the office of neoclassical architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell for a brief time. In 1790, Latrobe was appointed Surveyor of the Public Offices in London, and established his own private practice in 1791. Latrobe was commissioned in 1792 to design Hammerwood Park, near East Grinstead in Sussex, his first independent work, and he designed nearby Ashdown House in 1793. Latrobe was involved in construction of the Basingstoke Canal in Surrey, together with engineers John Smeaton and William Jessop. In spring 1793, Latrobe was hired to plan improvements to the River Blackwater from Maldon to Beeleigh, so that the port of Maldon could compete with the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation, which bypassed the town. The project lasted until early 1795, when Parliament denied approval of his plan. Latrobe had problems getting payment for his work on the project, and faced bankruptcy. In February 1790, Latrobe married Lydia Sellon, and they lived a busy social life in London. The couple had a daughter (Lydia Sellon Latrobe) and a son (Henry Sellon Boneval Latrobe), before she died giving birth during November 1793. Lydia had inherited her father's wealth, which in turn was to be left to the children through a trust with the children's uncles, but never ended up going to the children. In 1795, Latrobe suffered a breakdown and decided to emigrate to America, departing on November 25 aboard the Eliza. In America, Latrobe was known for his series of topological and landscape watercolors; the series started with a view of the White Cliffs of the south coast of England viewed from the Eliza. The series was preceded by a watercolor of East Grinstead, dated September 8, 1795. Question: Did the child live? Answer:","output":"Yes, both of Benjamin Henry Latrobe's children with Lydia Sellon, Lydia Sellon Latrobe and Henry Sellon Boneval Latrobe, survived their mother's death during childbirth in November 1793. The couple's daughter, Lydia Sellon Latrobe, and son, Henry Sellon Boneval Latrobe, went on to inherit their mother's wealth, although the inheritance was initially caught up in a trust with their uncles. Despite facing some obstacles surrounding the inheritance, the children ultimately lived and were provided for through this inheritance."},{"instruction":"Shocking . Admirable .

It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies. While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. Effects beyond one year are unknown. Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". What does inhaling corticosteroids deliver?","output":"Inhaling corticosteroids delivers the medication directly to the lining of the airways. This medication acts to reduce and prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways of the lungs which is a common characteristic in asthma. When inflammation is controlled, the airways are less likely to react to triggers. This helps to reduce the symptoms of asthma such as wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath, and it also helps prevent asthma attacks. Corticosteroids work by inhibiting the inflammatory response in the body that leads to the constriction and swelling of the bronchial tubes in the lungs. This anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids helps to reduce the swelling that narrows the airways, and makes it easier to breathe. Inhaled corticosteroids are typically delivered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI), a device that allows the medication to be delivered in a specific amount and aids in dispersing the medication through the airways. In addition to its effectiveness, the advantage of inhaling corticosteroids as opposed to taking them in pill form, is that the medication goes directly to the lungs, reducing the potential for systemic side effects found in oral corticosteroids. While inhaled corticosteroids are generally well-tolerated, potential side effects may include oral thrush, a yeast infection of the throat, and slight voice change due to irritation of the vocal cords. They may also potentially impact growth in children, so it is recommended to use the lowest dose that effectively controls the asthma. Overall, inhaled corticosteroids play a crucial role in long-term control of asthma and are effective in reducing the frequency and severity of asthma attacks. Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider are essential to ensure that the asthma is controlled and that the dose of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

When getting married, the bride choose the vanilla cake over the chocolate. She thinks the Choices: - vanilla tastes cheap.; - chocolate tastes cheap.;","output":"When getting married, the bride chose the vanilla cake over the chocolate, as she believed that the chocolate tasted cheap. The decision had been made after much contemplation, as everyone knew the bride was an ardent chocolate lover. So, it naturally came as a surprise when she decided to break with tradition and opt for a vanilla cake. The wedding preparations were well underway, and every detail was being carefully planned, from the extravagant decorations down to the scrumptious menu. Among various opinions, tastes and preferences, choosing the right cake flavor turned out to be one of the most fiercely debated subjects. However, the bride had her reasons to pick vanilla, and she eventually laid her case as to why chocolate can taste cheap. First, she argued that many chocolate cakes often use subpar or low-quality chocolate. The quality of cocoa and other ingredients can greatly impact the taste of the final product. Choosing a high-quality chocolate for the cake can sometimes be challenging, and the difference is noticeable in taste. She feared that settling for a low-quality chocolate cake would leave her and her guests underwhelmed on the big day. Secondly, she explained that when it comes to wedding cakes, pastry chefs and bakers often prioritize design and stability, which means that they might end up sacrificing some of the flavor in the process. A good chocolate cake is moist and rich, but sometimes, in order to design a cake that can support its beautiful decorations and multiple layers, the baker might make the cake drier or denser than desired. This, in turn, can affect the overall taste and texture of the chocolate cake. Next, she maintained that chocolate as a flavor can be overpowering. While it is undeniably a crowd favorite, chocolate in its many forms can easily overshadow the other delicate flavors served at the wedding. The bride, being a food connoisseur, wanted everyone to savor each dish on the menu, and she worried that having a chocolate wedding cake might dull their taste buds. Finally, she reasoned that choosing a vanilla cake would cater to a wider audience, including those who might not prefer chocolate. A well-made vanilla cake is versatile, delicate, and pairs well with various frostings, fillings, and beverage pairings. This would make it an ideal choice for all guests, respecting their diverse tastes and preferences. As time passed and the wedding date approached, the bride sought out the best bakery in town for her dream vanilla cake. After trying countless samples, she settled on a multi-layered, vanilla masterpiece. Delightfully moist, fragranced with the finest Madagascar vanilla beans, and adorned with a smooth, buttercream frosting – the cake was an ode to the sophistication and elegance that encapsulated her special day. At the wedding reception, the vanilla cake was unveiled to the awe of everyone present. Amid delicate floral arrangements and other tantalizing desserts, it emerged as the centerpiece of a lavish, tasteful spread. As everyone took their first bite, the bride couldn't help but notice the look of pure, unadulterated joy on their faces – even the staunchest chocolate aficionados couldn't resist its charm!"},{"instruction":"Process: - You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate - The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products. Question: suppose more water molecules split into oxygen happens, how will it affect LESS aluminum cans being recycled. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"A scenario where more water molecules split into oxygen is unlikely to have a direct effect on the recycling of aluminum cans. The process of recycling aluminum cans, as described above, does not involve the separation of water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen. Aluminum recycling primarily involves the collection, sorting, and melting of aluminum products to produce new aluminum materials. However, if we consider a hypothetical situation where more water molecules split into oxygen, there might be potential indirect effects on the aluminum recycling rate. One possible consequence of increased oxygen levels could be changes to the atmospheric composition and related environmental factors or chemical reactions. This could, in turn, influence the demand for or production of aluminum products. For instance, higher oxygen levels could lead to an increase in oxidation and corrosion, affecting the lifespan of certain metal products, including aluminum. This could subsequently result in a higher demand for aluminum materials and a higher rate of aluminum can production. Conversely, if the increased oxygen levels lead to changes in industrial production processes or the development of alternative materials that replace aluminum, it could lead to a decrease in demand for aluminum products and result in less aluminum cans being recycled. Additionally, if increased oxygen levels lead to more public awareness about environmental issues and sustainability, this could influence society's habits and attitude towards recycling. In this case, people might be more inclined to recycle aluminum cans, potentially leading to an increase in aluminum recycling. On the other hand, increased concern for the environment could also result in more strict regulatory measures, which could potentially limit the production and use of aluminum products, consequently leading to less aluminum cans being recycled. In conclusion, while there might not be a direct correlation between more water molecules splitting into oxygen and the recycling of aluminum cans, potential indirect effects could exist due to changes in environmental conditions, industrial production processes, materials demand, or societal habits. These indirect effects may either result in more, less, or no significant change to the recycling of aluminum cans, depending on how the underlying factors are influenced by the hypothetical perturbation to oxygen levels."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare industry.

Though it was clad in white marble to look like a Renaissance palazzo, the building's cast iron construction permitted large plate glass windows that permitted major seasonal displays, especially in the Christmas shopping season. In 1862, Stewart built a new store on a full city block with eight floors and nineteen departments of dress goods and furnishing materials, carpets, glass and china, toys and sports equipment, ranged around a central glass-covered court. His innovations included buying from manufacturers for cash and in large quantities, keeping his markup small and prices low, truthful presentation of merchandise, the one-price policy (so there was no haggling), simple merchandise returns and cash refund policy, selling for cash and not credit, buyers who searched worldwide for quality merchandise, departmentalization, vertical and horizontal integration, volume sales, and free services for customers such as waiting rooms and free delivery of purchases.

Article: There's no pizza on Mars, but scientists have found a solution to this problem for hungry astronauts: a pizza printer! NASA, the American space agency, has developed a machine that \\"prints\\" food. They showed a model of the printer in Austin, Texas last month. How does it work? Cartridges filled with powdered dough , cheese, sauce, water and oil put the ingredients layer by layer onto a printer bed. The printer bed, which gets hot from below, cooks the food as it's being printed. Since most of the ingredients are powdered, they can be sent into space and stored for many years without going bad. Water makes food go sour, so the food powders are mixed with water and oil only when they are being printed. \\"Long-distance space travel requires more than 15 years of shelf life for food.\\" says Anjan Contractor, whose company developing the printer. \\" We take water out, and in that form, food will last maybe 30 years.\\" In outer space, there are far fewer choices for astronauts for dinner. Most of their foods--even things like beef or shrimp--are eaten from bags as powders . Scientists hope the new food printer can be used to make more delicious food in outer space, keeping astronauts healthier and happier. But the printer is not limited to use in outer space. Scientists think it could be useful on Earth, too. It could allow personal meals to be made at the dinner table, according to each person's different needs. \\"Let's say someone is an athlete in the family, and he needs more protein ,\\" says Anjan Contractor, founder of Systems and Materials Research Corp, the company developing the printer. \\"We can design recipes for him and print out more protein-nutritious food for him.\\" Question: Which of the following is TRUE? _ Answer: Possible answers: A).

Hypothesis: He was worried that the adults would suspect something. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"In this scenario, it is not directly and unambiguously entailed by the premise that the individual is worried that the adults would suspect something. The premise provides a description of the person's behavior, but it does not explicitly provide the motive behind that behavior. However, it is possible to infer that the individual may be concerned about the adults suspecting something, based on the described actions. Slowing down when approaching the adults, taking deep breaths, and sauntering past them nonchalantly all suggest a desire to appear calm and controlled. These actions could be interpreted as an attempt to avoid drawing attention or appearing suspicious. There could be alternative explanations for the person's behavior, though. For instance, it might be possible that the individual is simply trying to catch their breath or recover from some physical exertion unrelated to the presence of the adults. The person could also be practicing a relaxation technique or adjusting their pace for some other reason. In conclusion, while the hypothesis that he was worried about the adults suspecting something is not directly entailed by the premise, it is a reasonable inference that can be drawn based on the described actions. However, it's important to consider other potential explanations for the person's behavior as well."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

The MFP's \\"top pursuit man\\" is a young police officer, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), badge number MFP4073.A member of one of the motorcycle gangs, Crawford Montazano (nicknamed Nightrider), escapes from police custody by killing an officer and stealing his vehicle. MFP officers chase the Nightrider in a high-speed chase that results in several serious wrecks. Among those involved is a cocky motorcycle cop nicknamed Goose (Steve Bisley), who radios Max. Max pursues Nightrider in a high-speed chase which results in Nightrider's death in a fiery crash. After the dangerous chase, Max' police chief, Fifi McAfee, warns Max that Nightrider's gang will be out for him now because of Nightrider's death.Nightrider's gang, which is led by Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), plans to avenge Nightrider's death by killing MFP officers. Meanwhile, they vandalize property, steal fuel, and terrorize the citizenry. While chewing up a town where the Nightrider's remains arrived by train, the gang brutalizes a civilian couple that tried escaping to the road; the couple is overtaken, then both of them are raped and the car is wrecked.

As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss. The answer is:","output":"Woglinde and Wellgunde"},{"instruction":"Given the below context: Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money. Art historian Christopher Gray mentions three... Guess a valid title for it!

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step in the process leading to an earthquake is the gradual accumulation of energy in the Earth's crust due to the continuous movement of tectonic plates. These plates are vast, irregularly shaped lithospheric slabs that make up the rigid outer layer of the Earth. The plates float on top of the more fluid and semi-solid asthenosphere, which is part of the Earth's mantle. The mantle undergoes convection, a process where hot material from deep within the Earth rises towards the surface, cools down, and then sinks back down towards the core. This convection causes the tectonic plates to move in different directions, albeit very slowly - usually at a rate of a few centimeters per year. As the tectonic plates move, they interact with one another along their boundaries. There are three main types of plate boundaries: divergent (where plates move apart), convergent (where plates move together), and transform (where plates slide past one another). The motion of the plates at these boundaries leads to the building up of stress within the Earth's lithosphere. The stress is caused by friction between the plates, as well as the deformation and compression of the rocks at plate boundaries. Fault lines are fractures or zones of weakness in the Earth's crust where intense stress has accumulated due to the movement of tectonic plates. The energy stored in the form of stress eventually surpasses the strength of the rocks along the fault line, causing a sudden release of this energy. This is the first key step that leads to the occurrence of an earthquake. The sudden release of energy during an earthquake results in the Earth's crust shifting along the fault. This movement can be either vertical or horizontal, and the displacement can range from a few centimeters to several meters, depending on the magnitude of the earthquake. As the plates abruptly move and slide past one another, a large amount of energy is both released and radiated outward from the fault in the form of seismic waves. These seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and along its surface, causing the ground to shake and vibrate. There are several types of seismic waves, including primary (P) waves, secondary (S) waves, and surface waves. P and S waves are also known as body waves, as they travel through the Earth's interior, while surface waves travel predominantly along the Earth's surface. In conclusion, the first step in the process of an earthquake is the gradual accumulation of stress in the Earth's crust as a result of tectonic plate movement. This stress, once it exceeds the strength of the rocks along a fault line, results in the sudden release of energy and ultimately leads to the shaking of the Earth's surface that we experience during an earthquake."},{"instruction":"This is one place I can safely say you won't want to stay at on the strip.

Which county experienced more rainy days? Hint: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur. Answer:","output":"In order to determine which county experienced more rainy days, let's analyze the information provided: Dirk County: - Experienced heavy precipitation leading to significant flood events. - Heavy rainfall led to massive water infiltration. - Implies that the soil reached saturation point, causing flood events. Saulk County: - Had a few thunderstorms. - Experienced runoff, but less infiltration and soil saturation. - Suggests that the rainfall did not consistently reach the infiltration capacity. From the information given, it seems that Dirk County experienced more rainy days than Saulk County. The heavy precipitation, massive water infiltration, and flood events in Dirk County indicate that they faced more significant and persistent rainfall in comparison to Saulk County, which only had a few thunderstorms and less soil saturation."},{"instruction":"1.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Stream of thoughts:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"A snowboarder is in midair above a snow-covered ridge beneath a blue sky\\" suggests that the snowboarder is indeed outdoors. We can infer this from several key elements in the sentence: 1. The snowboarder is mentioned to be in midair, which implies that they are off the ground and likely participating in an outdoor activity, as snowboarding is typically an outdoor sport. 2. The presence of a snow-covered ridge indicates that the setting is in a natural, outdoor landscape, likely in a snowy mountainous area. 3. The mention of a blue sky also confirms that the scenario is taking place outside, as indoor environments cannot have skies. Taking these factors into consideration, we can confidently conclude that the snowboarder is outdoors."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What kind of plant provided food for the insects used in the basic, least expensive kind of Kermes? Context: There were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities. The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans. For the wealthy, the dye used was Kermes, made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree. For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal; also known as Kermes vermilio or \\"Blood of Saint John\\", which was made from a related insect, the Margodes polonicus. It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes. The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the \\"Kermes\\" of Armenia (Armenian cochineal, also known as Persian kirmiz), made by collecting and crushing Porphyophora hamelii, an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses. The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color, called Venetian red, which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe. Its secret ingredient was arsenic, which brightened the color. The answer is:","output":"oak tree.

In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \\"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\\" he wrote, adding: \\"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \\"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \\"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \\"what limits he puts on his own rights\\". To this Shackleton replied: \\"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\\".The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170° W—everything to the west of that line, including Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and Victoria Land, would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\", and that he would seek to land further east, either at the Barrier Inlet visited briefly during the Discovery Expedition, or at King Edward VII Land. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all. It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land.

One of the founding members of the Polish Socialist Party, he played a significant role in the establishment of a sovereign Polish state after World War I. Of his many accomplishments, one noteworthy role was his tenure as Minister of Public Labour. In this article, we will discuss the time he spent in this position and the impact of his work. Jędrzej Edward Moraczewski: A brief biographical background Born on 13 January 1870 in a family with noble roots, Jędrzej Moraczewski showed an early interest in politics. After studying at a high school in Lviv and completing his education in Zurich, he became heavily involved in the growing Polish socialist movement. This period saw the formation of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS), which was founded in 1892 in Paris by Moraczewski and other prominent Polish political activists. Throughout his political career, Moraczewski held various crucial positions, including his membership in the Austro-Hungarian Parliament in 1908 and as a member of the Duma in 1915. However, his most significant accomplishment came with the formation of Poland's first independent government since the eighteenth century. Tenure as Minister of Public Labour On 16 November 1918, Jędrzej Moraczewski was appointed Prime Minister of the Provisional Government. The newly formed Polish state was in a dire socioeconomic situation, so it was crucial to address labor and employment issues. The Ministry of Public Labour was created, and Moraczewski took on the role of Minister in addition to his prime ministerial duties. The main objective of Moraczewski as Minister of Public Labour was to establish a framework to improve Poland's labor force. He introduced several policies aimed at creating a more egalitarian society. Under his leadership, the Ministry of Public Labour undertook projects relating to worker protection, unemployment assistance, and housing. Jędrzej Edward Moraczewski's tenure as both Prime Minister and Minister of Public Labour lasted precisely one year. On November 16, 1919, he handed over the reins to Leopold Skulski. Legacy and impact Moraczewski's tenure as Minister of Public Labour, albeit short, contributed significantly to the stabilization of the newly reestablished Polish state. The foundations laid by Moraczewski in the realm of labor policy helped shape Polish labor laws and social welfare programs for decades to come. Conclusion To answer the initial question posed in this article, Jędrzej Edward Moraczewski served as Minister of Public Labour for one year (from November 16, 1918, to November 16, 1919). Although brief, his time as Minister of Public Labour left a lasting impact on Poland's labor and welfare policies, setting the stage for the future development of the country."},{"instruction":"Please briefly summarize this news article: Russian parliament: Stalin ordered Katyn massacre MOSCOW – The World War II Katyn massacres were committed on the direct order of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, Russia's lower house of parliament said Friday — a statement hailed by Polish officials. The 1940 massacre of around 20,000 Polish officers and other prominent citizens in western Russia by Soviet secret police has long soured relations between the two countries. President Dmitry Medvedev will visit Poland in early December. Soviet propaganda for decades blamed the killings on the Nazis, but post-Soviet Russia previously acknowledged they were carried out by the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, or NKVD — Stalin's much feared secret police. The statement passed by the State Duma appears aimed as a step toward Russia definitively breaking with its Soviet legacy. Some observers have expressed alarm in recent years that Russia may be quietly rehabilitating Stalin. Last year, a quote praising Stalin was restored to the decoration of one of Moscow's busiest subway stations; this year, Moscow's mayor proposed allowing posters depicting Stalin as part of the annual celebrations of the defeat of Nazi Germany. \\"This historic document is important not only for Russian-Polish relations — much more it is important for us ourselves,\\" said Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Duma's foreign relations committee, according to the news agency ITAR-Tass. Russia has turned over scores of volumes of documents this year about Katyn to the Polish government. \\"Published materials, held in secret archives for many years, not only reveal the scale of this awful tragedy but show that the Katyn crime was committed on the direct order of Stalin and other Soviet leaders,\\" says the statement, which also expresses \\"deep sympathy for the victims of this unjustified repression.\\" Communist legislators tried to amend the statement to remove the naming of Stalin, but were defeated. \\"The falsification of history that we are fighting against in other countries is also taking place in our country, and today we could see it with our own eyes,\\" Kosachev said of the amendment attempt. Russian officials frequently use the term \\"falsification of history\\" to attack perceived attempts to underplay the importance of the Red Army in the fight against Nazi Germany. The head of the Polish parliament's foreign affairs committee, Andrzej Halicki, said he considered the Duma's statement to be a breakthrough. \\"I am happy that such a process of reconciliation and truth is taking place,\\" he said. \\"It is the first such act that proves that our relations and discussions are sincere.\\" However, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the conservative opposition Law and Justice party, said he still wants Russia to offer a full apology and compensation. A U.S. historian who wrote a book about Katyn, hailed the Duma decision. \\"I think this is part of a long process in which ultimately the Russian people will have to come to grips with their past,\\" Allen Paul, who authored \\"Katyn: Stalin's Massacre and the Triumph of Truth,\\" told The Associated Press. Associated Press writer Vanessa Gera in Warsaw contributed to this report. Summary:","output":"The Russian State Duma has acknowledged that Soviet dictator Josef Stalin directly ordered the World War II Katyn massacres, a tragedy where around 20,000 Polish officers and prominent figures were executed by Soviet secret police in western Russia. The admission was praised by Polish officials. This Soviet-era event has led to strained relations between Russia and Poland. The statement by the State Duma signifies Russia's attempt to distance itself from its Soviet legacy. Although Stalin's actions have been previously acknowledged by post-Soviet Russia, this statement carries additional weight and may serve as a step toward reconciliation between Russia and Poland."},{"instruction":"Q: What is the radiation patter influenced by?

Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose magma cools more happens, how will it affect less gas is trapped. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's consider the process and perturbation step-by-step. 1. Several types of gases form in the atmosphere. 2. These gases may come from various sources, such as volcanic eruptions, human activities, natural processes like decomposition, etc. 3. The gases remain trapped in the atmosphere, leading to a greenhouse effect. 4. The greenhouse effect occurs because the sun's light causes the trapped gases to hold in heat and energy. 5. These trapped gases, in turn, cause the Earth to become warmer. Now let's examine the perturbation hypothesis: Suppose that magma cools more, which results in less gas being trapped in the atmosphere. 1. Magma cooling could potentially affect the greenhouse effect by altering the number of gases released into the atmosphere. 2. If less gas is trapped due to the magma cooling, it may reduce the overall greenhouse effect. So, considering the perturbation hypothesis, we can say that the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. Less gas being trapped in the atmosphere due to cooler magma might potentially lead to a weaker greenhouse effect, and thus, reduced warming of the Earth. However, the relationship between magma cooling and the greenhouse effect is complex and could be influenced by other factors, such as human activities, that contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Deep in the South American jungles, plantation manager Barney Chavez (Burr) kills his elderly employer in order to get to his beautiful wife Dina Van Gelder (Payton).

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If wind energy becomes less viable, it is likely that countries and industries will have to rely more on alternative sources of energy, including fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. This increased reliance on fossil fuels could lead to a higher rate of coal consumption. As described in the process, burning coal releases sulfur oxides into the atmosphere, which eventually leads to the formation of acid rain. The supposed perturbation, which is the decrease in viability of wind energy, will have a direct influence on the second effect mentioned - the formation of sulfur oxides. The connection between these two elements is that wind energy production does not emit sulfur oxides, unlike coal combustion. Therefore, as more coal is burned due to lesser reliance on wind energy, the concentration of sulfur oxides in the atmosphere will increase. This increase in sulfur oxides, when combined with other factors mentioned in the process (such as the formation of sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid), will contribute to a higher intensity of acid rain. Hence, the perturbation (decreased viability of wind energy) will have a \\"more\\" effect on acid rain. The increased level of acid rain can have adverse consequences on the environment, including damage to forests, freshwater bodies, infrastructure, and other ecosystems. In conclusion, if wind energy becomes less viable, it will likely lead to an increased consumption of fossil fuels, particularly coal, resulting in an increase in sulfur oxides emissions and subsequent formation of acid rain.

A. louisiana B. oregon C. pet store D. tropical forest E. blue ridge mountains The best answer is Answer:","output":"B. Oregon and E. Blue Ridge Mountains To answer the question of where one could find a snake on a mountain, it is important to consider the geographical context and snake species that may be found in those areas. The correct options are B (Oregon) and E (Blue Ridge Mountains), as both these locations have mountainous regions that are known to be inhabited by various snake species. Oregon, located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, is characterized by diverse landscapes, such as mountains, forests, and coastal areas. It has various mountain ranges such as the Cascade Range, the Coast Range, and the Blue Mountains. These areas provide a natural habitat for several snake species, including the Northern Pacific Rattlesnake, Northwestern Garter Snake, Common Garter Snake, and the Rubber Boa. The Northern Pacific Rattlesnake, for example, can be frequently found at high elevations, including in the mountains of Oregon. The Blue Ridge Mountains, a segment of the Appalachian Mountains, stretch across the Eastern United States, covering regions from Pennsylvania to Georgia. This area is home to a wide variety of snake species, such as the Eastern Ratsnake, Timber Rattlesnake, Eastern Copperhead, Eastern Wormsnake, Eastern Kingsnake, Northern Black Racer, and Eastern Gartersnake. The mountainous terrain, abundant forests, and diverse ecosystems in the Blue Ridge Mountains provide ideal habitats for these snake species. In contrast, Louisiana (option A) has a mostly flat landscape with swampy areas, and while it is home to several snake species, it lacks mountainous terrain. A pet store (option C) is an artificial environment where snakes are kept in captivity and would not be considered a natural location on a mountain. Lastly, a tropical forest (option D) is a specific type of ecosystem typically found near the equator and is not specific enough to identify a mountainous location where snakes can be found. Therefore, the best options for finding a snake on a mountain are B. Oregon and E. Blue Ridge Mountains, as these locations have suitable mountainous environments and a diverse array of snake species."},{"instruction":"What is the final step of the following process: - Air is drawn in through the mouth - The air goes down the esophagus - The air moves into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is removed - The remaining oxygen enters the body Answer:","output":"The final step of the process after the remaining oxygen enters the body is: the oxygen-rich blood is pumped by the heart and circulated throughout the body via the circulatory system, where it is used by cells for various metabolic activities.

Context: I was about 14 and lived near a large tract of undeveloped land where people would go and park to fool around. There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on. We hadn't noticed a guy sitting on the hood with a bottle of booze and a pistol. As we ran, he was shooting and we could hear bullets going through the underbrush. No one was hit, thank goodness.

Answer:","output":"After Voldemort's death, Kingsley Shacklebolt became the Minister for Magic. Kingsley Shacklebolt was an esteemed and highly skilled Auror working for the Ministry of Magic. Before Voldemort's defeat, he participated actively in the Order of the Phoenix, fighting against the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters during the Second Wizarding War. When the Ministry of Magic fell under Voldemort's control, Kingsley was forced to go underground and operate covertly. Throughout the series, Kingsley proved himself to be an exceptional wizard and a dedicated fighter for justice, fighting alongside Harry, Hermione, Ron, and other members of the Order during pivotal events such as the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Battle of Hogwarts. After the final battle at Hogwarts, in which many lives were lost, and Voldemort was defeated by Harry Potter, the Wizarding World required a strong, trustworthy, and experienced leader to restore the damages caused by the war and to reunite the fractured society. Kingsley Shacklebolt was ultimately appointed as the new Minister for Magic, due to his steadfastness and impressive skill set. Under his leadership, many essential reforms were put into effect within the Ministry of Magic. Kingsley worked tirelessly to eradicate the biased and prejudiced policies that had been implemented during Voldemort's brief regime, focusing on equality and fairness for all magical beings, regardless of their blood status or creature heritage. Moreover, he sought to rebuild the trust between the Ministry and the magical community, which had been severely undermined during the dark period.

Martin is unsure of Ripley, but Ripley's goddaughter, Alexandra Korolenko (Radha Mitchell), who is also Victor's daughter, convinces him otherwise, although Ripley does not like that the two are getting close. Ripley tells Martin the plan, that they are going to steal from a Russian museum that has been smuggling Russian treasures into the country and bribing the NYPD with large donations and expensive equipment. The two infiltrate a party at the museum posing as cops, with Ripley as Lt. Weber (Robert Forster), a cop who has a particular vendetta against Ripley, to gather information about their vault.

The news emerged from a cancer-prevention trial involving the drug, challenging the credibility of Celebrex and its use in medical treatments. This revelation comes as a setback for the company, especially considering the recent recall of Merck & Co.'s Vioxx, a competing arthritis drug, due to similar heart safety concerns. Both Celebrex and Vioxx belong to the class of drugs known as COX-2 inhibitors, which have been widely prescribed for treating arthritis in a significant number of patients worldwide. In the cancer-prevention trial, over 2,000 patients were analyzed, with researchers discovering an alarming 2.5 times increased risk of suffering a heart attack among those taking Celebrex as compared to those on a placebo. Despite the potential heart attack risk, Pfizer has not yet recalled Celebrex, stating that they would continue scrutinizing the available data while collaborating with regulatory agencies to address this critical health issue. Upon the announcement of these concerning findings, Pfizer's stocks plummeted by 20%, presenting a severe financial threat to the company. Industry analysts estimate potential losses in revenue of up to billions of dollars if the drug is removed from the market or its consumer base significantly reduced. The recent Vioxx and Celebrex controversies have sparked heated debates among medical professionals, patients, and regulatory agencies over the safety of COX-2 inhibitors. Many are now questioning the overall efficacy and long-term risks associated with these drugs, which were initially thought to be safer alternatives to traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen. The FDA has committed to taking potential action by scrutinizing all currently available data and might impose restrictions or warnings for the prescription of COX-2 inhibitors like Celebrex. Additional measures to enhance drug safety might include mandatory warnings on potential heart attack risks, limited prescribing authority, and initiation of further clinical trials. For patients currently relying on Celebrex for arthritis treatment, it is recommended to consult with their healthcare providers and discuss potential alternatives or the necessity of continued use of the drug. As the medical community awaits further directives from regulatory bodies, it becomes crucial for patients and healthcare professionals to remain vigilant and stay informed about the potential risks associated with arthritis medications. In light of these recent developments, the future of COX-2 inhibitors may be uncertain, with a shift towards exploring alternative drug therapies or revisiting traditional NSAIDs for arthritis management being a possible outcome."},{"instruction":"Read the below conversation. M: Hello, Betty. Do you think women are better doctors than men? What would the listener say? A:","output":"Hello, thank you for involving me in this conversation. As an AI language model, I'm not a real person, but I can give you a neutral perspective on the subject. Regarding the question of whether women are better doctors than men, there is no definitive answer. Both male and female doctors possess unique qualities, and their skills or effectiveness cannot be solely attributed to their gender. In the medical profession, certain qualities such as empathy, communication, and patience are essential. Studies have suggested that female physicians tend to exhibit higher levels of empathy and better communication skills compared to their male counterparts. However, this is not to say that all female doctors are better in these regards, as individual differences among doctors exist regardless of gender. On the other hand, some studies have shown that male physicians are more likely to be specialized in high-demand fields, such as surgery and critical care. This may indicate a higher level of technical expertise in these specific areas. However, these findings can also be influenced by other factors, such as societal expectations, personal choices, and education opportunities. An important consideration when discussing issues like this is to avoid making sweeping generalizations about either gender. The quality of a doctor is determined by their education, experience, dedication, and interpersonal skills – not their gender. Both male and female doctors can possess the attributes needed to provide high-quality care to their patients. Furthermore, the diversity of perspectives and skill sets brought by both genders contribute significantly to the field of medicine, enhancing patient care and medical advancements. In short, we cannot conclusively say that women are better doctors than men or vice versa. Rather, we should focus on promoting equal opportunities for all individuals pursuing a career in the medical field, regardless of their gender. By fostering an inclusive and equitable environment, we enable all healthcare professionals to develop the skills and expertise necessary to provide exceptional care for their patients."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Premise: \\"A young lacrosse player is catching his breath.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"Sports aren't played they are worn.\\" is true?

Because of that, he will be in a place called \\"custody\\" for 3 years where he can't hurt anyone anymore, and then when he comes out, people will watch and help him for another 3 years to make sure he behaves. This sad event happened in front of a house in a place called Derry. A person who helps solve these kinds of problems, Detective Chief Inspector Michael, said that they are thinking about Gerard's family, who miss him very much. Gerard was a father too, and he had a little girl who is 3 years old. The detective hopes that other people will learn from this sad story and not be involved in violence like this."},{"instruction":"[Lindsay Lohan appeared healthy, upbeat, and pulled together (if somewhat surgically adjusted) and—putting to rest speculation that she might crash and burn spectacularly on live television—comported herself just fine in what proved to be an uneven episode.

What was unexpected, however, was that she played herself herself. Her life, after all, has given her the kind of experience and insight that make “Scared Straight” so effective — she can really speak to the effects of a life of crime. There are real, horrible consequences. Like “rehab in Malibu!” “Scared Straight” is one of the most formulaic sketches on the show, which usually makes it pretty successful: the Scared Straight team is introduced in the same way and from there it’s just an opportunity to make as many prison rape jokes as possible. Lohan started out quite funny, but was obviously reading from the teleprompter halfway through the sketch, and stumbled over a few of her lines. It would have been great to see a more polished performance from her, but it didn’t matter, because after she left the scene Jason Sudeikis sat down emphatically on his desk, knocking off the contents (as well as his glasses) and he, Andy Samberg, Bill Hader and Bobby Moynihan collapsed into giggles.

Lohan herself was mostly pushed to the background for the show, usually appearing in unchallenging supporting roles in sketches. The show winked at Lohan’s history of legal troubles in the monologue — Lohan got a pat-down from Kristen Wiig — and in a new “Scared Straight” sketch, in which Lohan played herself. (In that sketch, Lohan’s dependency on cue cards became excruciatingly clear during a long soliloquy.) A visiting Jon Hamm was officially named the night’s back-up host, and the Mad Men star arguably got a bigger laugh for his brief appearance as Snooki’s baby daddy than Lohan got all night. It certainly wasn’t the blazing comeback performance us Lohan apologists have been hoping for. But how bad was it? Did you give Lohan grade inflation just for showing up? Did you like how Jimmy Fallon accepted Lohan’s out-of-nowhere and completely unplanned invitation? How does her episode stack up to this season’s other hosts? Take the poll below, and check back here Sunday morning for my complete recap. Take Our Poll Follow Darren on Twitter: @EWDarrenFranich ||||| I don’t think anyone expected that Lindsay Lohan would be hosting <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in 2012, or that she would do so without a movie, album, or any project at all to promote! Her opening monologue was a perfect opportunity to answer some questions the audience would have for her, and she wasted no time poking fun at herself for her various arrests and her stalled career. She also had help from a few cast members, including Kenan Thomson, Kristen Wiig, Jimmy Fallon and a celeb cameo from Jon Hamm. The first three were there to demonstrate their utmost faith in her hosting abilities; the fourth was there as a back-up host juuuuuust in case. Not that she’d need it. But just as a precaution. You understand. It remains to be seen how the episode will go, but Lindsay seemed game for anything so far (and looked really lovely!) You can seen her opening monologue here, via NBC: Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| Lindsay Lohan, promoting her “SNL” appearance with Kenan Thompson. (NBC/DANA EDELSON/NBC) Lindsay Lohan attempted to make a triumphant return to non-court-hearing-related pop cultural relevancy by hosting “Saturday Night Live” this week. Did it work? Well, not entirely. Lohan started strong with an opening monologue that openly acknowledged her recent circumstances, complete with an alarm that sounded when she stepped offstage, a patdown from Kristen Wiig and a promise from Jon Hamm to step in as host the minute she crashed and burned. The first taped sketch, “Real Housewives of Disney” — which featured Belle, Cinderella, Snow White, Rapunzel and Jasmine acting like Camille Grammer and NeNe Leakes — also worked well, and was a nice dig at Lohan’s roots as Disney golden girl. Then things went a tad south. The prison sketch that added Lohan to the usual Kenan Thompson “Scared Straight” proceedings presented an opportunity for her to fire off a self-reverential monologue — one that mentioned her role in “Herbie: Fully Loaded” and the accusations she faced regarding stolen jewelry. But Lohan, who kept glancing at her cue cards, delivered her lines with a lack of conviction. That ball got definitively dropped. In other sketches — most notably, the a.m. DJ riff and a housesitting bit she did with a decidedly paranoid, butt-dialing Kristen Wiig — were a little better. But Lohan had notably less dialogue to deliver in those sketches and was largely carried by her co-stars. In essence, this was hardly a disaster on par with, say, Lana Del Rey. But Lohan also didn’t fully reclaim her status as a young comic performer worthy of casting in major Hollywood projects. But what did you think?

Question Why was the painting so quickly available for pickup ? Answer:","output":"The painting was so quickly available for pickup due to several possible reasons, which could be individually or collectively responsible for the quick turnaround time at the frame shop. 1. Efficient staff and processes: The frame shop might have highly skilled and well-managed staff who know how to work efficiently and get their tasks done quickly without compromising quality. They may have established processes in place to ensure jobs are completed in a timely manner. 2. Lower workload or off-peak hours: You might have visited the shop during a time when they didn't have many orders or customers to attend to. During such periods, staff can focus on completing the tasks at hand more quickly as they don't have other distractions or a backlog of work. 3. Priority given to your order: In some cases, shops might prioritize certain orders based on factors such as customer loyalty, previous interactions, or the simplicity of the task. If your painting fell under the priority category, it could have received immediate attention, resulting in quick completion. 4. Simple framing requirements: The framing and finishing requirements for your painting may have been relatively simple, without requiring any complex or time-intensive techniques. This could have made it easier and faster for the staff to complete the work on your painting. 5. High-quality equipment: The frame shop might be equipped with modern, high-quality tools and machinery that enable them to complete tasks more quickly and efficiently than if they were using older or more basic equipment. 6. Experience with similar projects: If the frame shop staff have previously worked on similar paintings or framing projects, they might have a better understanding of the specific requirements and potential obstacles. This experience can contribute to a faster completion time. In conclusion, the painting was quickly available for pickup due to a combination of factors such as efficient staff, lower workload, priority given to your order, simple framing requirements, high-quality equipment, and experience with similar projects. This enabled the frame shop to complete the task much sooner than you expected."},{"instruction":"Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said.

Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable.

One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

When she becomes aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread.Guerin begins by interviewing the prepubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing projects. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved.As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her being removed from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation.On June 26, 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous citations for speeding she has ignored.

Answer:","output":"The result of Veronica Guerin's death had a significant impact on both the public and the government in Ireland, leading to changes in legislation and a crackdown on organized crime. Following her murder, there was widespread outrage and grief among the Irish population. Guerin was seen as a symbol of courage and determination in her fight against the drug trade, and her death highlighted the increasing danger that journalists faced when reporting on organized crime. In response to the public outcry, the Irish government took swift action to address the issues of organized crime and drug trafficking. The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) was established in 1996, just a few months after Guerin's death. CAB was designed to seize the assets of criminals, particularly those involved in drug trafficking, and redirect the funds towards the fight against organized crime. This move was a direct consequence of Guerin's investigative work and her relentless pursuit of the truth, which had exposed the extent of the drug trade in Dublin and its devastating effects on local communities. In addition to the creation of CAB, the Irish government also introduced new legislation to target organized crime more effectively. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 were designed to strengthen the powers of law enforcement agencies in combating organized crime, allowing them to seize the assets of criminals and bring them to justice more easily. The introduction of these legislations was a direct response to the escalating crime levels in the country and the shock of Veronica Guerin's murder. Furthermore, Guerin's death also led to a renewed emphasis on the protection of journalists and the importance of freedom of the press. Her murder raised awareness about the risks that journalists face when reporting on sensitive issues and the need for greater protection and support for those working in dangerous environments. Perhaps one of the most significant outcomes of Guerin's death is the crackdown on organized crime figures in Ireland. Several high-profile criminals, including John Gilligan (the prime suspect in her murder) and John Traynor, were subsequently arrested and imprisoned. This was a clear message to criminals that the authorities were taking the issue of organized crime seriously, and the consequences of Guerin's death served as a strong deterrent. In summary, Veronica Guerin's death led to significant reforms in Ireland's approach to organized crime, including the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, the introduction of new legislations, and increased protection for journalists. Moreover, her work and sacrifice inspired a new generation of journalists and law enforcement officials to continue her fight against crime and help make the country a safer place."},{"instruction":"Answer the question...who wrote the song mamas don t let your babies grow up to be cowboys??","output":"In order to answer the question, I will first conduct research to find out the songwriter(s) of the song \\"Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys.\\" Step 1: Research the song information I will search through reliable sources such as music databases and online encyclopedias to find information regarding the song.
