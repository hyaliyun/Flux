Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Corey Todd Taylor (born December 8, 1973) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, actor, and author, best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the bands Slipknot and Stone Sour. Taylor formed Stone Sour in 1992, playing in the Des Moines area, and working on a demo. He joined Slipknot in 1997 to replace their original vocalist and has subsequently released five studio albums with them. After the first two Slipknot albums went Platinum, Taylor revived Stone Sour to record an album and tour in 2002. Corey Todd Taylor was born on December 8, 1973 in Des Moines, Iowa. He was mostly raised by his single mother in Waterloo, Iowa, a place described by Taylor as a \\"hole in the ground with buildings around it\\". He is of Irish, German and Native American descent on his father's side, and Dutch and Irish on his mother's side. In 1979, Taylor and his mother saw the sci-fi series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Before the series, there was a trailer for the 1978 horror film Halloween. Taylor said this \\"developed some sense of Slipknot in [himself]\\". While Halloween introduced Taylor to masks and horror themes, Taylor's grandmother introduced him to rock music, showing him a collection of Elvis Presley records from the 1950s to 1970s. He especially found songs like \\"Teddy Bear\\", \\"In the Ghetto\\", and \\"Suspicious Minds\\" to appeal to his interests the most, describing them as \\"good times\\". Taylor also began listening to Black Sabbath at a young age, beginning with their early work.  Taylor, along with his mother and sister, lived at one point in an \\"old dilapidated farmhouse\\" which on days in late autumn would \\"look like Black Sabbath album covers\\". By age 15, he had developed a drug addiction and had overdosed on cocaine twice. By this time, he was living in Waterloo, but later set out on his own and ended up at his grandmother's house in Des Moines. She took legal custody of him so that he could continue going to school, and she helped him buy musical equipment. When Taylor was 18, he left his grandmother's house and went to various places in Iowa, Des Moines being a place to which he frequently returned.  In 2017, on an episode of Viceland's The Therapist, Taylor revealed that he was sexually assaulted at the age of 10 by a 16-year-old friend. Taylor stated that he never told anyone about the incident until he was \\"probably 18\\" because his abuser \\"threatened to hurt [him] and threatened to hurt [his] mom\\". At age 18, when Taylor was living with his grandmother, he attempted suicide by way of overdose. His ex-girlfriend's mother drove him to the hospital in Des Moines and doctors were able to resuscitate him. He describes this as the lowest point in his life. Taylor first met his father when he was 30 years old, and now has a relationship with him, although he said their paths do not cross that often.

By choosing a top that is fitted, you will be balancing out the look and enhancing your feminine curves.  Try pairing your tulle skirt with a soft, form-fitting scoop neck sweater or a delicate fitted blouse. Look for tops with feminine cuts as well. For example, you could choose a top that reveals a bit of your chest, shoulders, or back. Lace is another great way to intensify the femininity of your tulle skirt. Try wearing a tulle skirt with a form fitting lace top or a top that has lace details. For example, you can look for a tank top with lace around the neckline, a long sleeved top made entirely of lace material, or a blouse that has a wide strip of lace down the front. A masculine touch can make for an interesting pairing, and emphasize the contrast between your skirt and top. Try wearing your tulle skirt with a plaid flannel shirt or a plain white button down shirt to get this contrasting effect. Other ways to add a masculine touch to your tulle skirt look is to wear a denim shirt or a band t-shirt. Both of these tops will contrast with the feminine, fluffy skirt in a fun way. Pairing your tulle shirt with a simple top can tone down a tulle skirt for casual daytime activities, and make it easier to transition your look from day to night. Try wearing your tulle skirt with a plain white t-shirt, band t-shirt, or a solid tank top for a toned down daytime look.  Carry a cardigan, shrug, or shawl that you can slip on later in the day to transition your tulle skirt look from day to night. Make your look more glamorous with some decadent jewelry, like a pearl necklace, so diamond (faux or real) studs, or some gold bangles. Tulle skirts are traditional ballerina attire, and you can play on this by pairing your tulle skirt with a bodysuit. Try wearing your tulle skirt with either a short or long sleeved white, pale pink, or black bodysuit. Tulle skirts are so versatile that they can be worn year round. You just need to pair them with the right kind of top to make it work. Try pairing your tulle skirt with a sweater in cold weather for a glamorous winter outfit. Different length coats and jackets pair well with tulle skirts as well.

The thicker the blanket gets, the warmer it gets inside it. When we do activities that produce more greenhouse gases, like driving cars and using electricity from burning coal, our ecological footprint increases. This means we leave a larger mark on the Earth and affect its ecosystems more since we are warming up the Earth. This is called the greenhouse effect. We can reduce the effect by doing things that lessen the greenhouse gases we create. We can use energy from the sun, wind, and water instead of burning coal; ride bikes or walk instead of driving cars and also, we can plant more trees and plants.  Small plants also help reduce the green house effect because they clean the air by taking in the carbon dioxide, which is one of the greenhouse gases, and give out oxygen that we breathe.

So, what's the best answer to the question?","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What lives in large colonies?\\" appears to be insects, specifically honey bees. Honey bees, as mentioned by the teacher, are insects that live in hives and make honey. These hives can house thousands of individual bees, forming a large and complex colony. Honey bee colonies consist of a single queen, many worker bees (which are all female), and a smaller number of male bees called drones. The queen bee is the mother of all the bees in the colony and is responsible for laying eggs. Worker bees, on the other hand, perform various tasks crucial to hive life, such as foraging for nectar and pollen, caring for larvae, building honeycomb, and protecting the colony from potential threats. Drones have the sole purpose of mating with the queen. The complex social behavior in honey bee colonies is remarkable. They communicate through a variety of methods, such as pheromones and intricate dances that convey information about food sources and potential dangers. This highly organized and cooperative system allows honey bees to work together efficiently and maintain the colony's overall health and productivity. Furthermore, honey bees are not the only insects that live in large colonies. Other examples include ants, termites, and certain wasp species. These insects also exhibit complex social behaviors and live in highly organized and structured colonies where individual members have specific roles and responsibilities. This system of social organization is termed eusociality, and it is a characteristic found in some animal species that allows them to live in large colonies with complex social structures. In conclusion, given the teacher's hints, the best answer to the question \\"What lives in large colonies?\\" is insects, particularly honey bees, as they display sophisticated social behaviors and have a highly organized system that supports their large colonies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Build a movie plot around this: What banned writings was Sonmi introduced to? of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Answer:","output":"Title: Unshackled Pages Genre: Drama, Thriller Setting: A dystopian future society in which literature is monitored and controlled by an oppressive government. Plot: In the not-too-distant future, Sonmi, a young and passionate librarian, secretly seeks out banned writings in an attempt to learn the truth about her society and the suppressed history that has shaped it. Over the years, she has amassed a clandestine collection of forbidden texts hidden within the depths of the library's restricted archives, away from prying government eyes. One day, Sonmi encounters a particular piece of banned literature that will change her life forever—an anthology of works by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. As Sonmi delves into Solzhenitsyn's writings, she is captivated by his powerful stories of human perseverance, resistance, and courage in the face of tyranny. These stories resonate deeply with Sonmi, who lives under an increasingly oppressive regime, and she is inspired to take action. Gradually, she starts to rally a group of like-minded individuals who've also secretly read Solzhenitsyn's works, and together they form the \\"Unshackled Pages,\\" a group dedicated to resisting government control and spreading the message of freedom and resistance found in banned literature. However, the group's actions do not go unnoticed for long. Government surveillance exposes their activities and starts to hunt them down ruthlessly. Members of the \\"Unshackled Pages\\" must learn to navigate this dangerous terrain, using their newfound knowledge from Solzhenitsyn's writings as a guide. In the end, Sonmi is forced to make a heart-wrenching decision—disband the group and flee or stay and fight for the freedom they've come to cherish. As the story unfolds, Sonmi and her fellow \\"Unshackled Pages\\" members must wrestle with the themes at the core of Solzhenitsyn's work: the price of individual freedom and the responsibility to resist injustice, no matter the cost. Through their struggle and sacrifice, they ultimately become modern embodiments of the same spirit of resilience that Solzhenitsyn captured in his texts. The film's climax sees Sonmi and her fellow group members risking everything in a daring mission to infiltrate the government's Department of Literature Control, exposing the truth about the regime's vast censorship efforts and empowering the people to reclaim their rightful freedoms. Their actions inspire a wave of rebellion, leading to a revolution that challenges the oppressive government. Unshackled Pages becomes a symbol of hope for a liberated future, echoing the message of Solzhenitsyn and his timeless works."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This change can indirectly impact the process of oxygen absorption in the lungs. Although the fundamental processes of air traveling into the body, reaching the lungs, and oxygen being transported by hemoglobin remain the same, some adjustments take place to accommodate the reduced oxygen needs. To understand the supposed perturbation during rest and sleep, let's analyze the potential effects on the oxygen absorption process: 1. Slower Breathing Rate: During rest and sleep, the breathing rate decreases as a response to reduced oxygen consumption. This slows down the rate at which air enters the body and reaches the lungs. This is an indirect step in the process because it doesn't change the absorption mechanism in the lungs but alters the rate at which oxygen becomes available. 2. Blood Circulation: In resting or sleeping states, the heart rate typically slows down, reducing the speed with which the blood circulates throughout the body. This indirectly impacts the rate of oxygen transportation by hemoglobin in the red blood cells. 3. Oxygen Demand by Cells: As the body's cells require less energy during rest and sleep, their demand for oxygen is lower than during periods of activity. This indirectly influences the lungs' absorption rate by creating a lower need for oxygen and, consequently, a slower transport of oxygen to the cells. 4. Lung Function Stability: Even during resting or sleeping states, the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen remains fundamental to the body's needs and is not negatively impacted. In fact, resting may even enhance lung function by allowing the lungs to maintain their elasticity, an essential feature in the efficient absorption of oxygen from the air. To summarize, the supposed perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process. The resting or sleeping state influences the rate at which air enters the body and the subsequent oxygen demand and transport, but it does not directly impact the function or the mechanism of oxygen absorption in the lungs or the transportation of oxygen by hemoglobin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I quickly promised her that I wouldn't make her do more than she was able to. I told her frankly that I didn't enjoy managing my money any more than she did hers and wouldn't burden her with guilt, judgments, or impossible tasks.  All I would ask her to do was to let me help her look at her fears and try to make some sense of them.

Many of us are terrified of handling our money because we don't believe we can do it well, and to do it wrong would put our very existence at risk.  On a deeper level we know that money is not the source of life, but sense of worth drives us to act as if it were. It locks us up in self-doubts and prevents us from tapping into the true source of our management power, our spirit.

Q:-  Dead organic material accumulates on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds or swamps, mixing with mud and sand - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The last step of the process could be the formation of hydrocarbon deposits, such as oil or natural gas. Reasoning: Since the molecules have been broken up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms, these molecules can further combine and rearrange themselves to form hydrocarbon chains. Over time, these hydrocarbon chains can accumulate and migrate through porous rock formations, eventually forming deposits of oil or natural gas trapped within these layers. This process can lead to the formation of oil and gas reservoirs, which are valuable energy resources that can be extracted and utilized for various human activities and industries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - Bloomsbury is an area in the West End, central London, forming part of the London Borough of Camden and located between Euston Road and Holborn. It was developed by the Russell family in the 17th and 18th centuries into a fashionable residential area. It is notable for its array of garden squares, literary connections (exemplified by the Bloomsbury Group), and numerous cultural, educational and health-care institutions. Although Bloomsbury was not the first area of London to have acquired a formal square, Bloomsbury Square, laid out in 1660 by Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, as Southampton Square was the first square to be named as such. Much of the district was planned and built by James Burton.  - Herodotus (\\"Hródotos\\") was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC (484 425 BC), a contemporary of Socrates. He is widely referred to as \\"The Father of History\\" (first conferred by Cicero); he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \\"The Histories\\" is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \\"inquiry\\" (or \\"historía\\") on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate; yet he states that he was reporting only what was told to him and was often correct in his information. Despite Herodotus' historical significance, little is known of his personal history.  - Assyria was a major Mesopotamian East Semitic-speaking kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East.

Astyages succeeded his father in 585 BCE, following the Battle of Halys, which ended a five-year war between the Lydians and the Medes. He inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, Croesus of Lydia and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whose wife, Amytis, Astyages' sister, was the queen for whom Nebuchadnezzar was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. but due to the recent evidence, the garden was likely built by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. Married to Aryenis, the sister of King Croesus of Lydia, to seal the treaty between the two empires, Astyages ascended to the Median throne upon his father's death later that year.  - Rusa II was king of Urartu between around 680 BC and 639 BC. It was during his reign that the massive fortress complex, Karmir-Blur, was constructed.  - Cyaxares (\\"Uvaxštra\\", , ; r. 625585 BC), the son of King Phraortes, and according to Herodotus was the third and most capable king of Media.

Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history.  - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Pacing and Pausing Sara tried to befriend her old friend Steve's new wife, but Betty never seemed to have anything to say. While Sara felt Betty didn't hold up her end of the conversation, Betty complained to Steve that Sara never gave her a chance to talk. The problem had to do with expectations about pacing and pausing. Conversation is a turn-taking game. When our habits are similar, there's no problem. But if our habits are different, you may start to talk before I'm finished or fail to take your turn when I'm finished. That's what was happening with Betty and Sara. It may not be coincidental that Betty, who expected relatively longer pauses between turns, is British, and Sara, who expected relatively shorter pauses, is American. Betty often felt interrupted by Sara. But Betty herself became an interrupter and found herself doing most of the talking when she met a visitor from Finland. And Sara had a hard time cutting in on some speakers from Latin America or Israel. The general phenomenon, then, is that the small conversation techniques, like pacing and pausing, lead people to draw conclusions not about conversational style but about personality and abilities. These habitual differences are often the basis for dangerous stereotyping  . And these social phenomena can have very personal consequences. For example, a woman from the southwestern part of the US went to live in an eastern city to take up a job in personnel. When the Personnel Department got together for meetings, she kept searching for the right time to break in -- and never found it. Although back home she was considered outgoing and confident, in Washington she was viewed as shy and retiring. When she was evaluated at the end of the year, she was told to take a training course because of her inability to speak up. That's why slight differences in conversational style -- tiny little things like microseconds of pause -- can have a great effect on one's life. The result in this cause was a judgment of psychological problems -- even in the mind of... Options: A Americans. B Israelis. C The British. D The Finns. Answer: B Israelis.

The context clearly states that Alaska Airlines is making changes to its flight routes. It is discontinuing two non-stop flights (\\"from Albuquerque to San Francisco and Orange County\\") due to the lack of demand. However, flights to Portland, Seattle, and San Diego will continue to be offered by the airline from Albuquerque International Sunport. Furthermore, the text also explicitly mentions that Alaska Airlines plans to add two new direct daily flights from El Paso to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and San Diego International Airport. Taking all this information into account, we can infer that the original hypothesis, \\"Alaska Airlines has no plans to add any flights in the near future,\\" is incorrect. Instead, the airline is both removing certain flights and adding new ones as a strategic response to fluctuating market demands.

Select the topic that this about: Tom Scheffler gets the same reaction whenever he takes consumers to an Internet cafe to show them a different kind of phone service.","output":"The topic of discussion here is the adoption of alternative phone services, specifically at an Internet cafe, as introduced by Tom Scheffler. The focus will be on the reaction of consumers to this new kind of phone service and their perception of the benefits, drawbacks, and overall experience associated with it. Internet cafes have long been a hub for internet and computer usage, especially in areas where people lack personal access to the internet. Tom Scheffler, an advocate for alternative phone services, utilizes the popular setting of an Internet cafe to present an innovative telecommunications service to the public. By doing so, he aims to broaden the horizon of communication means for the average consumer and offer more cost-effective and convenient methods. While traditional phone services typically rely on regular telephone lines or mobile networks to establish connection, alternative phone services often rely on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology. VoIP allows users to make voice calls using a broadband internet connection instead of conventional analog phone lines. This kind of technology has gained significant traction in recent years due to its cost-effective nature, especially for long-distance and international calls. Popular examples of VoIP services include Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp, which also provide video calling and messaging features. As Tom Scheffler demonstrates these alternative phone services at the Internet cafe, consumers often show reactions of surprise and curiosity. They may be intrigued by the service's ability to make calls at a fraction of the cost as compared to traditional methods. These reactions could be attributed to several factors, including the following: 1. Cost-efficiency: As mentioned earlier, VoIP-based phone services offer considerable savings compared to traditional phone services, especially for long-distance and international calls. These savings are a major attraction point for consumers who are often burdened by expensive phone bills on a monthly basis. 2. Ease of use: Alternative phone services often come with user-friendly interfaces and intuitive features that make navigation and usage quite simple. This factor is important for consumers who may not be well-versed in technology, as it reduces the learning curve associated with new devices and services. 3. Flexibility and adaptability: VoIP services can be accessed through various devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers. This provides users with the flexibility and convenience of communicating through their preferred device at any moment, as long as they have a stable internet connection. 4. Additional features: Apart from voice calls, alternative phone services also offer features like video calls, instant messaging, and file sharing. These additional services further enhance the appeal of alternative phone services to the consumer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are presented with the quiz \\"The risks of all types of skin cancer increases with increasing\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth\\" and \\"if there is an increase in UV radiation, the risks go up for all types of skin cancer\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Available choices: 1). oxygen debt; 2). rays or beams; 3). electromagnetic energy; 4). scattered light; 5). temperature; 6). shadow boxing; 7). ozone depletion; 8). redshift; Answer:","output":"Answer: 3). electromagnetic energy Based on the hints provided by your teacher, we can deduce that the best answer to this quiz question is \\"electromagnetic energy.\\" This is because the hints relate to an increase in UV (ultraviolet) radiation, which is a form of electromagnetic energy, resulting in heightened risks for all types of skin cancer. Ozone depletion, as mentioned by the teacher, leads to higher levels of UV radiation reaching the Earth. Ultraviolet radiation is a type of electromagnetic energy that falls within the electromagnetic spectrum, a range of energies that includes visible light, radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays. UV radiation, in particular, has a wavelength shorter than visible light but longer than X-rays. The increased amount of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface due to ozone depletion can cause adverse effects on human health. One of these effects is an increased risk of skin cancer, as higher levels of UV radiation can cause damage to the DNA in skin cells. This damage may lead to mutations and, ultimately, the development of skin cancers such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. In conclusion, the best answer to the quiz question, \\"The risks of all types of skin cancer increases with increasing,\\" is \\"electromagnetic energy,\\" as increased levels of UV radiation - a form of electromagnetic energy - heighten the risk for all types of skin cancer. The other available choices do not directly relate to the hints provided by the teacher or the increased risk of skin cancer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

King's X is an American rock band that combines progressive metal, funk and soul with vocal arrangements influenced by gospel, blues, and British Invasion rock groups. The band's lyrics are largely based on the members' struggles with religion and self-acceptance. King's X was ranked No. 83 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band was moved up to Megaforce's parent label Atlantic Records for the release of their fourth album, King's X, in early 1992. However, rising tensions with Taylor led the band to eschew the upbeat approach of previous albums and turn out a darker, more introspective effort. Unfortunately, despite critical praise, their new style did not translate well among the record-buying public, thus garnering fewer sales than Faith, Hope, Love. \\"Black Flag\\", the album's lone single, received only moderate airplay on MTV and radio. Not long after the release of King's X, the band parted ways with Taylor. The details of the split were not made public, but it was believed to be rather bitter. Taylor would admit in 1996 that his company Wilde Silas MusicWorks was growing and, as a result, he was no longer giving King's X, whom he considered \\"the top dogs,\\" the attention they deserved. In the aftermath, King's X took over a year off to consider their collective future together. The band members followed other, non-musical pursuits; most notably, guitarist Ty Tabor took up semi-professional motocross motorcycle racing.  With grunge at the peak of its popularity, and Pearl Jam's bassist Jeff Ament declaring that \\"King's X invented grunge\\" (despite the group's trademark sound being very different from that of the commercially successful grunge acts), the band went looking for a new sound upon their return. They enlisted veteran producer Brendan O'Brien, who had recently produced albums for Stone Temple Pilots and Pearl Jam. The resulting album, 1994's Dogman, showcased a much more muscular and heavy sound from the group, along with less abstract and spiritual lyrics. The record received a heavier promotional push from Atlantic including a compilation promotional CD entitled: Building Blox, as King's X enjoyed a successful tour, capped by an appearance at the Woodstock '94 festival in August. They also toured in support of such bands as the Scorpions, Pearl Jam, Motley Crue and Type O Negative, but despite a return to the Top 100 for the group, the album failed to sell as well as Atlantic had hoped, and the label's support for the group quickly faded.  The band's third release under Atlantic, 1996's Ear Candy, would also be their last for the label (not including a subsequent Best of King's X compilation). Although it sold to the band's sizeable core following, it lacked the relative mainstream success of previous efforts. The record was soon out of print, and it seemed that the group's chance for commercial success had come and gone. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are several other interesting aspects about this article. Some of them include: 1. The band's unique combination of progressive metal, funk, and soul with vocal arrangements influenced by gospel, blues, and British Invasion rock groups, which sets them apart from other hard rock bands. 2. The band's lyrics, which are largely based on the members' struggles with religion and self-acceptance, providing a deeper insight into the personal lives and perspectives of the members. 3. The inclusion of King's X at No. 83 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, indicating their recognition and influence within the hard rock genre. 4. The transition of the band to Megaforce's parent label Atlantic Records for the release of their fourth album, indicating a potential change in their production and sound. 5. The experimentation with a darker and more introspective album, King's X, which received critical praise but did not produce the same level of commercial success as their previous albums. 6. The departure of their producer Sam Taylor and the subsequent break the band took, with members exploring other non-musical pursuits like motocross racing. 7. The influence of grunge on the band's new sound, particularly their 1994 album Dogman, which was produced by Brendan O'Brien who had previously worked with Stone Temple Pilots and Pearl Jam. 8. The band's performance at Woodstock '94, which highlighted their status within the rock industry at that time. 9. The various bands King's X toured with, including notable acts like the Scorpions, Pearl Jam, Motley Crue, and Type O Negative. 10.

Write a text based on \\"opposition leader scanned for suspected skull fracture brain injury\\" Text:","output":"Title: Opposition Leader Undergoes Scan for Suspected Skull Fracture Brain Injury An alarming incident has led the opposition leader to undergo a medical scan for a suspected skull fracture brain injury. During a heated protest, the leader sustained a significant blow to the head which raised immediate concerns for their wellbeing.  Step 1: Identify the central incident - Opposition leader suffers a blow to the head during a protest The protest, aimed at voicing disagreement with the government's recent policies, quickly escalated into a chaotic scene, ultimately resulting in the opposition leader being struck. Witnesses report that law enforcement personnel were attempting to disperse the crowd when the opposition leader was accidentally hit. Step 2: Describe the consequences - Leader undergoing a medical scan due to concerns for a potential injury Owing to the severity of the blow, medical professionals advised the leader to get a comprehensive scan to assess the extent of any damage to their head. The specific type of scan being conducted is called a computed tomography (CT) scan, which allows doctors to capture a detailed view of the brain and skull in order to detect any fractures or brain injuries. Step 3: Explain the medical procedure - Use of a CT scan to detect potential skull fractures or brain injuries CT scans have become an indispensable tool in diagnosing and treating severe head injuries. The technology uses a series of X-ray images and advanced software to generate cross-sectional images of the brain and skull. This provides doctors with valuable information about the location, extent, and severity of any potential fractures or damage. Step 4: Address the public's concerns and expectations As news of the opposition leader's injury spreads, citizens and fellow party members have expressed their concern and support for the leader's recovery. Many are anxiously awaiting the result of the scan to see if any severe injuries have been identified. The opposition party has already issued a statement expressing their intent to cooperate with authorities in investigating the incident and to pursue any legal action if deemed necessary. Step 5: Discuss the potential implications on the political situation The outcome of this event could have significant implications on the nation's political landscape, depending on the severity of the opposition leader's injuries. If the leader is unable to return to their duties in the foreseeable future, this could lead to a power vacuum within the opposition party and a potential shift in political dynamics. In conclusion, the opposition leader is currently undergoing a CT scan for a suspected skull fracture brain injury sustained during a protest. The results of this scan will be crucial in determining the extent of the damage and possible consequences for the individual and their party. As the nation awaits further news, the implications of this incident underscore the importance of safety and adherence to peaceful protest protocols."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Donald's car faced some issues while he was driving back home from work one evening. He had heard of Joseph's reputed auto repair shop in town and knew he could rely on him to fix his car. After he contacted the shop, Joseph arrived promptly to tow the vehicle back to the garage. While Joseph worked on the car, Donald waited patiently in the waiting room, flipping through a magazine. The situation was an inconvenience, but he couldn't be too upset. Donald knew that Joseph was renowned for his exceptional work and attention to detail when it came to repairing vehicles. Joseph's auto repair shop had been in business for over 20 years, and it was the go-to place for locals who needed their cars fixed. As the son of an extraordinary mechanic, Joseph grew up learning the techniques and tools of the trade. His father taught him everything he knew, making sure his son was ready to take over the family business when the time came. Joseph treated all his clients with respect and kindness, ensuring they understood the repairs that needed to be done and the costs involved. It was his transparent and honest approach to business that built trust within the community and solidified his reputation. Donald had always been cautious about where he took his car for repairs. He didn't trust just anyone to take care of his vehicle. That's why he was counting on Joseph's expertise to get his car back in optimal condition as smoothly and quickly as possible. As he waited, Donald struck up a conversation with another client in the waiting area. They exchanged stories about their cars and discussed the exemplary service they both had experienced at Joseph's shop. It was obvious that Joseph's hard work and dedication to customer service had left a lasting impression on the community. In the garage, Joseph meticulously worked on Donald's car, carefully diagnosing the issue. After closely examining the engine and various parts of the vehicle, Joseph discovered that a few belts and hoses were worn out and needed to be replaced.

Once the repair was completed, Joseph called Donald into the garage to explain the work he had done and to reassure him that his car was now running smoothly. He also provided suggestions on how Donald could maintain his vehicle better to prevent similar issues from arising in the future. Donald was impressed with Joseph's professionalism and was grateful for the effort he had put into fixing his car. After settling the bill, he shook Joseph's hand and thanked him for a job well done. As he drove away from the auto repair shop, Donald couldn't have been more satisfied with the service he had received. He knew that he had made the right choice in trusting Joseph with his car and that he would return to the shop for any future repairs.

A survey shows that the tigers are in more danger of dying out than China's most famous animal,the giant panda.Forty years ago,about 4,000 South China tigers lived in the wild.Today there are only about 30.An additional 64 live in 19 zoos in China,,which are all descendants of six wild animals seized in 1956. The cubs were born in zoos in China and removed from their mothers when they were three months old.Their first home in South Africa was a one-acre camp where they stayed for a month.Their next home was a ten acre area,where they lived for three months to help them gradually get used to life outside a cage. When the cubs first arrived in South Africa,they didn't even want to leave their cages.It took weeks to get them to eat chicken,used as they were to being fed beef at the Zoo in China where they were born.It took months of practice to hunt a live animal and then make the link between the kill and food.Now just a few months on,and living in a 150-acre camp,they have become remarkably skilled hunters.

Here is a question about this article: Yale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a master and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates comprise each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \\"Master's Teas,\\" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. Instead, all undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college. What is the answer to this question: Who runs Yale's residential colleges?","output":"The residential colleges at Yale are run by a master and an academic dean according to the article. These individuals live in the college, and the college's fellowship is composed of university faculty and affiliates. Here's my reasoning: 1. After reading the user's question, I understand that they are asking for information about the management of Yale's residential colleges.      2. I examined the given article and found a relevant passage, \\"The colleges are led by a master and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates comprise each college's fellowship.\\" 3. From the above line, it is clear that the residential colleges are managed by two official roles, a master and an academic dean. The academic dean and master actually reside in the college, indicating their direct involvement in the functioning and management of the college. 4. Furthermore, the fellowship of each college, which can be seen as its academic community, is composed of university faculty and affiliates. This suggests that these individuals also play a role in the running of the college. So, considering all this, the answer to the question \\"Who runs Yale's residential colleges?\\" would be 'a master, an academic dean, and a fellowship composed of university faculty and affiliates'."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

Read the full results here.       ||||| WASHINGTON — Talks to revive gun control legislation are quietly under way on Capitol Hill as a bipartisan group of senators seeks a way to bridge the differences that led to last week’s collapse of the most serious effort to overhaul the country’s gun laws in 20 years.      Drawing on the lessons from battles in the 1980s and ’90s over the Brady Bill, which failed in Congress several times before ultimately passing, gun control supporters believe they can prevail by working on a two-pronged strategy. First, they are identifying senators who might be willing to change their votes and support a background check system with fewer loopholes.      Second, they are looking to build a national campaign that would better harness overwhelming public support for universal background checks — which many national polls put at near 90 percent approval — to pressure lawmakers.      Senators Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, have been talking in recent days about how they could persuade more senators to support their bill to expand background checks for gun buyers, which drew backing from only four Republicans last week.      “We’re going to work it hard,” Mr. Manchin said Thursday, adding that he was looking at tweaking the language of his bill in a way that he believed would satisfy senators who, for example, felt that background checks on person-to-person gun sales would be too onerous for people who live in rural areas far from a sporting goods store.      Those concerns were an issue for Alaska’s senators, Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, and Mark Begich, a Democrat.      Meanwhile, a separate gun measure, an anti-trafficking bill, is the subject of talks between Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and two Republican senators who voted no on the background check bill. The Republicans, Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, are discussing ways they might support the bill, which would criminalize the shipping or transfer of guns to someone who is barred from possessing a firearm.      While the bill on its own falls short of what the families of victims of mass shootings have been pushing Congress to enact — and is therefore less controversial — some Democrats believe it could be a good starting point to build a broader bipartisan compromise.      “I think trafficking can be the base of the bill, the rock on which everything else stands,” Ms. Gillibrand said. “I also think it’s complementary to background checks because, let’s be honest, criminals aren’t going to buy a gun and go through a background check. So if you really want to go after criminals, you have to have to do both.”      Ms. Ayotte said Thursday that she would continue talking with Ms. Gillibrand and was confident that some areas of agreement, on areas like expanding mental health care, could be reached.      “There’s a lot we have agreement on in terms of enforcing our current system,” she said. “And so I certainly think we should look for the common elements, including the mental health piece, which I support as well, and try to move as much of that as possible forward.”      Ms. Ayotte — the only one out of 22 senators on the East Coast north of Virginia who voted against strengthening background checks — has been the target lately of some of the most furious lobbying by gun control proponents, who have inundated local newspapers with letters to the editor denouncing her vote, run radio ads saying she “ignored the will of the people” and swamped her office with phone calls. On Thursday, two receptionists placed one call after another on hold as they politely listened to callers vent and replied, “Thank you for your message.”      Next week when Congress is in recess, gun control groups coordinating with the Obama committee Organizing for Action will be fanning out across the country in dozens of demonstrations at the offices of senators who voted down the background check bill.      As talks moved ahead on Capitol Hill, the White House was pressing on with its own efforts. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. summoned a group of gun control proponents to his office on Thursday — including representatives from Michael R. Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Gabrielle Giffords’s Americans for Responsible Solutions and the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence — and reassured them that the issue had become his highest priority.      The vice president recalled the long struggle to enact the Brady Bill, which established a five-day waiting period to buy a gun. And he told them gun control would become his new campaign to end the Iraq war, according to two participants in the meeting, comparing it to the issue he devoted much of his energy to during President Obama’s first term. The pressure campaign is evidently already starting to take its toll, the vice president added, because several senators have confided to him that they are feeling the backlash from constituents.      Those senators, he added, told him that they needed to be assured there was adequate support for expanded gun control to pass because they did not want to take such a great political risk on something that was doomed to fail. And some of them are already beginning to ask about what tweaks gun control proponents might entertain that could make the bills more palatable, the vice president said.      “It’s not a question of really changing their minds for or against this policy,” one of the meeting’s participants said. “It’s demonstrating that it’s safe to do the right thing and politically unsafe not to.” |||||Summary:","output":"The failed Manchin-Toomey gun control compromise has led to Republican Sen.

Write an article based on this \\"Schedule routine checkups to ensure your sexual health. Practice safe sex. Alert any sexual partners to your infection.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Prioritizing Sexual Health: The Importance of Routine Checkups and Safe Practices Introduction Sexual health is a crucial aspect of an individual's overall well-being, and maintaining it should be at the forefront of everyone's minds. Regular checkups, practicing safe sex, and open communication with partners are essential steps in ensuring optimal sexual health. In this article, we will discuss the importance of prioritizing these practices and explore the benefits and reasons behind them. Routine Checkup: An Investment in Sexual Health Step 1: Understand the significance of routine checkups Investing time and effort in regular medical checkups for sexual health plays a pivotal role in early detection and prevention of various sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and diseases. By identifying any issues early, individuals can receive the necessary treatment, reduce the risk of complications, and improve their overall well-being. Step 2: Familiarize oneself with the testing process Routine checkups usually involve screening tests and physical examinations, which are crucial in understanding one's sexual health status. Depending on age, gender, and sexual history, healthcare professionals recommend personalized testing schedules to ensure that individuals receive the most effective and appropriate care. Step 3: Be proactive and consistent in scheduling checkups Proactively scheduling routine checkups shows a genuine commitment to one's sexual health. Maintaining a consistent schedule allows individuals to stay informed about their status, act responsibly with sexual partners, and stay abreast of new developments in sexual health care. Safe Sex: Prevention is Better than Cure Step 1: Understand the necessity of safe sex practices Practicing safe sex involves engaging in behaviors that minimize the risk of contracting or transmitting STIs or unintended pregnancies. By wearing appropriate protection, such as condoms and dental dams, and using contraceptives, individuals can enjoy a healthy and fulfilling sexual life. Step 2: Educate oneself on different protection methods As an active participant in maintaining sexual health, it is essential to learn about the various contraceptive methods, their correct usage, and effectiveness. This knowledge empowers individuals to make informed decisions on the best course of action for their personal circumstances. Step 3: Foster mutual understanding with partners Discussing sexual health and safe sex practices with partners is key in building trust and understanding. This open communication helps establish boundaries and ensures both parties are on the same page regarding safety, comfort, and preferences. Communication: Transparency and Shared Responsibility Step 1: Embrace honesty and openness If an individual is diagnosed with an STI, honesty and transparency are critical. By alerting sexual partners to the infection, individuals take a responsible step towards safeguarding their partner's health and preventing further spread of the infection. Step 2: Communicate without fear Having an open conversation about sexual health status may feel daunting; however, approaching the topic respectfully and sensitively can create a supportive environment. This encourages partners to share information, prioritize their sexual health, and contribute to reducing the stigma surrounding STIs. Step 3: Encourage a culture of shared responsibility When both partners actively engage and take responsibility for their sexual health, it forms a culture of mutual respect and shared accountability. This environment lays the foundation for a healthy and trust-filled relationship. Conclusion Sexual health is an integral component of overall well-being. Prioritizing routine checkups, safe sex, and open communication with partners can efficiently protect and maintain one's sexual health. By staying proactive and committed to these practices, individuals can contribute to a healthier society, promote responsible behavior, and enjoy fulfilling relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: This article: Starting approximately 40 million years ago in the middle Eocene, a braided river system called the \\"Ancestral Rogue River\\" flowed through the region where the Rogue Valley is now carved. For about 2.1 million years, the river deposited what is now known as the Payne Cliffs Formation by laying down a thin conglomerate, followed by arkosic sandstone and siltstone. Between 10 and 20 million years ago, the uplift that created the nearby Klamath Mountains caused an incision that formed the Rogue River valley. Vertical erosion, or downcutting of the Rogue River continues to keep pace with the recent uplift, with about 690 feet (210 m) of erosion occurring in the past seven million years.Approximately seven million years ago in the upper Miocene, a 44-mile (71 km) long trachyandesitic lava flow that likely came from Olson Mountain near present-day Lost Creek Lake flowed down the Ancestral Rogue River and its tributaries and spread throughout the valley. This lava formed a hard cap over the Payne Cliffs Formation. At Lost Creek Lake, the lava attained its maximum thickness of 730 feet (220 m) and thinned to about 100 to 200 feet (30 to 61 m) to the north of Medford.   Since the Olson eruption, the Rogue River has eroded 90 percent of the solidified lava. Though the andesite prevented much erosion to the caps of the Table Rocks, the andesite-capped cliffs eroded from the side as the softer sedimentary units of the Payne Cliffs Formation gave way. This erosion created expansive talus fields which surround the plateaus on all sides, creating slopes capable of supporting abundant plant and animal life. Upper and Lower Table Rock both stand 800 feet (240 m) above the valley floor, and just over 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level. There are approximately 300 acres (120 ha) of level ground on Lower Table Rock, and 500 acres (200 ha) on Upper Table Rock.The Table Rocks offer an example of inverted relief, in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after the erosion... contains an answer for the question: What is there 500 acres of on Upper Table Rock?, what is it ? The answer is:","output":"There are approximately 500 acres of level ground on Upper Table Rock.  Here's my step-by-step reasoning: 1.

I found the sentence \\"There are approximately 500 acres (200 ha) of level ground on Lower Table Rock, and 500 acres (200 ha) on Upper Table Rock.\\" 4. From the context, it is clear that the 500 acres on Upper Table Rock refers to level ground on the plateau. Therefore, the answer is level ground. The information given implies that Upper Table Rock possesses an expansive flat surface."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: \\"Greece uses the?\\"  Context: \\"The Greek economy is classified as advanced and high-income. Greece was a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC). In 1979 the accession of the country in the European Communities and the single market was signed, and the process was completed in 1982. Greece was accepted into the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union on 19 June 2000, and in January 2001 adopted the Euro as its currency, replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachma to the Euro. Greece is also a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, and is ranked 24th on the KOF Globalization Index for 2013.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Greece uses the?\\" based on the provided context is \\"Euro\\". In the context, it is mentioned that \\"in January 2001 adopted the Euro as its currency, replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachma to the Euro.\\" Therefore, it is clear that Greece uses the Euro. Steps: 1. The user asked what Greece uses, without specifying further. To determine the most likely thing they are asking about, we need to scan the text for anything that could be a potential answer. 2. In scanning the text, we see references to several different things Greece uses or is a part of - such as the OECD, BSEC, and EU. However, the text alludes to the usage of the Euro.  3. Considering the context, it's most probable that the user refers to the currency, a frequently asked question type related to countries.  4. Upon finding the phrase \\"in January 2001 adopted the Euro as its currency...\\", the potential answer to this question becomes clear. 5. Therefore, \\"Euro\\" fits the question, and it is the answer that Greece uses the Euro as its currency."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Art Bell seen at at his home in Pahrump in 1996. (Las Vegas Review-Journal)      Art and Ramona Bell pose in the control room of their new radio station KNYE-FM in this undated photo. (Las Vegas Review-Journal)      Radio host Art Bell signals his return to the airwaves as he leaves KDWN-Radio after announcing his return to radio beginning Feb. 5, 2001. Bell hosted the popular paranormal radio talk show \\"Coast to Coast AM\\" from his home and radio studio in Pahrump. (Las Vegas Review-Journal)      Art Bell      He was awake when most of the country was asleep, cultivating a loyal following while sharing his fascination with the unexplained on his nighttime paranormal-themed show.      For the better part of two decades, longtime late-night radio personality Art Bell was his own producer, engineer and host of his show, “Coast to Coast AM.” He later launched his own satellite radio program from his Pahrump home after retiring from full-time hosting duties in 2003.      On the airwaves, Bell captivated listeners with his fascination for the unexplained, such as UFOs, alien abductions and crop circles. He died Friday at his home at the age of 72.      “As he begins his journey on the ‘other side,’ we take solace in the hope that he is now finding out all of the answers to the mysteries he pursued for so many nights with all of us,” Coast to Coast said in a statement Saturday.      Coast to Coast was syndicated nationwide on about 500 stations across the United States and Canada in the 1990s before he left in 2002. He broadcast the show from Pahrump’s KNYE 95.1 FM, a station he founded.      Lorraine Rotundo Steele, who had been listening to Bell for more than 21 years, said Saturday that she was stunned by the news of her favorite radio host’s death. The 60-year-old Canada resident started tuning in to Bell’s show after her dad died.      “Art taught me how to keep an open mind,” she told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “At a very dark time in my life, he kept me sane. Art’s fascination with life after death was what I needed after losing my father.”      Bell’s show had a huge national following in part because he played to people’s imaginations, “like a Disneyland for sci-fi,” local talk show radio host Alan Stock said. He remembered Bell as a creative, unique, nice man who will undoubtedly live on as a radio icon.      “Nobody talked about Area 51, and about chupacabras and about aliens,” Stock said Saturday night. “And he talked about that on a regular basis.”      His show, popular with truckers and others awake in the wee hours of the day, offered a look into a world nobody else on the radio had touched, Stock said.      Stock recalled listening to his show early one morning in the 90s. A caller into Bell’s show said he was piloting a small plane toward Area 51 — the classified Air Force facility located about 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas — to find out “what’s really going on.”      “And Art said, ‘Don’t do it, they will shoot you down,’” Stock said.      Bell and the caller went back and forth for about an hour and 20 minutes, he said, until the man reported seeing military planes flying behind him, signaling him to ground the plane. Despite Bell’s insistence on the man obeying their commands, the caller said he would keep flying.      “The next thing you know, it went dead and you heard nothing at all,” Stock said. Stock had Bell on his show about two weeks later, and he asked Bell what happened to the caller. Bell said he never heard from the man again.      Bell retired several times in his career, which included a short-lived show on SiriusXM satellite radio in 2013. He also co-authored a book, “The Coming Global Superstorm,” with Whitley Strieber.      Returning to terrestrial radio afterward was not a difficult decision, he told the Pahrump Valley Times in August 2013.      “That’s easy, because I love it,” he said at the time. “It’s my life, and that’s all I have ever done. I went through a lot of family problems, so that interrupted things, and I was overseas for four years, and that certainly interrupted things. I went back into radio because I love it.”      Pioneering broadcaster      Bell was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame in 2006 and into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2008, the same year he sold KNYE to Karen Jackson.      Bell’s genuine interest in the topics he discussed contributed to the interest and entertainment his show generated, she said in a press release to the Review-Journal.      “Art was a pioneer in broadcasting taking overnight talk radio to new heights which generated huge audiences,” Jackson said. “He was a master at creating spell binding, intriguing, sometimes frightening and thoroughly compelling talk radio.”      “No one has been more loved by their family, friends and listening audience,” she said.      For a time, Bell also held the Guinness world record for a solo broadcast marathon, logging more than 115 hours of airtime while working as a DJ in Okinawa, Japan. The stunt raised funds to rescue over 100 Vietnamese orphans left stranded by the conflict in their country, according to Coast to Coast.      An early love for radio      Bell was born in Jacksonville, North Carolina, on June 17, 1945. The only child in a military family, he moved around a lot as a kid.      He later served in the the Air Force as a medic during the Vietnam War, but his love for radio was always there. According to Coast to Coast AM, he was an FCC licensed radio technician at age 13, and while in the Air Force, he created an on-base pirate radio station that played anti-war music.      It wasn’t until the mid-1980s, when he returned to the United States and joined KDWN-AM in Las Vegas, that talk radio captivated Bell. There, he mastered his famous blend of contemporary and unsettling.      “I want to bring topics on radio you otherwise might not hear,” Bell, then 50, told the Pahrump Valley Times in January 1996.      His cause of death has not yet been determined. Bell’s autopsy is scheduled for later this week, according to the Nye County Sheriff’s Office.      Bell leaves behind his wife, Airyn, whom he married in 2006, and his children Asia, Alex and Art Bell IV. He is preceded in death by his parents, Jackson said.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

The other films in Polanski's unofficial trilogy are creepy too, but they are all different in what makes them creepy, but they all roughly deal with the same thing, they all deal with the mind. Definitely the staring people are very creepy, each of them sent shivers down my spine that made me incapable of sitting still. Again, if you have seen the other two films mentioned, I'm sure you'll find this quite creepy, because you begin to expect typical Polanski traits that you think you have caught onto, he is aware of this and will keep teasing you with simple things, personally every time Trelkovsky would slowly turn around I would be bracing myself for a jump, maybe that's just me, but it felt intended to do that, though it was quite subtle, there is no build up of the music in those moments. The acting in this was pretty good, mostly that from Polanski of course, the other characters in the film don't have all that much time to outshine the lead. Polanski really proves himself as an all-round great filmmaker, he not only can direct and write great films, but he can actually act too. I don't think there is any other better person who could have pulled off the Trelkovsky character, Polanski settled right on in perfectly. I like seeing films where the director is also apart of the main cast, to me it really highlights their fantastic versatility and talent, which I respect greatly. One thing I didn't like about this film is how it was done in English. For those who don't know, this is a French film, American financed, and as well to make it more commercially successful it was mostly done in English. There are parts which it is very obvious there has been dubbing, and I don't know why it is, but 3/4 of the time when there is a dub they get the complete wrong person to do the dub. There is a women in the film who when she speaks it's obvious it's a dub, but they got the most annoying person to do the voice-over, it was seriously pain to my ears to hear her speak, she had the loudest high pitch voice I've heard in a while, it almost seemed fake, but I don't see what the point was, she was a rather small character. I honestly would of preferred if they just left it as it was filmed, parts of it in French and parts of it in English, because the dubbing in this film was a pain and was not near (two completely different films, I know) the high standard of another film that did a similar thing, which was, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I realise it's not a big problem, just when you do realise it, it gets annoying, but I'm sure you won't sit there the long trying to lip read what they are actually saying, regardless if you know French. Whats so great about Polanski is that he will let you think you know him, that you know his style, which in some aspects you do, but really, you can't see whats behind that corner. This film is a lot more open to interpretation than the other two films mentioned, which I think really strengthens this one in particular. I personally feel this is the best of the three, I'm unsure which comes next, but they are all relatively close in their level of greatness. The ending is fantastic, it is so easy to dwindle on it for a long time to come and get nowhere. I choose not to think to much on it, just to have my personal opinion and leave it at that. I've rambled on, and I haven't really given any insight on what makes this film so great, I don't think, so I'll quickly do it here. If you liked Repulsion and/or Rosemary's Baby, I guarantee you will enjoy this film to say the least. For those who are too unfortunate to have seen either then I recommend you check this film out if your looking for something that is quite a creepy film that is quite intelligent, particularly the end, as well if your looking for something that deals with the mind, paranoia even, though that is better fitted under Repulsion. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)? Choices: [i] negative. [ii] positive....I think the answer is","output":"[ii] positive. The reviewer clearly expresses their appreciation for the excellent acting, especially from Polanski, the recurring theme of dealing with the mind in the unofficial trilogy, and the unpredictability of Polanski's style.

Article: As more and more books become movie adaptations  , I can't help but think how this will affect English classes in America. Thinking back to my years in middle and high school -- ten years ago, I would be rewarded if I had read a number of classics. Today, a majority of those books are now also movies Life of Pi, The Great Gatsby, Much Ado About Nothing and Anna Karenina, to name a few. Even modern books such as The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have been adapted for the big screen. In discussion with my students, I often hear them say they are not going to read books because movies will come out soon, which makes me wonder what effect movie adaptations have on modern-day students. Will the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) encourage them to read books more carefully or to use movies to improve their understanding of the text? The CCSS requires students to provide text-based evidence when reading and discussing a book. By focusing on such evidence, teachers can pull specific details from a book that may have not made the final cut when the book was adapted for the big screen. For instance, after reading and watching The Hunger Games, there were a number of details from the book that were missing from the film -- many people were disappointed with Rue's meek   movie role. A student who failed to read The Hunger Games would not quite understand Rue's impact on the games in the same way as someone who had read the book and remembered all the details that went into her death. I am not saying the CCSS will stop students from cutting corners, but I believe if teachers use the support the CCSS provides, it can be a great roadway to ensure all students are digging deep into texts and not just hitting the play button.

His 30's A:","output":"Title: Beyond Time's Reach Genre: Drama, Thriller, Mystery Plot: In a quaint, picturesque town in northern India, lives a brilliant mathematician and scientist, Dr. Ranjeet Khurana. Dr. Khurana, in his mid-30's, has spent most of his life working on a top-secret government project. However, his family and ordinary townsfolk are oblivious to this aspect of his life, knowing him only as a warm and helpful chemistry teacher at the local high school. Dr. Khurana's life takes a sudden turn when he discovers an unusual stone with unearthly properties while on a family picnic. Enthralled by the stone's unique capabilities, Ranjeet takes it back to his home and begins investigating it, unknowingly uncovering its connection to his past, present, and future. As he delves deeper into understanding the complexities around the stone, Ranjeet stumbles upon the fact that it isn't merely a historical artifact, but a portal to the past. Excited by the implications and possibilities, Ranjeet cautiously ventures back in time to revisit episodes from his youth, including the tragic death of his childhood best friend, Vikas, and the heartbreak he experienced when his first love, Naina, moved away. Intrigued by the portal's possibilities, a much younger Dr. Khurana, still in his teenage years, decides to delve into the future and finds himself face-to-face with his present-day self. This encounter creates a generational loop amongst the various ages of Ranjeet – teenage, present-day and even an older version in his 60's – compelling them to work together to solve an impending disaster that threatens to unravel the fabric of time and space. Dealing with their own personal struggles and bearing the burden of saving the world, the three versions of Ranjeet – each with their unique perspectives and experiences – form an unbreakable bond that transcends age, realizing that it isn't just about averting the disaster; it's about the choices they made in life and the significance of their relationships. In the present time, older Ranjeet ensures that current Ranjeet uses the stone to prevent the tragedy involving Vikas by presenting himself just in the nick of time. Meanwhile, present-day Ranjeet tracks down Naina and brings closure to their love story by ensuring her successful and happy life. Through a series of trials and tribulations, the familial circle becomes complete once again. However, the cost of altering the past begins to manifest, as the town experiences strange and inexplicable occurrences. Realizing that their actions have resulted in dire consequences, the trio decides to use the stone one last time to reunite and undo their transgressions. In the process, they destroy the stone to prevent any further disruptions to the timeline, but, unfortunately, this means that their bond and the heartwarming moments they experienced together will be locked away in a forgotten corner of time. In the end, Dr. Ranjeet Khurana is no longer the man he was. He cannot remember the unique camaraderie he shared with his younger and older selves, but he knows that he made a difference – not just to the ones he loved but also to the world at large. The movie culminates with the older Ranjeet passing away peacefully, surrounded by family, as the camera pans out to a park bench where the three versions of Ranjeet have etched their names – a subtle reminder that beyond time's reach, they were brothers across ages, bound by destiny, and truly unforgettable."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Energy is lost as heat between each trophic level due to the second law of thermodynamics. Thus, after a limited number of trophic energy transfers, the amount of energy remaining in the food chain may not be great enough to support viable populations at yet a higher trophic level. The loss of energy between trophic levels is illustrated by the pioneering studies of Howard T. Odum in the Silver Springs, Florida, ecosystem in the 1940s (Figure 46.5). The primary producers generated 20,819 kcal/m2/yr (kilocalories per square meter per year), the primary consumers generated 3368 kcal/m2/yr, the secondary consumers generated 383 kcal/m2/yr, and the tertiary consumers only generated 21 kcal/m2/yr.

Question: What do the Lombardic mandolins resemble more than modern mandolins? Is \\"These mandolins are closer to the mandolino or mandore than other modern mandolins.\\" the correct answer? Choose from: i. yes. ii. no.","output":"ii. no. The Lombardic mandolins differ considerably from modern mandolins in their structure, materials, and sound. These historical mandolins, which originated in Italy, do share similarities with the mandolino and the mandore. However, the statement \\"These mandolins are closer to the mandolino or mandore than other modern mandolins.\\" does not fully capture the unique features and characteristics of Lombardic mandolins. The Lombardic mandolins, also known as Milanese mandolins, were larger and more ornate than their modern counterparts. With a distinctively shaped body resembling a pear or teardrop, these mandolins had a longer string length and a wider fingerboard. Unlike some modern mandolins, which use metal frets, Lombardic mandolins had tie-on gut frets on their necks, giving them a softer, more delicate sound. The mandolino, a small, flat-backed stringed instrument similar in appearance to a tiny lute, was an important predecessor of the modern mandolin. It had an elongated body, which differed from the larger body of the Lombardic mandolin, and was known for its high-pitched sound and rapid playing technique. While both instruments have a common historic origin, they also have distinct features that set them apart. The mandore, another early stringed instrument with ties to the mandolin family, was especially popular in the Renaissance period. Similarly to the Lombardic mandolin and mandolino, it featured gut frets on its neck, but it had a round back and a slightly different string count and tuning. Although it shares some common features with the Lombardic mandolin, such as its elaborate design and fretting method, the two instruments remain distinct in their own ways. In conclusion, it would be more accurate to say that the Lombardic mandolins have strong historical connections to both the mandolino and the mandore, but they exhibit their own unique design and tonal characteristics that set them apart from modern mandolins."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What did he most likely use to hold the liquid? Options: - jar - cup - drinking glass - container - tankard The answer to this question is:","output":"James most likely used a drinking glass to hold the liquid. While all of the options presented could potentially be used to hold liquid, the most common and sensible option for everyday use is a drinking glass. Drinking glasses are specifically designed for holding and consuming liquids, making them the most practical and convenient choice. A jar, container, or tankard may also be used for holding liquid, but they are not as commonly used for everyday drinking as a glass. Jars and containers are often used for storing or preserving food items and may not be the most comfortable or hygienic options for drinking directly. Tankards, though used for drinking, are more associated with drinking alcohol in a historical context or in specific establishments and are not as widely used as drinking glasses. A cup could be used for drinking as well, but the term \\"cup\\" can refer to a variety of shapes and sizes, including coffee cups, teacups, and disposable cups. Cups can be made of different materials like ceramic, plastic, paper, or even glass, which may also affect their suitability for holding a particular type of liquid. Drinking glasses, on the other hand, are designed for a range of commonly consumed liquids and are typically made of glass, making them a more universally suitable option. In summary, considering common sense, the most likely option for James to hold and consume a liquid is a drinking glass. This option offers the most practical and widely used solution for everyday liquid consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit. Question: What are the minerals that supplement users are likely to be exceeding the upper limit? === The answer to the above question is Options: I. magnesium, zinc, iron, and calcium II. selenium, calcium, iron, copper III. not enough information IV. calcium, iron, phosphorus, copper A:","output":"I. magnesium, zinc, iron, and calcium"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. Question: Where is Camp Humphreys located?

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea? , can you please find it?   Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

EU:lla ja komissiolla on monia mahdollisuuksia vaikuttaa positiivisesti kansalaistensa elämään ja tehdä enemmän nykyisten haasteiden kohtaamiseen. Tässä on joitakin ehdotuksia siitä, kuinka ne voivat parantaa toimintaansa ja toimenpiteitään: 1. Voimakkaampi ilmastonmuutoksen torjunta: EU ja komissio voivat lisätä ponnistelujaan ilmastonmuutoksen torjumiseksi esimerkiksi asettamalla kunnianhimoisempia päästövähennystavoitteita, parantamalla EU:n energiatehokkuutta ja tukemalla jäsenmaiden investointeja uusiutuvaan energiaan. 2. Talouskasvun edistäminen: Eurooppalaisen talouskasvun edistämiseksi EU ja komissio voisivat esimerkiksi kehittää tukiohjelmia pienyrityksille ja innovaatioille, edistää koulutusta ja ammattitaitoa sekä kehittää Euroopan sisämarkkinoita. 3. Sosiaalisen yhteenkuuluvuuden parantaminen: Euroopan unioni voi vahvistaa yhteiskuntien yhteenkuuluvuutta tukemalla työllisyyttä, tasa-arvoa, koulutusta ja sosiaaliturvaa koskevia ohjelmia. Näihin toimiin voi kuulua esimerkiksi työttömyystuen uudelleenjärjestäminen, vaikeasti työllistyvien ryhmien työllistymisen edistäminen ja koulutusmahdollisuuksien lisääminen. 4. Vahvempi yhteinen ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikka: EU ja komissio voivat yhdessä kehittää yhteistä ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikkaa; tämä voi käytännössä tarkoittaa esimerkiksi yhteisten diplomaattisten toimien ja sotilaallisen yhteistyön vahvistamista sekä yhteistyön lisäämistä kansainvälisen terrorismin ja katastrofien torjumiseksi. 5. Aktiivisempi rooli globaaleissa kysymyksissä: EU ja komissio voivat omaksua aktiivisemman roolin globaalissa toiminnassa, esimerkiksi puolustamalla ihmisoikeuksia ja demokratiaa, edistämällä kestävää kehitystä, harjoittamalla aktiivista taistelua köyhyyttä ja eriarvoisuutta vastaan sekä tukemalla tehokasta monenvälisyyspolitiikkaa. 6. Unionin demokraattisuuden vahvistaminen: Euroopan parlamentin vaaleilla valittujen edustajien vallan kasvattamisella ja Euroopan komission jäsenten demokraattisen vastuun lisäämisellä voidaan vahvistaa Euroopan unionin demokraattisuutta ja kansalaistensa luottamusta EU:n toimintaan. 7. Kansalaisten osallistumisen parantaminen: EU:n on pyrittävä parantamaan kansalaistensa osallistumista ja kuuntelemaan heitä tehokkaammin. Osallistumisen lisääminen voi tarkoittaa esimerkiksi avoimemman päätöksenteon edistämistä ja laajempaa julkista keskustelua, joka johtaa paremmin perusteltuihin poliittisiin ratkaisuihin. Nämä ovat vain joitakin esimerkkejä siitä, miten EU ja komissio voisivat tehdä enemmän nykyisten haasteiden kohtaamiseen ja Eurooppa-neuvoston ja muiden eurooppalaisten instituutioiden entistä tehokkaampaan toimintaan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review:  I recently downloaded the org.geometerplus.zlibrary.ui.android app with high expectations, but unfortunately, this app has left me thoroughly frustrated and dissatisfied. I am truly regretting my decision to install this app and here's why: 1. Poor Performance: The app is extremely slow and unresponsive. It takes ages to load books, and navigation is a painful experience. It constantly freezes and crashes, leaving me unable to read for long periods. 2. User Interface: The outdated design and unappealing UI make for a visually unattractive experience. It lacks customization options, and simple tasks like adjusting font size or changing background colors are missing or overly complicated. 3. Limited functionality: The features in this app are quite basic and hardly meet the needs of a serious reader. Many popular formats are not supported, and there's no cloud integration to sync my progress across devices. 4. Poor customer support: I reached out to the app's support team for assistance, but the response was unhelpful and took forever to be received. It's evident that the developers are not interested in user feedback or improving their app. 5. No updates: It seems the app has not been updated in a long time. Security and performance updates are crucial for any app, and this one appears to have been completely abandoned by the developers. All in all, I cannot recommend the org.geometerplus.zlibrary.ui.android app to anyone. It has unfortunately been a frustrating experience that has hampered my reading rather than enhancing it.

They constitute one of the major groups into which the flowering plants have traditionally been divided, the rest of the flowering plants having two cotyledons and therefore classified as dicotyledons, or dicots. However, molecular phylogenetic research has shown that while the monocots form a monophyletic group or clade (comprising all the descendants of a common ancestor), the dicots do not. Monocots have almost always been recognized as a group, but with various taxonomic ranks and under several different names. The APG III system of 2009 recognises a clade called \\"monocots\\" but does not assign it to a taxonomic rank.  - The dicotyledons, also known as dicots (or more rarely dicotyls), were one of the two groups into which all the flowering plants or angiosperms were formerly divided. The name refers to one of the typical characteristics of the group, namely that the seed has two embryonic leaves or cotyledons. There are around 200,000 species within this group. The other group of flowering plants were called monocotyledons or monocots, typically having one cotyledon. Historically, these two groups formed the two divisions of the flowering plants.  - The Cronquist system is a taxonomic classification system of flowering plants. It was developed by Arthur Cronquist in his texts \\"An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants\\" (1981) and \\"The Evolution and Classification of Flowering Plants\\" (1968; 2nd edition, 1988). Cronquist's system places flowering plants into two broad classes, Magnoliopsida (dicotyledons) and Liliopsida (monocotyledons). Within these classes, related orders are grouped into subclasses. While the scheme was widely used, in either the original form or in adapted versions, many botanists now use the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants, first developed in 1998. The system as laid out in Cronquist's \\"An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants\\" (1981) counts 64 orders and 321 families in class Magnoliopsida and 19 orders and 65 families in class Liliopsida.  - Magnoliopsida is a valid botanical name for a class of flowering plants. By definition the class will include the family Magnoliaceae, but its circumscription can otherwise vary, being more inclusive or less inclusive depending upon the classification system being discussed.  - Arthur John Cronquist (March 19, 1919  March 22, 1992) was a United States biologist, botanist and a specialist on Compositae. He is considered one of the most influential botanists of the 20th century, largely due to his formulation of the Cronquist system. Two plant genera in the aster family have been named in his honor. These are \\"Cronquistia\\", a possible synonym of \\"Carphochaete\\", and \\"Cronquistianthus\\", which is sometimes included as a group within \\"Eupatorium\\". The former was applied by R.M. King and the latter by him and Harold E. Robinson.  - Mistletoe is the common name for most obligate hemiparasitic plants in the order Santalales. Mistletoes attach to and penetrate the branches of a tree or shrub by a structure called the haustorium, through which they absorb water and nutrients from the host plant.  - Liliopsida (synonym: Liliatae) is a botanical name for the class containing the family Liliaceae (or Lily Family). It is considered synonymous (or nearly synonymous) with the name monocotyledon. Publication of the name is credited to Scopoli (in 1760): see author citation (botany). This name is formed by replacing the termination \\"-aceae\\" in the name Liliaceae by the termination \\"-opsida\\" (Art 16 of the ICBN).  - The Viscaceae are a family of flowering plants . In past decades , several systems of plant taxonomy recognized this family , notably the 1981 Cronquist system . In this circumscription , the family includes the several genera of mistletoes . However , the APG II system of 2003 does not recognize the family , treating it as a synonym of Santalaceae . Genera once treated as belonging to family Viscaceae include : Arceuthobium Dendrophthora Ginalloa Korthalsella Notothixos Phoradendron Viscum    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'parent taxon' with the subject 'viscaceae'.

Understand the Scenario: The first part of the task is to understand what is happening in the head of the statement. For instance, in the example you've given, the Head is \\"PersonX hears PersonX's music\\". This scenario involves PersonX engaging in an activity, specifically listening to his/her own music. 2. Analyze the Consequence: The next step is to look at the 'Tail', which in this case is labeled as \\"attentive\\". This should be seen as the perception or attribute that might result from the activity occurring in the 'Head'.  3. Determining Perception: Based on the event and the possible persona, you need to reflect whether the action in the 'Head' could result in PersonX being perceived as the characteristic described in the 'Tail'. In the given task, you would decide whether listening to one's own music could make PersonX be seen as 'attentive'. 4.

Article: Many are accustomed to picking up dogs as if they were human babies by putting one hand under each of the dog's \\"armpits.\\" However, this is unsafe for dachshunds. This puts an unnatural stress on the dog's back — the spine simply isn't built to support his long body without any other support. In general, you will want to avoid any sort of hold that supports only half of the dog's body length. This is true even if the dog is already standing on one set of legs — like, for instance, if he is propping himself up on his hind legs while looking over the top of a sofa. In this case, you'll want to lean down so that you can support his rump before picking him up. As noted above, dogs should be set down gently, not dropped. A dachshund's legs are very short compared to other dog breeds'. This means that they can't bend very far to absorb the shock of hitting the ground, which puts most of the impact stress on the leg joints and back. Getting rid of the dog's \\"fall\\" eliminates this danger. Don't trust your dog's body language here. Dachshunds don't know that their skeleton can't support falls, so they may be perfectly willing to jump out of your hands. Even if this doesn't cause them immediate pain, it can lead to painful problems if continued in the long-term. Dachshunds' long, slender spines are especially vulnerable to injury, which is why it's so important to keep their bodies straight when you pick them up. You will definitely want to avoid any activities that put a twist or bend in the dog's back, as this increases the stress on it and can contribute to conditions like slipped discs. For example, one way you might accidentally do this is by scooping the dachshund up suddenly when he doesn't expect it. If you startle your dog, he may wriggle or twist out of one of your hands, putting an unnatural bend in his spine as he hangs. Make sure your dog is calm and aware of you before you attempt to pick him up. Dachshunds, like all dogs, are generally pretty smart about letting you know when they are in pain. If your dog looks or sounds uncomfortable when you pick him up, he probably is, so set him back down and re-evaluate the way you're holding him before you try again.  Some signs of pain in dogs are obvious, like yelping, whimpering, etc. However, others a little more subtle. The following are nonverbal signs that a dog may be uncomfortable:  Trembling (without another explanation, like coldness) Trying to get away Unnatural amounts of affection or aggression Holding the mouth closed (rather than having a natural, \\"happy\\" look) Nothing's more frustrating than when you take the time to learn how to hold your dachshund properly, only for well-meaning relatives to come over and treat him like an ordinary dog. To avoid problems, be sure to educate any visitors about the proper ways to hold your dog before they play with him. This is especially true for children, who can sometimes be too rough with dogs by accident. It's a wise idea to supervise children when they first interact with your dachshund until you're confident that they know how to play safely.

Answer a question about this article: After recovering surprisingly fast from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans beat the Samnites in two battles, but were forced to withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War. Rome beat the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius and again in the Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule. What caused the Romans early withdrawl in The First Samnite War?","output":"The early withdrawal of the Romans in the First Samnite War (343 BC – 341 BC) was primarily caused by an internal conflict that emerged in the form of the Latin War. The Latin War was a revolt initiated by several of Rome's Latin allies who demanded equal rights and greater autonomy within the Roman confederation.  There were various factors that contributed to the Latin War, including the growth and supremacy of Rome in the Italian peninsula and the increasing dissatisfaction among the Latin cities about their subordinate status. The fear of losing their autonomy and cultural identity was widespread among the Latin cities, particularly as Rome started showing signs of imperialistic ambitions. The Romans had to shift their focus away from the Samnites when several Latin cities, including Tibur, Praeneste, and Lanuvium, united to challenge Rome's dominance. The Latin cities' rebellion provoked Rome to redirect their military resources toward countering this new domestic threat.  Two significant battles took place during the Latin War: the Battle of Vesuvius in 340 BC and the Battle of Trifanum in 339 BC. The Romans emerged victorious on both occasions, ultimately forcing the Latin cities to submit to Roman rule and give up their ambitions for greater autonomy. These two victories illustrate Rome's ability to allocate resources and military attention to address the immediate threats that were closer to home. In summary, the early withdrawal of the Romans in the First Samnite War was due to the unexpected revolt of their Latin allies that led to the Latin War. Consequently, Rome had to prioritize this internal conflict to maintain its stability and dominance on the Italian peninsula. As a result, the Romans had to withdraw from pursuing the Samnites temporarily, leading to the conclusion of the First Samnite War."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition to the app's appealing aesthetics, I find its performance to be outstanding, with smooth scrolling and snappy response times.  Another key aspect of Telegram that I have grown to love is the variety of features it offers. From basic functions such as voice messages, stickers, and GIFs to advanced capabilities like bots, channels, and file-sharing, there's something for everyone. Furthermore, the app also supports group messaging with up to 200,000 members, which is perfect for communities, teams, and even social events. Beyond these impressive features, this app is all about privacy and security. With end-to-end encryption and automatic self-destructing messages, I can rest assured that my conversations remain confidential. The app also uses cloud-based storage, allowing me to access my messages and files across multiple devices without any hassle. This feature immensely benefits those who are constantly on the go or have multiple devices.  However, org.telegram.messenger truly sets itself apart by continuously adding new features and improvements. Regular updates ensure that the app stays ahead of the curve in terms of innovation and user satisfaction. I am always excited to see what new additions will be introduced, and I have yet to be disappointed. Lastly, I would like to commend the developers of this app on their dedication to providing a free service without ads. In today's world, where being bombarded with advertisements is the norm, it's a breath of fresh air to have such a quality app that is ad-free, without incurring any hidden costs.  In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend org.telegram.messenger to anyone looking for an exceptional messaging app. With its user-friendly interface, robust features, top-notch security, and commitment to being ad-free, it surely deserves a perfect 5-star rating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: John McCain thinks that's beneath him. Hypothesis: John McCain is an egocentric and narcissistic person. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise provided is: \\"John McCain thinks that's beneath him.\\" In this statement, John McCain supposedly believes that a particular action, task, or situation is not worthy of his time, effort or attention. To fully assess whether this premise entails the hypothesis that John McCain is an egocentric and narcissistic person, a deeper analysis of both the premise and the hypothesis is needed. Egocentrism is characterized by the belief that one's own self-interest and perspectives far outweigh those of others. An egocentric individual often has difficulty understanding or appreciating the feelings, perspectives, or needs of others and tends to prioritize their own needs and desires above all else. Narcissism, on the other hand, is characterized by an excessive interest in or admiration of oneself, often stemming from a deep-rooted need for admiration and validation from others. The hypothesis posits that John McCain's belief that something is \\"beneath him\\" is indicative of egocentrism and narcissism. While it is true that believing certain tasks, actions, or situations to be beneath oneself can be a sign of egocentrism or narcissism, it is important to consider the broader context in which the statement is made. If, for example, John McCain consistently dismisses all tasks or actions that do not contribute directly to his personal gain or reflect positively on his image and accomplishments, it would provide evidence for the hypothesis. This pattern of behavior would demonstrate that McCain prioritizes his interests above others' and has difficulty empathizing with differing viewpoints or values. However, if this statement about something being \\"beneath him\\" is an isolated incident and in response to a morally questionable action, it may not be indicative of egocentrism or narcissism. In such a case, McCain may be expressing a principled stance based on moral or ethical grounds. This would mean that his actions are not guided solely by his own self-interest, but rather by a larger framework of values. Therefore, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis that John McCain is an egocentric and narcissistic person. The belief that something is \\"beneath\\" an individual is context-dependent and may vary depending on the specific circumstances. While it is possible that this statement could be a manifestation of egocentrism or narcissism, it is not guaranteed, and further information would be required to make a definitive conclusion about McCain's character."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on lidia Șimon 's:    - weight     - caption     - height       - medaltemplates     - birth date     - name     - image size     - image     Bio: lidia slăvuțeanu-Șimon -lrb- born 4 september 1973 in târgu cărbunești -rrb- is a romanian long-distance runner . she is the only woman to have competed in the olympic marathon five times -lrb- 1996-2012 -rrb- , winning a silver medal at the 2000 summer olympics in sydney . she is also a former marathon world champion .

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

The letterhead on correspondence still bears the Bexar County Legal Aid name, even though the organization is no longer. Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn.

Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

Please answer the following question: Two signatures. That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution.

That could all change with a controversial Nov. 4 ballot initiative in which voters will get to decide for the first time whether to abolish a 1963 state law designed to protect small businesses. The law requires North Dakota pharmacies to be owned by local pharmacists or run by hospitals with a local pharmacist on staff. Supporters of the initiative argue it will remove an embarrassing anachronism, give consumers more choice and lower prescription drug costs. Opponents say that allowing national chains would destroy North Dakota’s tradition of personalized pharmacy care and be yet another example of how the state’s neighborly way of life is changing too fast. Canada, Germany, France and many other countries, they also note, have similar laws requiring local pharmacy ownership. “Independent pharmacies are more apt to focus on customer service,” said Gabe Gretz, who bought Service Drug Pharmacy in Williston last year with his father. “This is our bread and butter. It’s not just a hobby for us.”  “North Dakota Nice” is a truism here, not an irony, and most retail stores are still prohibited from opening before noon on Sunday - a throwback to laws designed to encourage family time. Yet since the oil boom began around 2010, drawing thousands of new residents to jobs where roughnecks can earn more than 100,000 a year, drug use, assault and other violent crimes have jumped. Recent sex-trafficking charges brought against an oil field worker in Williston, a once quiet town that is now the epicenter of the boom, marked the first charges of that type ever filed in the area and has escalated tension between new and old residents. Many newly arrived oil workers, and even some locals, say they hope the ballot measure passes so that they can use the  same chains they’ve grown accustomed to elsewhere. Rite Aid Corp has no outpost in the state, North Dakota’s Walmarts have no in-store pharmacies and the state’s lone Walgreens, on the Minnesota border, is prohibited from selling prescription drugs. CVS is able to operate only a handful of pharmacies in North Dakota thanks to a 2006 buyout of several Osco Drug stores that operated before the 1963 law. “Honestly, it’s not convenient getting my prescriptions here,” said Jan Anseth, a resident of Williston who spends winters in Arizona where she gets her medications from a national chain. In North Dakota, Anseth says, she runs into problems transferring prescriptions and getting anything more than a 30-day supply. The ballot’s primary sponsor, North Dakotans For Lower Pharmacy Prices, was funded with 168,000 in contributions from Walmart, Walgreens, Kmart and others. In campaign materials, the group cites data the Kaiser Family Foundation compiled in 2009 showing North Dakota has one of the highest per capita costs for prescription drug and medical devices in the country. Walmart says North Dakotans are missing out on its popular 4 prescription program, which makes many generic drugs available at the sharply discounted price. Crying foul, the state’s independent pharmacists say they’re able to often meet or beat prices from national chains, most of whom lose money on pharmacy sales as a way to get customers in the door. A random survey by Reuters of North Dakota’s independent pharmacies showed that a 30-day supply of the generic blood thinning drug clopidogrel ranged in price between 10 and 59.95. A CVS in Bismarck, the state capital, quoted a price of 149.95 for the same dosage. “I get to set the prices here at my pharmacy,” said Jenna Wahlstrom, a pharmacist at Larsen Service Drug, which her grandfather founded in Watford City in 1952. “It’s not a corporate decision.”  Like the big chains, Wahlstrom offers her customers a smartphone app and online refill ordering. Her pharmacy has transferred hundreds of prescriptions from retail chains for workers who have moved to the state, she said. Ahead of the vote, the state’s top politicians are declining to take sides. Governor Jack Dalrymple, a Republican who took office in 2010, says he shops at locally owned Aerohead Plaza Drug while in Bismarck and believes it has been able to compete effectively with the nearby CVS. Yet in the 1990s, as a state legislator, Dalrymple voted to keep the pharmacy law intact. “I don’t know,” he now says, “if that was the right vote.”","output":"Claim: Abolishing the 1963 state law in North Dakota, which requires pharmacies to be owned by local pharmacists or run by hospitals with a local pharmacist on staff, could increase consumer choice and potentially lower prescription drug costs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Similarly, the General Services Administration's (GSA) fiscal year 2000 annual performance plan does not address several long-standing problems identified by the GSA Inspector General.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"All problems are addressed in the plan.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"Similarly, the General Services Administration's (GSA) fiscal year 2000 annual performance plan does not address several long-standing problems identified by the GSA Inspector General\\" is true, then it directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"All problems are addressed in the plan.\\" The information provided by the premise suggests that there are indeed gaps in the annual performance plan, specifically in addressing several long-standing problems previously identified by the GSA Inspector General. The hypothesis \\"All problems are addressed in the plan\\" asserts that the plan is comprehensive and has taken into consideration all known issues to be tackled within their specified timeframe. However, the truth of the premise negates that assertion, indicating that the annual performance plan has not dealt with all issues, particularly the ones pointed out by the Inspector General. In light of the premise provided, it is possible to draw some inferences about the situation: 1. Lack of thorough planning: The fact that the annual performance plan doesn't address several long-standing problems could suggest a lack of thorough planning on the part of the GSA. This might point towards inadequacies in their strategic planning process, or perhaps they lack the necessary resources or expertise to tackle all known problems effectively. 2. Priority discrepancies: It is also possible that the GSA might have different priorities in terms of problems to be addressed as compared to the Inspector General. The annual performance plan might have focused on issues that are more pressing from their perspective, hence they might have deliberately chosen to address only certain problems in their plan for the fiscal year 2000. 3. Incomplete communication channels: Another possible explanation for the contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis is that there might have been communication gaps between the GSA and the Inspector General. The issues mentioned by the Inspector General might not have been effectively communicated to those responsible for creating the annual performance plan, leading to their omission. Overall, if the premise is true, it disproves the hypothesis stating that \\"All problems are addressed in the plan\\" and showcases that the GSA's fiscal year 2000 annual performance plan has not taken into consideration all long-standing problems identified by the Inspector General. This can potentially raise concerns about the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the GSA's planning processes, and it might necessitate a closer examination of their priorities as well as their communication and coordination with the Inspector General."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is an article: And yet, despite its sometimes breathless tone and metaphorical overreaching, “Bottom of the 33rd” is as good a book about, yes, communion and possibility in baseball as any, a worthy companion to Roger Kahn’s classic “Boys of Summer,” about the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. While the books’ subjects are baseball opposites — one bizarre minor-league game versus a historically beloved major-league team — Mr. Barry, like Mr. Kahn, exploits the power of memory and nostalgia with literary grace and journalistic exactitude. He blends a vivid, moment-by-moment re-creation of the game with what happens to its participants in the next 30 years. (Mr. Barry wasn’t present that night, but he lived in Pawtucket and was a reporter for The Providence Journal several years later.) This is a fastball of literary devices — hindsight, like Ted Williams’s vision, can be 20/10 — but it works wonderfully here, thanks to a diverse roster of characters. The third basemen, Cal Ripken Jr. for Rochester and Wade Boggs for Pawtucket, will enjoy careers that lead to baseball’s Hall of Fame. A free-spirited Dutchman named Win Remmerswaal, who pitches in the 18th through the 22nd innings for Pawtucket, will become an alcoholic, suffer brain damage and wind up confined to a wheelchair in a nursing home in The Hague. The exquisitely named Rochester right fielder, Drungo Hazewood, will exit baseball bitterly, drive a truck and think about “the best time of his life: the days he spent playing baseball on nights like this, as cold as it is, with got-your-back teammates close by, and the Baltimore organization invested in his future.” During the final game of the 1986 World Series two former Pawtucket teammates, Bruce Hurst and Bob Ojeda, “will spot each other, one in a Red Sox uniform, one in a Mets uniform, and their eyes will lock in wordless communication, conveying so much, including: Pawtucket.” The Pawtucket club owner, Ben Mondor, and his two young lieutenants will run the team for the next three decades. The game’s eventual hero, the Pawtucket first baseman Dave Koza, will struggle in and then out of baseball before righting his life back in the city where he enjoyed his moment of fame. The foreknowledge imbues “Bottom of the 33rd” with resonance and depth. Participants tell Mr. Barry that a day doesn’t go by that they don’t think about the game, or that it defined their lives, or that it gave them a great story — like that of the Rochester pitcher Jim Umbarger, who consumed “20 or so cups of coffee” and threw 10 scoreless innings, the 23rd through the 32nd; or Danny Card, 9 years old at the time, who stayed because his father had once pledged never to leave a game early. “I learned what a promise meant,” Mr. Card tells Mr. Barry. Mostly the participants remember the surreal nature of a game that wouldn’t end. By the 24th inning Mr. Barry wonders: “Is this even a baseball game anymore? Maybe it has morphed into some kind of extravagant form of performance art, in which the failure to reach climax is the point; in which the repetition of scoreless innings signals the meaninglessness of existence. Then again, maybe the performance is intended to convey the opposite message: That this is all a celebration of mystery, a divine reminder that the human condition is too complex and unpredictable, so enjoy this party while you can.” A bit over the top? Sure, but asking existential questions seems not only reasonable but also necessary when it comes to a game in which players burned broken bats in garbage drums to stay warm, and family members called hospitals searching for loved ones who should have come home hours earlier. It’s fitting, and for Mr. Barry narratively ideal, that baseball’s longest game occurred in the rung just below the majors, Triple-A, populated by has-beens and will-bes and those in between. Everyone in Triple-A is at a life-changing crossroads, even if they don’t yet know it, but for one night there in April 1981 time simply stopped. In the moment those present wanted the insanity to end; three decades later they are grateful that it didn’t. The tie game was resumed on a warm Tuesday evening in June. This time McCoy Stadium was packed with 6,000 fans and 150 journalists, all of them intruders on a private moment. What took 8 hours 7 minutes and 32 innings to start required just 18 minutes and 1 inning to finish, with a bases-loaded bloop single by Mr. Koza. He never went on to play in the majors. But the bat he used to stroke that winning hit is in the Hall of Fame. Hope, Redemption and Baseball’s Longest Game Illustrated. 255 pages. Harper. 26.99.

INSTANT COLOUR TV In 1962 there was only one TV channel in Sweden, and it broadcast in black and white.The station's technical expert, Kjell Stensson, appeared on the news to announce that thanks to a newly developed technology, all viewers could now quickly and easily transform their existing sets to display colour reception.All they had to do was pull a nylon stocking over their TV screen, and they would begin to see their favorite shows in color.Reportedly, hundreds of thousands of people were taken in.Actual color TV transmission only started to appear in Sweden on April 1, 1970. SAN ERRIFFE In 1977 the British newspaper The Guardian published a special seven-page supplement  in honor of the tenth anniversary of San Serriffe, a small republic located in the Indian Ocean.A series of articles affectionately described the geography and culture of this unknown nation.The Guardian's phones rang all day as readers asked for more information about the beautiful holiday spot.Few noticed that everything about the island was made up. NIXON FOR PRESIDENT In 1992 American National Public Radio's Talk of the Nation program announced that Richard Nixon, in a surprise move, was running for President again.His new campaign slogan was, \\"I didn't do anything wrong, and I won't do it again.\\" Accompanying this announcement were audio clips of Nixon delivering his election speech.Listeners responded immediately to the announcement, flooding the show with calls expressing shock and anger.Only during the second half of the show did the host John Hockenberry reveal that the announcement was a practical joke, Nixon's voice was copied by comedian Rich Little. Question: What can be inferred from the text about Color TV? - The Swedish People didn't watch color TVs until 1970. - The Swedish People began to watch color TVs in 1962. - Kjell Stensson was a TV host. - Not many people believed Kjell Stensson.","output":"The best answer that can be inferred from the text about Color TV is: - The Swedish People didn't watch color TVs until 1970."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. On Tuesday, less than a week after the death of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, the news broke that his life will be turned into a biopic starring none other than Jared Leto.            The Academy Award-winning actor is in the early stages (so early that there's neither a release date nor a title for it just yet) of making a movie about Hefner’s life with producer Brett Ratner, who’s slated to direct. \\"Jared is an old friend,\\" Ratner told The Hollywood Reporter. \\"When he heard I got the rights to Hef's story, he told me, 'I want to play him. I want to understand him.' And I really believe Jared can do it. He's one of the great actors of today.\\"      Leto isn’t just an actor: he’s also an avid mountain climber (albeit one who scales the slopes wearing copious amounts of Gucci) and the frontman of the band 30 Seconds to Mars. Word has it he never had the opportunity to meet Hefner in person, but that shouldn’t stop him from turning out a great performance. Hefner lived his life in full view of the public for well over 60 years, and with talk shows, reality shows, and even movie and TV cameos, his mannerisms and personal style should be easy for Leto to capture. And if Ray, The King's Speech, and Braveheart are any indication, this film has a good chance of setting him up to win another Oscar. In the meantime, his next movie, Blade Runner 2049, will premiere on Friday, Oct. 6. ||||| Jared Leto has officially signed on to play the late Playboy founder Hugh Hefner in an upcoming biopic, according to the Hollywood Reporter.      The announcement comes just a week after Hefner passed away at 91, but the film's reportedly been in the works for the better part of a decade. The Hef biopic is the brainchild of Brett Ratner, the guy who gave us Rush Hour and directed the goofiest X-Men movie ever made.      Ratner's been scrambling to tell Hefner's weird-ass life story for years, at one point nabbing Robert Downey Jr. to star before the project went haywire, according to the Reporter. In April, the Big Butt Book–loving director finally got the greenlight to make the movie—and, as he tells it, his \\"old friend\\" Leto became the leading contender for the starring role almost immediately.      \\"When [Leto] heard I got the rights to Hef's story, he told me, 'I want to play him. I want to understand him,'\\" Ratner told the Reporter. \\"And I really believe Jared can do it. He's one of the great actors of today.\\"      Ratner even took Leto down to the Playboy mansion for a premiere of the Amazon docuseries American Playboy: The Hugh Hefner Story, which also doubled as the tycoon's 91st birthday party. Ratner had hoped to introduce Leto to the onetime Curb guest star in person, but apparently Hef wasn't feeling well enough for the visit. Still, Ratner's convinced the actor will handle the role just fine.      \\"There's enough footage on Hef out there that Jared will be able to get as much information as he wants,\\" he told the Reporter.      Leto just finished wrapping up Blade Runner 2049, and he's still slated to play Andy Warhol in another upcoming biopic. The Hefner movie is still in early development, and there's no timeline about when it will go into production, but whenever it does, Leto's co-stars better get ready for some gross-ass gifts behind the scenes. ||||| In some news that we weren’t hoping to start our day off with, The Hollywood Reporter has revealed that Jared Leto will take on the role of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, who died just last week at the age of 91, for Brett Ratner’s long-in-development biopic surrounding the late media mogul.      The project has been in limbo since 2007 when it was originally set up at Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment. However, the film sat on the shelf for a number of years and the rights soon expired, leading to them being purchased by producer Jerry Weintraub for Warner Bros.      Advertisement      “Jared is an old friend,” Rater, who acquired the rights to the project after Weintraub’s death in 2015, told THR. “When he heard I got the rights to Hef’s story, he told me, ‘I want to play him. I want to understand him.’ And I really believe Jared can do it. He’s one of the great actors of today.”      I think we can all agree that this biopic will shy away from being an honest retelling of Hefner’s actual life story and will more so serve as a celebration of his life, to which I say, in the words of Ira Madison III: “Keep it.” ||||| The producer of the upcoming Hefner biopic believes the Playboy founder and \\"consummate optimist\\" was one of a handful of leaders who made American culture less intolerant and repressive.      Hef was my friend. He was the coolest. And the hippest. And at the same time, the squarest. While he transformed from an Illinois prude to the ultimate urban sophisticate, he never lost the Midwest values on which he was raised. His word was bankable. His heart was a well of emotion, open for all to see. He was the least prejudiced man I ever knew. He had deep pockets and long arms.      I admired him differently at different times. When I was a kid, he was the embodiment of everything I wanted but seemed hopelessly out of reach: beautiful women, a kingly mansion, a bunny-emblazoned DC-9. He smoked a pipe and wore pajamas, both day and night. So did my uncle Mario, but he was a doctor and unfortunately wasn’t dating Barbie Benton.      In those days, Hef’s name was synonymous with sin. For me, like most young American boys, getting my hands on a Playboy was the ultimate forbidden fruit … the joys of living before the internet. But in those days, I thought the interviews with Norman Mailer, the short stories by John Cheever or the poems by Allen Ginsberg were mere fillers that kept The Girls of the Big Ten from slamming directly into Miss November.      In my 20s and 30s, when fortune smiled on me and I actually came to know Hef, spending time at the mansion, I admired his decency and his hospitality, how he made this Jewish kid from Miami Beach with a couple of movies under his belt feel as if he’d made it in a town that can be both magical and difficult. I also realized that by his fostering the literary and performing arts, by putting the wealth of his organization and the power of his convictions squarely on the side of civil liberties for all of our citizens, he was trying to make this country a better and fairer place.      Now that he’s gone, I realize more than ever that he didn’t have to do those things. Many titans of industry have no interest in contributing to the Greater Good. Certainly Hef enjoyed money and what it could buy. But his most treasured acquisitions were friends of whom there are too many to count and causes that were unabashedly progressive — of which he was justifiably proud.      My personal relationship with Hef actually started when I read that Brian Grazer was to produce a biopic about him. I sent Brian my classic 1970s playboy pinball machine with a note telling him that he’d found his director. After Brian capitulated, I had a series of meetings with Hef, desperately trying to crack how to tell the story, which is the odyssey of his life. The development process went through many incarnations — Imagine, Universal (with Robert Downey Jr. attached), Jerry Weintraub at Warners, and then, thankfully, it became available again. A dream came true: I bought it for RatPac. There will never be another Hugh Hefner, but getting to make a movie about his life is, I guess, the next best thing.      The America into which Hugh Hefner was born was in many ways intolerant and repressive. He, among only a handful of men in our history, made it less so. It saddened him to see the pendulum swinging the other way. But Hef was the consummate optimist. I’m sure he passed on believing that the pendulum will swing back, that the progress he was committed to and facilitated will ultimately become a permanent part of our national character.

But second, I want to remind him that if he acts like a jerk, I could wind up writing something like this:      I’ve been cornered downstairs in the gold lamé disco basement at Brett Ratner’s house and he’s hitting on me.      That was the opening line of a profile I wrote of Ratner in October 2008. I worked hard to persuade him to interview with me, but not that hard, since the very first time I met him, at an event at American Jewish University, he gave me his phone number.      My M.O. after that was turn his own trick right back on him: Don’t take ‘no’ for an answer.      That line is part of the Brett-Ratner-rise-in-Hollywood mythology – and has been referenced countless times (see: Entourage, profiles etc.). But it’s also part of the mythology of Brett Ratner the man: He doesn’t take ‘no.’ He has no boundaries. He does whatever the heck he wants. It’s part of his big-Hollywood-director cache. And most of the time, he gets away with it.      Not anymore.      My guess is that if it were up to Brett Ratner The Man, and not Brett Ratner The Director, to get women to like him, he could have played The Forty-Year-Old-Virgin instead of Steve Carrell. And not because he’s modest and cute and shy; because he’s disrespectful and smarmy and childish.      Every time I see Brett Ratner, he hits on me again. Though only after he insults me: “You’re still at the Jewish Journal? Your piece on me was supposed to advance your career.” (Editor’s note: It did. I got salaried and health insurance.)      The last time I saw him, at the Museum of Tolerance dinner honoring Tom Cruise, he said, “You’re cute, but can you cook?”      Months later, I texted him to ask for an interview about “Tower Heist” (which he did not grant) and to maybe do a live Q-and-A with me in advance of the Oscar cast he was supposed to produce. I asked if we could have lunch and talk it over. He only wanted to know if I still had a boyfriend.      After all this, I figure, ‘This is his shtick. This is what he does. This is who he is.’ But when I read what he says about other women, how he humiliates them with the bully pulpit he doesn’t deserve – for example, he referred to Olivia Munn, who at the age of 30 has accomplished more than most, as a “whore” and revealed to Howard Stern that he forced Lindsay Lohan, who has enough problems, to get checked for sexually transmitted diseases before he would sleep with her—I get angry.      Then I feel inclined to say things like this: If Lindsay Lohan was infected with the Ebola virus, Ratner would be lucky to get five minutes in a room with her.      But admittedly, I have Ratner baggage. When I look back on my first big Hollywood interview, I remember sitting on Ratner’s couch, with a handful of people around, watching Albert Lamorisse’s The Red Balloon, and repeatedly removing Ratner’s hands from between my legs.      I was a young, inexperienced journalist then, and told myself that getting the story was more important than my dignity. So in a big way, I’m grateful to Brett Ratner – because the very same profile that got me a full-time reporting job was also the one that taught me that no story is worth compromising my integrity. I should have slapped him and stormed from the house. It would have been cinematic.      It is precisely because movies represent some imaginative ideal that the movie industry should have standards. Lots of directors get away with way worse than Ratner – Roman Polanski comes to mind, for example. Famous people tend to get away with things, because they’re famous and they can.      Today was the first day Brett Ratner didn’t get away with it.      Earlier today, I wrote that I didn’t care whether Ratner produced the Oscars or not, but in the dark of evening, long after the sun has set, I applaud the Academy for taking a stand – for standing for something.      It was a Jewish thing to do. ||||| Noted Hollywood fauxteur Brett Ratner appeared on Attack of the Show to pimp his latest brain-smoothing studio confection, Tower Heist. After a comfortable amount of brown-nosing, host Kevin Pereira pointedly asked the director if rumors were true that a particularly unflattering passage in former co-host Olivia Munn's memoir, Suck It, Wonder Woman!: The Misadventures Of A Hollywood Geek, had referred to Ratner. (The story, as Munn recounts it, involved a major movie director whipping out his tiny penis without warning and proceeding to jerk off, while simultaneously eating cocktail-sauce-slathered jumbo shrimps with the other hand.)      Ratner immediately knew which story Pereira was referring to, and offered this version of events. (It begins in the video below at 3:45.)      \\"I used to date Olivia Munn, I'll be honest with everyone here. But when she was 'Lisa.' She wasn't Asian back then. She was hanging out on my set of After the Sunset, I banged her a few times, but I forgot her. Because she changed her name. I didn't know it was the same person and so when she auditioned for me for a TV show, I forgot her, she got pissed off, and so she made up all these stories about me eating shrimp and masturbating in my trailer. And she talked about my shortcomings.\\"      At which point Pereira added:      \\"To be fair, you did ask for shrimp cocktail in the green room today.\\"      So draw your own conclusions. ||||| Movie director and shrimp-eating fapper, Brett Ratner, called into Howard Stern (via EW) yesterday to spit out a half-assed apology to GLAAD for saying “rehearsals is for fags” during a Q&A for Tower Heiest last week and he also admitted that he lied when he said that he “banged” Olivia Munn back when she wasn’t Asian. With the scent of curdled goat leche and shrimp shit wafting off of his finger tips, Brett picked up the phone and said this to Howard about Olivia:            “She’s actually talented. The problem is I made her look like she’s a whore.”      Brett kept backpedaling (unfortunately he didn’t backpedal off of a cliff) and gave GLAAD an “I’m Soooo SOWWY” hug for using the word fag.            “I apologize for any offense my remarks caused. It was a dumb way of expressing myself. Everyone who knows me knows that I don’t have a prejudiced bone in my body. But as a storyteller I should have been much more thoughtful about the power of language and my choice of words.”      Brett is producing the next Oscars and the president of that shit says that his comments were “dumb and insensitive” but “the apology [Ratner] gave I truly believe comes from his heart. If I didn’t believe it, I would do something about it. This is about integrity and honoring the Academy Awards, but we all make mistakes and I believe he didn’t mean it.”      That apology came from Brett’s checking account, since he has a stupid movie to sell, and not his heart. That is the correction. But really. Brett Ratner is an exact stereotype of a sleazy, flea-dicked movie director who keeps a murphy bed in his office and honestly thinks he’s fooling a bitch with those tragic hair plugs, so none of us should strain our emotions by being shocked when words of doucheness fall out of his mouth. Allow me to put it more eloquently: Fuck him, fuck his awful movies and fuck his sweaty piss bag of a face. Seriously, I’d rather lick a condensation drop on an overheated piss bag than go see Tower Heist. (Yes, mom, that is my way of telling you that I will not see Tower Heist with you when I visit.)      And Brett should call into Howard Stern again tomorrow to apologize for calling himself a storyteller. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Jared Leto, who is an actor and also a mountain climber and the singer of a band called 30 Seconds to Mars, is going to play Hugh Hefner in a movie about his life.

Information:  - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.  - OGLE - TR - 113b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE - TR - 113 . In 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment ( OGLE ) detected periodic dimming in the star 's light curve indicating a transiting , planetary - sized object . Since low - mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet , radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body . In 2004 , the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet . The planet has a mass 1.32 times that of Jupiter . Since the planet 's inclination is known , the value is exact . It orbits the star ( OGLE - TR - 113 ) in an extremely close orbit , even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1.43 days . The radius of the planet is only 9 % larger than Jupiter 's , despite the heating effect by the star . Planets of its kind are sometimes called \`\` super-hot Jupiters '' .  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - OGLE-TR-113 is a dim, distant magnitude 16 binary star in the star fields of the constellation Carina. Because of its distance of about 1800 light years, and location in a crowded field it was not notable in any way. Spectral type of the star is type K dwarf star, slightly cooler and less luminous than the Sun.    What is the relationship between 'ogle-tr-113b' and 'carina'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'OGLE-TR-113b' and 'Carina' is that OGLE-TR-113b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE-TR-113, which is a dim, distant binary star located in the constellation Carina. The constellation Carina serves as the location in the night sky where the star OGLE-TR-113 (and consequently its orbiting planet OGLE-TR-113b) can be found."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The first time I tried watching it I could only make it halfway through, before losing interest. Again it gets off to a good start (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with Dracula), but then for me it got less involving when it hits New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A great place to set it, but never took advantage of its settings (despite etching a paradise in damn, where Dracula could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and yeah they throw that name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals, but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don't help. The messy script does get considerably silly. Lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy, inserting a lot of blood (the make-up is suitably achieved) and a lot of \\"Virgin\\" advertising. No I don't mean virgins, it's the music company, as it does get in numerous shots and Helsing's daughter works there too. Oh that wasn't obvious planting.

The answer is:","output":"The last step of the process could be the excretion of the converted waste products and the distribution of essential nutrients and substances throughout the body to maintain homeostasis. After the liver has performed its various functions, such as filtering the blood, producing bile, synthesizing proteins, converting glucose into glycogen, and transforming ammonia into urea, the final step of the process is to ensure that the waste products, along with essential nutrients, are distributed effectively within the body. Waste products like urea, which is produced from the conversion of ammonia, are transported by the blood to the kidneys. Here, they are filtered out and excreted through urine. This removal of waste is crucial for maintaining the body's internal equilibrium and preventing the accumulation of toxic substances. In addition to eliminating waste products, the liver also plays a crucial role in distributing essential nutrients and substances throughout the body. Some examples are: 1. Iron Storage: The liver stores excess iron from the food we consume, which can then be utilized by the body to produce red blood cells. 2. Vitamin Storage: The liver also stores fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K. These vitamins are essential for the body's proper functioning and contribute to various aspects of our health like eyesight, immune system, and bone health. 3. Blood Clotting Factors: The liver produces proteins necessary for blood coagulation, which helps in the prevention of excessive bleeding during injuries or other incidents. 4. Glycogen Storage: When the liver converts excess glucose into glycogen, it stores this glycogen and releases it back into the bloodstream as glucose when the body needs energy, such as during periods of fasting or high-energy demand. In summary, the last step of the liver's process involves working with other organs such as the kidneys to excrete waste products like urea and distributing essential nutrients and substances like glycogen throughout the body to maintain homeostasis and ensure the various body systems continue to function efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the day of the celebration, Eric arrived at Michael's home with the cake, concealed in a beautifully designed cake box. When Michael opened the box, his eyes lit up with joy, and he couldn't believe the effort Eric had put into creating the perfect birthday cake just for him. The magical moment was made complete when Eric lit the candles, and they sang \\"Happy Birthday\\" together, the flickering flames reflecting the warmth and happiness filling the room. It wasn't just any birthday cake that Eric had made; it symbolized the depth of their friendship and showed just how much Eric cared for Michael. Michael felt touched and grateful for having a friend like Eric, who would go out of his way to make his special occasions extraordinary. As for Eric, he was glad to have the opportunity to make Michael's birthday extra memorable during these challenging times. Later that evening, as they enjoyed generous slices of the heavenly chocolate cake, they shared stories, laughed together, and cherished the moments they have had as friends. It was a day filled with love, joy, and gratitude that neither of them would ever forget. After all, it's not every day that someone gets a birthday cake made with such care, thoughtfulness, and affection, and that alone made the occasion incredibly special for both Michael and Eric."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate this to English?","output":"The given phrase \\"Vaihtoehtona on sosiaalinen polkumyynti\\" is in Finnish and translates to \\"The alternative is social dumping\\" in English. To provide a detailed explanation of the term \\"social dumping\\" in this context, it refers to a wide range of practices in which employers seek to take advantage of the differences in wage levels, working conditions, and regulatory frameworks between different countries or regions, in order to reduce labor costs and gain a competitive advantage over competitors in the global market. Simply put, it occurs when companies exploit workers by paying them less than the usual or legally required wage rates in their region, leading to unfair competition and poor working conditions. There are several reasons why social dumping occurs, and they can be broadly classified into the following categories: 1. Wage differences: Substantial disparities in wage levels between different countries or regions may incentivize employers to shift production or outsource work to areas where labor is cheaper. 2. Differences in labor regulations: Some countries may have weaker labor laws or less stringent enforcement of existing regulations, making it easier for companies to exploit workers without facing legal consequences. 3. Globalization and trade liberalization: The increased ease of trade and globalization has made it more accessible for companies to operate across borders and take advantage of differences in labor conditions. Social dumping can have several negative consequences, both for workers and the economy as a whole. These can include: 1. Exploitation of workers: Social dumping often leads to poor working conditions, long working hours, and reduced job security for the affected workers. This can contribute to a deterioration in physical and mental health, as well as an increased risk of accidents and injuries. 2. Undermining labor rights: The practice of social dumping can weaken the bargaining power of workers and trade unions, making it more difficult for them to negotiate fair wages and decent working conditions. 3. Erosion of labor standards: Widespread social dumping can set off a \\"race to the bottom\\" in terms of labor standards, as companies compete to cut costs by exploiting workers and lowering their conditions. 4. Negative effects on the economy: By reducing workers' income and spending power, social dumping can contribute to lower overall consumer demand and slower economic growth. To address and prevent social dumping, it is essential for governments and international organizations to work together to harmonize labor standards, strengthen enforcement of labor laws, and promote fair competition between businesses. This can be achieved by ensuring that workers are protected through equal access to labor rights and regulations, regardless of their nationality or the country in which they work. Moreover, it is crucial for businesses to adopt ethical labor practices that respect the rights and well-being of workers and contribute positively to the communities in which they operate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A Jeddah Criminal Court found Raif Badawi, who has been in prison since June 2012, guilty this week of insulting Islam through his website and in television comments.      \\"This incredibly harsh sentence for a peaceful blogger makes a mockery of Saudi Arabia's claims that it supports reform and religious dialogue,\\" said Nadim Houry, the deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \\"A man who wanted to discuss religion has already been locked up for a year and now faces 600 lashes and seven years in prison.\\"      Raif Badawi has been in prison since June      His lawyer, Waleed Abu al-Khair, told Human Rights Watch that Judge al-Harbi read the verdict Monday. The court is expected to send him a written notification by August 6. They'll have 30 days to appeal.      Case separates family      Ensaf Haidar, Badawi's wife, said she's devastated by the news.      \\"I don't know what to do,\\" Haidar said Wednesday. \\"Raif did nothing wrong.\\"      Haidar and the couple's three children now live in Lebanon.      Estranged from her family, Haidar said it would be impossible to take her children back to Saudi Arabia. The stigma is too strong there.      \\"You feel like everybody's accusing you,\\" she said, close to tears, in an April interview. \\"Like everybody's against you, at war with you.\\"      CNN has made several attempts to reach the Saudi Arabia government for comment but received no response.      A contentious five years      Badawi's legal troubles started shortly after he started the Free Saudi Liberals website in 2008. He was detained for one day and questioned about the site. Some clerics even branded him an unbeliever and apostate.      Last summer, Human Rights Watch released a statement urging Saudi authorities to free Badawi.      \\"Saudi authorities should drop charges and release the editor of the Free Saudi Liberals website for violating his right to freedom of expression on matters of religion and religious figures,\\" a statement from the group said at the time.      Rights groups accuse Saudi authorities of targeting activists through the courts and travel bans. Many were outraged when two of the country's most prominent reform advocates, Mohammed Al-Qahtani and Abdullah Al-Hamid, were sentenced in March to 10 years in prison apiece.      Amnesty International called that trial \\"just one of a troubling string of court cases aimed at silencing the kingdom's human-rights activists.\\"      Asked in January about accusations that Saudi Arabia is cracking down on dissent, Maj. Gen. Mansour Al-Turki, spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry, told CNN, \\"At the Interior Ministry, our area of responsibility is security.\\"      He added, \\"My understanding is that these cases are being looked at by the courts now. Nobody will comment on cases being looked at by the courts.\\" ||||| Image caption Raef Badawi was facing a possible death sentence for apostasy      A Saudi online activist has been jailed for seven years and sentenced to 600 lashes for urging religious liberalisation, his lawyer has said.      The activist, Raef Badawi, co-founded the Free Saudi Liberals website, an online forum for public debate.      He was arrested last year and convicted on Monday of setting up a website that undermined general security.      Amnesty International considers Mr Badawi a political prisoner and has called for his immediate release.      Mr Badawi was originally charged with apostasy, or abandonment of religion, a crime in Saudi Arabia that carries with it the death penalty.      Lawyer Waleed Abu Alkhair told the BBC that Mr Badawi, a father of three, had confirmed in court that he was a Muslim but told the judge \\"everyone has a choice to believe or not believe.\\"      He was convicted of the charges of setting up a website that undermines general security and of ridiculing religious figures.      The judge ordered that the 600 lashes be administered 150 at a time.      Mr Alkhair said the charges were over comments the activist posted calling for a relaxation of Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islam.      The lawyer said the sentence was unduly harsh.      \\"The lashes could be spread out but in Sharia this is a sign that the judge wants to insult him,\\" he said.      His lawyer said he will appeal against the decision. ||||| The founder of a liberal-minded website in Saudi Arabia has been sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes after angering Islamic authorities in the ultraconservative kingdom, a newspaper reported Tuesday.      Raif Badawi, through his website known as Free Saudi Liberals, had urged Saudis to share opinions about the role of religion in the country, which follows a strict form of Islam that includes harsh punishments for challenging customs.      A judge in the Red Sea port of Jiddah imposed the sentences but dropped charges of apostasy, which could have brought a death sentence, the Al-Watan newspaper reported. Badawi has been held since June 2012.      The newspaper did not name the judge who sentenced Badawi, nor did it say when the ruling was handed down. It was unclear Tuesday whether Badawi would receive any credit for the time he's already served.      Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday that the U.S. was \\"deeply concerned\\" by the sentence given to Badawi.      \\"We believe that when public speech is deemed offensive, be it via social media or any other means, the issue is best addressed through open dialogue and honest debate,\\" Psaki said.      Hard-line Saudi clerics have raised repeated objections to social media, including one prominent Islamic scholar describing Twitter as a path to hell. He later withdrew the comment. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A Saudi court has sentenced activist Raif Badawi to seven years in prison and 600 lashes for violating the nation's anti-cybercrime law, according to Human Rights Watch.

In using this phrase, the speaker confirms that they have received certain details, which could then be used to make decisions, draw conclusions, or take action.

By Victoria Woollaston Almost 1,500 years after his death, a rare seal has been discovered bearing a striking resemblance to religious figure St. Sabas - also known as Mar Saba. The lead seal consists of two discs connected by string that would have been used to close letters from Mar Saba's monastery during the Crusades. One disc reveals the figure of Mar Saba, holding a cross in his right hand, while the other side features the inscription: 'This is the seal of the Laura of the Holy Sabas,' written in Greek. The lead seal consists of two disks connected by string that would have been used to close letters during the Crusades in Jerusalem.

DTP, burada Türkiye, Irak, Suriye ve İran’dan gelen Kürt grupları ve yanı sıra PKK temsilcileri ile biraraya gelmeyi planlıyor. Translate to English","output":"DTP (Democratic Society Party) is planning to gather here with Kurdish groups from Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran, as well as representatives of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party). The Democratic Society Party (DTP) aims to bring together various Kurdish groups from different countries in the region, namely Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran. It is important to understand the context and the key players involved in this plan to better grasp the implications of this meeting. The Kurdish people, who are an ethnic group native to a region spanning parts of Eastern Turkey, Northern Iraq, Western Iran, and North-Eastern Syria, have been seeking varying levels of autonomy and self-determination in their respective countries for decades. As a result, various political organizations and armed groups have been formed to represent the Kurdish interests in different countries, leading to some of these groups being labeled as terrorist organizations by the governments they oppose. The Democratic Society Party (DTP) is a political party in Turkey that mainly focuses on advocating for the rights and recognition of the Kurdish population in the country. Formed in 2005, the party has attempted to serve as a political platform for Kurdish issues, which have often been underrepresented or even suppressed in Turkey's political landscape. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is a Kurdish militant and political organization based in Turkey and Iraqi Kurdistan, which has been involved in an armed struggle against the Turkish state since 1983. The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by several countries and international organizations, including Turkey, the United States, and the European Union. The plan for the DTP to bring together Kurdish groups from Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran, as well as representatives of the PKK, represents an effort to bridge the geographical and political divides between these diverse Kurdish communities and militant groups. Such a meeting would potentially help the participating Kurdish groups to establish common goals and develop a united front in their quest for greater autonomy, political representation, and human rights. It is worth noting, however, that any collaboration or negotiation between the DTP and the PKK could be seen as controversial given the latter's designation as a terrorist organization. This means that the proposed gathering could face opposition or criticism from both within and outside the Kurdish community, as well as from the governments of the countries where these groups are based. In conclusion, the DTP's plan to gather Kurdish groups from Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran, alongside representatives of the PKK, demonstrates an attempt to foster solidarity and cooperation among Kurdish communities across national borders. The outcomes of such a gathering may have a significant impact on the Kurdish struggle for autonomy and better representation in their respective countries, although the contentious nature of the PKK's involvement may pose challenges to the success of this initiative."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. According to the above context, answer the following question. When were people MOST likely to overeat processed food due to a certain quality?

The study showed that participants consumed 11% more kilojoules when the meals were high in salt, regardless of the fat content."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Обратите внимание, что автоматическую настройку паролей использовать небезопасно, так как любой может получить доступ к файлу ответов и узнать пароли. Translate to English","output":"Please note that using an automatic password configuration can be insecure because anyone can gain access to the answer file and find out the passwords. The automatic password configuration refers to the process of setting up and storing passwords with the help of software that might automate the process. There are some primary concerns associated with using this method. Let us dive deeper into this topic and discuss each concern in detail. 1. Lack of control over password generation: The automatic password configuration often lets the software generate passwords without much input from the user. As a result, users have limited control over the complexity and uniqueness of generated passwords. If the software uses a weak or predictable algorithm for creating passwords, this can lead to weak passwords that are easy to guess or crack, making the system vulnerable to attacks. 2. Centralization of sensitive data: When relying on a single tool or software for managing passwords, all the sensitive data, such as login credentials, are stored in a centralized location. Hackers may target this centralized location, and if they succeed in infiltrating the system, they can gain access to multiple passwords at once, which poses a significant security risk. 3. Vulnerability to malware and hacking: As mentioned earlier, if someone gains access to the answer file (for instance, a file containing the generated passwords), they can easily get hold of the critical data. This situation becomes more dangerous if the user is unaware that their system has been breached, leaving the hacker plenty of time and opportunities to exploit the compromised data. To mitigate these risks, some best practices can be followed: 1. Use reliable password managers: Instead of relying on automatic password configuration tools that may be insecure, users should opt for trustworthy and well-established password managers. These applications offer robust security features, generate strong and unique passwords, and store them securely. 2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring multiple pieces of information (such as a password and a temporary code sent to a registered device) to verify your identity before granting access. This practice makes it more challenging for hackers to breach your accounts even if they possess your password. 3. Regularly update your software: Ensuring that your system and password manager are updated to the latest versions is crucial for maintaining security. Software updates generally contain security patches that address known vulnerabilities, making it harder for attackers to exploit them. 4. Educate users about security practices: It is essential to train and educate users about secure password practices, such as generating strong passwords, not reusing passwords across multiple sites, and updating them regularly. This knowledge will help users adopt secure habits and lower the chances of a security breach. In conclusion, automatic password configuration can be highly insecure, as it may expose sensitive data and password information to potential threats. It is essential to be aware of these risks and follow best practices on password management and security to protect your accounts and data."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, object-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spectrum fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.  As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.  Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets. 1.

We have this equation: -82*y + 53*y = 174 Imagine you have -82 apples (I know it's weird, but let's pretend you owe someone 82 apples). Then someone gives you 53 apples. Now, we just need to figure out how many 'y' times this process happens to have 174 apples in total. To combine the apples, we just add the numbers: (-82 + 53) * y = 174 (-29) * y = 174 Now we want to find out what 'y' is - it means how many times we need to do this process. To do this, we will divide 174 by -29: y = 174 / (-29) When we do the math, we get: y = -6 And there we have it! You have to go through the process 6 times but backwards (because it's negative) to have a total of 174 apples. So, y = -6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Review: My husband and I are ultra-competitive when it comes to athletics -- so I was a bit concerned that the game would create more fights than fitness. Instead, it's been so fun and and, because of our competitive streak, definitely motivating. The first week, he wasn't so into it -- but when I won the week (8 to 5), he ramped it up the second week, which is where we are now. On days when normally I would have wanted to just sit in front of the TV after a long day at work, I am motivated to get moving to earn my stars. We're playing the instant-gratification version, so the one with the most points at the end of the week wins a smaller prize. The cards are way fun, and I love that they include things for kids so the whole family can get involved. When we have kids, they're totally going to be playing this with us! The answer to this question is:","output":"The customer seems to be satisfied with the product. As it is evident from their review, they have found the game fun, engaging, and motivating. The customer appreciates the game's ability to tap into their competitive nature and prompt them to be more active even after a tiring day at work. They also mention that the game gets their whole family involved, including the kids, which makes it an inclusive and exciting experience. Based on the customer's account, the game has surpassed their initial apprehension, preventing any arguments and instead fostering a spirit of healthy competition. The enthusiasm shown towards the game's instant-gratification version shows that it caters well to their preference for immediate rewards and recognition. Furthermore, the mention of winning the week (8 to 5) and the intention to involve their future kids in the game demonstrates their satisfaction with the product. In conclusion, the customer's review portrays a high level of satisfaction with the product as it successfully engages and motivates them in their fitness journey and promotes quality family time. The game's ability to adapt to their preferences and ultimately exceed their initial expectations showcases its versatility and potential to captivate a broader audience."},{"instruction":"Brad and Dale went to the doctor for a check up. Brad did some blood tests and found out he has very high cholesterol levels, while his partner Dale had normal cholesterol levels, and was very healthy. Brad got scared and started worrying.  Which friend had less plaque on his blood vessels?  Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.","output":"Based on the information given, Brad has very high cholesterol levels, which increases the likelihood of plaque formation in his blood vessels.

Title: nice for beginers Review: Small book but has nice prints. For someone who wants to have some reproductions of Sander's work and don't want to spend too much. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review is positive."},{"instruction":"Question: I have a new situation: Many years ago there was a beach Called Coast Brigs where many coral and other life lived. A refinery that burned coal was built nearby and over time the water nearby became very acidic. The coral and marine life died because of this but a few miles north on another beach named Greendale the same creatures are surviving just fine.  But I can use this background: Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume.  What is an answer for this question: Will building a refinery at Greendale cause the acidity of the water to increase or decrease? Answer:","output":"Building a refinery at Greendale is likely to cause the acidity of the water to increase, especially if the refinery burns fossil fuels like coal. This would lead to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere, which could then be absorbed by the ocean, lowering the pH of the water. This could potentially result in the same harmful effects on marine life, corals, and shellfish as witnessed at Coast Brigs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Recently a large amount of factories have been built in Illinois using fossil fuels as their main energy source. In Indiana however, many of their factories have been shut down and replaced by parks with many plants and trees.  Given Illinois adds even more of these fossil fuel burning factories will the levels of carbon dioxide increase or decrease? A:","output":"To answer this question, I'll consider the factors that contribute to carbon dioxide levels in both states. Step 1: Examine the situation in Illinois Illinois is adding more factories that use fossil fuels as their main energy source. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Therefore, the addition of these factories will contribute to increasing CO2 levels in Illinois. Step 2: Examine the situation in Indiana In Indiana, many factories have been shut down and replaced by parks with plants and trees. This change reduces the CO2 emissions from the closed factories. Furthermore, plants and trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere as part of their photosynthesis process, which helps reduce CO2 levels. Step 3: Determine the overall impact Given the increase in CO2 emissions from the new fossil fuel-burning factories in Illinois and the decrease in CO2 emissions from factory closures in Indiana, we need to consider the magnitude of these factors. If the overall increase in CO2 emissions from Illinois is greater than the overall decrease in CO2 emissions and absorption from Indiana's actions, then the combined carbon dioxide levels would increase. The reverse would be true if the decrease in CO2 emissions and absorption in Indiana outweighs the increase in emissions from the Illinois factories. Conclusion: If Illinois adds even more fossil fuel-burning factories without any mitigating actions or adoption of cleaner energy sources, it is likely that the levels of carbon dioxide will increase. However, the specific increase or decrease would depend on the balance between the additions in Illinois and the closures and new parks in Indiana."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

California lags far behind comparable states in funding legal services for the poor, a situation so dire that only 28 percent of the civil legal needs of the state's poor and lowerincome residents are being addressed. That figures translates into 2 million people without the ability to access the justice system, according to a new study by the California Commission on Access to Justice, which also found that despite increased spending, the gap between need and services remains substantial. \\"As a practical matter, in most cases there can be no access to justice without access to legal assistance,\\" said Jack Londen, past commission chair and a partner with Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco. \\"Whether we like it or not, sometimes landlords illegally evict tenants, children with disabilities are denied proper care, veterans don't get services guaranteed to them, and elderly people need legal assistance to escape the abuse of a caregiver.\\" California has the highest number of people in poverty in the nation - 6.4 million, including nearly one in five children. Half the nation's increase in poverty in the 1990s, when the number of poor jumped 30 percent, occurred in California, and nearly 25 percent of the nation's poverty increase occurred in Los Angeles County alone. Even those with jobs are suffering: 26 percent of California workers earn poverty level wages. The commission's report, \\"The Path to Equal Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" examined how the legal needs of the state's poor have changed in the last five years as well as both the shortcomings of the justice system and the improvements during that period. Despite increases in state funding to meet the legal needs of the poor, low interest rates (which have reduced the IOLTA fund), high unemployment and the present economic downturn have threatened any gains.

How do you say this sentence in English?","output":"The English translation of the Spanish sentence \\"Tire de la manilla para abrir la puerta\\" would be \\"Pull the handle to open the door\\".  Let's break it down for a better understanding of the translation: - 'Tire' is the command form of the Spanish verb 'tirar', which typically means 'to pull' or 'to throw'. In this context, since we're talking about a door handle, 'pull' is the appropriate translation.   - 'De' is a preposition that generally means 'of' or 'from'. However, in this context of an action being performed on an object, the English equivalent would be the word 'the'. - 'La manilla' refers to 'the handle'. 'Manilla' is a common term in Spanish specifically used for a door handle or knob. 'La' is a definite article in Spanish, similar to 'the' in English. - 'Para' usually means 'for' or 'to', 'in order to', it is used to indicate a purpose or an intention. - 'Abrir' is an infinitive verb in Spanish, which means 'to open'. - And finally, 'la puerta' translates to 'the door'. 'La' is the feminine definite article, 'the', and 'puerta' is the Spanish noun for 'door'. So, when you put it all together, \\"Tire de la manilla para abrir la puerta\\" translates to \\"Pull the handle to open the door\\" in English."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

He makes 599 seats unavailable. French conceptual artist Loris Gréaud will debut a film at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Aug. 16 that is only allowed to play to one audience member at a time, with the institution’s Bing Theater reconfigured for a single seat. If a viewer leaves early, the 54-minute movie will play to an empty room. Such exclusive (or nearly so) experiences can be found across Lacma this summer. Along with “Loris Gréaud: Sculpt,” the museum also features one of James Turrell ’s perpetual cells. It allows a single visitor inside a sphere to be bombarded by light. “Rain Room,” a chamber of falling water that was created by artist duo Random International, has been running at the museum since the fall and accommodates roughly 15 people at once. “Sculpt,” Mr. Gréaud’s first feature-length film, stars Willem Dafoe as a “moment collector” who gets lost in his own obsessive quest for experiences. Tickets are free of charge, released online at 9 a.m. to the first takers for that day’s four to six screenings. The artist is sending in video bootleggers to record the work and is planning free screenings in other places after the Lacma debut. “If you look at the project itself, it’s a money-losing machine—it’s an object that can’t exist today,” Mr. Gréaud said. The artist added that the movie, which is tinted red from start to finish, is scripted and features a coherent narrative. “It’s not abstract and crazy,” he said. The film’s trailer, which flickers from freakish characters to naked women in bondage to gusts of steam to Mr. Dafoe in torment, has drawn nearly 680,000 views on YouTube since May. The 37-year-old artist said that he courted Mr. Dafoe for the movie, filmed over 30 months in Italy, Vietnam, Iceland and elsewhere. One day, while Mr. Dafoe was considering whether to do the project, he suggested that the two rehearse in New York the following morning. Mr. Gréaud, who lives in a Paris suburb, raced to the airport and landed on Mr. Dafoe’s doorstep in time. Even then, Mr. Gréaud said, the actor didn’t offer an outright yes. “I think he was sort of testing me,” the artist said. Mr. Gréaud’s exhibition follows a controversial one at the Dallas Contemporary in 2015, when he hired people to smash his works in a pretend riot. What got more attention, though, was the viral moment that followed: After a female art critic disparaged the show, Mr. Gréaud sent her a series of angry Facebook messages telling her that she needed a boyfriend. The exchange caught fire online. Afterward the artist suggested that his outburst was an intentional part of the project. Lacma has been instructed not to announce the exhibit’s end date, but other events are planned for the theater in the fall.

This article: The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455  Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \\"Annunciation\\".A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \\"serpentine\\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \\"icy\\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \\"bleached by light\\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \\"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \\"startling\\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \\"unsteadying\\" and contradictory. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop?, what is it ?

I live in a dorm on campus and I chill with a few neighbors and my roommate (4F total). To be honest, I don’t really consider them true friends, but that’s because of past issues that I need to resolve. Anyway, we all decided to live on campus together next year in this great building: two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, on site mailbox, the works.  But I HATE living with my current roommate. I believe that I wouldn’t like her even if I didn’t live with her. She’s disgusting — lets her dirty gym clothes marinate on the floor, leaves our shared sink a mess despite me cleaning it EVERY night, has trash strewn over half the room (for some reason she gets the bigger half of the room??) seconds after she enters. She coughs and sneezes without covering her mouth because “she can’t help it.” She’s loud — always slamming the door shut, her walk is like a stomp in her clunky boots, her voice echoes when we’re walking together, inside and out, and then she just claims that it’s because she’s a “sociable person.” She’s rude — she interrupts people when they are talking (also the signs of a sociable person), she is such a know-it-all, especially on topics she knows nothing about (for instance, MY job), she jumps into conversations that do not include her at all, she speaks on the behalf of others who CAN speak, she believes that if something happened in her life then it automatically sets an example for everything else in the world (such as the lack of bullying in schools? Okay.). And she is so LAZY. She doesn’t help clean up unless I directly ask her, she doesn’t have a job because she is super picky about where she wants to work but complains about not having money (she claims to have applied to every position on campus but never got one, and didn’t do a single follow up). Then she cries because she feels like she is disappointing her family. And then she cries about not having a boyfriend. That’s not really lazy but you can all see why she DOES NOT have one. Basically she’s always dumping her problems on everyone else and frankly I don’t really care because they all have simple solutions.  And honestly, she’s just MEAN. She takes play fighting/teasing to a whole different level (throwing pencils and metal forks). And a bit racist.  Yet everyone expects me to share a room with her again next semester.  I can’t do it. Nope. I decided to get an apartment. BY MYSELF. I’m not risking ending up with another shit roommate. I’m willing to start working full time to avoid that. But everyone else in the group thinks that it’s just so I could have my own room (they know that I have never had my own bedroom) and that I’m being an asshole for not trying to stick it out. That I’m being an asshole because they have to risk getting shit roommates because it’s too expensive living with just two people (the other girl is joining the army, but no one thinks she’s doing wrong by “abandoning” us).

The friction will be greater between the sandpaper and the glass table or or the sandpaper and the gravel.?    Assuming that:  Rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces. A:","output":"Given your assumption that rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces, the sandpaper will have greater friction when rubbed across gravel than when it's rubbed across a glass table. The friction between two surfaces is determined by their relative roughness. Typically, the frictional force is greater when the surfaces in contact are rougher. The texture of gravel is more uneven and typically rougher compared to a glass table, which is smoother.  So, when you rub sandpaper against gravel, the tiny, rough particles of the sandpaper get into the tiny irregularities on the gravel's rough surface, causing more resistance or friction. In contrast, when sandpaper is rubbed across the glass table, the interaction surface is smoother, resulting in lower friction.  However, please note that other factors such as the pressure with which you're rubbing the sandpaper and the material properties of the sandpaper, glass, and gravel can also affect the friction. Still, fundamentally and simply based on surface roughness, the friction should be greater between sandpaper and gravel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless.

Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \\"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused.

Fiddle farm used and abundance of fertilizers and pesticides, while Park farm didn't use any of those substances.  But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone.

He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

AITA for not wanting to go on another date with them?  So me (27F) and my SO (27M) went on a double date on Saturday with his coworker (25F) and her fiancé (26M). This was our first double date with them. My first inkling that me and his coworker wouldn’t be lifelong besties was when she didn’t know who Ted Bundy was. To me, a lifelong true crime fanatic this was a bad sign for future topics of conversation.  About an hour in it dawns on me that she hasn’t asked me a single personal question about myself, while I’ve been asking her questions, laughing at her stories etc. being generally polite. She’s been talking about herself, her cats (I’m a diehard dog person) or talking to my SO about work stuff. Her fiancée at least tries to start a convo with me at this point but it’s brief.  Another hour goes by and she has finally gotten around to asking me what I do for a living. I answer and she moves onto how much she loves cruises and all the cruises they’ve been on. At this point I’m just waiting for it to end.  Fast forward to driving home with SO and I am completely honest and say that I found her self centered and didn’t see a future friendship happening. He laughed it off, said no big deal and I thought that was that. (For what it’s worth, he did agree about her being self centered and not being too interested in me)  Well, the other night my SO gets wind that his coworker is worried that I didn’t like her (this is a complete surprise to me) and because of this my SO would like to try another double date. I couldn’t hide the annoyance on my face and I could tell this hurt him a bit. His argument is that he still has to see her and doesn’t want to make things awkward at work. My argument is that I just didn’t jive with her and have very little middle ground and I didn’t see the point. I asked him if he could recall one thing she asked me about myself or my life (besides what I do) and he couldn’t come up with anything.

We know that the Celtic of September in Barcelona is not the Celtic of December in Manchester. We know that as a team they have gained confidence, if not a lot of points, in a very short space of time in Europe's pre-eminent club competition. It's obvious that they have grown up these past few months, from the spooked innocents of the Nou Camp to the mature competitors we saw at Etihad Stadium. We can't know where Celtic are going - Rodgers' budget in the transfer market and his luck in the draw should they make it back to this stage next season will have a lot to do with that - but we know something about where they have come from. Sixteen months ago, they lost 2-0 to a modest Malmo side and crashed out of the Champions League in the qualifying stage. Their world seemed to be at an end. Now they have just completed the group stage - earning in the region of £23m - and their world is infinitely brighter. Fifteen months ago they led Aberdeen 1-0 in a league match at Pittodrie before losing 2-1. Now they swat Aberdeen aside 3-0 in a cup final. Thirteen months ago they completed their double-header against Molde in the Europa League, losing 5-2 over two matches, and tried to dress it up as an unfair reflection of where they were at. It wasn't. On Tuesday, they got a fully deserved draw in a Champions League match against a Manchester City team that might have been missing many stellar names but was still put together for a total of £92m with another £129m sitting on the bench. Twelve months ago they went ahead against Motherwell at Celtic Park and lost 2-1. Now they go 2-0 down against Motherwell at Fir Park and win 4-3. Media playback is not supported on this device We can see the journey to this point very clearly. We can see the difference a good manager can make. Rodgers' calm authority, motivational excellence and tactical nous has galvanised things in a major way. He's done it quickly and with not a lot of money. His starting line-up in Manchester only contained one player that wasn't around last season - Moussa Dembele. Much has been made of Dembele's capture and there is no doubt that it's been a coup. Much has also been made of the arrival of Scott Sinclair and he, too, has been a big success. The major difference that the manager has made, though, has come not in the players he has signed but the players he has reinvented. Maybe Scott Brown, now free of injury, would be playing with the authority of old no matter who his manager was this season, but Rodgers made him a special case from day one and has love-bombed him at every turn. James Forrest was on his way out of the door at Celtic Park and has been yanked back in and restored to something approaching his best form, even if inconsistency still dogs him. Stuart Armstrong looks a different player. Tom Rogic has upped his level. Celtic now have a partnership at centre-back that is bedding in nicely. The irony of ironies here is that one of the few players who has gone backwards under Rodgers is the one who stood out under Ronny Deila. Leigh Griffiths remains in Dembele's shadow. It's easy to see why, but Griffiths has started just two games since returning from injury in September and has nine goals compared to 18 this time last season. With 12 minutes left in Manchester on Tuesday, Griffiths, a second-half substitute, had a chance to put Celtic back in front but he snatched at it and the moment passed. You wondered then would the Griffiths of last season have done more with it. This is a continuing challenge for Rodgers. Dembele is his young star, but he can't afford to let Griffiths' confidence drain away on the bench. It would be easy - and a little unfair - to deride Tuesday's game. Of course it was a dead rubber. Of course City were missing some of their biggest guns. Nine of the players who lost to Chelsea last weekend didn't play against Celtic - among them Sergio Aguero, Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva. That still left Ilkay Gundogan, Nolito, Leroy Sane and Kelechi Iheanacho as the chief attackers and Gael Clichy, Bacary Sagna, Pablo Zabaleta and Fernando as vastly experienced defensive players. Guardiola went with some youngsters but there was heaps of experience around them. What was obvious on the night was how comfortable Celtic looked, how they played without any fear, any regard for the reputations of some of those they were playing against. Weakened or not, that City team would have done damage against Celtic last season. Celtic's football has got better over the course of six games, but that couldn't have happened had their mentality not got better. They've come on a ton in that regard. They're a more robust side now. They believe in themselves more than they did before. They could have beaten City. After Patrick Roberts burst through to score the opening goal, there was a Forrest-inspired chance for Dembele, then a penalty that should have been given for a foul on Roberts, then Griffiths had a chance, then Gary Mackay-Steven had the best chance of all, just seven minutes from the end. City had opportunities as well, but it was hard to find a single soul at the game who thought they were better and deserved to win. What they were saying was that Celtic may not have won the match but they won respect. Across two contests with Guardiola's team they scored four times and went unbeaten. A new attitude has taken hold under Rodgers. The great frustration comes in the eight months they must now wait for another shot at getting back to this level. In the meantime, Rodgers and his chief executive, Peter Lawwell, have much to talk about. The manager has taken Celtic forward without having spent the earth. It only amounted to three draws from six games in the Champions League this season but consider those three points as a firm foundation for next season. Rodgers has prepared the ground. The challenge for the club is building on top of it.

Please answer the following question: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess.  Which lake will have more algae? A:","output":"Lake Mahoe Step 1: Identify the key factors affecting algae growth in this context: In this case, the key factor mentioned is the presence of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals can lead to excessive growth of water plants and algae in nearby water bodies. Step 2: Compare the proximity of the two lakes to potential sources of these chemicals: Lake Mahoe is located right next to a large farm that grows various crops and uses fertilizers and pesticides. In contrast, Lake Tresco is located near a school, which is less likely to expose it to significant amounts of these chemicals. Step 3: Analyze the potential for chemical runoff or infiltration in each lake: Due to its proximity to the farm, Lake Mahoe is more likely to experience chemical runoff from rainwater carrying fertilizers and pesticides. This can potentially lead to higher levels of dissolved nutrients in the lake, promoting the growth of algae. On the other hand, Lake Tresco, being near a school, is less likely to be exposed to such chemical runoff. Step 4: Conclusion - Lake Mahoe will likely have more algae growth because of its proximity to the large farm that uses fertilizers and pesticides.

On April 16, 1962, Cronkite succeeded Douglas Edwards as anchorman of the CBS's nightly feature newscast, tentatively renamed Walter Cronkite with the News, but later the CBS Evening News on September 2, 1963, when the show was expanded from 15 to 30 minutes, making Cronkite the anchor of American network television's first nightly half-hour news program. Cronkite's tenure as anchor of the CBS Evening News made him an icon in television news.  During the early part of his tenure anchoring the CBS Evening News, Cronkite competed against NBC's anchor team of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, who anchored the Huntley-Brinkley Report. For much of the 1960s, the Huntley-Brinkley Report had more viewers than Cronkite's broadcast. A key moment for Cronkite came during his coverage of John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. Another factor in Cronkite and CBS' ascendancy to the top of the ratings was that, as the decade progressed, RCA made a corporate decision not to fund NBC News at the levels that CBS provided for its news broadcasts. Consequently, CBS News acquired a reputation for greater accuracy and depth in coverage. This reputation meshed well with Cronkite's wire service experience, and in 1967 the CBS Evening News began to surpass The Huntley-Brinkley Report in viewership during the summer months.  In 1969, during the Apollo 11 (with co-host and former astronaut Wally Schirra) and Apollo 13 moon missions, Cronkite received the best ratings and made CBS the most-watched television network for the missions. In 1970, when Huntley retired, the CBS Evening News finally dominated the American TV news viewing audience. Although NBC finally settled on the skilled and well-respected broadcast journalist John Chancellor, Cronkite proved to be more popular and continued to be top-rated until his retirement in 1981.  One of Cronkite's trademarks was ending the CBS Evening News with the phrase \\"...And that's the way it is,\\" followed by the date. Keeping to standards of objective journalism, he omitted this phrase on nights when he ended the newscast with opinion or commentary. Beginning with January 16, 1980, Day 50 of the Iran hostage crisis, Cronkite added the length of the hostages' captivity to the show's closing in order to remind the audience of the unresolved situation, ending only on Day 444, January 20, 1981.","output":"This text is about Walter Leland Cronkite Jr., an American broadcast journalist who served as anchorman for the CBS Evening News for 19 years (1962-1981)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Neuroscience: Which regions of the brain are responsible for anxiety? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available choices: [i] no. [ii] yes.","output":"[i] no. The two questions, although they both pertain to brain functions, are asking about different emotions and sensations (pain and anxiety) which are managed by unique regions of the brain and therefore are not the same. The sensation of pain is managed by a variety of structures in the brain, each playing a unique role. For physical pain, the process usually begins with the nociceptor sensory neurons located throughout the body that sends signals to the spinal cord upon encountering a potentially damaging stimulus. These signals then get forwarded to the brain via the thalamus. Two key areas in the cerebral cortex related to the sensation of pain are the somatosensory cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. The somatosensory cortex helps in identifying the location and intensity of pain. The anterior cingulate cortex, on the other hand, is involved in the emotional response to pain. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex is involved in pain perception related to the suffering component, while the insula gives us the sensation of the unpleasantness of pain. Anxiety, however, is a more complex emotional response that involves an extensive network of brain regions known as the 'fear circuitry.' The central structure in this circuitry is the amygdala, which is involved in the detection of threat and the generation of fear responses. The prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex also play significant roles, with the former involved in decision-making processes and controlling rational thought and action, and the latter helping to mediate the body's response to stress. The hippocampus, a region critical for memory, is also involved in anxiety, particularly in relation to remembering stressful or traumatic events. In summary, while overlapping brain regions (like the anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex) are involved in both pain and anxiety, each of these emotions utilizes the brain's structures in unique ways. Hence, the regions of the brain responsible for experiencing pain are distinct from those responsible for anxiety."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: I’m here in Dubrovnik, Croatia for a team meetup. Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them. If you look closely in a few shots, you’ll see a stone pier, which is just between the Pile Gate (pronounced “peel-ay”) at the city walls and the fort.

Hypothesis: The decline of the Korean economy was beneficial since there weren't any bankruptcies. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Available options: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","output":"(3). No. The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Let's first unpack the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: The decline of the Korean economy would cause more bankruptcies, increase investors' efforts to get out of won assets into other currencies, and force the won down further. The premise suggests that if the Korean economy declines, three potential consequences are expected: increased bankruptcies, investors trying to exit from Korean won-denominated assets, and the devaluation of the won against other currencies. Hypothesis: The decline of the Korean economy was beneficial since there weren't any bankruptcies. The hypothesis states that the decline of the Korean economy was a positive occurrence because no bankruptcies were observed. This is contradictory to the premise's assertion that a decline in the Korean economy would lead to more bankruptcies. Now let's focus on whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment is a logical relationship between two statements when the truth of one statement (premise) requires or guarantees the truth of the other statement (hypothesis). In this case, the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, as the premise predicts that a declining economy will lead to more bankruptcies, while the hypothesis claims that the decline was beneficial due to the absence of bankruptcies. Since the premise and hypothesis present conflicting views on the consequences of a declining economy, it is not possible for the premise to entail the hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is option (3). No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Alex wanted to make a big, healthy breakfast, so Alex made hard-boiled eggs.

Can you tell me the answer to what part of mexico got the earthquake hit??","output":"The Mexico earthquake in discussion appears to be the one that occurred on September 19, 2017. This earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale, struck Central Mexico and caused widespread destruction, loss of lives, and damage to infrastructure. The epicenter of the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake was located in Puebla state, near the town of Raboso. From there, the shockwaves spread out, affecting numerous cities and states throughout the region. Some of the most impacted areas include: 1. Mexico City: The capital of Mexico experienced significant devastation as a result of the earthquake. Many buildings collapsed, particularly older structures, leading to the deaths of hundreds of people and the displacement of thousands more. Infrastructure and transportation systems were also disrupted, causing long-lasting effects. 2. Puebla: Being close to the earthquake's epicenter, Puebla faced severe destruction. Many buildings, including historical structures like churches, were damaged or destroyed. The region's rescue efforts were overwhelmed by the scale of the catastrophe, and a significant loss of life was reported. 3. Morelos: The state of Morelos, particularly its capital, Cuernavaca, also suffered major damage. Numerous buildings collapsed or were structurally destabilized, and essential services like electricity and water supply faced significant challenges during the aftermath. 4. State of Mexico: Situated in the greater Mexico City metropolitan area, the State of Mexico experienced substantial damage to its buildings and infrastructure. The earthquake ruptured essential systems and led to loss of lives and property. 5. Guerrero: Despite being further away from the epicenter, the state of Guerrero still felt the earthquake's effects. Damage to several buildings and some loss of life were reported in the region. The 2017 Central Mexico earthquake was a tragic reminder of the vulnerability of the region, given its high risk of seismic activity. The earthquake also occurred only a few weeks after an 8.1 magnitude quake struck the coast of Chiapas in Southern Mexico, adding to the devastation already faced by the country. It is essential that proper emergency response plans, strict building codes, and appropriate education programs are put into place to minimize the impacts of future earthquakes on the Mexican population."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

I've seen several reviewers call ISOYG an 'anti-rape' film or even a feminist statement, and I just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims. First of all, what do we see on the cover of this movie? That's right: a shapely woman's behind. Whether it was Zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and I absolutely don't believe it was - is entirely beside the point. The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic (everything but actual penetration is shown) that NO ONE but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it. The rape(s) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch. There's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes, none. There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (mere moments before he's murdered) so the scene isn't at all engaging on an emotional level. Really, it's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that it attracts only the exploitation crowd. Finally, a few reviewers have commended Zarchi's so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack. But considering how inept everything else in the film is (acting, script, etc.) I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing. I'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG. I'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties. In fact, I'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films. However, it's also poorly made and after the rape occurs, just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum, mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to roll. This is probably worth watching once if you're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but I'm telling you, the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation.

It wasn't that William lacked skills or intelligence; he certainly had his fair share of accomplishments. Still, his practical mindset and reserved nature were far better suited for handling the financial and technical aspects of their joint business venture. Step 1: Establish the main characters, Derrick and William, and their core skills. Step 2: Highlight the reason why running a business suits Derrick more than William. One fine morning, Derrick arrived at the office, noticing that their small company was growing exponentially. He realized that space was becoming an issue, threatening to hamper their progress. He promptly arranged a team meeting to discuss the matter. Step 3: Introduce a challenge for Derrick to tackle related to the management of the business. During the meeting, Derrick encouraged his team members to voice their concerns and ideas for solving the space problem. Many employees suggested renovating the office or searching for a larger space. William, meanwhile, quietly crunched the numbers and assessed the practicality of each suggestion. Step 4: Describe how Derrick and William address the problem using their respective skills. After weighing the various options, Derrick decided to move the company to a more spacious location that would not only accommodate the current employees but would also have room for future growth. With William's support in handling the financial aspects of the relocation, Derrick led the team in orchestrating a seamless move. Step 5: Showcase how the protagonists' respective strengths benefit the successful resolution of the challenge. The new office was soon buzzing with creative energy, and the employees were noticeably more motivated. Derrick's empathetic and open leadership style had allowed him to identify the needs of his team and take proactive steps to address them.

Q: With regular money now coming in from the Guardian column, my regular contributions to other publications and the modest subscription revenue from The Friday Thing, I had been living something of the high life since arriving in London. I had started hanging out with the great and the good of the dot com world: attending launch parties for new sites, going to parties to celebrate them staying in business for a whole year, eating their lunches, drinking their booze and learning their secrets while they tried to convince me to write about them in my column. Many of these online entrepreneurs had become my friends and I'd managed to find myself a new girlfriend - Maggie, a Welsh journalist who was a restaurant reviewer for a food and drink website. This was a brilliant blag: it meant we could eat at some of London's best restaurants and never pay a penny. Life was wonderful: The Friday Thing and the Guardian column meant that my plan to use the Internet to become hugely famous and successful was firmly on track, I'd made lots of new friends, and, on top of all that, I was getting laid and eating gourmet food for free. Even Sam Lewis was jealous, and he was rich. Meanwhile, the people I was writing about were not having such an easy time of it. 2003 was a really strange time to be covering the 'new media' industry - mainly because no one was really sure for how long there would be an industry left to cover. The dot com boom of 1999 seemed like a millennium ago: a period in history as crazy as the tulip craze or the South Sea Bubble look to us now. The first signs of trouble for the industry had come in 2000. As the century turned, so had the market and - to use the parlance of analysts - the boom had turned out to be a bubble. And then the bubble had burst. Question: How could the writer eat at London's best restaurants for free? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"The writer could eat at London's best restaurants for free because his girlfriend, Maggie, was a restaurant reviewer for a food and drink website.

Benjamin Ryan Tillman (August 11, 1847 - July 3, 1918) was a politician of the Democratic Party who served as Governor of South Carolina from 1890 to 1894, and a United States Senator from 1895 until his death in 1918. A white supremacist who opposed civil rights for blacks, Tillman led a paramilitary group of Red Shirts during South Carolina's violent 1876 election. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, he frequently ridiculed blacks, and boasted of having helped to kill them during that campaign. In the 1880s, Tillman, a wealthy landowner, became dissatisfied with the Democratic leadership and led a movement of white farmers calling for reform. Tillman was sworn in as governor in Columbia on December 4, 1890, before a crowd of jubilant supporters, the largest to see South Carolina's governor inaugurated since Hampton's swearing-in. In his inaugural address, Tillman celebrated his victory, \\"the citizens of this great commonwealth have for the first time in its history demanded and obtained for themselves the right to choose her Governor; and I, as the exponent and leader of the revolution which brought about the change, am here to take the solemn oath of office ... the triumph of democracy and white supremacy over mongrelism and anarchy, of civilization over barbarism, has been most complete.\\"  Tillman made it clear he was not content that African Americans were allowed even a limited role in the political life of South Carolina:  The whites have absolute control of the State government, and we intend at any and all hazards to retain it. The intelligent exercise of the right of suffrage ... is as yet beyond the capacity of the vast majority of colored men. We deny, without regard to color, that \\"all men are created equal\\"; it is not true now, and was not true when Jefferson wrote it.  The legislature, at Tillman's recommendation, reapportioned itself, costing Charleston County four of its twelve seats, and other lowcountry counties one each, with the seats going to the upcountry. Although Tillman sought to reduce public expenditures, he was not successful in doing so as his reform program required spending, and the legislature could find few savings to make. Construction of Clemson College was slowed, and subsidies for fairs were cut.  Among the matters before the new, Tillman-controlled legislature was who should fill the Senate seat held by Hampton, whose term expired in March 1891--until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. There was a call from many in the South Carolina Democratic Party to re-elect Hampton, who had played a major role in the state for the past thirty years, in war and peace. Tillman was embittered against Hampton for a number of slights, including the senator's neutrality in the race against Haskell. The legislature retired Hampton, who received only 43 of 157 votes, and sent Irby to Washington in his place. The ouster of Hampton was controversial, and remained so for decades afterwards; according to Simkins (writing in 1944), \\"to future generations of South Carolinians, Tillman's act was a ruthless violation of cherished traditions of which Hampton was a living symbol\\". Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Were the seats replaced by Republicans or Democrats?","output":"The article does not explicitly mention whether the replaced seats were occupied by Republicans or Democrats. However, it does describe how Tillman, a Democrat, and his movement led to a redistribution of seats within the South Carolina legislature. The reference to Charleston County losing four of its twelve seats and other lowcountry counties losing one seat each, with those seats going to the upcountry, indicates that the redistribution favored Tillman's Democratic faction."},{"instruction":"The young man (boy, really) played with his fingers in the garish light cast from the lone bulb in the concrete bunker.

The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\").  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world.  - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.  - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of   - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north.  - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.  - Mount Taranaki, or Mount Egmont, is an active but quiescent stratovolcano in the Taranaki region on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island. Although the mountain is more commonly referred to as Taranaki, it has two official names under the alternative names policy of the New Zealand Geographic Board. The 2518-metre-high mountain is one of the most symmetrical volcanic cones in the world. There is a secondary cone, Fanthams Peak, , on the south side. Because of its resemblance to Mount Fuji, Taranaki provided the backdrop for the movie \\"The Last Samurai\\".  - The South Taranaki Bight is a large bay that extends south and east from the south coast of Taranaki in New Zealand's North Island. With more symmetry than poetry or originality, it is matched by the North Taranaki Bight to the north of Cape Egmont.  - Makahu is a settlement in inland Taranaki , in the western North Island of New Zealand . It is located to the southeast of Strathmore . the Makahu Stream runs south through the area to join with the Mangaehu Stream , which flows into the Patea River . The name \`\` Makahu '' means \`\` White Hawk '' .  - Patea is the third-largest town in South Taranaki, New Zealand. It is on the western bank of the Patea River, 61 kilometres north-west of Whanganui on State Highway 3. Hawera is 27 km to the north-west, and Waverley 17 km to the east. The Patea River flows through the town from the north-east and into the South Taranaki Bight. For the former electorate from 1893 to 1963 see Patea.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.  - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The Patea River is in Taranaki in the North Island of New Zealand.

It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of .

The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\".  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa.

Movie plot title: The Reaping Movie plot: Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank) and colleague, Ben (Idris Elba), investigate and disprove claims of miracles. In Louisiana, Katherine receives a call from a friend, Father Michael Costigan (Stephen Rea), who says that his photographs of her have developed burn marks that when assembled, form a sickle-like symbol, a possible warning from God, which she ignores. She meets Doug Blackwell (David Morrissey), a teacher from the nearby town of Haven, who asks Katherine to find out why Haven's river has turned red. The locals believe this is a biblical plague caused by a girl, Loren McConnell (AnnaSophia Robb), who they believe killed her older brother in the river. They travel to Haven where Katherine meets Loren and has a vision of her turning the river red. Meanwhile, Ben witnesses dead frogs seemingly fall from the sky. Doug invites them to spend the night at his house, since the town doesn't have a motel. That night as they're about to eat dinner, they encounter flies and disease, which kills off local cows. Later that evening, Katherine explains to Doug at his wife's grave why she left the church; five years ago, she was an ordained minister. After a drought while doing missionary work in the Sudan with her husband and daughter, the locals sacrificed her family, believing they were the cause. Test results from the river prove it to contain human blood. The citizens meanwhile are shaving their children's hair, due to an outbreak of lice. Ben and Doug try to get the mayor to evacuate the town, but he and his staff are struck down with boils. Katherine calls Father Costigan, who explains that he has researched a Satanic cult which sacrifices every second-born to create a child with \\"the eyes of the Devil\\" to bring them power. He also states that an angel, who cannot be harmed by the cult, will destroy them. He insists that Loren is the devil child, while Katherine is the angel.

Is \\"These were completely incompatible with standard record playback preamplifiers, relying on the dbx compandor encoding/decoding scheme to greatly increase dynamic range (dbx encoded disks were recorded with the dynamic range compressed by a factor of two in dB: quiet sounds were meant to be played back at low gain and loud sounds were meant to be played back at high gain, via automatic gain control in the playback equipment; this reduced the effect of surface noise on quiet passages).\\" the correct answer?","output":"DBX encoded recordings showcased a marked advancement in audio recording technology. The primary intention of these recordings was to provide an enhanced dynamic range, reduced noise, and better overall audio quality when compared to prior technologies. Your provided statement is mostly accurate but could be made more comprehensive by clarifying the compatibility and operational aspects of DBX encoded recordings with prior technologies. Here is a more detailed and long answer: DBX encoded recordings were designed to work in tandem with specific dbx playback equipment that employed the dbx compandor encoding/decoding scheme. This system used advanced noise reduction techniques to compress dynamic range by a factor of two in decibels. By automatically adjusting gain during playback, quiet sounds were reproduced at lower gain while loud sounds were reproduced at higher gain, thus reducing the effect of surface noise on quiet passages. This provided a significant improvement in overall sound quality for vinyl records and other audio formats at the time. When it came to compatibility with prior technologies, DBX encoded recordings were not directly compatible with conventional record playback preamplifiers and non-dbx equipment. This is because they lacked the necessary decoding circuitry to accurately reproduce the expanded dynamic range of a dbx-encoded recording. Attempting to play a DBX encoded recording on a standard playback system resulted in a significant loss of audio fidelity, including an exaggerated perceived dynamic range and considerable distortion. In essence, the compatibility between DBX encoded recordings and standard playback systems was limited and required separate dbx-compatible equipment to fully enjoy the intended audio quality improvements. That being said, the benefits of DBX encoded recordings were notable for those who invested in dbx-compatible playback equipment. The increased dynamic range and reduced noise interference provided by dbx processing allowed listeners to experience a higher level of audio fidelity and immersion, particularly for vinyl records which were prone to surface noise. In conclusion, DBX encoded recordings were not directly compatible with prior technology playback systems, primarily because they required specialized dbx-compatible equipment to decode the expanded dynamic range properly. By using the dbx compandor encoding/decoding scheme, these recordings delivered a marked improvement in dynamic range and noise reduction when played on compatible systems, offering a superior listening experience compared to non-dbx recordings of the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: Egyptâs Chaotic Election Egypt’s democratic transition is in turmoil again as the country heads into next month’s crucial election for its first president since the ouster of Hosni Mubarak. Egypt’s military-run government is running out of time to guarantee a fair and credible vote. Authorities need to finalize the list of candidates and decide where polling stations will be located, whether citizens must vote at specific stations, what rules the monitors must follow and how television airtime will be apportioned among candidates. And all this information needs to be widely publicized. The parliamentary elections in February had problems but were still good enough that the Egyptians see the new legislature as legitimate. The standard should be higher for the presidential election. The presidential election commission sowed confusion and doubt when it disqualified 10 of 23 candidates for president, including Omar Suleiman, a secularist who was Mr. Mubarak’s former spy chief; Khairat el-Shater, a chief strategist of the Muslim Brotherhood; and Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, an ultraconservative Salafi preacher. All three were considered front-runners — and polarizing figures — and were ruled off the ballot on technical grounds. We don’t pretend to know all of the forces at work here. Both the military and the Islamists, who have been battling for control, lost their top candidates. But the disqualifications have fed conspiracy theories and added to doubts about the legitimacy of the entire process. So who’s left? The disqualifications were a boost for Amr Moussa, a secularist and former foreign minister, and Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a liberal Islamist reformer. They are seen as the leading candidates along with Mohamed Morsi, the Brotherhood’s current choice. The Brotherhood has the strongest organization. But Mr. Morsi is not as well known or as influential as Mr. Shater. His election would also give the Islamists control of both the presidency and Parliament, and his conservative religious vision rightly makes many Egyptians, as well as the West, uneasy. He has called for barring women and non-Muslims from the presidency on the basis of Islamic law, or Shariah, and he has made inflammatory statements about Israel, describing its citizens as “killers and vampires.” The two other leading candidates offer less ideological and more practical approaches that seek to appeal to a broad range of Egyptians. Mr. Moussa, a former Arab League secretary general with wide name recognition, has pledged to eradicate illiteracy, create jobs, attract international aid and “care for the marginalized and the weak.” His links to Mr. Mubarak could hurt him. Mr. Aboul Fotouh is charismatic and is seen as a pious man, but not an extremist. He was expelled from the Brotherhood last year for advocating a more tolerant and inclusive approach to Islam and Egypt. The military has wasted the last year, deferring decisions or making bad ones. Economic problems are particularly acute: debt is mounting; currency reserves could soon be depleted; unemployment has skyrocketed. A new constitutional assembly needs to be appointed (the court threw out the first group) to rewrite the repressive Mubarak Constitution, and Egyptians will need to approve it. The process is already causing fierce jockeying over how much power the military and the president will have. Egyptians need to know that whoever wins the presidency will bring a skilled team with a viable plan to create jobs, improve education, woo foreign investment and guarantee the rights of all Egyptians. The first step must be a credible vote. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about Egypt's elections for a new president after their old leader, Hosni Mubarak, was removed from power. The election process is very chaotic and confusing. Many people are worried if it will be fair and if the new leader will be a good person. Some candidates who were supposed to run for president were not allowed to, which made people more worried. There are still some candidates left who want to become the president, and they each have different ideas to help Egypt.

Scientists have proved that chimps perform better than human beings when it comes to this kind of problem. We may have to rethink what we believe about human memory. Memory is our ability to learn something, save it and recall it when needed. Our memories are important to our sense of self, our personalities, and our ability to understand the world. Scientists say that there are different types of memory. There is short-term memory and long-term memory. Your short-term memory saves information for a few seconds or a few minutes. For example, the time it takes to compare the prices of a few items in a store. Long-term memory involves the information you try hard to keep, because it's meaningful to you (an example is data  about family and friends. ) And then there is visual memory and sound memory. But these are not hard and fast: scientists argue a lot about the nature of memory. Scientists have also found that people memorize things in different ways. Some memorize better with the help of pictures. Others are helped more by sounds. One thing's for sure. If you can combine different kinds of memory together, you will remember a lot!

Light-filled stages can be used for numerous types of performances, not exclusively for bands playing music. 4.

Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - The Wurlitzer electric piano, trademarked the \\"Electronic Piano\\" and referred to by musicians as the \\"Wurly\\", was one of a series of electromechanical stringless pianos manufactured and marketed by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of Corinth, Mississippi, U.S. and North Tonawanda, New York. The earliest models were made in 1954 and the last model was made in 1984. Since then the Wurlitzer electric piano sound has been recreated on digital keyboards, and the vintage models are sought by musicians and collectors.  - Supertramp (known as Daddy in 196970) are an English rock band formed in London in 1969. Though their music was initially categorised as progressive rock, they later incorporated a combination of traditional rock, pop and art rock into their music.

Davies is the only member of Supertramp to have been with the group for their entire history, and has composed some of their most well-known songs, including \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", \\"Bloody Well Right\\", \\"My Kind of Lady\\", and \\"Cannonball\\". He is generally noted for his sophisticated blues and jazz-influenced progressive rock compositions and cynical lyrics.  - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.  - Keith Baker ( born 14 April 1948 ) is a drummer , best known for a brief stint with Uriah Heep . He played for Bakerloo , but left the group following the release of its only album . He subsequently became the first drummer of Supertramp ( then called Daddy ) between late 1969 and early 1970 . Baker joined Uriah Heep prior to their second album Salisbury , replacing Nigel Olsson . He recorded the album with the group , but left when he did not want to tour extensively with the band and was replaced by Ian Clarke .  - Charles Roger Pomfret Hodgson (born 21 March 1950) is an English musician, singer and songwriter, best known as the former co-frontman and founding member of progressive rock band Supertramp.  - Sir Elton Hercules John, (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is an English singer, pianist, and composer.

Passage: In Ireland, private schools (Irish: scoil phríobháideach) are unusual because a certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State. If the school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees, which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world. There is, however, a limited element of state assessment of private schools, because of the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education; Irish private schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate, for example. Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools. The average fee is around €5,000 annually for most schools, but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to €25,000 per year. The fee-paying schools are usually run by a religious order, i.e., the Society of Jesus or Congregation of Christian Brothers, etc. Question: What is the Irish term for school fees?","output":"Part #1: Identify the passage and the question.

His father, Otto Anderson (1903-1984) was a farmer; and his mother, Audrey Volenne (nee Speer; 1906-1969) was an opera singer and concert pianist who was forced to abandon her own Hollywood dreams to care for her family. Following her example, West stated to his father as a youth that he intended to go to Hollywood after his completion of school. He moved to Seattle with his mother when he was 15, following his parents' divorce. West often reprised his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, first in the short-lived animated series The New Adventures of Batman, and in other shows such as The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour, Tarzan and the Super 7, Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show, and The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians (succeeding Olan Soule in the role). In 1979, West once again donned the Batsuit for the live-action TV special Legends of the Superheroes. In 1985, DC Comics named West as one of the honorees in the company's 50th-anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great for his work on the Batman series.  West was considered to play Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne's father, in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. Originally, he wanted to play Batman. West never appeared in any of the theatrically released post-1960s Batman franchise motion pictures and, to date, neither has Burt Ward (Robin, from the TV series). West made an appearance in a 1992 episode of Batman: The Animated Series on Fox, but not as Batman (as the role of Batman was already being played by Kevin Conroy). Instead, he portrayed Simon Trent, a washed-up actor who used to play a superhero in a TV series called The Gray Ghost and who now has difficulty finding work. West later had a recurring role as the voice of Mayor Grange in the WB animated series The Batman.  The actor vocally reprised his role as Batman for the CGI-animated short film Batman: New Times. He co-starred with Mark Hamill, who vocally portrayed The Joker and had originally played the role on Batman: The Animated Series. West also voiced Thomas Wayne in an episode of the cartoon series Batman: The Brave and the Bold. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did he do after that series?","output":"After the Batman series, Adam West continued to act as Batman/Bruce Wayne in different animated shows and specials, like The New Adventures of Batman, The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour, Tarzan and the Super 7, Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show, The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians, and Legends of the Superheroes.

Murray Abraham) attempting to study a new species of primate, possibly the missing link between humanity and the great ape, found in a hidden valley deep within the jungles of Thailand. The movie opens into action with Hamilton's initial research team trying to capture one of these new (and very large) primates, but fails and is apparently wiped out. Hamilton and his assistant Chenne (Prapimporn Karnchanda) survive and scour the camp site looking for clues and remains of their team. Meanwhile, another research team is inbound, this one a motley crew of incredibly naive college anthropology students with no idea of what they're in for. The students Seth, Amy, Greg, Sydney, Josh, and Dani are flown into a remote region of the Thai jungle, and picked up by a guide who drives them deeper into bush. He drops them off in a panic at the edge of trail/road, which leads further still into the foliage, claiming \\"bad things\\" are in there and won't go any further. He high-tails it back the way he came, leaving the students to march forth into the unknown. They walk until they reach the end of trail and set up camp. As evening sets in, noises from the jungle raise suspicion until a set of glowing green eyes can be seen close by, watching. Just before the unknown creature attacks, Chenne arrives with a flare that scares off the unseen menace. Chenne escorts the students to the relative safety of Professor Hamilton's camp, and the following day they meet the obsessed man and learn of his mission and their purpose...sort of. Hamilton professes of dream findings in a uncharted region of the jungle and their potential for career-launching documentation. He has Chenne confiscate their mobile phones and hands out information bracelets for each member, which contain all of their emergency contact info, and promptly leads the slightly unwilling team to the valley entrance.

Answer:","output":"The Kollegienkirche, located in Salzburg, Austria, is a remarkable architectural masterpiece and an important historical venue for classical music. This baroque church, also known as the University Church, was built between 1694 and 1707 by the renowned architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. Kollegienkirche is inextricably linked to the Salzburg Festival, an internationally renowned event that celebrates classical music, opera, and theater on a grand scale. The Salzburg Festival was first established in 1920, with the objective of fostering and promoting the rich cultural heritage of Salzburg and Austria. The festival was founded by a group of intellectuals, artists, and politicians, including Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Max Reinhardt, Richard Strauss, and Franz Schalk. These visionaries saw the potential in Salzburg as a prime location for an annual cultural celebration, not only because of its picturesque beauty, but also due to the city's strong historical connection with music, including being the birthplace of the iconic composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Since its inception, the Salzburg Festival has grown to become one of the most prominent and prestigious events in the world of classical music. Each year, it attracts thousands of visitors and performers from all corners of the globe. The festival takes place over a span of several weeks in the summer, and it features a diverse program that includes operas, symphonic concerts, chamber music, solo recitals, and theatrical performances. Kollegienkirche, with its magnificent baroque architecture and exceptional acoustics, has been serving as one of the prominent venues of the Salzburg Festival since its founding year in 1920. Over the years, it has hosted numerous concerts featuring both established and emerging musicians, orchestras, and ensembles. The church's elegant and spacious interior is particularly well-suited for the presentation of sacred music, and it provides a fitting backdrop to this evocative genre. In conclusion, the Salzburg Festival, which takes place annually in the heart of Austria's historic city of Salzburg, was first established in 1920. Kollegienkirche, with its beautiful baroque architecture and exceptional acoustics, has been an integral part of the festival since its inception, hosting a variety of musical performances, concerts, and recitals as a prominent venue. As the legacy of the Salzburg Festival endures and continues to evolve, Kollegienkirche remains a symbol of the city's unwavering commitment to the celebration, preservation, and innovation of classical music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The ancient Olympic Games were held in a sacred valley at Olympia at western Greece. The earliest records of the Games go back to 776 B.C.. These contests were held every four years. They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics. Finally, Emperor Theodosius of Rome decided that the Olympics were a public danger. He died away with them after the Games of A.D. 392. They had lasted over 1,000 years. Fifteen hundred years passed. Then, in the 1890's, Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France began to interest nations in bringing the Games back. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. They have been held every four years since then, except during the two world wars. The passage is mainly about  _  .

If \\"Friends sitting in the rocks for photo.\\", does this mean that \\"friends are seated down\\"?","output":"To determine if \\"Friends sitting in the rocks for photo.\\" means that friends are seated down, let's analyze the sentence step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the main components of the sentence. The main components of the sentence are: - Friends - Sitting in the rocks - For photo Step 2: Interpret the meaning of the components. - \\"Friends\\" refers to a group of people who share a bond or relationship. - \\"Sitting in the rocks\\" suggests that the group of friends are positioned among rocks. - In the context of photography, \\"sitting\\" is often associated with being seated down or having a lowered posture. - \\"For a photo\\" implies that the friends are posing for a picture. Step 3: Combine the meanings of the components. When we combine the meanings of the components, we get a clearer picture of the scene: a group of friends are positioned among rocks with a lowered posture or seated-down pose for the purpose of taking a photo. Conclusion: Based on the steps and interpretations above, we can conclude that the sentence \\"Friends sitting in the rocks for a photo.\\" does mean that the friends are seated down or at least in a lowered posture for the purpose of taking a photo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the below context:  Markham had hoped for a fully-fledged Royal Naval expedition, but was warned by the Admiralty that \\"the present exigencies of the Naval Service [would] prevent them from lending officers...\\" However, the Admiralty agreed to release Scott and Charles Royds, and later allowed Michael Barne and Reginald Skelton to join the expedition. The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson–Harmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894–97, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, stores and provisions, and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew's voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act.The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory's successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition. The only scientist with previous Antarctic experience was Louis Bernacchi, who had been with Borchgrevink as magnetic observer and meteorologist. The geologist, Hartley Ferrar, was a 22-year-old recent Cambridge graduate who Markham thought \\"might be made into a man.\\" Marine biologist Thomas Vere Hodgson, from Plymouth Museum, was a more mature figure, as was the senior of the two doctors, Reginald Koettlitz, who, at 39, was the oldest member of the expedition.

Context: Many of the migrants from China in the 19th century came to work on the pepper and Uncaria gambir plantations, with 11,000 Chinese immigrants recorded in one year. Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended. By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians. The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871, and the people were grouped into 33 racial, ethnic or national categories, with Chinese forming the largest group at 57.6%. Censuses were then conducted at 10 year intervals afterwards. The 1881 census grouped the people into 6 main categories, and further subdivided into 47 sub-categories. The 6 broad groups were given as Europeans, Eurasians, Malays, Chinese, Indians and Others in 1921. The Malays group includes other natives of the Malay archipelago, the Europeans include Americans, the Indians would be people from the Indian subcontinent including what would now be Pakistan and Bangladesh. In 1901, the total population of Singapore was 228,555, with 15.8% Malays, 71.8% Chinese, 7.8% Indians, and 3.5% Europeans and Eurasians. The Chinese population figure of Singapore has stayed at over 70% of the total since, reaching 77.8% in 1947. After dropping from a peak of 60% in the early years of Singapore, the Malay population would range between 11 and 16% in the first half of the 20th century, while Indians hovered between 7 and just over 9% in the same period. Question: How many percent were not Indians in 1901? Answer:","output":"To find the percentage of the population in 1901 that were not Indians, we can subtract the Indian population percentage from the total population percentage. Total population = 100% Indian population in 1901 = 7.8% Non-Indian population in 1901 = Total population - Indian population Non-Indian population in 1901 = 100% - 7.8% = 92.2% Answer: 92.2% of the population in 1901 were not Indians."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you’d like to possibly have a relationship with her, you need to get closer to her by being her friend first. Try eating lunch with her and other people so you spend time with her in a group setting. Offer to help her out with a project or just be a listening ear if she needs one. Become friends with her friends, too. If you want to have a relationship with her, you will need to have a good relationship with everyone in her life. As you get closer to her, try a little playful flirting to see if she’s at all interested in you. Try complimenting her appearance or even teasing her a little bit to engage with her. If you’re going to have a romantic relationship with her, it’s important to have romantic chemistry.  Compliment her when she does something different with her appearance. If she gets a new haircut, say, “Your hair looks great!” If she giggles and flirts back or initiates her own flirting, it could be the start of a romantic relationship. If she becomes despondent or upset when you try to flirt with her, it may be a sign that it just isn’t meant to be. But you can only find out if you try! If you’ve gotten closer to her, you can ask her for her phone number so you can communicate with her there. Texting is a great way of talking to her casually. You can ask her about her day, or make plans to meet up without the pressure of an in-person conversation.  Text her something like, “Hey, I’m super bored, what are you up to?” She may respond saying that she wants to meet up or she may start a text conversation with you. Don’t blow up her phone with a bunch of texts and don’t get angry if she takes a long time to respond to your texts or doesn’t respond at all. You can learn a lot about her life, interests, and hobbies from her social media accounts. Add her as a friend on Facebook so you’re connected there and can send messages and comments. If she has an Instagram account, go and follow her profile so you can like her posts.  Connecting on social media also gives her a chance to learn more about you and your life. Like and comment on her posts, but don’t overdo it. If you go and like every post from the past 6 weeks, it could make you look creepy. Memes are a great way to make her laugh and show her that you understand her sense of humor as well. You can text memes to her or tag or share them via social media so she sees them there. Try making your own memes that include inside jokes between you and her. Whatever you do, don’t be too pushy and constantly laud her with praise and questions. Give her her space and if she likes you back, she will let you know. The last thing you want to do is drive her away by creeping her out or even scaring her by being too clingy.  If she tells you that she needs space, say something like, “No problem, I understand. It wasn’t my intention.” Never follow her around or approach her against her will. It’s rude, inappropriate, creepy, and grounds for a restraining order.","output":"This article is about how to build a good relationship with a girl you like, starting with becoming her friend, spending time with her, and then flirting playfully to find out if she is interested in you romantically.

Nevsky acts like a body builder and he isn't all that attractive, in fact, IMO, he is UGLY. ( his acting skills lack everything! ) Sascha is played very well by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character needed to be developed. There are way too many men in this story, there is zero romance, too much action, and way too dumb of an ending. It is very violent. I did however love the scenery, this movie takes you all over the world, and that is a bonus. I also liked how it had some stuff about the mafia in it, not too much or too little, but enough that it got my attention. The actors needed to be more handsome...The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was just too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most guys, Sascha will be hot enough, but for us ladies that are fans of action, Nevsky just doesn't cut it. Overall, this movie was fine, I didn't love it nor did I hate it, just found it to be another normal action flick. Now, what is this review like? Pick your answer from: a. negative b. positive","output":"This review is a mix of both positive and negative elements. The reviewer acknowledges some good aspects of the movie, such as the interesting plot and action sequences, the acting of Joanna Pacula, and the global scenery. This indicates that the reviewer found some value in the film, which can be interpreted as a positive aspect of the review. The mention of the mafia subplot capturing their attention also contributes to the positive side. On the other hand, there is a significant amount of criticism present in the review. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the lead actor, Nevsky, claiming that he is unattractive and lacks acting skills. They also point out several flaws, such as too many male characters, a lack of romance, excessive action, and a disappointing ending. Moreover, the reviewer wishes that the actors were more attractive, and the movie was more appealing to female action fans. These criticisms contribute to the negative elements found in the review. Overall, the review is a balance between positive and negative aspects, with the conclusion that the movie is just a typical action flick.

In 1993 Dangers relocated from England to San Francisco, resulting in Stephens' departure from the band. At this time, Nothing Records was founded as an imprint of Interscope with the purpose of signing industrial and electronic bands to capitalize on the recent success of Nine Inch Nails. Nothing, helmed by Trent Reznor, signed Meat Beat Manifesto and in 1996 the double album Subliminal Sandwich was released. While this album represented MBM's major-label debut, it failed to achieve the critical and commercial successes of previous releases. The album is notable for the last appearance of Jonny Stephens who contributed guitar on the track Asbestos Lead Asbestos. After Subliminal Sandwich, Dangers put together an album called Original Fire that collected various studio rarities, B-sides, and fan favorites from the early years of MBM, in addition to some new remixes of the material. Also in 1996, the group contributed to the AIDS benefit album Offbeat: A Red Hot Soundtrip produced by the Red Hot Organization.  In 1997 Dangers recruited drummer Lynn Farmer and multi-instrumentalist John Wilson (MBM member 1995-1998 former Supreme Love Gods) to record and release Actual Sounds + Voices in 1998, which found the group's earlier flirtations with jazz fusion featured more prominently; the record included appearances by saxophonist Bennie Maupin. The album yielded the single \\"Prime Audio Soup\\" which was featured in the film The Matrix. While Jon Wilson left the band prior to the 1998-1999 tour, Farmer remains with the band as of Spring 2007. Wilson was replaced by former Consolidated programmer Mark Pistel, who also remains a contributing member.  During these years, Dangers contributed a pair of remixes to high-profile Nine Inch Nails releases Closer to God and The Perfect Drug.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Hatfield was born in Wiscasset, Maine, the daughter of Philip M. Hatfield, a radiologist, and Julie Hatfield, a former Boston Globe features, society, travel writer, and fashion critic who currently works as a freelance travel writer. Hatfield grew up in the Boston suburb of Duxbury. Although well known for the early 1990s hit, \\"My Sister\\", Hatfield has two brothers, but no sisters. Hatfield's father claimed his family were descendants of the West Virginia Hatfields of the Hatfield-McCoy feud following the Civil War. In 1995, following the success of Become What You Are she released her follow-up album, Only Everything, in which she \\"turned up the volume and the distortion and had a lot of fun\\". One reviewer describes it as \\"a fun, engaging pop album\\". The album spawned another alternative radio hit for Hatfield in \\"Universal Heartbeat\\". The video featured Hatfield as an overly demanding aerobics instructor. Prior to the tour for Only Everything, Hatfield released Phillips and brought on Jason Sutter (American Hi-Fi, Chris Cornell, Jack Drag), as well as Ed Slanker (Thudpucker, Tinsel) on 2nd guitar, and Lisa Mednick on keyboards. Two weeks into the tour, Hatfield canceled the tour, which her publicist explained as due to \\"nervous exhaustion,\\" and took a month-long break.  In her memoir, Hatfield writes that in truth she was suffering from depression severe enough to the point of being suicidal. Hatfield disagreed with the decision not to be upfront about her depression. The drummer was, once again, replaced, this time by Phillips, and touring resumed with Jeff Buckley as the opening act.  In 1996, she traveled to Woodstock, New York where she recorded tracks for God's Foot, which was to be her fourth solo album (third if not counting Become What You Are, which was recorded with the Juliana Hatfield Three), intended for 1997 release. After three failed attempts to satisfy requests from Atlantic Records to come up with a \\"single\\" that the label could release, Juliana requested she be released from her contract. The label obliged, but kept the rights to the songs produced during these sessions (Atlantic had reportedly paid 180,000 to that point on the recordings). Two tracks - \\"Mountains of Love\\" and \\"Fade Away\\" - were eventually released on a greatest hits collection entitled Gold Stars, while still another, \\"Can't Kill Myself,\\" was available for download from Hatfield's official website. The remaining tracks have surfaced only as substandard bootleg versions (which do not meet Hatfield's approval) and she has rarely featured them in her subsequent live performances.  In 1997 Hatfield toured with the first Lilith Fair, a prominent all-female rock festival founded by singer Sarah McLachlan. Entity:","output":"The text is about Juliana Hatfield, an American musician and singer-songwriter from the Boston area. She is best known for her 1990s hits, particularly \\"My Sister\\".

Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Având în vedere afluxul de refugiați din Africa de Nord și incertitudinea din regiune, apelăm la politici comunitare suplimentare și nu dorim re-naționalizarea. Translate to English","output":"Taking into account the influx of refugees from North Africa and the uncertainty in the region, we call for additional community policies and do not wish for re-nationalization. Given the rising number of refugees arriving from North Africa, coupled with the prevailing uncertainty in the region, it is imperative to address this humanitarian crisis through a collaborative approach. Additional community policies can be implemented to alleviate the challenges faced by both the refugees and the countries they seek asylum in. Re-nationalization, on the other hand, refers to the process of returning assets or resources, such as industries and services, to national ownership after being privatized or operated under a foreign government. In this context, the re-nationalization of policies may imply the abandonment of a unified response to the refugee crisis in favor of each country implementing its own strategy. However, such a move could risk exacerbating the crisis and hindering the formation of a comprehensive solution. There are several reasons why advocating for additional community policies is the preferred course of action: 1. Resource sharing: Additional community policies can foster the sharing of resources and responsibilities among member countries, reducing the burden on individual nations and ensuring a more equitable distribution of support for the refugees. 2. Coordinated response: A unified approach ensures that countries work together in a coordinated manner, improving the efficiency of the response to the crisis. This includes pooling data, expertise, and capabilities to create effective strategies and execute them in a timely and organized manner. 3. Promoting integration: Implementing community policies can provide a platform for member countries to develop programs that promote the social and economic integration of refugees. 4. Enhancing regional stability: By addressing the reasons behind the influx of refugees, additional community policies can contribute to achieving long-term stability and increased security in the region, mitigating the risk of potential conflicts and tensions. In conclusion, additional community policies are crucial in tackling the refugee crisis arising from the uncertain situation in North Africa. Pursuing a unified and coordinated strategy not only eases the pressure on individual countries but also ensures a more efficient, fair, and humane response to the humanitarian challenges faced by the refugees."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"As early as 939 A.D, Taira no Masakado threatened the authority of the central government, leading an uprising in the eastern province of Hitachi, and almost simultaneously, Fujiwara no Sumitomo rebelled in the west.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Who threatened the authority of Japan's central government?\\"","output":"While the statement \\"As early as 939 A.D, Taira no Masakado threatened the authority of the central government, leading an uprising in the eastern province of Hitachi, and almost simultaneously, Fujiwara no Sumitomo rebelled in the west.\\" provides valid information, it can be improved further to provide a more comprehensive and detailed answer to the question \\"Who threatened the authority of Japan's central government?\\" Consider the following revised answer: Several individuals and groups have posed threats to the authority of Japan's central government throughout history. Two notable examples from the Heian period include Taira no Masakado and Fujiwara no Sumitomo.  Taira no Masakado was a powerful samurai and regional leader who challenged the central government in 939 A.D. Born into the Taira clan, a prominent family serving the Imperial Court, Masakado's rebellion in the eastern province of Hitachi notably jeopardized Japan's imperial administration. He was able to temporarily establish an autonomous state after claiming the title of \\"New Emperor.\\" However, his reign was short-lived as he was eventually defeated and killed by forces loyal to the central government in 940 A.D. Fujiwara no Sumitomo, on the other hand, was an influential pirate leader who rebelled against the central government almost simultaneously with Taira no Masakado. As a member of the powerful Fujiwara clan, which held significant influence over the Imperial Court, Sumitomo's revolt held considerable weight. He led several uprisings from 939 to 941 A.D., aimed at destabilizing the central authority in western Japan. Despite his best efforts, he was eventually captured and executed in 941 A.D. While these historical figures threatened the authority of Japan's central government in the Heian period, it is important to recognize that tensions between central and regional authorities persisted throughout Japanese history, as different clans and factions jostled for dominance. These power struggles have shaped Japan's political landscape, influencing the emergence of feudalism and the eventual rise of powerful shogunates, such as the Kamakura, Muromachi, and Tokugawa shogunates. Each of these eras was marked by various internal conflicts and rebellions, further illustrating the challenges posed by competing factions and their impact on Japan's central government."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.  I am facing a new situation today: Two different rivers were stocked with adult fish. Red river had a lower fish population because the fish had hardly reproduced naturally. Black river had doubled it's fish population in two years because they reproduced naturally.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which of the two rivers had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information, fish lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body, with the majority of species having eggs develop outside the mother's body and fertilization taking place outside as well. However, the information provided in the new situation does not specify the exact species of fish in Red and Black rivers, nor does it provide details about their reproductive methods. To answer the question accurately, we would need to determine the reproductive habits of the specific fish species in both rivers. If it is the same species in both rivers, we can infer that their reproductive methods are likely the same, so egg-laying outside of the body might not be the primary reason for the difference in population growth. Other factors, such as environmental conditions or availability of prey, could have contributed to the population increase in Black river.

Q: Question: Who won the award that Gesicki was a finalist for? Passage:Following coach James Franklin, Rahne spent the 2014 and 2015 seasons as the Penn State Nittany Lions quarterbacks coach. Working with quarterback Christian Hackenberg, Rahne helped him break all of the Nittany Lions major career passing records. Hackenberg finished his career with 693 completions, 8,457 passing yards, 48 touchdown passes, 9 career 300-yard passing games, and 21 200-yard passing games. After the final game of the 2015 regular season, John Donovan was fired as Penn States offensive coordinator, and replaced by Rahne as the interim to coach the TaxSlayer Bowl. During preparation for the bowl game, it was announced that ex-Fordham Head coach, Joe Moorhead would be taking over as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the 2016 season. Rahne took over as tight ends coach, a position that was previously held by Donovan. In this role Rahne mentored Mackey Award finalist Mike Gesicki as he broke the Penn State career record for receptions (123), receiving yards (1,419) and touchdowns (15) by a tight end. Gesicki was selected first-team All-Big Ten in 2017 and second team in 2016. Gesicki set single-season records at Penn State for receptions (51), receiving yards (679) and touchdown catches (9) by a tight end. On December 1, 2017, Rahne was named Penn States offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach after Joe Moorhead left the Nittany Lions to become the head coach at Mississippi State. In his first game as a full-time offensive coordinator, Rahne led Penn State's offense to a Fiesta Bowl record 545 yards of total offense in a 35-28 win over Washington.

Пилетт, Андре Which language is this?","output":"The name \\"Пилетт, Андре\\" is written in the Cyrillic script, and it is a transliteration of \\"Pilett, Andre\\" in the Russian language. The Cyrillic script is used in many languages, primarily Slavic, such as Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Serbian, and Macedonian, as well as many non-Slavic languages like Kazakh, Tajik, and Kyrgyz. To give a bit of context, the Cyrillic script was developed in the 9th century, during the reign of the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I the Great. It was created by two Byzantine missionaries, brothers Cyril and Methodius, who were born in Thessaloniki, Greece. The script was based on the Greek uncial script, with the addition of new letters for sounds not present in the Greek language. The goal of creating the Cyrillic script was to translate religious texts and spread Christianity among the Slavic peoples. Throughout its history, the Cyrillic script has undergone several modifications, mainly influenced by the evolution of the languages that use it and the historical events in the regions they were spoken. The Russian Revolution in 1917 led to the Bolshevik government reforming the script, simplifying several letters and removing others that were considered redundant or used only in specific dialects. As a result, the modern Russian alphabet has 33 letters. In the case of \\"Пилетт, Андре,\\" it is a name written in Russian Cyrillic. If we transcribe it back to the Latin alphabet, it becomes \\"Pilett, Andre.\\" It's most likely a name of a person, with \\"Pilett\\" being the last name, and \\"Andre\\" being the first name, similar to the English equivalent \\"Andre Pilett.\\" \\"Andre\\" is a given name, commonly used in French-speaking countries. It is derived from the Greek name Andreas, which means \\"manly\\" or \\"brave.\\" The last name \\"Pilett\\" could be of French origin as well. While I identified this as Russian, it's essential to mention that since the name appears to be non-Slavic by origin, it could be written similarly in other languages that use the Cyrillic script.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the precise geographic name of the pole Nansen and Johansen left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges to make for? , can you please find it?   Nansen's Fram expedition of 1893–96 was an attempt by the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen to reach the geographical North Pole by harnessing the natural east–west current of the Arctic Ocean. In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole.  Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean. The idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole. Nansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work. Fram's drift and Nansen's sledge journey proved conclusively that there were no significant land...

Common ingredients used in antipasti include olives, cured meats like prosciutto and salami, various types of cheeses, marinated vegetables such as artichokes and peppers, seafood like anchovies and shrimp, and bruschetta topped with garlic, tomatoes, or other local ingredients. Different regions of Italy have their unique versions of antipasti, reflecting the diverse culinary traditions of the country. For example, in the northern region of Lombardy, one may find bresaola (air-dried, salted beef) on a platter of antipasti; while in the southern region of Campania, the platter might feature seafood like marinated anchovies. Antipasti can be served on individual plates, but they are often presented on large, shared platters or trays that encourage communal dining and conversation. Transporting diners to a lively Italian setting, the experience of sharing and relishing a delicious assortment of antipasti ignites a unique joy and sets the stage for a memorable Italian meal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of the French from Egypt (1799), the capture of Java from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of Penang Island (1786), Singapore (1819) and Malacca (1824), and the defeat of Burma (1826).From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitt's India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired. The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline. The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India. India became the empire's most valuable possession, \\"the Jewel in the Crown\\", and was the... Answer:","output":"The East India Company was dissolved by the British government following the Indian Rebellion in 1857. The conflict and the subsequent suppression prompted the British government to assume direct control over India, leading to the dissolution of the Company in 1858. The transition was formalized by the Government of India Act 1858, which established the British Raj, a system whereby an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When you're first learning how to latch hook, it's best to keep things simple. Try following a template for your first few project to get an idea of how the yarn looks on the canvas. From there, you can move on to freehand shapes like lines and circles a shot. As you improve, you'll learn to produce more complex patterns and contours and begin producing your own unique designs. These could be anything from formless swaths of color to distinct patterns like stripes, spirals, waves, and rainbows. Advanced latch hookers have even been known to weave detailed portraits and scenes.  Don't be afraid to be abstract—experiment with yarn placement and weave whatever patterns your eye suggests. It can be helpful to think of the canvas squares as a guide for forming precise edges and curves, similar to drafting paper. Rather than spending hours cutting the yarn to size before you make a single knot, wait until your design comes together, then snip the strands wherever you want them to be shorter. Touching up your work after the fact will offer you more control, as it allows you to make just as much of an adjustment as you need instead of being forced to guess at the right length. Trimming the strands to different lengths can lend added texture and dimension to your finished project. Wrapping, threading, and knotting one strand after another can take all day. By doubling up your yarn, you also stand to double your speed. Line up two separate pieces of the same length, then knot them as you ordinarily would, being careful not to let the two strands overlap in the process.  Since you'll have an extra strand to deal with, you'll need to work carefully to avoid mistakes. This method can be especially useful when you're covering a large area with a single color. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article provides tips and guidance for beginners learning how to latch hook. It suggests starting with simple templates and progressing to freehand shapes and complex patterns as skills improve. It encourages experimentation, offers practical advice on cutting and trimming yarn, and recommends doubling up yarn for increased efficiency.

Choices:  - laziness - feel better - laying down - relaxation - falling asleep  The rationale to choose \\"falling asleep\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Falling asleep is likely the most appropriate answer among the given choices, as it highlights a natural process that occurs when our body is at rest and our eyes are closed. The process of falling asleep involves a combination of several factors, including the physiology of the human body, the need for restorative rest, and the external environment. Here is a detailed rationale for choosing falling asleep over the other options: 1. Laziness: Although laziness may cause some people to rest with their eyes closed, it does not encompass the entire population and fails to consider the biological need for sleep. Laziness is typically associated with a lack of motivation, energy, or interest. This state may lead individuals to opt for a horizontal position, but it does not explain the natural functions involved in sleep, such as the release of certain hormones, slowing down of brain activity, and other physiological changes. 2. Feel better: While it is true that individuals might close their eyes to feel better or to relieve themselves from stress, the choice does not explicitly delve into the actual process of sleep and the role it plays in how we function daily. Closing one's eyes or lying down may promote a sense of calmness and relaxation, but it might not always result in falling asleep. 3. Laying down: Laying down is merely a position that people often assume while resting, and does not necessarily indicate that they are falling asleep. People lay down for various reasons, ranging from relaxation during leisure hours to recovering from an injury. It is a comfortable position that allows for a more even distribution of body weight, but it does not fully explain the complex processes involved when one's eyes are closed and they drift off to sleep. 4. Relaxation: Relaxation is a state where the body and mind are at ease, and stress is reduced, but this does not necessarily imply that the person is falling asleep. While closing one's eyes and laying down may induce relaxation and promote feelings of comfort, the transition to actual sleep involves a series of physiological changes that go beyond mere relaxation. Overall, falling asleep best encapsulates the various stages, physiological changes, and functions of sleep that are not captured by the other choices. Assuming a relaxed position with closed eyes might be comforting for some individuals and may even alleviate stress temporarily, but the complex process of falling asleep is more than just a response to laziness, seeking comfort, laying down, or finding relaxation. As a natural biological function, sleep is essential for the maintenance of physical and mental health, enabling the body to repair and regenerate itself and allowing the mind to process experiences and information in a more efficient manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Secret filming by the BBC's Panorama programme this month showed vulnerable residents being pinned down, slapped, doused in water and taunted. An e-mail from the hospital manager last November said \\"five Safeguarding concerns\\" appeared to have arisen. It is thought this may refer to concerns raised with the council's Safeguarding Vulnerable Adults panel. The e-mail, sent by the manager to support workers and nurses and seen by the BBC, said patients had complained of ill treatment. It said they had allegedly been teased, forced to swallow medication, threatened, restrained when it was not warranted, and called nicknames which other patients then used. The e-mail read: \\"My worry is that these may be happening and some of you do not feel comfortable to challenge what you see. \\"I have always said (you have it now again in black and white) I do not condone ANY practice that is less than bespoke for this type of service.\\" \\"Safeguarding concerns\\" would normally refer to matters referred to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Adults panel at the local authority - South Gloucestershire Council. The leader of the council's Labour group, Councillor Andy Perkins, told the BBC he was really surprised he had not been told about any concerns when he presided over the social services committee last November. The private home, which is taxpayer-funded, is to be investigated by the Care Quality Commission. On Wednesday, Labour health spokeswoman Baroness Thornton added her voice to calls for a public inquiry into the alleged abuse. Speaking in the House of Lords during an urgent question on the subject, she told peers she wanted a wide-ranging, independent review to \\"shine a light\\" on events and allow lessons to be learned. Police this week arrested two women, aged 22 and 21, and three men, aged 58, 40 and 28. Last week, a woman and three men were arrested and all nine have been released on police bail. Hospital owner Castlebeck has apologised and suspended 13 employees - including the manager who wrote the e-mail. The patients filmed by Panorama have been moved to safety.

Premise: \\"If grade budgets are such a good idea, why don't we have them?\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Grade budgets are not offered in our area.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"If grade budgets are such a good idea, why don't we have them?\\" is true, it implies that there is a general belief that grade budgets are beneficial. However, the mere fact that they are not implemented in a particular area does not directly entail the hypothesis \\"Grade budgets are not offered in our area.\\" The relationship between the premise's validity and the conclusion that grade budgets are not offered in our area can be examined through various factors. First, it is essential to understand the concept of grade budgets. Grade budgets refer to a system in which students are given a specific amount of points or grade currency to allocate across their assignments and exams during a course. The idea behind grade budgets is to provide students with more control over their learning and assessment, allowing them to focus on their strengths and individual learning styles. Advocates of grade budgets argue that they promote personal responsibility, reduce the pressure associated with high-stakes exams, and foster autonomy. Now, if the premise is true and grade budgets are indeed effective educational tools, their absence in a particular region could be a result of several reasons: 1. Lack of awareness: It is possible that the education policymakers and administrators are not aware of the potential benefits of grade budgets. As a result, they would not have considered implementing the system in the first place. This could be because grade budgets are a relatively new concept, or the idea has not reached that geographical area yet. 2. Resistance to change: In some cases, even when the education authorities are aware of grade budgets, they may be hesitant to implement them due to resistance to change. Transitioning to a new grading system necessarily requires adjustments, both for educators and students. There could be concerns about the need for re-training of teachers, potential initial confusion for students, or the fear of unintended consequences. 3. Financial constraints: Implementing a new grading system like grade budgets might involve additional expenses, such as developing new software or training staff. Education budgets are often strained, and authorities might not be willing or able to allocate resources to such an endeavor, especially if the benefits are not yet proven on a larger scale. 4. Philosophical or ideological differences: The education system in different regions is frequently shaped by historical, cultural, and philosophical influences. It is possible that the concept of grade budgets conflicts with the dominant educational ideology in that area. For example, some traditionalists might view grade budgets as fostering an unhealthy focus on grades rather than learning or perceive the system as undermining a teacher's authority. In conclusion, the absence of grade budgets in a particular area does not solely depend on their effectiveness as an educational tool. Various factors, such as lack of awareness, resistance to change, financial constraints, and philosophical differences, can influence whether or not grade budgets are implemented. Thus, the premise that grade budgets are a good idea does not directly entail that they are not offered in a certain area. The absence of grade budgets could be due to any of the aforementioned factors or a combination of them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I was familiar with Lisa from her show on Lifetime, and since I was eager to get a sign from my father, I agreed to go. I took my father's gold watch and listened as Lisa helped audience members communicate with their loved ones. \\"I have a grandfather-like figure with me and he is speaking about his granddaughter Jilly,\\" she announced. The audience was quiet; no one raised a hand. I nudged  my sister and whispered to her that this was Dad ,for my third child and my father had a deep bond(,) and he called her Jilly.

They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \\"the descendants\\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves).

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: He was 11 years old and went fishing every chance he got from the dock at his family's cabin on an island in the middle of a New Hampshire lake. On the day before the bass season opened, he and his father were fishing early in the evening, catching sunfish and perch with worms. Then he tied on a small silver lure and practiced casting. The lure struck the water and caused colored ripples in the sunset, then silver ripples as the moon rose over the lake. When his pole doubled over, he knew something huge was on the other end. Finally, he very gingerly lifted the exhausted fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a perch . The boy and his father looked at the handsome fish. Then the father lit a match  and looked at his watch. It was 10 P.M.--- two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy. \\"You'll have to put it back, son,\\" he said. \\"Dad!\\" cried the boy. \\"There will be other fish,\\" said his father. \\"Not as big as this one,\\" cried the boy. He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were anywhere around in the moonlight. He looked again at his father. Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he caught the fish, the boy could know everything by his father's clear voice that the decision could not be changed. He slowly worked the hook  out of the lip of the huge bass and lowered it into the black water. The creature swished its powerful body and disappeared. The boy suspected that he would never again see such a great fish. That was 34 years ago. Today, the boy is a successful architect in New York City. His father's cabin is still there on the island in the middle of the lake. He takes his own son and daughters fishing from the same dock. He was right.

A fake paramedic  jailed for tricking a terminally ill pensioner into thinking he was a real medical worker and even drove his own ambulance has been sent back to prison for 'befriending vulnerable people'. Joshua Martyn had bought a fully marked paramedic first response vehicle and medical equipment online, despite having never completed anything more than a basic first aid course. The 21-year-old from Hove, East Sussex, was jailed for 18 months in August after he admitted fraud and theft charges, but was released in September as he had served most of his sentence while on remand. Fake: Joshua Martyn (left), who bought a first response vehicle (right) and tricked pensioners into thinking he was a real paramedic, has been sent back to prison for 'befriending vulnerable people' However, he was returned to prison earlier this month after breaching his licence by 'befriending vulnerable people', Sussex Police said. Martyn first came to police attention in 2010 while pretending to be a paramedic. However, because it is not currently an offence to impersonate a health professional, police found there was little they could do to stop him. He was eventually arrested in September 2011 for fraud and assault on a 71-year-old woman he was living with in Crawley, according to police. Difficulties: Police said that because it is not currently an offence to impersonate a regulated health or care professional, they found it difficult to know how to deal with Martyn. He had moved in with the woman, convincing her that he was medically trained, but in reality had no such qualifications. In March 2012, he was convicted at Lewes Crown Court of using an uninsured and untaxed vehicle, three counts of battery in relation to the 71-year-old woman, and two counts of driving without a licence. He was sentenced to a six-month hospital order and banned from driving for six months. Kit: A stash of medical equipment used by the 21-year-old, who managed convince pensioners that he was a real paramedic. However, just two months later, police were told that he was staying with a couple in their 80s in West Hoathly, near East Grinstead, West Sussex, whose concerned family were not convinced he was a registered paramedic. Last March, Martyn was convicted of fraud and assault against a terminally ill 80-year-old man from West Hoathly but cleared of one charge of witness intimidation. He was sentenced to five months imprisonment at a youth offenders’ institution and given a restraining order banning him from contacting the 71-year-old woman in Crawley. He admitted further charges of fraud and theft when he appeared at Hove Crown Court in August this year, and received the 18 month prison sentence. 'Joshua Martyn adopted personas that put him in contact with vulnerable people and in a position of trust,' said Pc Jacqui Thornton. 'He was well known in the community and fooled people into thinking he was qualified to administer medical care. 'He dressed as a paramedic, drove a marked ambulance response vehicle and carried medical equipment. 'It is not currently an offence to impersonate a regulated health or care professional, therefore it was difficult to deal with Martyn’s activities and behaviour. 'It took me three years of investigation to obtain the evidence required to put Martyn before the court for various offences linked to his activities.' Pc Thornton said Martyn’s case was not the first of its kind and that she was working with the South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) to raise awareness and to amend legislation which protects those who are vulnerable and those who need medical care. Paramedic David Davis said: 'This case specifically highlights a current inadequacy in the law in that it is not currently an offence to impersonate a paramedic, or for that matter a nurse, doctor, physiotherapist or a social worker. 'Members of the public can always check to see if their paramedic or other allied health professional or social worker is registered, by visiting the www.hcpc-uk.org or doctor www.gmc-uk.org or nurses/midwives www.nmc-uk.org.'

Movie plot title: Cruising Movie plot: In New York City during the middle of a hot summer, body parts of men are showing up in the Hudson River. The police suspect it to be the work of a serial killer who is picking up homosexual men at West Village bars like the Eagle's Nest, the Ramrod, and the Cock Pit, then taking them to cheap rooming houses or motels, tying them up and stabbing them to death. Officer Steve Burns (Al Pacino), who resembles the victims, is sent deep undercover by Captain Edelson (Paul Sorvino) into the urban world of gay S&amp;M and leather bars in the Meatpacking District in order to track down the killer. He rents an apartment in the area and befriends a neighbor, Ted Bailey (Don Scardino), a struggling young gay playwright. Burns's undercover work takes a toll on his relationship with his girlfriend Nancy (Karen Allen), due to both his refusal to tell her the details of his current assignment and Burns building a close friendship with Ted, who himself is having relationship problems with his jealous and overbearing dancer boyfriend Gregory (James Remar). Burns mistakenly compels the police to interrogate a waiter, Skip Lee (Jay Acovone), who is intimidated and beaten to coerce a confession before police discover Skip's fingerprints don't match the killer's. Burns is disturbed by this police brutality, and tells Captain Edelson he didn't sign on for this so that they can arrest anyone just because he's gay. Exhausted by his undercover assignment, Burns is close to quitting, but is convinced by Edelson to continue with the investigation. Following a new lead, Burns investigates Columbia University students who studied with one of the previous victims, a college professor. At the film's conclusion, Burns thinks that he has found the serial killer, Stuart Richards (Richard Cox), a gay music graduate student with schizophrenic disorder who attacks him with a knife in Morningside Park.

Q:-  Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed -   What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step in the process of fossil formation, also known as fossilization, begins when an organism or parts of an organism, such as bones, shells, or plant materials, die and become buried under layers of sediment. Here is a detailed explanation of this initial stage and the subsequent series of events that ultimately transform biological remains into fossils. 1. Death and initial burial: For fossilization to occur, the remains of an organism must be protected from scavengers and rapid decomposition. When an organism dies, it falls to the ground or settles to the bottom of a body of water (ocean, lake, or river). There, it becomes quickly covered with a layer of sediment, which could be mud, silt, sand, or other fine particles. This initial coverage helps protect the remains from damage due to exposure, scavenging, and decay. 2. Accumulation of sediments: Over time, more layers of sediment continue to accumulate on top of the remains, compressing them under the increasing weight and pressure. These additional layers also contribute to the further exclusion of oxygen, which slows down microbial decomposition and ultimately preserves the remains. 3. Sediment solidification: As the sediment layers continue to build up and the pressure increases, the lower sediment layers begin to compact and undergo a process called lithification. This process turns the deposited sediment into sedimentary rock, such as shale, sandstone, or limestone. Once lithification is complete, the rock layer containing the organism's remains becomes part of the Earth's crust. 4. Decomposition of organic material: With time, the remaining organic material in the remains, such as muscle tissue and skin, decompose, leaving behind only trace amounts of carbon and other elements. These elements are eventually replaced by minerals from the surrounding environment through a process called mineralization or permineralization. This replacement can occur at an atomic level, preserving even the most intricate structural details of the organism. 5. Formation of a fossil: As the process continues, the remains become mineralized, and all the original organic material is replaced by minerals, forming a three-dimensional replica of the organism's structure preserved in rock. The fossil may appear as an exact mold or cast of the original organism, or it may even retain some of its original coloring or other physical properties. Thus, the first step in the process of fossil formation is the death of the organism and its subsequent burial under layers of sediment. This crucial stage sets the stage for the subsequent processes of sediment accumulation, lithification, decomposition, and mineralization, which ultimately transform the organism's remains into fossils that provide valuable insights into the history of life on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The premise suggests that the speaker is requesting immediate information or response, showing emphasis on the urgency or importance of the information being sought. In this specific context, we can analyze why the hypothesis might not hold true: 1. Urgency: The request to \\"Tell us at once\\" reflects a sense of urgency on the part of the speaker, possibly because the information sought is time-sensitive. Therefore, being informed immediately is essential, and waiting for a while could potentially cause complications or negative consequences. 2. Importance: The premise could also suggest that the information being sought is of high importance, and the speaker believes that prompt communication of such information is crucial for making well-informed decisions. 3. Anticipation: The statement may also convey eagerness or anticipation for the information being requested. In such a situation, the individual asking the question may be emotionally invested in the details and require them as soon as possible to alleviate their curiosity or anxiety, making a delay in the response less than desirable.

Title: Over 21 Movie plot: At the New York Bulletin newspaper, its owner, Robert Drexel Gow (Charles Coburn), receives a teletype story that the newspaperâs thirty-nine-year-old editor, Max Wharton (Alexander Knox), is resigning to enlist in the army. Robert is livid, both at the news and the method that he found out about the news. There is a second story on the teletype: Maxâs wife, the famous novelist Paula Wharton (Irene Dunne) (whom Max calls Paulie), is in Hollywood adapting her latest book into a movie screenplay. Max wants to do his duty as a citizen and responsible journalist to be close to the war (World War II). Robertâs view is that without Max, the newspaper will fold because Max *is* the newspaper. From Hollywood, Paulie telephones Max and congratulates him on his decision. After Max informs her of the plan of basic training then possibly officerâs candidate school, Paulie decides that she will move to where ever that school is to be close to him. After completion of basic training, Max sends Paulie a telegram that officerâs candidate school is in Tetley Field, Florida. She doesnât quite understand Maxâs motivations, but she wants to see her husband succeed in this passion. Paulie arrives at Palmetto Court looking for bungalow 26D and meets the last tenant, Jan Lupton (Jeff Donnell), whose husband Roy has just graduated to second lieutenant. Jan gives Paulie the lowdown on life in 26D, and that life for the enlisted at Tetley Field is all work, work, work. With school, Jan relays a story she heard where once youâre over 21 years of age, your brain doesnât absorb the material taught anymore. Max comes by the bungalow surprised to see his wife there already. They have a loving reunion. The Luptons say goodbye to the Whartons, who can now have a proper reunion. Max and Paulie discuss their upcoming life. Paulie wants to be just like all the other army wives living in the complex.

Premise: \\"What is the impact of home computing technology on postal demand?\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"What is the impact on postal demand caused by home computing technology?\\"?","output":"The premise \\"What is the impact of home computing technology on postal demand?\\" and the hypothesis \\"What is the impact on postal demand caused by home computing technology?\\" basically entail the same inquiry. The wording is slightly different, but they both seek to explore how home computing technology has affected postal demand. When we talk about the impact of home computing technology on postal demand, there are several aspects that we have to consider. Firstly, home computing technology has significantly reduced the high dependence on traditional postal services. This is mainly due to the ability of computers, and especially the internet, to facilitate instant and efficient communication. The prevalence of email as a medium of formal and informal communication has drastically reduced the need for individuals to send letters or documents via traditional mail.  Secondly, online platforms facilitated by home computing technology have given rise to virtual marketplaces and e-commerce platforms. These platforms encourage online shopping and deliveries which leverage courier services more than traditional postal services. However, it's essential to admit that while email has displaced snail mail for quick exchanges, package delivery is thriving thanks to e-commerce. The reduction in demand for the postal service to deliver personal and business letters and documents is substantial, but the explosion in package delivery, particularly due to online shopping, has substantially increased the demand for parcel delivery services. Moreover, home computing technology helped citizens and businesses to pay their bills, invoices, and taxes online, reducing the need to send or receive these types of documents by post. Also, online advertising has reduced the need for physical promotional mail. Lastly, home computing technology has also facilitated the development and adoption of electronic banking services such as online money transfers, which have reduced the need for sending things like checks through the post. Electronic files can also be shared through computing technology, reducing the need for sending physical media (like CDs, DVDs, etc.) through the mail. Nonetheless, it's essential to mention that while home computing technology has generally had a negative impact on traditional postal services, it has also presented opportunities for evolution. Postal services worldwide are adapting to these changes, offering new services (like parcel delivery for online shopping), and integrating modern technology into their operations. So, back to the question regarding whether the premise entails the hypothesis. As mentioned before, the premise and the hypothesis imply the same question. They both examine how the advancement and adoption of home computing technology have affected the demand for postal services. Thus, answering the premise effectively answers the hypothesis. The distinction between them lies more in their phrasing than in the content or nature of the inquiry they represent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Robert Owen (; 14 May 1771 - 17 November 1858) was a Welsh textile manufacturer, philanthropic social reformer, and one of the founders of utopian socialism and the cooperative movement. Owen is best known for his efforts to improve the working conditions of his factory workers and his promotion of experimental socialistic communities. In July 1799 Owen and his partners bought the New Lanark mill from David Dale, and Owen became the New Lanark mill's manager in January 1800. Encouraged by his success in the management of cotton mills in Manchester, Owen hoped to conduct the New Lanark mill on higher principles than purely commercial ones. David Dale and Richard Arkwright had established the substantial mill at New Lanark in 1785. With its water power provided by the falls of the River Clyde, the cotton-spinning operation became one of Britain's largest. About 2,000 individuals were associations with the mill; 500 of them were children who were brought to the mill at the age of five or six from the poorhouses and charities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Dale, who was known for his benevolence, treated the children well, but the general condition of New Lanark's residents was unsatisfactory. Over the years, Dale and his son-in-law, Owen, worked to improve the factory workers' lives.  Many of the workers were in the lowest levels of the population; theft, drunkenness, and other vices were common; education and sanitation were neglected; and most families lived in one room. The respectable country people refused to submit to the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the mills.  Until a series of Truck Acts (1831-1887) required employees to be paid in common currency, many employers operated the truck system that paid workers in total or in part with tokens. The tokens had no monetary value outside the mill owner's \\"truck shop,\\" where the owners could supply shoddy goods and charge top prices. In contrast to other employers, Owen's store offered goods at prices slightly above their wholesale cost. He also passed on the savings from the bulk purchase of goods to his workers, and placed the sale of alcohol under strict supervision. These principles became the basis for the cooperative shops in Britain, which continue in an altered form to trade today.

When someone is happy,can you smell it? You can usually tell when someone is happy based on seeing them smile,hearing them laugh or perhaps from receiving a big hug.But can you also smell their happiness? Surprising new research suggests that happiness does indeed have a scent,and that the experience of happiness can be transmitted through smell,reports Phys.org. For the study,12 young men were shown videos meant to bring about a variety of emotions while researchers gathered sweat samples from them.All of the men were healthy and none of them were drug users or smokers,and all were asked to abstain from drinking or eating smelly foods during the study period. Those sweat samples were then given to 36 equally healthy young women to smell,while researchers monitored their reactions.Only women were selected to smell the samples,apparently because previous research has shown that women have a better sense of smell than men and are also more sensitive to emotional signaling--though it's unclear why only men were chosen to produce the scents. Researchers found that the behavior of the women after smelling the scents--particularly their facial expressions--indicated a relationship between the emotional states of the men who produced the sweat and the women who sniffed them. \\"Human sweat produced when a person is happy brings about a state similar to happiness in somebody who breathes this smell,\\" said study co-author Gun Semin,a professor at Koc University in Turkey. This is a fascinating finding because it not only means that happiness does have a scent,but that the scent is capable of transmitting the emotion to others.The study also found that other emotions,such as fear,seem to carry a scent too.This ensures previous research suggesting that some negative emotions have a smell,but it is the first time this has proved to be true of positive feelings. Researchers have yet to isolate  exactly what the chemical compound for the happiness smell is,but you might imagine what the potential... Question: What is the main finding of the new research?

Nasa has revealed the incredible moments in a specially set up 'war room' inside its HQ as its Curiosity rover landed on the red planet. The unprecedented insight reveals the drama the 34 scientists allowed into the inner sanctum, which was separate from mission control, went through during Curiosity's descent to the surface of the red planet. It even reveals the carefully chosen words that signified a perfect landing - tango delta nominal. Curiosity's Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) 'war room' and its staff. On the night of Aug. 5, 2012 PDT (early morning Aug. 6 EDT), 34 engineers gathered in this room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, to support the landing. Twenty-five of Nasa's engineers are pictured above. From the left, back row, they are: Luis Dominguez, Armen Toorian, Allen Kummer, Dan Scharf, Jaime Catchen, Chuck Baker, Nadin Cox, Matt, Lenda, Steve Lee, Genevie Yang and Richard Kornfeld at the end. Starting from the top of the table and moving left are: Paul Brugarolas, Lynn McGrew, Aaron Stehura, Steve Sell, Devin Kipp, Jeremy Shidner, Corey Harmon and David Way. In the closest row, from the left, are: Matt Rozek, Ravi Prakash, Dick Powell, Jody Davis, Gavin Mendeck and Jordi Casoliva. The image above shows the team at work. \\"If we said 'touchdown,' then people not intimately familiar with EDL. might infer that Curiosity was good to go,\\" said  Steve Sell, a 42-year-old engineer from Gettysburg, said on Nasa's web site. He admits the touchdown was the first of three key message the team hoped to hear. 'Two more. major calls had to be made before I could begin to breathe again.' The key moment for the team occured at 10:32 p.m local time. Diaries from the crew reveal there had been a debate amongst Curiosity's entry, descent and landing team about what their first words to indicate that the rover had reached the surface should be. The team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory knew their microphones would be 'hot' and that NASA TV was beaming the landing event out live to anybody with the desire and wherewithal to watch. They also knew that landing safely on Mars meant more than simply landing on Mars - which any one of the 34 engineers present at JPL's Building 264 Room 230, also known as the 'EDL War Room,' will tell you at great length is not simple at all. Their rocket-propelled backpack and rover-lowering Sky Crane system were getting their first test 154 million miles (248 million kilometers) away from home. At 10:31:45 p.m. PDT, Jody Davis saw the event record, or EVR, she was looking for appear on her computer screen in the EDL War Room. She told Nasa's site she knew that the 'Touchdown' message would only be beamed down if the rover's descent stage had throttled down, a result which could only occur if the descent stage had offloaded half its weight. The only way the rover could offload half its weight in an instant is if it were being held up from below. Davis, a member of the EDL team and an engineer from NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia, gave the much reviewed, pre-scripted call - 'Tango Delta nominal.' Tango and Delta are phonetic identifiers for T and D, which the team used to represent touchdown. The next call the EDL team was looking for was 'RIMU Stable.' 'RIMU stands for Rover Inertial Measurement Unit,' said Sell. 'The RIMU gives us the rover's orientation as well as any movement it is making. 'If we landed on a crumbling crater wall or an unstable sand dune, or were being dragged by a still-connected descent stage across the surface, then the RIMU would show that in its data set.' Researchers in Nasa's main mission control celebrating the landing. However, Nasa has now revealed its key researchers were in a special 'war room' for the landing. The War Room's David Way, an engineer from JPL, was monitoring that unit's performance. Eight long seconds after Jody's call, he found the EVR he was looking for. 'RIMU Stable,\\" said Way. The final confirmation actually came from a different building, Nasa said. There, in the Mission Support Area of JPL's Building 230, Adam Steltzner, the mission's EDL phase lead, was staring across the room at Brian Schwartz, who was not making eye contact with anyone. Schwartz, the EDL communications engineer, was staring at his screen. Final destination: Curisity recently sent back this high resolution picture of its landing site and its destination, called Mount Sharp, in the distance. His task was not to check for a good-news EVR from the rover. Instead, he was waiting to see if the UHF signal became intermittent, faded away or just cut out altogether - all potential indications that the rover and descent stage had not gone their separate ways. Eight seconds after the RIMU call - Schwartz looked up. 'UHF strong,' said Schwartz. With that, Steltzner had all the data he needed. Seated directly in front of the pacing EDL Phase Lead, Allen Chen felt a jab in the shoulder. Chen, the mission's (capsule communicator), knew it could only mean one thing. 'Touchdown confirmed,' said Chen. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which patient would be more at risk of genetic defects in the fetus, patient A or patient B?  David is a doctor with the city hospital. Today, he is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. All four patients are expectant mothers. Moreover, patient A is over thirty five years old, but patient B is under thirty five years old. Patient C has family history of genetic disorder, but patient D does not have any family history of genetic disorder. David needs to prescribe appropriate treatment according to each patient's condition.  Hint: During Amniocentesis a small amount of amniotic fluid, which contains fetal cells, is extracted from the amnion or amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus, and the fetal DNA is examined for genetic abnormalities. Amniocentesis is not performed for every pregnancy, but is generally done when an increased risk of genetic defects in the fetus is indicated, by mother's age (over 35 years is common), family history of genetic defects, or other factors. Answer:","output":"Patient A would be more at risk of genetic defects in the fetus because she is over thirty-five years old, which is a common indicator for an increased risk of genetic defects. Amniocentesis is typically performed when there are risk factors present, such as advanced maternal age. Although patient B is under thirty-five years old, patient C's family history of genetic disorder may also present a risk, but the question specifically asks to compare patient A and patient B, indicating that patient A has a higher risk of genetic defects in the fetus."},{"instruction":"Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data.  Which researcher studied less about abrasion?  Hint: Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.

However, when the tournament reverted to a knockout formula in 1969, he did not prosper.  Ray Reardon became the dominant force in the 1970s, winning six titles, with John Spencer (snooker player) winning three. Steve Davis first world title in 1981 made him only the 11th world champion since 1927, including the winner of the boycotted 1952 title, Horace Lindrum. Stephen Hendry became the 14th in 1990 and dominated through the 1990s. Reardon won six (1970, 1973–1976 and 1978), Davis also six (1981, 1983, 1984 and 1987–1989) and Hendry seven (1990, 1992–1996 and 1999). Ronnie OSullivan is the closest to dominance in the modern era, having won the title on five occasions in the 21st century (2001, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2013). Mark Williams (snooker player) has won three times (2000, 2003, and 2018) and John Higgins (snooker player) four times (1998, 2007, 2009, 2011) but since the beginning of the century, there has not been a dominant force like in previous decades, and the modern era has seen many players playing to a similar standard, instead of one player raising the bar. Davis, for example, won more ranking tournaments than the rest of the top 64 players put together by 1985. By retaining his title in 2013, OSullivan became the first player to successfully defend the world championship since 1996 when Hendry won the sixth of his seven titles, his fifth in a row, and then later by Mark Selby in 2017.

Does the sentence \\"It was occupied by piratical kingdoms of the Barbary Coast, de facto independent since the 18th century.\\" answer the question \\"Where were the piratical kingdoms from?\\"","output":"No, the sentence \\"It was occupied by piratical kingdoms of the Barbary Coast, de facto independent since the 18th century\\" does not directly answer the question \\"Where were the piratical kingdoms from?\\" However, it does provide important information about the location and independence of these piratical kingdoms that can be used to infer their origin. The sentence tells us that these piratical kingdoms were located along the Barbary Coast, which provides some geographical clues about their origins. The Barbary Coast refers to the Mediterranean coastline of North Africa, and includes the modern-day countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. Historically, European sailors and explorers named this region after the Berber people who lived there.  The piratical kingdoms being mentioned here are often referred to as the Barbary States or Barbary Pirates. These states thrived from the 16th to the early 19th century, engaging in piracy, privateering, and the capturing of European slaves. The main kingdoms included the Sultanate of Morocco, the Regency of Algiers, the Regency of Tunis, and the Eyalet of Tripolitania (later known as the Regency of Tripoli). It is important to note that these states were not a single unified entity, but rather independent territories governed by their own rulers, often with complex political and military alliances amongst themselves and with other European powers. The sentence also suggests that these kingdoms were \\"de facto independent since the 18th century.\\" This means that despite possible formal allegiances to the larger Ottoman Empire or other suzerains, the Barbary States exercised a significant degree of autonomy and self-governance during this period. In conclusion, while the sentence does not directly answer the question, it provides enough information to infer that the piratical kingdoms were likely from the geographic region along the Mediterranean coastline of North Africa that makes up the Barbary Coast, specifically within the territories of present-day Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. The mention of de facto independence since the 18th century further suggests that these kingdoms operated with a considerable degree of autonomy during this era of their history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to Sentence 2, Occidental experiences warm and dry weather during the winter season, while the summers are characterized by cool temperatures and wet (or rainy) conditions. In summary, the two sentences present conflicting information about the weather patterns in Occidental. Sentence 1 describes cool, damp winters and warm, dry summers, while Sentence 2 states that the winters are warm and dry and the summers are cool and wet.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, WernickeKorsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men. Both environmental factors and genetics are associated with alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism.

In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer.  - 12 Rounds is a British rock band formed by Atticus Ross and singer Claudia Sarne , who are married .

Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental.  - Mechanical Animals is the third studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson, released on September 14, 1998 by Nothing and Interscope Records. The album marked a major shift from the industrial and alternative metal styles of the band's earlier efforts, into an experimentation with 1970s glam rock.

The parent label handles the production and distribution and funding of the vanity label, but the album is usually released with the vanity label brand name prominent. Usually, the artist/head of the vanity label is signed to the parent label, and this artist's own recordings will be released under the vanity label's brand name. Creating a vanity label can be an attractive idea for the parent label primarily as a \\"perk\\" to keep a successful artist on the label's roster happy and a venue to bring fellow artists to the public's attention.  - Run Lola Run (literally \\"Lola runs\\") is a 1998 German thriller film written and directed by Tom Tykwer, and starring Franka Potente as Lola and Moritz Bleibtreu as Manni.

Widely differing definitions of drug abuse are used in public health, medical and criminal justice contexts. In some cases criminal or anti-social behavior occurs when the person is under the influence of a drug, and long term personality changes in individuals may occur as well. In addition to possible physical, social, and psychological harm, use of some drugs may also lead to criminal penalties, although these vary widely depending on the local jurisdiction. Drugs most often associated with this term include: alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, methaqualone, opioids and substituted amphetamines. The exact cause of substance abuse is not clear, with theories including one of two: either a genetic disposition which is learned from others, or a habit which if addiction develops, it manifests itself as a chronic debilitating disease. In 2010 about 5% of people (230 million) used an illicit substance. Of these 27 million have high-risk drug use otherwise known as recurrent drug use causing harm to their health, psychological problems, or social problems or puts them at risk of those dangers. In 2013 drug use disorders resulted in 127,000 deaths up from 53,000 in 1990. The highest number of deaths are from opioid use disorders at 51,000. Cocaine use disorder resulted in 4,300 deaths and amphetamine use disorder resulted in 3,800 deaths. Alcohol use disorders resulted in an additional 139,000 deaths.  - Industrial rock is a musical genre that fuses industrial music and specific rock subgenres, not to be confused with industrial metal.

He is known for his controversial stage personality and image as the lead singer of the band Marilyn Manson, which he co-founded with Daisy Berkowitz and of which he remains the only constant member. His stage name was formed by juxtaposing the names of two opposing American pop cultural icons; actress Marilyn Monroe and cult leader Charles Manson.  - Alternative metal (also known as alt-metal) is a rock music genre that infuses heavy metal with influences from alternative rock and other genres not normally associated with metal. Alternative metal bands are often characterized by heavily downtuned, mid-paced guitar riffs, a mixture of accessible melodic vocals and harsh vocals and sometimes unconventional sounds within other heavy metal styles. The term has been in use since the 1980s, although it came into prominence in the 1990s.   - Atticus Matthew Cowper Ross (born 16 January 1968) is an English musician, songwriter, record producer, and audio engineer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:I have a new situation: Two neighboring habitable planets from the same solar system, planet U and planet N, had Earth-like atmospheres. The inhabitants of planet U destroyed the ozone layer by their actions, while their neighboring planet N didn't.  But I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  What is an answer for this question: Which planet had inhabitants that used fewer aerosol sprays? A:","output":"From the given information, it is clear that it was the inhabitants of planet N who used fewer aerosol sprays and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS) than their counterparts on planet U. The key to this conclusion lies in the state of the ozone layer on each of the planets.  Planet U experienced the destruction of its ozone layer, which suggests that the inhabitants there extensively used substances known to deplete ozone, like chlorine and bromine gases. These harmful gases are commonly released by products such as aerosol sprays and coolants. As a result, planet U suffered from increased levels of UV radiation, likely leading to severe consequences for the health of its inhabitants and the planet's ecosystems. On the other hand, planet N managed to maintain its Earth-like atmosphere, which implies that the ozone layer there has remained largely intact and functional. This preservation of the ozone layer strongly indicates that the inhabitants of planet N used fewer aerosol sprays and other products that release chlorine and bromine gases. There must have been a more sustainable approach to the use of such substances, which has helped prevent the depletion of their ozone layer.  It is worth noting that even though planet N has a healthier ozone layer, all habitable planets need to commit to reducing the use of ozone-depleting substances in order to prevent further damage to these essential protective barriers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Given the following context:  The film begins by introducing Kellyanne Williamson, playing with imaginary friends Pobby and Dingan. The family of Rex Williamson—his wife, Anne, daughter Kellyanne and son Ashmol—have moved to Coober Pedy, known as the \\"opal capital of Australia\\", because Rex believed he could make a fortune in mining opal. So far he's had little success. Ashmol, while he loves his sister, is frequently annoyed when she talks to her imaginary friends, and some of the kids at school tease the siblings because of them. Rex and Anne decide it is time to separate Kellyanne from her invisible companions. Annie takes Kellyanne to a Christmas party at Annie's friend's house, Rex telling her that he will let Pobby and Dingan come with him to go opal mining. Upon Rex's return, Kellyanne says she can no longer see them and that they have disappeared. She insists on going to the opal mining area to look for them, accompanied by Rex and Ashmol. The family accidentally strays on to a neighbouring miner's claim. The miner, Sid, pulls a shotgun on Rex and calls the police, thinking that Rex was \\"ratting\\" on his territory - that is, looking for opals on his turf. Kellyanne is grief-stricken at the loss of her imaginary friends and takes ill, although doctors can find nothing physically wrong with her. Rex has to leave his opal claim. Annie loses her job at the local supermarket, thanks to the circulating rumours around Rex's arrest. Convinced that Kellyanne is faking her illness, Ashmol nonetheless goes along with her wish that he try to find Pobby and Dingan. He even comes up with the idea of putting posters around town. Ultimately, returning to his father's mine area, Ashmol finds two lollipop wrappers. Deeper in the tunnel, he finds a large opal which he takes back to Kellyanne. He tells her he has found Pobby and Dingan, and that they are dead.  answer the following question:  What does Sid's neighboring miner have to give up after being arrested? Answer:","output":"The text does not mention that Sid, the neighboring miner, has to give up anything after Rex's arrest. It is Rex who has to leave his opal claim, and Annie loses her job at the local supermarket due to the circulating rumors around Rex's arrest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which farm caused less fertilizer to end up in oceans?  Two farms had different plant cultivation methods. Jolly farm adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer, while Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides.  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Jolly farm adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer and didn't use fertilizers, while Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides. Since fertilizer runoff contributes to the growth of algae in bodies of water and creates dead zones, it can be deduced that Jolly farm, which utilized permaculture methods and didn't use fertilizers, caused less fertilizer to end up in oceans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \\"commonsense\\" move. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department. \\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday. But Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect — discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results. \\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 — too much is at stake,\\" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, co-chair of the Congressional Census Caucus, told VOA. \\"The census mandated by the [U.S.] Constitution affects the way that Federal and state funds are distributed and how district lines are drawn for both the city, state and Federal level.\\" Question: After the end of this story, Maloney is probably Options: - not enough information - chairing another committee - still co-chair of the committee - not chairing any committee A:","output":"still co-chair of the committee"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house, but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple: the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus to the Western and Eastern emperors.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Pick from: (a). yes. (b). no.","output":"Answer: The flame that Theodosius extinguished to remove the Vestals from power was the Sacred Fire of Vesta.  Theodosius I was a Roman Emperor who ruled from 379 to 395 AD. He was a strong advocate for Christianity and aimed to strengthen the influence of the Christian religion across the Roman Empire. This endeavor led him to extinguish the Sacred Fire of the Vestals and vacate their temple, as mentioned by the senator Quintus Aurelius Symmachus in his letter. The role of Vestals in ancient Rome was of significant importance. They were priestesses dedicated to Vesta, the goddess of the hearth, home, and family. They remained celibate for 30 years and had the responsibility to maintain the eternal flame, the Sacred Fire of Vesta, which symbolized the well-being and continuity of Roman society. As long as the flame was burning, Rome was believed to be divinely protected. During Theodosius's reign, a move to eliminate traditional Roman religious practices happened, focusing on converting the empire to Christianity. Theodosius enforced several anti-pagan laws and discontinued state support for the Vestals and other pagan cults. As a clear demonstration of his intentions, Theodosius extinguished the Sacred Fire, which was the primary duty and source of power for the Vestals. By extinguishing the Sacred Fire of Vesta, Theodosius weakened the traditional pagan belief system, effectively removing the Vestals from their positions of power, and made significant progress in establishing Christianity as the dominant religion in the Roman Empire. Eventually, the temple of Vesta was closed, and the Vestal Virgins were disbanded, marking the end of their prominent role in Roman society. In conclusion, the flame that Theodosius extinguished to remove the Vestals from power was the Sacred Fire of Vesta. By extinguishing this flame and vacating the temple, he was able to strengthen the Christian religion and reduce the influence of pagan cults within the Roman Empire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.  - Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin.  - In Greek mythology, Melete () was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses before the Nine Olympian Muses were founded. Her sisters were Aoide and Mneme. She was the muse of thought and meditation. Melete literally means \\"ponder\\" and \\"contemplation\\" in Greek.  - Mnemosyne (or  ), source of the word \\"mnemonic\\", was the personification of memory in Greek mythology. A Titanide, or Titaness, she was the daughter of the Titans Uranus and Gaia. Mnemosyne was the mother of the nine Muses, fathered by her nephew, Zeus:  - In Greek mythology , Mneme / nimi / (  ) was one of the three original ( Boeotian ) muses , along with her sisters Aoide and Melete before Arche and Thelxinoë were identified , increasing the number to five . Later , the Nine Olympian Muses were named . She was the muse of memory .  - Anaximander (\\"Anaximandros\\"; c. 610  c. 546 BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus, a city of Ionia (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and, arguably, Pythagoras amongst his pupils.  - In Greek mythology, Aoede (\\"Aoid\\") was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses, which later expanded to five, before the Nine Olympian Muses were named. Her sisters were Melete and Mneme. She was the muse of voice and song. According to Greek mythology, she is the daughter of Zeus, the King of the Gods, and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory.   - Arche is a Greek word with primary senses \\"beginning\\", \\"origin\\" or \\"source of action\\". (: from the beginning, r : the original argument), and later first principle or element, first so used by Anaximander (Simplicius in Ph. 150.23), principles of knowledge (Aristot. Metaph. 995b8). By extension, it may mean \\"first place, power\\", \\"method of government\\", \\"empire, realm\\", \\"authorities\\" (in plural: ), \\"command\\". The first principle or element corresponds to the \\"ultimate underlying substance\\" and \\"ultimate undemonstrable principle\\". In the philosophical language of the archaic period (8th-6th century BC), \\"arche\\" (or \\"archai\\") designates the source, origin or root of things that exist. In ancient Greek philosophy, Aristotle foregrounded the meaning of \\"arche\\" as the element or principle of a thing, which although undemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing.

In the small town of La Pintada, for instance, 68 of the town's 800 residents are missing after a massive landslide Monday, the AP reports. \\"Half the homes in town were smothered and buried,\\" one woman says. Several entire families were wiped out in the disaster. Tropical Storm Manuel is believed to have caused almost 400 million in damage, Voice of America reports. Thousands of tourists have been evacuated from Acapulco.

With a rising death toll and extensive damages, Mexico's citizens and authorities are reeling from the effects of the back-to-back disasters. Authorities have declared at least 97 confirmed deaths, with many people still unaccounted for, as Mexico's emergency services struggle to cope with the extensive devastation. The Wrath of the Storm: Tropical storms Manuel and Ingrid pummeled the country this week, leaving several towns and communities devastated in their wake. One of the worst-hit locations is the small town of La Pintada, where Monday's massive landslide buried approximately half of the homes, leading to at least 68 residents out of the town's 800 missing. Reports reveal that several families have been wiped out entirely by this catastrophe. The storm situation is so severe that the Mexican government has calculated the damage caused by Tropical Storm Manuel alone at an estimated 400 million. Impact on Tourism: Mexico’s economy has also been affected, due to the storm impacting its tourism industry. As Tropical Storm Manuel hit the popular tourist destination of Acapulco, thousands of tourists had to be evacuated at short notice. Acapulco's transportation infrastructure has been severely compromised, and holidaymakers planning to visit the area now face cancellation or rescheduling of their plans. This disruption has led to a significant blow for the country's tourism sector, which it needs to bounce back from in the coming months. Response and Recovery Efforts: Despite the significant challenges faced by communities across the country, Mexico's residents claim they have received inadequate aid from their government and emergency services. In the hard-hit town of Renacimiento, for example, a CNN investigation found that cleanup crews had yet to arrive, despite the storm having passed days prior. As a result, people of the town feel ignored by their government. In the words of one resident who lost his kitchen to the floodwaters, \\"The government ignores us.

With the burden of handling a rising death toll, extensive damage to infrastructure, and the subsequent impact on their economy, the authorities must effectively utilize the available resources and manpower to provide aid and support to the most affected communities. In order to rebuild, the Mexican government needs to prioritize addressing the struggles of its citizens, particularly in hardest-hit areas like La Pintada and Renacimiento.

And I was wondering What will happen to Bailey? Available choices: A). need to change B). knock on the door C). arrive at the party A:","output":"Based on the given situation, it seems that Bailey will likely need to change clothes after having a drink accidentally spilled onto them by Quinn. To offer a detailed account of what may happen next, let's break down the events: 1. Bailey took Quinn aside to say hello - It seems that Bailey wanted to have a private or personal conversation with Quinn, which is why they took Quinn aside. This could be an indication that they had not met in a while or that they had some important matter to discuss. 2. Quinn accidentally spilled their drink onto Bailey - Quinn, most likely feeling nervous or simply being clumsy, accidentally spilled their drink onto Bailey's clothes. Depending on the type of drink and the fabric of Bailey's clothing item, this could cause a noticeable stain or may just make their clothes wet. So, given the situation, this is how things may unfold: A. Need to change - Bailey, realizing that their clothes are now wet and/or stained from the drink, might immediately feel uncomfortable or embarrassed about their appearance. Depending on the severity of the situation and taking into consideration the type of gathering they are attending (e.g., a formal party or a casual gathering), Bailey may decide that they need to change clothes as it could affect their overall presentation or comfort level. - If they are at someone else's house, Bailey might seek permission from the host to borrow clothes or use the host's washing facilities to attempt to remove any stains.    - If they are at a public place, Bailey may look for a nearby restroom to assess the situation and possibly try to dry their clothes or remove the stain using available resources. In either scenario, Quinn might feel mortified by their actions and might be apologetic towards Bailey. They may even offer to help Bailey in finding a solution or taking responsibility for any inconvenience caused. In conclusion, although the available choices provided didn't seem to match the exact outcome of the events, Bailey would most likely fall into category A, needing to change clothes or clean their stained garment. Of course, the way each person handles such a situation may vary, and this response is just an estimation of the potential course of action."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a question about the following article: The Bears travelled to Heinz Field to face the winless Pittsburgh Steelers in their first NBC Sunday Night Football matchup of the season. Pittsburgh had lost the previous week to Cincinnati to fall to 0-2 for the first time in 11 years. In the last game between the two in 2009, the Bears triumphed 17-14. The Bears were the 1-point favorites; eight CBSSports.com experts voted on their predictions for the game, with a 5-3 result favoring Chicago, while four ESPN analysts predicted that the Steelers would win. One of the goals of the defense was to contain Ben Roethlisberger in the passing pocket, especially as the offensive line suffered the loss of center Maurkice Pouncey. Additionally, the Steelers also had the 31st-ranked rushing offense and had yet to score a rushing touchdown, who was expected to regain first-rounder Le'Veon Bell. Alan Rubenstein of ChicagoNow writes that the Bears should attempt to improve their pass rush, which was only able to record two sacks in the last two games. Marc Trestman cited the weather as a factor for the poor performance, stating, \\"It's tough to rush the passer in wet weather... For both sides. It's tough to get a pass rush with a soggy field and a wet field. It's an advantage throwing the football. On a rainy day (versus) no rain, really the advantage goes to the offense. Because we can sit back there and protect. And it's really hard to configure a pass rush to get close.\\" On offense, the Bears should attempt to attack the Steelers' 14th-ranked rush defense. A key matchup was the WR-CB duel between Brandon Marshall and Ike Taylor; Taylor contained Bengals receiver A. J. Green, who recorded 162 yards against the Bears in week one, to just six catches for 41 yards in week two. Chicago started the game with Robbie Gould's field goal, followed by Matt Fort&#233; and Michael Bush's touchdown runs to take a 17-0 lead in the first quarter. Pittsburgh then scored on Shaun Suisham's 27-yard field goal, but the Bears then scored after Major Wright returned Roethlisberger's interception 38 yards for a touchdown for the 24-3 lead at halftime. In the second half, the Steelers began to rally with Roethlisberger throwing two touchdown passes of 33 and 21 yards to Antonio Brown, followed by Suisham kicking two more field goals to narrow the margin to 27-23. However, Jay Cutler threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Earl Bennett; the pass was initially ruled as incomplete, but was reversed. Eventually, Lance Briggs stripped Roethlisberger, and Julius Peppers returned the fumble 42 yards for a touchdown. Although the eventual extra point by Gould was blocked by Troy Polamalu, the Bears finished the game with Chris Conte intercepting Roethlisberger with 1:39 left in the game for the fifth takeaway by Chicago on the night and the 40-23 win, dropping the Steelers to 0-3 for the first time since 1986.","output":"What happened when the Bears and the Steelers played against each other in a Sunday Night Football matchup, and who were the favorites to win the game?"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Facts:   - death date: 10 february 1979      - birth date: 25 october 1915    - name: torleiv bolstad    - nationality: norwegian    - death place: oslo , norway    - birth place: Øystre slidre , oppland county , norway    - occupation: musician and hardanger fiddler   Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of torleiv bolstad .

The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going.

With songs such as \\"Maybellene\\" (1955), \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" (1956), \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" (1957) and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music.  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" is a 1956 hit single by Chuck Berry, originally released on Chess Records, with \\"Drifting Heart\\" as the B-side. The lyrics of the song mention rock and roll and the desire for rhythm and blues to replace classical music. The title of the song is an imperative directed at the composer Ludwig van Beethoven to roll over in his grave in reaction to the new genre of music that Berry was promoting. The song has been covered by many other artists, including the Beatles and the Electric Light Orchestra. \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine ranked it number 97 on its list of the \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\".  - \`\` Around and Around '' is a 1958 rock song written and first recorded by Chuck Berry . It originally appeared under the name \`\` Around & Around '' as the B - side to the single \`\` Johnny B. Goode '' .  - \\"Maybellene\\" is one of the first rock-and-roll songs. It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \\"Ida Red,\\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single and his first hit. \\"Maybellene\\" is considered one of the pioneering rock-and-roll songs: \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine wrote, \\"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\\" The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere Answer:","output":"The final step of the process involving solar radiation, absorption, reflection, and greenhouse gases is an increase in Earth's overall temperature due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. This phenomena is known as global warming or climate change. When solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere, some of that energy is reflected back into space while the rest is absorbed by the Earth's surface, which includes land and oceans. This absorbed energy then warms the Earth and results in heat radiating back to the space. However, not all of this heat escapes the atmosphere; some is trapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, which act as insulators. While the greenhouse effect is a natural part of Earth's climate system, human activities have amplified this effect significantly. Burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes have led to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The increasing amounts of these gases cause more of the Earth's radiated heat to be retained, thus causing an imbalance in Earth's energy budget. Consequently, this leads to an overall increase in global temperatures and fluctuations in the climate system. This global warming has several consequences, including rising sea levels, loss of sea ice, extreme weather events, and shifting ecosystems. Such changes affect human societies and natural environments, which might face food and water scarcity, damage to infrastructure, and loss of biodiversity. Moreover, the warming triggers a series of feedback loops, such as the release of methane from melting permafrost. These feedback loops could further accelerate the overall warming, resulting in significant and potentially catastrophic changes to our planet. Therefore, the final step of the process involving solar radiation, energy absorption, reflection, heat radiation, and greenhouse gases is the rise in Earth's overall temperature and the associated consequences of global warming and climate change. This problem highlights the urgent need for concerted global efforts to mitigate the factors contributing to global warming and transition towards cleaner and sustainable sources of energy."},{"instruction":"Which is farther north, Lehigh Canal or New Orleans Outfall Canals?","output":"Lehigh Canal is farther north than the New Orleans Outfall Canals.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which country was more regulated in regards to foreign currency exchange?  Pakistan tried to control the foreign exchange market and India didn't. By creating the foreign exchange control department, Pakistan tried to stop the devaluation of their currency. India chose to not interfere and let the exchange market regulate itself.  Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Pakistan was more regulated in regards to foreign currency exchange.

One of its earliest massive implementations was brought about by Egyptians against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution. Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws. It has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in India (Gandhi's campaigns for independence from the British Empire), in Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution and in East Germany to oust their communist governments, In South Africa in the fight against apartheid, in the American Civil Rights Movement, in the Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries from the Soviet Union, recently with the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, among other various movements worldwide.  One of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in Sophocles' play Antigone, in which Antigone, one of the daughters of former King of Thebes, Oedipus, defies Creon, the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial. She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law. She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with (and eventually carries out), but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this.

Answer a question about this article: Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the Uptown District boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of mid-rise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along Interstate 610 west. Uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, 901-foot (275 m)-tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the world's tallest skyscraper outside of a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30 years. The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei, César Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In the late 1990s and early 2000s decade, there was a mini-boom of mid-rise and high-rise residential tower construction, with several over 30 stories tall. Since 2000 more than 30 high-rise buildings have gone up in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units. In 2002, Uptown had more than 23 million square feet (2,100,000 m²) of office space with 16 million square feet (1,500,000 m²) of Class A office space.

(Mark Davis/Getty Images for Pepsi)      In the many breaks during Sunday’s big game, a variety of eye-catching ads kept viewers glued to the screen. Here is a rundown of our “elite eight” — from puppies to puppets, and from Danica to Dannon:      (See all the Super Bowl commercials — and vote on your favorites — at wapo.st/2014superads).      The product: Budweiser      The premise: One farm is for the Budweiser Clydesdales; the other is for puppies. When two of them become pals, fences can’t keep them apart. This continues the story of last year’s Budweiser commercial, which featured an interspecies friendship between a Clydesdale and the trainer who raised him from infancy.      1 of 24 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Super Bowl ads: Big winners of the big game View Photos PHOTOS | From “Mean Joe” Greene downing a Coke to the ETrade baby: A look back at the most successful ads. Caption PHOTOS | From “Mean Joe” Greene downing a Coke to the ETrade baby: A look back at the most successful ads. “Mean Joe” Greene The classic 1979 Coca-Cola ad features \\"Mean Joe” Greene , the Pittsburgh Steelers star and future National Football League Hall of Famer. Child actor Tommy Okon stops him on his way back to the locker room. Thinking the kid wants an autograph, Greene brushes him off, but Okon offers him a Coke, which Greene downs in one gulp. As a reward, he tosses the kid his jersey, to the boy’s delight. After outtakes revealed Greene belching after downing the soda, the ad becomes legendary. Coca-Cola via AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.      The punch line: When the puppy is adopted, it looks as if it’s all over for these pals — but then the Clydesdales stage a dramatic intervention. Cue the tears in 3 . . . 2 . . .      The verdict: Never underestimate the public’s appetite for a commercial that has a puppy in it. This was the most-watched ad on YouTube, with more than 33 million views, in the days leading up to the Super Bowl.      The product: Axe Peace      The premise: Leaders in North Korea and Iran are among the troubled nations alluded to in a tense sequence of events — an advancing tank, a military march, a soldier with a machine gun.      The punch line: But just as we’ve begun to think the worst, the soldiers begin to abandon their weapons and embrace the women they love. That military march is a grand tribute to the dictator’s wife. The red button deploys fireworks, not bombs. The message here is peace, as the newest line of Axe is called.      The verdict: This is something new: a heartwarming commercial from Eau de Bro body spray company Axe. In a departure from its usual schlubby-dude-wearing-Axe-attracts-bikini-babe marketing strategy, Axe has shifted its message to something softer. Not only does the ad support a partnership with cease-fire advocates Peace One Day, but it’s also gripping and cinematic, with a great twist.      The product: Dannon Oikos Greek yogurt      The premise: John Stamos, the reigning ladies’ man of lactose for the third straight year, is once again eating yogurt with a woman. He’s having trouble getting the spoon to his mouth, so she helps him out by licking it off of his lips. He senses an opportunity and — oops! — drips it in his lap.      The punch line: But his “Full House” castmates, Bob Saget and Dave Coulier, aren’t about to let him score. Needless to say, the cleanliness-obsessed Saget is not the person that Stamos was hoping would utter the phrase, “Take off your pants, Greek boy.”      The verdict: Given the media blitz that the “Full House” castmates undertook in recent days — including a Reddit Q&A and a skit with Jimmy Fallon — Dannon is really getting its money’s worth this year.      The product: GoDaddy Web hosting      The premise: Throngs of hulking bodybuilders are running through a city — and they’re led by GoDaddy spokeswoman Danica Patrick, who’s been considerably beefed up, thanks to some veiny, prosthetic muscles. But why is the siren call attracting all these meatheads?      The punch line: They’re about to stampede a spray-tanning salon, whose owner hosts her Web site on GoDaddy. “It’s ‘go’ time,” she says, spritzing a little orange puff of tanning solution.      The verdict: Last Fall, GoDaddy — maker of the most notoriously provocative commercials — announced that it was dropping its scantily-clad-babe strategy for something a little less sleazy. It’s a decision that has already paid off, as this year’s commercial is one of the funniest of the bunch.      The product: Kia      The premise: Laurence Fishburne returns as Morpheus from “The Matrix,” moonlighting as a valet at a fancy restaurant. When an attractive couple approaches, he presents them with an echo of the movie’s choice: blue key or red key? Red, he says, will make them “never look at luxury the same way again.”      The punch line: They take it, of course, and some weird, Matrix-y things start to happen — flying cars, exploding streetlights. It’s all done to the unexpected tune “Nessun Dorma,” from the opera “Turandot.”      The verdict: One hopes they tipped him well.      The product: Chevy Silverado      The premise: A rugged-looking gentleman takes a bull on a road trip. The ad seems like a typical truck commercial featuring farmland and Americana, until they cue the music: Hot Chocolate’s “You Sexy Thing.”      The punch line: The bull is offloaded into a field of cows and . . . hello, ladies. With perfect comedic timing, he licks his lips as he surveys his prospects.      The verdict: It’s nice to see a rancher-and-his-truck commercial that doesn’t take itself so seriously.      The product: Bud Light      The premise: In a two-part ad, a guy named Ian is in for a wild night. He’s approached by a woman who offers him a Bud Light and asks him whether he’s up for whatever happens next.      The punch line: What happens next turns out to be partying with a group of bachelorettes in a limo with Reggie Watts, bumping into Don Cheadle and a llama in a limo, and playing table tennis with Arnold Schwarzenegger.      The verdict: It’s as if “The Hangover” were a short film, instead. And it might be one of Arnold’s finest performances.      The product: Toyota Highlander      The premise: Terry Crews is driving on a dusty road when he comes upon a broken-down bus. When he stops to offer aid, the Muppets of Electric Mayhem pile into his car and take him on a weird, wonderful trip — through an old ladies’ bingo game, a winery, a parade and more. It’s all to the tune of a new Muppet jingle, “We ain’t got no room for boring.”      The punch line: Boring old Terry Crews starts to loosen up a bit — maybe a bit too much, as his neighbor Kermit finds him shirtless and wild-eyed, with a tie around his head, singing the Muppets’ song.      The verdict: Basically, it’s the kid-friendly version of the Bud Light commercial that takes one man on a surprising, celebrity-packed day of adventures. Except these celebrities are made of felt. ||||| Advance marketing campaigns have largely leeched the thrill of discovery out of Super Bowl advertising, since many of the spots were exposed before the game. Of course, that logic seems less assailable given that the game itself was essentially over on the first play of the second half, making viewing optional if you really gave a damn about who wins.      The level of perceived creativity in Super Bowl advertising has taken on a life of its own, which has led to the content generally being overrated. Moreover, one of the biggest sponsor categories — movie studios — are invariably challenged to come up with genuinely breakthrough creative, since a trailer is pretty much a trailer, the only difference here being the size of the stage and cost of the platform.      That said, watching the game like a regular fan (including a couple of pale ales just to complete the effect), here’s a set of knee-jerk reactions about the in-game advertising, assessing who scored — in a creative sense, if not necessarily a moving-product one — and who could have put those millions of dollars to better use.      Because they’re of special interest to Hollywood — and really belong in a separate class — we’ll break the movies out separately, followed by the rest of the field. In general, there were relatively few standouts, but also few outright howlers, with car companies conjuring some of the most memorable spots, for both good and ill.

Chevy: The company’s spot about World Cancer Day was just beautiful — haunting, touching, a little movie, played out in 30 seconds.      Hyundai Genesis: Who can’t relate to the idea of a dad trying to protect his kid — and a car’s breaking system stepping in when he’s not available? Perfect way of pushing the product in a light yet highly identifiable manner. Too bad it’s other spot, with Johnny Galecki, was a waste.      SodaStream: Although this has always struck me as a completely unnecessary product, the company’s “banned” Scarlett Johansson ad was a winner well before kick off, going viral thanks to the NFL forcing a change because the company dared to mention fellow Super Bowl sponsor Pepsi. And it’s a good thing, too, since the spot didn’t air until the fourth quarter, when the outcome of the game was long since decided, and wasn’t particularly imaginative.      Budweiser: Unabashedly patriotic and designed to make viewers cry, the notion of every returning soldier receiving a hero’s welcome was enough to trump the inherent manipulation in the way it was mounted and produced. Ditto for the adorable-puppy-meets-Clydesdale ad.      Microsoft: A thoughtful look at how technology is changing — and improving — the world, while not-so-subtly linking Microsoft to those innovations.      Beats Music: Ellen DeGeneres seemed like the right talent for a playful spot pushing the music service.      RadioShack: A dizzying wave of ’80s nostalgia used to sell the stores’ new look. Clever.      MARGINAL WINNERS      Cheerios: Adorable kid finds out she’s getting a new baby. What’s not to like?      Coca-Cola: Old-fashioned and heart-tugging, America in all its diversity is united in its love for sugary brown water. And in reality, very little else. Got it — and much better than the second spot, with the young kid running (and running and running) for a touchdown.      Time Warner Cable: One of those weird fever dreams — “True Blood?” “Ray Donovan?” Diddy? — that kind of strangely worked.      Toyota Highlander: Hard to go wrong with the Muppets. But a modest winner at best.      Kia: As much as I enjoyed Laurence Fishburne’s “The Matrix” spoof, I also found it mildly depressing that he would do it.      Jaguar: Nicely produced spot featuring British actors explaining why they’re cast as villains in movies — and like to drive Jaguar. Although probably not as much of a recognition factor for a lot of viewers as the company would have liked to really make this pop.      LOSERS      Wonderful Pistachios: What a criminal waste of Stephen Colbert as a pitchman.      Maserati: That ad with the kid was terribly dramatic, but I have no idea what the hell it has to do with cars.      Bud Light: Kudos to the idea of doing a serialized spot — with Don Cheadle and Arnold Schwarzenegger, no less — but the payoff to this reality-TV spoof felt like a missed opportunity. While I suspect it will score well in public polling, kind of a creative mess, conceptually.      GoDaddy: Someone quits their job on TV, in this economy, and that’s fodder for a commercial? Never thought I’d say this, but go back to teasing that you’re going to show naked women — or the other spot with the running bodybuilders.      Audi: I’m sure they thought the Doberhuahua spot and its “Don’t compromise” message was crowd-pleasing, but as executed, all they did was stumble into a possible plot for the next Kevin James and/or Adam Sandler movie.      CarMax and Geico: Hey, I love “Rudy” as much as the next guy — and for that matter, talking pigs — but what was the point?      Subway: Olympians eat at Subway, huh? Right, and rainbows fly out of the butts of German engineers.      Chobani: So if I buy your yogurt, a bear is going to break into my house to get it? Does anybody ever think these spots through?      M&M and Butterfingers: Apparently the candy industry just decided to be weird this year. Although did the latter really imply a chocolate-peanut butter-candy bar three-way? Kinky, but still….      DRAW      Chrysler: “We will build your car” is a powerful message, but A) this looked exactly like the Clint Eastwood spot and B) Bob Dylan strikes me as a rather awkward spokesman to deliver it. Too many people will find themselves thinking, like I did, less about the loving imagery than, “Wow, why would Dylan do this?”      Honda: Having Bruce Willis deliver a car safety message wasn’t a bad idea, but why not just play it straight, instead of mucking it up with the Fred Armisen gag?      T-Mobile: Great for the Tim Tebow lovers out there, but kind of a waste for those who felt he was overexposed about three seasons ago.      Doritos: OK, the kid using the “time machine” to steal the guy’s Doritos was kind of funny, but it didn’t feel particularly special.      Chevy: So the Silverado truck will get a Bull laid? Cheeky, but — pardon the expression — where’s the beef?      TurboTax: While I like the idea of trying to dissect the sociology of the Super Bowl, trying to convince me to go worry about my taxes while I have a big plate of bean dip isn’t particularly appetizing or interesting.      Squarespace and Sonos: Not a bad idea trying to highlight what a strange universe the Web often is, but the spot left me with absolutely no idea what the company’s product does. And ditto for the second one.      WeatherTech: Despite the appealing “Made in America” message, not particularly well done.      Heinz: Probably effective, but “If you’re happy and you know it clap your hands” strikes me as just a trifle too simplistic to be worthy of a Super Bowl campaign.      Oikos: Kind of fun to do a “Full House” reunion in the context of a commercial, but this just felt so … flat. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented.
