Five","output":"Title: Beneath the Honey Tree Logline: A heartfelt, coming-of-age drama that chronicles the life of Miss Honey, a young girl who lost her father at just five years old, as she unravels decades-old secrets and finds her true self in a small, rural town. Plot: Act 1: - The movie opens in the picturesque, small town of Blossomdale, where people are known for their kindness, traditions, and strong community bonds. - We are introduced to five-year-old Miss Honey, a bright, spirited, and innocent child with a loving family, consisting of her father, Charles Honey, a pillar of the community; her mother, Emily Honey, a kind-hearted woman; and her baby brother, Peter. - Miss Honey is her father's favorite, and he often tells her stories under the Honey Tree, a century-old tree near the town center that has become a symbol of Blossomdale. - Charles, a teacher, works tirelessly to help the children in town get a good education, often staying late to provide extra support to those who need it. - One evening, a storm ravages the town, causing widespread destruction. In an attempt to save the Honey Tree from being felled by lightning, Charles is tragically killed. Act 2: - Devastated by the loss, Emily struggles to raise Miss Honey and Peter alone, withdrawing from the close-knit community for solace. - As years go by, Miss Honey never loses her love for her father's stories, and she grows up to be a curious, strong-willed young woman. - In her late teens, Miss Honey discovers a hidden trunk in the attic, which belonged to her father. Inside, she finds photographs, letters, and documents that suggest a hidden past and another life he had before coming to Blossomdale. - Intrigued, Miss Honey embarks on a journey to uncover the truth about her father's past, driven by a strong sense of justice and love. - She discovers her father was, in fact, a part of a secret society that, contrary to their wholesome appearance, engaged in illegal and unethical activities. Shaken by the revelation, Miss Honey becomes determined to unravel the truth and bring the society to justice. Act 3: - Miss Honey's investigation leads her to connect several prominent townsfolk to the society, including the town's seemingly kind mayor and the local police chief, who have been carefully maintaining the facade of a close-knit community to cover their misdeeds. - As she inches closer to the truth, her mother, Emily, tormented by the past, reveals that her father had attempted to disentangle himself from the society - which ultimately led to his death. He made it look like an accident to protect the family. - With the support of her family and newfound friends, Miss Honey devises a plan to outwit the society and bring its members to justice. - In a dramatic confrontation under the Honey Tree during a town event, Miss Honey uses evidence she has collected over the years to expose the truth and the corrupt townsfolk, causing an immense outcry and leaving the town in shock. Act 4: - In the aftermath, the society is disbanded, and the corrupt members face legal consequences. Miss Honey decides to follow in her father's footsteps and become a teacher to provide the education and support that all children in Blossomdale deserve. - The town gradually recovers, and under the guidance of its new leaders, it strives to become a better, more transparent community. - As the movie concludes, Miss Honey pays tribute to her late father's legacy in a touching ceremony beneath the Honey Tree, which now stands tall, a symbol of hope and resilience. With strong characters, a gripping plot, and powerful messages about family, truth, and justice, \\"Beneath the Honey Tree\\" promises to be an unforgettable movie that captivates and inspires audiences on a deeply emotional level."},{"instruction":"Which entity is this text about? Geraldine Anne \\"Gerry\\" Ferraro (August 26, 1935 - March 26, 2011) was an American attorney, a Democratic Party politician, and a member of the United States House of Representatives. In 1984, she was the first female vice presidential candidate representing a major American political party. Ferraro grew up in New York City and worked as a public school teacher before training as a lawyer. She joined the Queens County District Attorney's Office in 1974, heading the new Special Victims Bureau that dealt with sex crimes, child abuse, and domestic violence. Ferraro continued to battle cancer, making repeated visits to hospitals during her last year and undergoing difficult procedures. Much of her care took place at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, where she also acted as an informal advocate for other patients. She was able to make a joint appearance with Palin on Fox News Channel's coverage of the November 2010 midterm elections. In March 2011 she went to Massachusetts General Hospital to receive treatment for pain caused by a fracture, a common complication of multiple myeloma. Once there, however, doctors discovered she had come down with pneumonia. Unable to return to her New York home, Ferraro died at Massachusetts General on March 26, 2011. In addition to her husband and three children, who were all present, she was survived by eight grandchildren. President Obama said upon her death that \\"Geraldine will forever be remembered as a trailblazer who broke down barriers for women, and Americans of all backgrounds and walks of life,\\" and said that his own two daughters would grow up in a more equal country because of what Ferraro had done. Mondale called her \\"a remarkable woman and a dear human being ... She was a pioneer in our country for justice for women and a more open society. She broke a lot of molds and it's a better country for what she did.\\" George H. W. Bush said, \\"Though we were one-time political opponents, I am happy to say Gerry and I became friends in time - a friendship marked by respect and affection. I admired Gerry in many ways, not the least of which was the dignified and principled manner she blazed new trails for women in politics.\\" Palin paid tribute to her on Facebook, expressing gratitude for having been able to work with her the year before and saying, \\"She broke one huge barrier and then went on to break many more. May her example of hard work and dedication to America continue to inspire all women.\\" Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement that, \\"Gerry Ferraro was one of a kind - tough, brilliant, and never afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what she believed in - a New York icon and a true American original.\\" A funeral Mass was held for her on March 31 at the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in New York, the site where Ferraro and Zaccaro had been married and had renewed their vows on their 50th anniversary the year before. Figures from local, state, and national politics were present, and Mondale and both Clintons were among the speakers. She is buried in St. John Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens, within her old congressional district. When Hillary Clinton finally captured the Democratic nomination in the 2016 presidential election, becoming the first woman to do so for a major party, there was considerable media commentary recalling, and relating this to, Ferraro's breakthrough thirty-two years earlier.","output":"The text is about Geraldine Anne \\"Gerry\\" Ferraro, an American attorney, Democratic Party politician, and member of the United States House of Representatives.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The Speedpass is a keychain RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) device introduced in 1997 by Mobil Oil Corporation, now ExxonMobil, for electronic payment. It was originally developed by Verifone, a company known for providing technology solutions for electronic payments. When Speedpass was launched, it represented a significant innovation in the field of contactless payments, making it more convenient for customers to pay for goods and services, particularly at gas stations and convenience stores. The device is designed to be attached to a keychain, allowing users to simply wave the device in front of a reader to complete transactions. RFID technology used in the Speedpass system enables devices to store information and communicate with other devices through the use of radiofrequency signals. In the case of Speedpass, the device is linked to a customer's credit or debit card account, which is then billed for the purchases made using the Speedpass device. The development of Speedpass by Verifone was a joint effort between the technology company and Mobil Oil Corporation, with both companies seeking to improve and streamline the payment process for customers. The small, portable nature of the Speedpass device, as well as the ease of use it offered, made it attractive to consumers who were looking for faster and more convenient payment options. The adoption of Speedpass quickly expanded throughout the United States, with millions of consumers across the country making use of the convenient payment method. In addition to gas stations and convenience stores, the system was eventually adopted by other businesses such as fast food chains, parking lots, and even some vending machines. Since its introduction, the technology behind Speedpass has evolved and improved considerably. Today, contactless payment systems like mobile payment platforms and NFC-enabled credit cards have become more prevalent, offering similar convenience to consumers. However, the Speedpass system played a crucial role in the development and popularization of contactless payments, paving the way for the various payment solutions we see today."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What painting possibly influenced the painting The Swimming Hole? from the following article ? Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while...

Tuck your bales tightly together. Continue alternating the direction for each layer. Do four layers total for the most stability. Fill the pallet to capacity. Article:","output":"Title: Essential Tips for Stacking Hay Bales Properly: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction Stacking hay bales effectively and safely is vital in preserving the quality of the hay while preventing unnecessary accidents and losses. Stacking them properly ensures that the bales retain their shape, remain accessible, and are protected from pests and dampness. In this article, we will elaborate on a step-by-step method for stacking hay bales on a pallet to maximize stability and optimize storage capacity. 1. Preparing the Stacking Area Before you start stacking the hay bales, it is essential to prepare the storage area. Choose a clean, dry, and well-ventilated place that keeps the hay protected from moisture, pests, and direct sunlight. Place a pallet or a platform on the ground to create a stable and elevated base for the hay bales, which helps in maintaining air circulation and prevents moisture accumulation. 2. Positioning the First Layer Place the first layer of hay bales on the pallet with their cut side facing up. This orientation ensures that the denser, more tightly bound side of the bale is in contact with the surface below, providing a stable base. Align the bales tightly together, side by side, covering the entire surface of the pallet without leaving any gaps. Packing the bales close together prevents them from shifting and increases the stability of the entire stack. 3. Stacking the Second Layer For the second layer of hay bales, place them on top of the first layer with the top side facing up, which is the opposite of the orientation you used for the first layer. This alternating placement pattern is crucial for maintaining the balance of the stack. Additionally, this arrangement allows for better ventilation between the bales, reducing the chances of mold growth and spoilage. 4. Continuing the Pattern For each subsequent layer of hay bales, continue alternating the direction of the bales as you stack them. This technique ensures that the hay bales interlock, providing stability and rigidity to the entire stack. Keep in mind that spacing between the bales can cause the stack to become unstable, so make sure you tuck the bales tightly together. 5. Four Layers for Optimal Stability While the number of layers you can stack may depend on various factors such as the height of your storage area or the type of hay you are storing, a general rule of thumb is to create a stack of four layers for most situations. This height provides the most optimal stability and weight distribution for the hay bales, preventing potential accidents or collapses. 6. Filling the Pallet to Capacity As you reach the final layer of the stack, make sure to fill the entire pallet space to capacity to maximize storage. Ensure that the top layer bales are also positioned tightly together, leaving no gaps between them. A full pallet is more stable and offers greater resistance to shifting or toppling compared to a partially filled one. Conclusion Stacking hay bales correctly is crucial for preserving the quality of your hay and preventing mishaps in your storage area. By following the guidelines outlined in this article, you can optimize available storage space and maintain a stable, safe, and efficiently managed haystack. Always remember to handle and stack hay bales with care and caution, as accidents can happen even with proper stacking techniques. Regularly inspect your stacks for signs of deterioration, instability, or pest infestation, and take appropriate action if necessary. By doing so, you will ensure a safe and long-lasting hay management system."},{"instruction":"What was the full name of the school Sir Alexander Mackenzie was principal of? Answer the above question based on the context below: Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first... The answer to this question is:","output":"The Royal Academy of Music.

The jam's vibrant color, bright red and inviting, lured her in, reminding her of the ripe fruits she used to enjoy during her childhood summers at her grandparents' home. Moreover, the jam's consistency, with tiny bits of fruit still present, provided an enjoyable texture as she spread it generously onto her bread. Butter, on the other hand, seemed too ordinary and familiar to her. She found it mundane in taste and appearance, offering little excitement when compared to the jam. Perhaps, if the butter was infused with herbs or spices, she might have considered it an equal contender, but today, it simply couldn't compete with the enticing sweetness of the jam.

We know that the man performs 3/5 of the total journey by rail, 17/20 by bus, and the remaining 6.5 km on foot. We can express this information as follows: Total journey by rail = (3/5)x Total journey by bus = (17/20)x Total journey on foot = 6.5 km The sum of these three journeys should equal the total journey (x). So, (3/5)x + (17/20)x + 6.5 = x Now, let's solve this equation step-by-step to find the value of x. 1. Find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 20 is 20. Therefore, we need to rewrite the (3/5)x term with a denominator of 20: (3/5)x = (12/20)x 2. Rewrite the equation with the equivalent fractions. (12/20)x + (17/20)x + 6.5 = x 3. Combine the like terms (the terms in x). (12/20)x + (17/20)x = (12 + 17)/20 * x = (29/20)x 4. Subtract this term from the right side of the equation. 6.5 = x - (29/20)x 5. Rewrite the equation, adding the fractions. (1 - 29/20)x = 6.5 6. Simplify the fraction. (1 - (29/20))*x = (-9/20)x = 6.5 7. Solve for x. x = 6.5 / (-9/20) x = 6.5 * (-20/9) x = -130 Since the distance can't be negative, let's check for the sum of the given journey parts: Total journey by rail = (3/5)x = (3/5)(-130) = -78 km Total journey by bus = (17/20)x = (17/20)(-130) = -110.5 km Adding these values results in a negative sum, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

He was a mountain man (fur trapper), wilderness guide, Indian agent, and U.S. Army officer. Carson became a frontier legend in his own lifetime via biographies and news articles. Exaggerated versions of his exploits were the subject of dime novels. In August 1826, against his mother's wishes, Kit ran away from his apprenticeship. He went west with a caravan of fur trappers, tending their livestock. They made their trek over the Santa Fe Trail to Santa Fe, the capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico, reaching their destination in November 1826. Kit settled in Taos. Carson lived with Mathew Kinkead, a trapper and explorer who had served with Carson's older brothers during the War of 1812. Carson was mentored by Kinkead in learning the skills of a trapper, while learning the necessary languages for trade. Eventually he became fluent in Spanish and several Indian languages. Workman put an advertisement in a local newspaper back in Missouri. He wrote that he would give a one cent reward to anyone who brought the boy back to Franklin. No one claimed the reward. It was a bit of a joke, but Carson was free. The advertisement featured the first printed description of Carson: \\"Christopher Carson, a boy about 16 years old, small of his age, but thick set; light hair, ran away from the subscriber, living in Franklin, Howard county, Missouri, to whom he had been bound to learn the saddler's trade.\\" Between 1827 and 1829, Carson worked as cook, translator, and wagon driver in the southwest. He also worked at a copper mine near the Gila River in southwestern New Mexico. In later life, Carson never mentioned any women from his youth. There are only three specific women mentioned in his writing: Josefa Jaramillo, his third and last wife; a comrade's mother in Washington, DC; and Mrs. Ann White, a victim of Indian atrocities. In 1845, Carson guided Fremont on their third and last expedition. They went to California and Oregon. Fremont made scientific plans, but the expedition appeared to be political in nature. Fremont may have been working under secret government orders. President Polk wanted the province of Alta California for the United States. Once in California, Fremont started to rouse the American settlers into a patriotic fever. The Mexican government ordered him to leave. Fremont went north to Oregon, though not before instigating the Sacramento River massacre, in which at least 150 Indians were killed in an unprovoked attack. The party moved up along the Sacramento River, continuing to kill Indians as they went, then camped near Klamath Lake. Messages from Washington, DC made it clear that President Polk wanted California. At Klamath Lake in southern Oregon, Fremont's party was hit in a revenge attack by 15-20 Indians on the night of May 9, 1846. Two or three men in camp were killed. The attackers fled after a brief struggle. Carson was angry that his friends had been killed. He took an axe and avenged the death of his friends by chopping away at a dead Indian's face. Fremont wrote, \\"He knocked his head to pieces.\\" In retaliation for the attack, a few days later Fremont's party massacred a village of Klamath people along the Williamson River in the Klamath Lake massacre. The entire village was razed and at least 14 men, women and children were killed. There was no evidence that the village in question had anything to do with the previous attack. Carleton had chosen a bleak site on the Pecos River for his reservation. This reservation was called Bosque Redondo (Round Grove). He chose this site for the Apaches and Navajos because it was far from white settlements. He also wanted these Apaches and Navajo to act as a buffer for any aggressive acts committed upon the white settlements from Kiowas and Comanches to the east of Bosque Redondo. He thought as well that the remoteness and desolation of the reservation would discourage white settlement. The Mescalero Apaches walked 130 miles (210 km) to the reservation. By March 1863, four hundred Apaches had settled around nearby Fort Sumner. Others had fled west to join fugitive bands of Apaches. By middle summer, many of these people were planting crops and doing other farm work. On July 7, Carson, with little heart for the Navajo roundup, started the campaign against the tribe. His orders were almost the same as those for the Apache roundup: he was to shoot all males on sight, and take the women and children captives. No peace treaties were to be made until all the Navajo were on the reservation. Carson searched far and wide for the Navajo. He found their homes, fields, animals, and orchards, but the Navajo were experts at disappearing quickly and hiding in their vast lands. The roundup proved frustrating for Carson. He was in his 50s, tired, and ill. By autumn 1863, Carson started to burn the Navajo homes and fields, and remove their animals from the area. The Navajo would starve if this destruction continued. One hundred eighty-eight Navajo surrendered. They were sent to Bosque Redondo. Life at the Bosque had turned grim. Murders occurred. The Apaches and Navajos fought. The water in the Pecos contained minerals that gave people cramps and stomach aches. Residents had to walk 12 miles (19 km) to find firewood. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Was Carson successful in his campaign?","output":"Yes, Carson was successful in his campaign. As the text states, \\"By autumn 1863, Carson started to burn the Navajo homes and fields, and remove their animals from the area. The Navajo would starve if this destruction continued.

To a small Arab town on the edge of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning to her life & a handsome Trappist monk fleeing from his crisis of faith. They will meet and passions will be stirred, but not even the Sand Diviner knows if they will find happiness or sorrow, here, in THE GARDEN OF ALLAH. The plot is pure hokum, but the film is still great fun & beautiful to look at. Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer are a superb screen couple. She is, to put it simply, gorgeous, and Boyer gives a most effective, understated performance, letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him. The supporting cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a sympathetic role as a Count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly, talkative guide (all the \\"Arabic\\" he & others speak in the film is pure gibberish); Lucile Watson as a gentle Mother Superior; Alan Marshal as an honorable young French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic porter; John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner; and magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest. Movie mavens will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones & Bonita Granville (peeking over the nun's shoulder) as convent girls; gaunt Nigel De Brulier as a monastery lector; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel clerk, all uncredited.

A: Answer:","output":"Natural methods of asexual reproduction, such as cuttings or budding, include strategies that plants have developed to perform rapid and efficient propagation, successful colonization, and genetic uniformity without the need for sexual reproduction through pollination and seed production. 1. Rapid and efficient propagation: Asexual reproduction allows plants to multiply quickly, generating a larger population in a short amount of time. This is particularly beneficial for plants in environments where resources are abundant, and competition for space or sunlight is intense. Cuttings and budding enable the parent plant to generate genetically identical offspring, or clones, that can rapidly cover an area and increase the plant's chances of survival. 2. Successful colonization: Asexual reproduction helps plants expand their geographic range and colonize new environments by generating many identical offspring that can grow even under challenging conditions. These clones have the same genetic adaptations as their parent plant, growing and reproducing successfully in a specific environment. For example, when a fragmented piece of stem or leaf from a parent plant is relocated by wind or water to a new area, it can develop roots and grow into a new individual, establishing itself in the new environment. 3. Genetic uniformity: Asexual reproduction allows plants to maintain genetic uniformity within populations. This means that the genetic traits of the parent plant are passed down to the offspring without any modifications through sexual reproduction. Genetic uniformity can be advantageous in stable environments where the parent plant's traits are well-suited for survival and reproduction. This allows the clones to thrive in the same conditions as the parent plant, maximizing their capability to grow and reproduce. Thus, natural methods of asexual reproduction like cuttings and budding enable plants to perform tasks that ensure rapid propagation, successful colonization of new environments, and preservation of genetic uniformity within their populations."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Generating a context and hypothesis: Context: The local government wants to address the increasing obesity rates in the community.

He never had the opportunity to know his biological father, who had died before Carl was born. Franklin was raised by his mother and stepfather. While Franklin speaks highly of his stepfather and has called him \\"very loving,\\" he has spoken out about his stepfather's abusive tendencies, linking his outbursts to alcohol use. Context: Upon completion of a BA degree in Theater Arts, Franklin almost immediately moved to New York City with hopes of becoming an actor. One of his first jobs was acting in the New York Shakespeare Festival, where he appeared in the Twelfth Night, Timon of Athens, and Cymbeline. Pursuing his love of acting with an on-stage career, Franklin performed off-Broadway with The Public Theater. He has performed at many well-known public arenas such as Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the Joseph Papp Public Theater in New York, as well as the Arena Stage (Washington, D.C.). With experience under his belt on the off-Broadway circuit, Franklin began his on-screen career with a film called Five on the Black Hand Side in 1973. From there, he acted in a string of guest roles on television shows such as The Rockford Files, Good Times, Caribe, The Incredible Hulk, McClain's Law, and The Streets of San Francisco. Over the years, Franklin's looks have typically landed him roles portraying men of power, such as members of the police force or military officials. Franklin's most recognizable acting role was his 1983-1985 portrayal of Captain Crane on the popular action-adventure series The A-Team. After two seasons on the show, Franklin realized that acting had become mundane and unsatisfying to him. He began to experiment with filmmaking, getting his feet wet with writing and production. Franklin is quoted in L.A. Weekly, saying \\"Acting made a director out of me.\\" And so, at age 37, Franklin made an important decision to return to school in 1986. This time, he chose the AFI Conservatory in Los Angeles, where he studied film directing, studying mostly the works of European and Japanese directors. He obtained his M.F.A. degree in directing in 1986. His time at AFI culminated in a life-changing project. For his master's thesis, Franklin produced a short film called Punk in 1989. The film follows the story of an African-American boy faced with the realities of familial stress, societal pressures, and the ever-daunting development of sexual discovery. Franklin's 30-minute film can be attributed to both failure and success. The production of the film cost Franklin his home and left him in a state of financial crisis, however, the impactful final product gained him attention in an industry that is nearly impossible to infiltrate. From there, his vision carried him through a successful career. Question: Did he act in any othe rmovies?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Carl Franklin acted in other movies besides Five on the Black Hand Side (1973). After making his film debut, Franklin continued to work in both television and cinema. In addition to his numerous guest appearances in television series mentioned earlier, some of his other notable film roles include: 1. High Velocity (1976) - A Philippines war drama film, where Franklin played the role of Clete. 2. Another Man, Another Chance (1977) - This film, also known as Un Autre Homme, Une Autre Chance, is a French Western movie, in which Franklin appeared as Simon. 3. Chameleons (1989) - A television movie, in which Franklin portrayed the character of Detective Garry Lennox. While Carl Franklin's acting career contains several film roles, it is important to note that he eventually began to feel limited in his acting pursuits. This led him to pursue filmmaking, screenwriting, and directing. His shift of focus from acting to filmmaking ultimately helped Franklin build a highly respected career as a director, with notable works such as One False Move (1992), Devil in a Blue Dress (1995), and Out of Time (2003). Despite having a more prolific career as a director, his acting experience played a significant role in laying the foundation for his accomplishments in the film industry."},{"instruction":"Billy loved climbing, and he eventually suffered a brain injury due to what?

There is a widely held local tradition that St Denys' was used during the English Civil War (1642–51) as a barracks for parliamentary troops who destroyed the interior furnishings. The local historian Trollope stated that the soldiers looted the brass eagle lectern (last recorded in 1622), broke the stained glass windows and the organ, and stole valuables. Whether this damage occurred or not, repairs to the windows and roof were carried out in 1657, paid for by public subscription. Galleries were also added to the church in the 18th century: the south in 1758, west in 1772, and north in 1783–84. In 1772, Edward Evans, a ship's surgeon on HMS Egmont, donated £300 to replace the organ with one built by Samuel Green of London.For most of the 19th century, the Anglican community dominated Sleaford's civic bodies, including the Board of Guardians, who oversaw the workhouse, and the Local Board of Health. Dr Richard Yerburgh and his son, Richard, were vicars in 1809–51 and 1851–82 respectively and had family connections with the local builders Kirk and Parry; Yerburgh and Thomas Parry (one half of the firm) were on the Board of Guardians and were labelled members of a \\"family party\\" by opponents during the Board's 1870 elections (they were nonetheless re-elected). They and other local clergymen were key players in the establishment of National schools in Sleaford and Quarrington, which Kirk and Parry built. The Anglican congregation, at an estimated 700 to 800 people in 1851 (St Denys' had enough space for 743 people), was less than half of the size of the nonconformist community, which was probably larger than 2,000 and tended to flourish in poorer parts of the town.The 19th century also witnessed two major restorations to St Denys'.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Experience Unparalleled Solitude: Discovering the Secluded Islands of Tristan da Cunha and Bear Island Introduction: When one thinks of islands, the image that most likely comes to mind is that of swaying palm trees, white sand beaches, and turquoise waters. However, for those adventurers who find themselves seeking uncharted territories and a truly unique island experience, there are places that offer an entirely different kind of allure: the islands of Tristan da Cunha and Bear Island. Step 1: Introduce Tristan da Cunha Nestled in the South Atlantic Ocean, Tristan da Cunha is a group of isolated volcanic islands situated 1,750 miles southwest of South Africa. Considered the world's most remote inhabited archipelago, this British Overseas Territory consists of the main island and several smaller islands, with a population of just around 260 people. Justification: Introducing Tristan da Cunha as a unique destination for travelers seeking solitude and a remote island experience. Step 2: Describe the attractions of Tristan da Cunha Tristan da Cunha's allure lies in its isolation and rugged beauty. Travelers who venture to this remote island can expect awe-inspiring volcanic landscapes, a rich and diverse wildlife, and an incredibly tight-knit community that welcomes visitors with open arms. Some highlighted attractions include: - The 6,765-foot-tall Queen Mary's Peak, the highest point on the island, providing panoramic views of the changing landscape. - Wildlife such as the endangered Northern Rockhopper Penguins, which can be found on the nearby Nightingale Island, and the Tristan albatross, which makes its home on Gough Island, a UNESCO World Heritage site. - Learning about the unique culture and history of the hardy islanders, who have managed to establish a resilient and self-sufficient lifestyle amidst the rugged terrain and isolation. Justification: Providing readers with a glimpse of what to expect when visiting Tristan da Cunha, showcasing its distinctive charm and attractions.

Justification: Introducing Bear Island as another option for adventurers seeking a remote and secluded island experience. Step 4: Describe the attractions of Bear Island While Bear Island may not be bustling with inhabitants or feature palm-fringed shores, it offers its own unique set of attractions for those willing to explore its inhospitable terrains: - A diverse range of birdlife, including guillemots, kittiwakes, and puffins, due to its history as a protected nature reserve. - The Miseryfjellet mountain, a challenging hike for those who want to be rewarded with stunning views of the surrounding wilderness. - Arctic flora, such as the delicate Svalbard poppy, which can be found during the brief Arctic summer months. Justification: Offering readers insight into what makes Bear Island a worthwhile destination for travelers seeking solitude and untouched nature.

It has also become a model for others by showing that it is possible to become self-supporting in a universe where many rely on outside financial support, Mr. Marvy said. Mary Seton Corboy, 50, a former chef with a master’s degree in political science, co-founded Greensgrow in 1998 with the idea of growing lettuce for the restaurants in downtown Philadelphia. Looking for cheap land close to their customers, Ms. Corboy and her business partner at the time, Tom Sereduk, found the site and persuaded the local Community Development Corporation to buy it and then rent it to them for 150 a month, a sum they still pay. They made an initial investment of 25,000 and have spent about 100,000 over the years on items that included the plastic-covered greenhouses and the soil that had to be trucked in to cover the steel-and-concrete foundation of the old factory site. “The mission was: How do you take postindustrial land and turn it into some kind of green business?” said Ms. Corboy, an elfin woman with the ruddy cheeks of someone who works long hours out of doors. She approached her early lettuce-growing operation with conventional business goals and little thought for what an urban farm could achieve. “I thought you didn’t have to have a relationship with the community,” she said. “You would just be a business person.” Customers said the farm was a breath of fresh air in a gritty neighborhood. “It’s a little piece of heaven,” said Janet McGinnis, 47, who lives on nearby Girard Avenue. “We live in the city, and it makes me feel good to wake up and see flowers.” Ms. McGinnis said she could buy herbs, bread and produce elsewhere but did so at Greensgrow because it is part of the community. “We’ve got to keep it in the community,” she said. “We have to give back.” Despite the community goodwill, the farm lives with urban problems like theft and violence. “I have gone through every tool in the box eight or nine times,” Ms. Corboy said. Although no one at Greensgrow is getting rich from the operation — after 10 years’ work, Ms. Corboy is making an annual salary of 65,000 — there is a sense that their time has come. “Ten years ago when I said we were going green, people thought we were out of our minds,” Ms. Corboy said. “Now we are top of the party list.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Where Industry Once Hummed, Urban Garden Finds Success.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend. Mary decided to candy the fruit, while Ann decided to eat them fresh, Mary received plums, peaches, apples and oranges. Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries. Which fruit retained their quality longer apples or pears? The answer to this question is:","output":"Candied apples retained their quality longer than fresh pears. Candying fruit, as mentioned earlier, is a preservation method that involves immersing the fruit in heated sugar syrup which eventually absorbs the moisture within the fruit, preventing spoilage through unfavorable osmotic pressure. This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for up to a year. In this scenario, Mary decided to candy the apples she received. On the other hand, Ann chose to eat her pears fresh. Fresh fruits, when not subjected to any preservation method, have a considerably shorter shelf life compared to candied fruits. Most pears have a shelf life ranging from a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on factors such as their ripeness, storage conditions, and variety. Given the difference in preservation methods chosen by Mary and Ann, the candied apples retained their quality longer than the fresh pears. Candied apples can last significantly longer due to the sugar content inhibiting microbial growth, whereas fresh pears will likely spoil within days or weeks."},{"instruction":"7.

Quinn had been waiting all summer for it to be warm enough to go to the pool. This means that Quinn is looking forward to spending time at the pool, which implies a level of interest and enjoyment in swimming. 2. If Quinn was afraid of the water, they would likely not be eager to go to the pool and would not be waiting for it to be warm enough to swim. 3. Similarly, if Quinn was a nervous swimmer, it is less likely that they would be eagerly awaiting the opportunity to swim at the pool, as nervous swimmers may feel anxiety or fear when swimming.

This search involves scanning through player rosters and other team records. Step 3: Gathering and evaluating information, matching it to the question's requirements. As I search, I find that one notable player who wore number 32 for the New York Yankees is Elston Howard. Elston Howard played as a catcher and outfielder for the Yankees from 1955 to 1967 and was the first African American player on the team. After completing these steps, I can confirm that Elston Howard is an example of a player who wore number 32 for the New York Yankees."},{"instruction":"How is \\" Mr President, the Palestinian and Israeli electorates have indeed dealt us a complicated hand.\\" said in German?","output":"\\"Sehr geehrter Herr Präsident, die palästinensische und israelische Wählerschaft haben uns in der Tat eine komplizierte Situation präsentiert.\\" In this translation, I've tried to convey the meaning of the original sentence while keeping in mind the nuances of the German language. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the translation: - \\"Sehr geehrter Herr Präsident\\" is a formal and polite way of addressing the President in German, comparable to \\"Mr. President\\" in English. - \\"die palästinensische und israelische Wählerschaft\\" refers to the Palestinian and Israeli electorates. In German, the noun \\"Wählerschaft\\" represents the collective electorate, while the adjectives \\"palästinensische\\" and \\"israelische\\" refer to Palestinian and Israeli, respectively. - \\"haben uns in der Tat\\" translates to \\"have indeed\\" and is used to emphasize the fact that the situation is truly and without question complicated. - \\"eine komplizierte Situation\\" means \\"a complicated situation\\". It is worth noting that although the original English sentence uses the expression \\"dealt us a complicated hand\\" in a metaphorical sense, the German language doesn't have an exact equivalent expression. Therefore, I translated this to \\"eine komplizierte Situation\\", which conveys the same sentiment but in a more literal manner. - \\"präsentiert\\" is the past participle of the verb \\"präsentieren\\", which means \\"to present\\" or \\"to deal\\". In this context, it is used to indicate that the Palestinian and Israeli electorates have presented this complicated situation to the speaker."},{"instruction":"Instructions: Given a sentence in English language, translate the sentence to Igbo language keeping the meaning of the original sentence intact Input: English sentence: Nórdico antiguo - Maria (India) Output:","output":"Part #1: Identify the main components of the input.

Which language is this?","output":"The language in the given text is Finnish. Finnish, also called Suomi, belongs to the Finno-Ugric language family and is primarily spoken in Finland. It is one of the two official languages of Finland, along with Swedish, and is also recognized as a minority language in some parts of Sweden and Norway. Finnish has been influenced by the surrounding languages, such as Swedish, Russian, and even German, throughout its history. The given Finnish phrase translated to English means: \\"The matter is a very necessary initiative, which deserves a lot of attention and support.\\" Finnish grammar and syntax are quite different from those of the Indo-European languages, which can make Finnish a challenging language to learn for speakers of English and other Indo-European languages. The Finnish language has 15 cases, including nominative, genitive, partitive, and inessive, which can be challenging for new learners, especially those accustomed to languages with fewer cases. Additionally, Finnish has vowel harmony, meaning that words typically only contain vowels from one of the two groups of vowels: front vowels (ä, ö, and y) and back vowels (a, o, and u). Front vowels rarely appear in the same word as back vowels, resulting in a harmonious vowel system. Finnish also relies heavily on the use of suffixes to convey meanings and modify words within sentences. It is an agglutinative language, meaning that different grammatical elements are expressed by adding various suffixes to a base form of the word. This can result in lengthy words with several suffixes combined, conveying various layers of meaning. In conclusion, the language identified in the given text is Finnish, a Finno-Ugric language primarily spoken in Finland. Its unique grammar, extensive use of cases, and agglutinative nature make Finnish a fascinating and complex language to learn and understand."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: 3 months ago 0900 Beeg seduced massage oil seduced massage","output":"It is unclear what the intended meaning of this sentence is, but I will attempt to add some punctuation to improve readability: 3 months ago, 09:00, Beeg: \\"Seduced massage oil, seduced massage.\\" Here are the steps and justifications: 1.

Answer the above question based on the context below: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - Marines, also known as a marine corps or naval infantry, are an infantry force that specializes in the support of naval and army operations at sea and on land, as well as the execution of their own operations. In the majority of countries, the marine force is part of the navy, but it can also be under the army like the \\"Troupes de marine\\" (French Marines) and \\"Givati Brigade\\" (Israeli Marines), or form an independent armed service branch like the United States Marine Corps. - The Confederate States, officially the Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized breakaway country of 11 secessionist slave states existing from 1861 to 1865. It was originally formed by seven slave states South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas in the Lower South region of the United States whose regional economy was mostly dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves. - A general officer is an officer of high rank in the army, and in some nations' air forces or marines. - Nathaniel Prentice (or Prentiss) Banks (January 30, 1816 September 1, 1894) was an American politician from Massachusetts and a Union general during the Civil War. - The Battle of Cedar Mountain, also known as Slaughter's Mountain or Cedar Run, took place on August 9, 1862, in Culpeper County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. Union forces under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks attacked Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson near Cedar Mountain as the Confederates marched on Culpeper Court House to forestall a Union advance into central Virginia. After nearly being driven from the field in the early part of the battle, a Confederate counterattack broke the Union lines resulting in a Confederate victory. The battle was the first combat of the Northern Virginia Campaign. - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history. - The Northern Virginia Campaign, also known as the Second Bull Run Campaign or Second Manassas Campaign, was a series of battles fought in Virginia during August and September 1862 in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War.

Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war. - Secession (derived from the Latin term \\"secessio\\") is the withdrawal of a group from a larger entity, especially a political entity (a country), but also any organization, union or military alliance.

As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation.

Naive physics reasoning involves drawing conclusions from the basic principles of real-world object interactions. In order to provide a detailed answer, I will explore multiple factors that contribute to an effective garbage disposal maintenance strategy. 1. Regular Cleaning: Ensuring that you clean your garbage disposal regularly, ideally after each use, can prevent food build-up and odors. You can do this by running cold water and a mild dish soap through the unit for a minute. After turning off the disposal, use a soft brush or cloth to clean the interior surfaces. Avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach, as they can damage the unit's blades and components. 2. Avoid putting unsuitable items in the disposal: Be mindful of the items you allow to enter the garbage disposal, as not everything can be processed. It's important to avoid greasy, fibrous, or starchy items that can clog or damage the appliance. Examples include: - Grease, oils, and fats: These can solidify and clog the unit or your pipes. - Fibrous foods: Celery, onion skins, and cornhusks can wrap around the blades, causing motor strain. - Starchy foods: Rice, pasta, and potatoes can create a sticky residue that may clog the blades. - Large bones: These can jam or damage the blades. 3. Maintaining sharp blades: It's crucial to keep the blades sharp so they can effectively grind food debris. You can sharpen them by grinding up cubed ice or eggshells in the disposal. Be sure to run cold water while grinding. 4. Freshening up the disposal: Combat odors by using natural, non-toxic methods. For instance, you can grind citrus peels (lemon, lime, or orange) or run a mixture of baking soda and vinegar through the unit, allowing it to sit for at least 15 minutes before flushing with cold water. 5. Running the garbage disposal with cold water: Always use cold water when running the garbage disposal, as it helps solidify any oils or grease, making them easier to grind. Using hot water can cause these substances to liquefy, leading to clogged pipes and possible damage to the unit. 6. Periodic inspections: Routinely inspect your garbage disposal for any evident damage, leaks, or loose connections. Addressing these issues promptly can prevent more significant problems from arising. In conclusion, the solution that accounts for the naive physics reasoning involves a combination of regular cleaning, proper waste disposal, maintaining sharp blades, combating odors using natural methods, running the unit with cold water, and conducting routine inspections. Adopting this comprehensive approach will ensure that your garbage disposal remains functional, clean, and safe to use for an extended period."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth. An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, \\"the worst came to the worst\\". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door. The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced. Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank.

In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit. - Computer hardware is the collection of physical components that constitute a computer system. Computer hardware is the physical parts or components of a computer, such as monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, hard disk drive (HDD), graphic card, sound card, memory (RAM), motherboard, and so on, all of which are tangible physical objects. By contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. - A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of the software and systems that make computers or anything containing software work. - In computing , mechanisms and techniques for managing services often differ by operating system . Examples of operating system service management are : Service Control Manager - Used by Microsoft Windows launchd - Used by Apple OS X Systemd - Used by most Linux Upstart - Used by Google Chrome OS Service Management Facility - Used by Oracle Solaris Android init - Used by Google Android sysvinit - Used by older Unix - like operating systems cygserver - Used by Cygwin runit - Used by Void - An information system (IS) is any organized system for the collection, organization, storage and communication of information. More specifically, it is the study of complementary networks that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and distribute data. - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology. - Software engineering (SWE) is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software. Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture. - In electronic systems and computing, firmware is a type of software that provides control, monitoring and data manipulation of engineered products and systems. Typical examples of devices containing firmware are embedded systems (such as traffic lights, consumer appliances, remote controls and digital watches), computers, computer peripherals, mobile phones, and digital cameras. The firmware contained in these devices provides the low-level control program for the device. As of 2013, most firmware can be updated. - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. - An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function. - System software, or systems software, is computer software designed to provide services to other software.

What is the relationship between 'operating system service management' and 'process'?","output":"Operating system service management and processes are closely related, yet they serve different functions within a computing system. To understand the relationship between the two, we must first define both terms. Operating system service management refers to the methods, mechanisms, and techniques that are responsible for controlling and managing system services within an operating system. System services are background tasks or processes that provide essential functionalities required for the proper functioning of the operating system and its applications. Examples of operating system service management tools include Microsoft Windows Service Control Manager, Apple macOS launchd, and Linux Systemd. A process, on the other hand, refers to an instance of a computer program that is being executed in a runtime environment. It consists of the program code and the current activity or state, such as variable values, program counter, and memory allocations. Processes are managed by the operating system, which oversees their creation, execution, and termination. Each process generally operates independently and is isolated from other processes that may be running concurrently, while sharing system resources like the CPU, memory, and I/O devices. Now, the relationship between operating system service management and processes can be described as follows: 1. Control and management: Operating system service management tools are responsible for managing processes as services within the context of the operating system. These tools perform tasks such as starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming services, as well as controlling their execution based on specific criteria or events. 2. Lifecycle management: The service management system helps manage the lifecycle of processes, from their initiation to termination, ensuring that they maintain their intended state and operate within defined parameters. This includes monitoring and managing resource usage, handling errors and exceptions, and maintaining the overall health and stability of the system. 3. Resource allocation: Both processes and services require access to system resources, such as CPU time, memory, and I/O devices. The operating system service management tools help allocate and manage these resources among the running processes, preventing resource conflicts and ensuring the smooth operation of the system. 4. Inter-process communication: Operating system service management tools are responsible for facilitating communication between different processes and services, allowing them to exchange data and coordinate their activities. This can involve mechanisms like pipes, sockets, and shared memory. 5. Security and privilege management: Service management tools are also responsible for maintaining the security and access control of services and processes. This includes managing user and group permissions, process isolation, and managing the privileges granted to services or processes. In summary, the relationship between operating system service management and processes is that the service management tools are responsible for controlling and managing the execution of processes as services, ensuring their proper functioning within the runtime environment of the operating system. These tools allow the processes to share resources, communicate with each other, maintain their intended state, and operate securely and efficiently."},{"instruction":"Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the character who has a farm in Connecticut? from the following article ?

Which language is this?","output":"The phrase \\"Miluju večírky\\" is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. It is closely related to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian languages. In English, this phrase can be translated as \\"I love parties.\\" Czech originated from the Proto-Slavic language, which is the common ancestor of all Slavic languages. The earliest written records of the Czech language can be traced back to the 12th century. Over time, Czech has undergone various changes and has been influenced by Latin, German, and other Slavic languages, including Old Church Slavonic. The Czech language uses the Latin alphabet with additional diacritic marks, known as háček (ˇ) and kroužek (˚), which distinguish it from other languages that also use the Latin script. These diacritics are used to indicate vowel length, consonant palatalization, or changes in pronunciation. Czech grammar is highly inflected and follows a complex syntactical structure. It is characterized by its use of cases for nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and even some numerals. There are seven cases in Czech: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. Verbs in Czech are conjugated according to tense, mood, voice, aspect, and person. Czech vocabulary reflects its rich history and cultural heritage. Borrowed words from Latin and German are common in the language, as well as loanwords from other languages, such as English and French, which are continuously adopted through globalization and technological advancements. However, the Czech language also tends to create new words by compounding or modifying existing words, staying true to its Slavic roots. In the Czech Republic, the language holds a significant cultural and national importance. Czech literature has a long and storied history, with notable authors such as Franz Kafka, Karel Čapek, and Milan Kundera making significant contributions to world literature. The Czech language is also widely taught and studied in schools and universities, promoting its continued development and preservation as a living language."},{"instruction":"Brownie?

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media, said at one point that the death toll had apparently risen to eight, but Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed Momani disputed that figure. The attack also wounded seven people, including two Americans, three Jordanians and a Lebanese, Momani said. He said authorities are investigating whether the attacker’s motive was personal or political. Jordan, a close U.S. ally that has a peace treaty with Israel, has long been seen as an island of relative stability in a turbulent region. Over the past year, the pro-Western kingdom has taken on a high-profile role in the fight against extremists, including the Islamic State group, which controls large areas of neighboring Iraq and Syria. There has been concern that militants could carry out revenge attacks on Jordanian soil. Fayez Dwairi, a strategic analyst and former senior military officer, said he could not recall such a deadly shooting attack inside a Jordanian security compound in his 36 years in the military. The government did not release the identity of the attacker, but a former member of parliament said authorities told him the shooter was 29-year-old Anwar Abu Zaid. The ex-parliamentarian, Suleiman Saed, is a relative of Abu Zaid. Abu Zaid’s brother, Fadi, told The Associated Press that Anwar was mentally stable and “not an extremist at all.” He said his brother, a father of two, joined the security forces at age 18, had been working at the training center for several months and had left for work as usual on Monday morning. Fadi Abu Zaid said the family demands to know about the circumstances of Anwar’s death and will not accept his body until the authorities release more information. In Washington, President Barack Obama said the attacker had been dressed in a military uniform. “We take this very seriously and will be working closely with the Jordanians to determine exactly what happened,” Obama said during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. U.S. forces in Afghanistan have come under attack on a number of occasions by local police and troops serving alongside them, in what are known as “green-on-blue” assaults. Such attacks have been extremely rare in the Middle East. A U.S. official said the Americans who were killed and wounded in the attack were part of a State Department police training program. The official said all were civilians, but declined to identify them. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Momani said the Jordanian killed in the attack was a civilian employee at the center. He said the wounded are being treated at Jordan’s main military hospital and were visited by King Abdullah II. About two hours after the shooting, dozens of armored vehicles were moving in and out of the large, walled training center on the outskirts of Amman. The center was established in 2003, and has trained 53,000 police officers from Iraq, 8,000 from the Palestinian territories and additional groups from other Arab countries, according to its website. “We have full confidence in our security measures, and the investigation will uncover the motivation behind what happened,” Momani told The Associated Press. In an earlier statement, he referred to the shooting as a crime. Associated Press writers Karin Laub in Southern Shuneh, Jordan, and Bradley Klapper and Josh Lederman in Washington contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are as follows: 1. A Jordanian police officer opened fire at a regional police training center in Amman, Jordan, killing two Americans, two Jordanians, and a South African before he was shot dead. 2. The attack wounded seven people, including two Americans, three Jordanians, and a Lebanese. Jordanian government spokesman, Mohammed Momani, stated that authorities are investigating whether the attacker's motives were personal or political. 3. Jordan is a close U.S. ally and has a peace treaty with Israel. The country has been seen as relatively stable amidst regional turmoil and has taken on a high-profile role in the fight against extremist groups like ISIS. 4. There has been concern that militants could carry out revenge attacks on Jordanian soil, although such 'green-on-blue' assaults have been extremely rare in the Middle East. 5. The attacker was identified as 29-year-old Anwar Abu Zaid by a former member of the Jordanian parliament. The attacker's brother claimed that Anwar was mentally stable and not an extremist. 6. U.S. President Barack Obama said the attacker had been dressed in a military uniform and the incident was being taken very seriously. The U.S. and Jordan would work together to determine exactly what happened. 7. The Americans who were killed and wounded in the attack were part of a State Department police training program. All the victims were civilians. 8. The Jordanian government referred to the shooting as a crime and stated that an investigation would uncover the motivation behind the attack."},{"instruction":"The Tech N9ne Mitch Bade lyrics are brought to you by Lyrics-Keeper.

Justification: 1. Waves hit the coast: No direct impact from human population increase occurs on the wave hitting the coast. 2. Waves have energy that pushes the water and sediment: Again, no direct impact from human population increase on the energy of the waves. 3. The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper: Human population increase can lead to land use changes (e.g. construction, urbanization), which may alter the rate of erosion or sediment distribution. However, this is still not a direct impact on the process. 4. Water washes the sediment back: Human population increase might affect water quality or lead to water engineering projects that could alter the natural washing process, thus indirectly impacting the step of the process. 5. Some sediment is left as sand: Human population increase could lead to increased tourism or recreational use of beaches, potentially affecting the amount of sediment left as sand, but this impact is also indirect. Overall, the impact of human population increase seems to indirectly impact the steps of the process, rather than directly changing how the process functions.

Below is a detailed and long negative review: Title: Disappointing Dining Disaster I am usually not one to leave negative reviews, but I feel the need to share my unfortunate experience at \\"The Elegant Eatery\\" to provide some insight for potential diners. I had high expectations after hearing so much praise from friends and reading countless positive reviews online, but my experience was anything but elegant. Upon arrival, I noticed that the ambiance, which is such a crucial aspect of any dining experience, struck me as underwhelming and dull. The lighting was too bright, creating a harsh glare, and the tables were crammed too close together, leaving no room for privacy or comfort. Service played a significant role in the disappointing evening. It took nearly 30 minutes for our server to greet us, after we were seated, and they seemed not only disinterested in our presence but also overwhelmed and disorganized. Throughout the night, the server repeatedly mixed up our orders and forgot essential items such as silverware, water refills, and condiments. Moreover, the food quality was severely lacking. I ordered the signature dish, the pan-seared halibut. From the menu description, I was expecting a perfectly cooked, flavorful fish, but what I received was overcooked, dry, and bland. Most astonishingly, the dish was lukewarm, indicating that it had been sitting around for a while before being brought to our table. A rather disappointing experience, given the restaurant's claim to use fresh, high-quality ingredients and exude culinary talent. My dining companion ordered the filet mignon, which was not cooked to the requested medium-rare and lacked seasoning. The accompanying sides and presentation were forgettable, making it difficult to justify the relatively high price of the dish. In addition to the subpar food and unresponsive service, the noise level in the restaurant was enough to drown out any attempt at conversation. It felt like we were dining in the middle of a chaotic market rather than an establishment that claims to provide an elegant dining experience. Unfortunately, the management made no real attempt to rectify these issues when we politely brought them up. Their dismissive attitude and lack of apologies truly made me feel like a burden rather than a valued customer. In summary, our experience at \\"The Elegant Eatery\\" was nothing short of a disaster. My high hopes were shattered by the uninspired ambiance, negligent service, inadequate food quality, unbearable noise levels, and the unapologetic management. I am genuinely disheartened by my experience and cannot, in good conscience, recommend \\"The Elegant Eatery\\" to anyone seeking a memorable and enjoyable dining experience. The restaurant's prestigious reputation falls flat, leaving much to be desired."},{"instruction":"Process: - A machine called a pulverizer grinds the coal into a fine powder - The coal powder mixes with hot air, which helps the coal burn more efficiently, and the mixture moves to the furnace - The burning coal heats water in a boiler, creating steam - Steam released from the boiler powers an engine called a turbine, transforming heat energy from burning coal into mechanical energy that spins the turbine engine - The spinning turbine is used to power a generator, a machine that turns mechanical energy into electric energy - This happens when magnets inside a copper coil in the generator spin - A condenser cools the steam moving through the turbine - As the steam is condensed, it turns back into water - The water returns to the boiler, and the cycle begins again - Question: suppose less coal will be mined happens, how will it affect LESS coal arriving at the power station.

It was at the centre of a conflict between Gray and Le Corbusier, while a later owner was murdered there in 1996. Now its long-drawn-out restoration is provoking accusations of botching and disrespecting Gray's work. Delicate, white and ship-like, E1027 is perched above a bay on the Cote d'Azur whose wildness was, when it was finished in 1929, the opposite of the worldly charms of nearby Monte Carlo. The bisexual Gray designed it with input from her then lover Jean Badovici, as a refuge for them both, and the name intertwines their initials: the E is for Eileen, the 10 and the 2 for the tenth and second letters of the alphabet, J and B, and the 7 is for G. Until then a designer mostly of furniture and interiors, this was Gray's first house, and its spaces unfolded from the furnishings, designed by her, to the landscape. Other modernists, Corbusier included, treated their houses as statements, and as proud temple-like objects, into which chairs and tables (also manifestos of design intent) might be inserted. Gray was lighter, more playful, subtly and carefully attuned to the sun and wind. Too much so for Le Corbusier. In 1938 and 1939 he stayed there as a guest of Badovici, who had by then parted from Gray, and painted murals, crude and garish, on its walls. He did so, as one photograph records, nude. Seemingly affronted that a woman could create such a fine work of modernism, he asserted his dominion, like a urinating dog, over the territory. Gray saw his painting as a violation, and was furious. He, however, didn't stop there: he acquired land nearby and built his own retreat, a wooden cabanon, above the stretch of sea in which, in 1965, he would die. As an act of naked phallocracy, Corbusier's actions are hard to top, for which reason the E1027 story is now widely known and taught in architectural schools, as emblematic of the sexual politics of modern architecture. But the site is also significant for the grace and quality of the house, and for the rarity of its being designed by a woman: the architectural profession is still disproportionately male, and in the 1920s was much more so. Le Corbusier's cabanon, meanwhile, is also remarkable. Since 2000 Gray's house has been the responsibility of the commune of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, contracted to them by its owners, the Conservatoire du Littoral, and it has proved a burdensome responsibility for this small authority. They originally wanted to follow the advice of a young architect Renaud Barres, who had produced a study on the possible restoration of the house, and to work with another architect, Burkhardt Rukschcio, who has won awards for his restoration of modernist buildings. The Ministry of Culture, however, which supplied half the funding, encouraged the appointment of the chief architect for historic monuments in the region, Pierre-Antoine Gatier. Unquestionably knowledgeable about restoration, Gatier however had little experience of modern buildings. ¤600,000 and several years later the restoration is incomplete, and its permanent opening date uncertain. Barres and Rukschcio have produced a dossier which details, with convincing photographic evidence, departures from Gray's intent: thickening of metal rails, original glazing and light switches replaced by standard 21st-century products, a stair clumsily misplaced and mis-dimensioned, a colour scheme different from the 1929 version. It is also, for now, devoid of furniture, the originals having been sold through Sotheby's in the early 90s. As one Eileen Gray chair sold for 28m in 2009, breaking the record for 20th-century furniture, it is not feasible to return the originals, but without her pieces the interiors are quite unlike those she first made. Le Corbusier's repulsive paintings meanwhile, still dominate – the sane thing would be, if not to destroy them, to relocate them, but as they are also items of heritage this is unlikely. Jean-Louis Dedieu, the deputy mayor in charge of the project, defends it. Some adjustments of detail, he says, were necessary to deal with the corrosive effects of sea air, \\"while respecting the philosophy of the place\\". He cites as justification Eileen Gray's own words, that \\"nothing is fixed, everything must evolve\\". He has not, however, placated the critics: the architectural writer Michael Webb has described E1027's current state as \\"tragic\\", and Le Monde has got on the case. The British architect John Allan, who is experienced in restoring modernist buildings, found \\"disturbing evidence of a project that was poorly conceived and inadequately executed\\". It is not all doom and gloom. Thanks to the efforts of the commune E1027 is at least in a better state than it was in the late 90s, when it was close to disintegration. Zeev Aram, who runs the London modern furniture shop Aram Store, and who was a leading figure in the rediscovery of Gray in the 1970s, is supplying replica furniture. Eileen Gray is also the subject of a film, The Price of Desire, with Shannyn Sossamon and Alanis Morissette, being made by the Irish director Mary McGuckian. It will, says McGuckian, \\"be about the way she underpinned 20th-century architecture\\". She says that much of it will be centred on E1027, with Le Corbusier, played by Vincent Perez, portrayed as Salieri to Gray's Mozart. The film production is helping to support some parts of the restoration, including the replication of those lost light switches. The ever-increasing interest in Gray should also be to the good, and there is no shortage of eminent architects who would like to support a work of this significance. There is plenty of goodwill and interest, the only question being how they are directed. There is talk of a not-for-profit foundation taking over responsibility – in principle an excellent idea, depending on who exactly makes up the organisation. It would need real commitment and expertise, and no egomania. There is also talk that the whole site, including the cabanon, might be sorted out and made suitable for visiting by the time the next big anniversary comes round. This is 2015, the half-centenary of Le Corbusier's death. Even now, it seems, his colonisation of what was first Eileen's place is hard to escape. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about Eileen Gray's E1027 house, a beautiful building that she designed and built with her lover Jean Badovici in 1929.

Right now, Eileen Gray's E1027 house is being restored, but some people are unhappy with how the restoration is going. They say the people working on the house are not respecting Gray's design and not doing a good job. The furniture in the house has been sold, so it doesn't look like how Gray originally designed it.

The Nirvana frontman, 27, had committed suicide, police later ruled, killing himself with a shotgun while high on heroin and pills. His death ended a battle with hard drugs and added Cobain to a long list of legendary musicians, such as Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, whose careers were cut short by their addictions. Cobain's ashes were reportedly scattered in a Washington state river and a New York Buddhist temple. Nirvana band mates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl eventually formed other bands. Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, stayed in the limelight with an acting career and legal problems surrounding her own drug problems. Frances Bean, the couple's daughter, has largely lived outside the public eye. What was unclear when Cobain died was whether the music Nirvana created would endure or fade away like the grunge craze it helped to inspire. \\"At one point I thought, 15 years on, no one would really know who Kurt Cobain was outside of a group of diehard fans,\\" said Jeff Burlingame, a Cobain biographer who grew up with the musician in Aberdeen, Washington, and knew him when he was a teenager who, without a place to sleep, crashed on mutual friends' couches.

It reached the peak of its military, political and economic power under the Spanish Habsburgs, through most of the 16th and 17th centuries, and its greatest territorial extent under the House of Bourbon in the 18th century, when it was the largest empire in the world. The Spanish Empire became the foremost global power of its time and was the first to be called \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\". - The Philippine Revolution (Filipino: \\"Himagsikang Pilipino\\"), also called the Tagalog War by the Spanish, was a revolution and subsequent conflict fought between the people of the Philippines and the Spanish colonial authorities. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

Originally the term \`\` Cry '' referred to the first clash between the Katipuneros and the Civil Guards ( Guardia Civil ) . The cry could also refer to the tearing up of community tax certificates ( cédulas personales ) in defiance of their allegiance to Spain . This was literally accompanied by patriotic shouts . Because of competing accounts and ambiguity of the place where this event took place , the exact date and place of the Cry is in contention . From 1908 until 1963 , the official stance was that the Cry occurred on August 26 in Balintawak . In 1963 the Philippine government declared a shift to August 23 in Pugad Lawin , Quezon City . - The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian dynasty.

If Kenneth paid 40 for an oz of fabric and bought 700oz, calculate the amount of money that Nicholas paid more than Kenneth for the fabric he bought. Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"Sure, let's analyze this problem step-by-step: 1. Kenneth bought 700 oz of fabric and paid 40 for each oz. To find out the total amount of money Kenneth paid for the fabric, we need to multiply the price per oz by the quantity he bought. Total cost for Kenneth = (price per oz) × (quantity of fabric) Total cost for Kenneth = 40 × 700 2. Nicholas bought six times as much fabric as Kenneth. To find out the total amount of fabric Nicholas bought, we need to multiply Kenneth's fabric quantity by 6. Total fabric for Nicholas = 6 × (Kenneth's fabric quantity) Total fabric for Nicholas = 6 × 700 3. Now that we have the total amount of fabric Nicholas bought, we can calculate the total amount of money Nicholas paid for the fabric by multiplying the price per oz by his quantity of fabric. Total cost for Nicholas = (price per oz) × (quantity of fabric for Nicholas) 4. To find the difference between the amount of money Nicholas paid and the amount of money Kenneth paid for their fabric, we need to subtract Kenneth's total cost from Nicholas's total cost. Now, let's calculate: Step 1: Total cost for Kenneth = 40 × 700 = 28,000 Step 2: Total fabric for Nicholas = 6 × 700 = 4,200 oz Step 3: Total cost for Nicholas = 40 × 4,200 = 168,000 Step 4: Difference between Nicholas and Kenneth's cost = 168,000 - 28,000 = 140,000 So, Nicholas paid 140,000 more than Kenneth for the fabric he bought."},{"instruction":"True as a Turtle is a 1957 British comedy film directed by Wendy Toye and starring John Gregson, Cecil Parker, June Thorburn and Keith Michell.

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - A category of fine art, graphic art covers a broad range of visual artistic expression, typically two-dimensional, i.e. produced on a flat surface. The term usually refers to the arts that rely more on line or tone than on color, especially drawing and the various forms of engraving; it is sometimes understood to refer specifically to printmaking processes, such as line engraving, aquatint, drypoint, etching, mezzotint, monotype, lithography, and screen printing (silk-screen, serigraphy). Graphic art further includes calligraphy, photography, painting, typography, computer graphics, and bindery. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs. - Philip Edward \\"Phil\\" Hartman (September 24, 1948May 28, 1998; born Hartmann) was a Canadian-American actor, voice actor, comedian, screenwriter and graphic artist. Born in Brantford, Ontario, Hartman and his family moved to the United States in 1958. After graduating from California State University, Northridge, with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands like Poco and America. Feeling the need for a more creative outlet, Hartman joined the comedy group The Groundlings in 1975 and there helped comedian Paul Reubens develop his character Pee-wee Herman. Hartman co-wrote the screenplay for the film \\"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\\" and made recurring appearances on Reubens' show \\"Pee-wee's Playhouse\\". - Black comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo. Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes. Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor. - Houseguest is a 1995 comedy film starring Sinbad and Phil Hartman and directed by Randall Miller . 'houseguest' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'color'?

As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - A bedtime story is a traditional form of storytelling, where a story is told to a child at bedtime to prepare the child for sleep. - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.

Truck city had an economy that was based on tourism, while Farm city was based on agriculture. Which city caused fewer dead zones? A:","output":"Dead zones are areas of depleted or reduced oxygen (hypoxia) in a water body, leading to a significant decline in aquatic life due to a lack of oxygen. Both tourism and agriculture can have detrimental effects on aquatic environments; however, without specific data, it is difficult to determine which city caused fewer dead zones directly. Nevertheless, we can discuss the possible pollution sources from both cities to determine the potential impact on the ocean. Truck City (Tourism-based economy): Tourism can lead to water pollution through various activities: 1. Inadequate wastewater treatment: Hotels and other tourist accommodations may release inadequately treated sewage directly into the ocean, leading to nutrient overloads and oxygen depletion. 2. Litter and debris: Tourists may leave behind waste materials like plastic, food waste, and other debris on the beach, which can get washed into the ocean. 3. Boating activities: Water-based recreational activities, such as boating and jet-skiing, can discharge pollutants like oil and fuel into the water. 4. Coastal construction: Building infrastructure to support tourism, like hotels, restaurants, and marinas can lead to sediment runoff, which can reduce water quality and oxygen levels. Farm City (Agriculture-based economy): Agriculture can lead to water pollution through several means, primarily related to the excessive use of agrochemicals and animal waste: 1. Nutrient pollution: The excessive application of fertilizers on crops can cause nutrient leaching, leading to eutrophication in water bodies. This process results in algal blooms, consuming oxygen and creating dead zones. 2. Pesticide contamination: Pesticides used in agriculture can leach into nearby water bodies, where they may be toxic to aquatic life. 3. Animal waste: Manure from livestock farming can carry excess nutrients, bacteria, parasites, and even hormones, which can enter water bodies through runoff, contaminating them and potentially contributing to dead zones. 4. Soil erosion: Poorly managed agricultural lands can lead to soil erosion, and sediment loading into nearby water bodies, reducing water quality and oxygen availability. Overall, based on the potential sources of pollution, Farm City (agriculture-based economy) might have a greater likelihood of causing dead zones due to nutrient pollution from fertilizers and animal waste, which can create eutrophication. However, it's essential to note that the actual impact would depend on the scale of operations, environmental regulations, and pollution control measures implemented in each city."},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? what's at the luxor in las vegas?","output":"The Luxor is a big hotel and casino in Las Vegas.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"If bees consume more food, it is likely to have a positive impact on honey production, as well as potentially influencing other aspects of their behavior and hive-building process. This increased food consumption is likely to result in more beeswax and propolis created. The perturbation, in this case, would lead to more honey being produced and potentially other effects related to hive construction. To understand the direct relationship between bees consuming more food and increased honey production, it's essential to break down the process of how bees create honey. When bees collect nectar from flowers, they store it in their \\"honey stomach,\\" a separate compartment from their regular stomach. They mix the nectar with enzymes as they regurgitate it from their honey stomach into the cells of the honeycomb. This mixture, placed in honeycomb cells, is then fanned by the bees' wings, evaporating the water content and turning it into honey. Once the honey reaches the desired consistency, bees cap each cell with beeswax to preserve it. So, if bees consume more food, their energy levels would likely increase, which could lead to a few possible scenarios: 1. More honey production: The increased energy leads to more foraging trips, thus collecting more nectar, which subsequently results in more honey being produced in the hive. 2. More beeswax and propolis production: In addition to producing honey, bees have specialized glands that convert sugars from honey into beeswax. If more food is consumed and converted into an energy surplus, bees may produce more beeswax to build and maintain their hive. Similarly, bees collect plant resin to produce propolis, a sticky substance used for sealing cracks in the hive. An increase in energy might also result in more propolis being collected and produced. 3. Population growth: An increase in food availability can lead to an overall healthier colony. With more food and higher energy levels, the queen bee might lay more eggs, resulting in a larger colony. This larger population could then collect even more food, further increasing honey production in the long run. In conclusion, if bees consume more food, it is likely to have a positive effect on honey production by allowing them to collect more nectar and convert it into honey more efficiently. In addition, the consumption of more food may lead to increased production of beeswax and propolis, promoting better hive construction and maintenance. Therefore, the perturbation in this case would lead to more honey being created, along with other positive effects on the bees' hive and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"Casey helped to set Remy's affairs in order in a neat and professional way.

Each block of stone in the station's construction measures the length of a person's leg, arm, and features varying colors, creating a checkerboard pattern. The modern preservation movement in the United States owes its existence to the fierce ten-year-long battle that took place in 1968 to prevent the construction of a massive office building over Grand Central Terminal. This struggle helped protect the architectural integrity and historical significance of the station. Today, nobody would consider altering the station's beauty and preserving its magnificence remains a priority for everyone involved. In conclusion, both Dan Brucker and Justin Ferate have a long-term connection with Grand Central Terminal, showcasing their interest and passion for the station. Dan Brucker has worked for the New York Transit Authority at the station for 30 years, while Justin Ferate has given tours of the station for the same period (30 years). Both of them admire, cherish, and contribute to the historical and architectural legacy of this iconic New York City landmark."},{"instruction":"Write a summary based on this article: Bill de Blasio, who transformed himself from a little-known occupant of an obscure office into the fiery voice of New York’s disillusionment with a new gilded age, was elected the city’s 109th mayor on Tuesday. His landslide victory, stretching from the working-class precincts of central Brooklyn to the suburban streets of southeast Queens, amounted to a forceful rejection of the hard-nosed, business-minded style of governance that reigned at City Hall for the past two decades and a sharp leftward turn for the nation’s largest metropolis. Mr. de Blasio, the city’s public advocate, defeated Joseph J. Lhota, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, by a margin of about 49 percentage points, with 99 percent of the vote counted. It was the most sweeping victory in a mayor’s race since 1985, when Edward I. Koch won by 68 points, and it gave Mr. de Blasio what he said was an unmistakable mandate to pursue his liberal agenda. ||||| Bill de Blasio overwhelmingly was elected mayor Tuesday, becoming the first Democrat to lead New York in 20 years and ushering in an era of activist liberal governance in the nation’s largest city. With 84 percent of precincts reporting results, de Blasio was trouncing Republican Joe Lhota, a protégé of former mayor Rudy Giuliani, by 73 percent to 24 percent early Wednesday. De Blasio campaigned on a mantle of progressive change following Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s 12 years in office, highlighting what he saw as “a tale of two cities.” The moneyed Manhattan elite have had their mayor, he argued, and now the 46 percent of New Yorkers living at or near the poverty level need one of their own. De Blasio’s administration will be a laboratory of sorts for modern progressivism — testing whether an anti-establishment activist can effectively manage a sprawling municipal government and lessen growing inequality between the rich and poor. “Tackling inequality isn’t easy. It never has been, and it never will be,” de Blasio said in a victory speech at the YMCA gymnasium in his Brooklyn neighborhood of Park Slope. “The challenges we face have been decades in the making, and the problems we set out to address will not be solved overnight. But make no mistake: The people of this city have chosen a progressive path. And tonight we set forth on it — together, as one city.” 1 of 31 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Elections around the country View Photos From Detroit to Virginia, a look at some of the races drawing voters to the polls Tuesday.

Chris Christie (R) exits a voting booth after casting his ballot at a polling center in Mendham, N.J. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. But de Blasio also faces a series of immediate challenges as he takes charge of a city government with some 300,000 employees, a 70 billion budget and a dizzying web of intersecting interests. He will have to negotiate several city labor contracts that are due for renewal and overhaul the leadership of agencies, including the New York Police Department, which he has sharply criticized for the anti-crime policy known as “stop and frisk.” De Blasio also confronts serious obstacles to his tax policy agenda beyond the borders of this overwhelmingly Democratic city, including potential opposition from Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers in Albany. “He walks into a new experiment,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a New York Democratic strategist. “How does a mayor bridge the income gap? It’s a very difficult set of circumstances. The president hasn’t been able to do it. The governors haven’t been able to do it.” Despite New York’s overwhelmingly liberal tilt, de Blasio will become New York’s first Democratic mayor in 20 years. He will follow the reigns of Bloomberg, a billionaire Republican-turned- independent, and Rudy Giuliani, a law-and-order Republican who led the city as it recovered from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Lhota ran as a continuation of the Bloomberg years, while attacking de Blasio as a leftist, anti-police extremist. The New York Post featured de Blasio on its front page Monday above the headline, “Back to the USSR!” — a reference to a student trip by de Blasio to the Soviet Union 30 years ago. But the attacks gained little traction. De Blasio’s friends say he is at once principled and practical, and that the business community will warm to him as he shifts from campaigning to governing. “He’s very reasonable,” said public relations strategist Matthew Hiltzik, a longtime friend. “He has a core set of beliefs, but he doesn’t go into things assuming he has all the answers.” A key pillar of de Blasio’s campaign was to expand pre- kindergarten classes — something President Obama has championed. De Blasio has said he would pay for it by raising taxes on residents making more than 500,000, subject to approval from the state legislature. Many de Blasio supporters believe his victory shows that talking plainly about higher taxes carries less political risk than assumed. “Most people regard raising taxes as a political killer, but Bill’s not afraid because he knows we need it,” Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) said in an interview before a Monday campaign appearance with de Blasio in the Bronx. But legislative leaders in Albany are skittish about the issue, especially with lawmakers standing for reelection in 2014. Democrats control the Assembly in the state capital, but Republicans have a slim majority in the Senate. Cuomo, who would have to sign any tax law, has said he supports expanding pre-K programs, but opposes raising taxes. The tax debate will be an early test of the new mayor’s relationship with the governor, who was President Bill Clinton's Housing and Urban Development secretary when de Blasio worked as a HUD appointee in New York and New Jersey. Such ties are typical for de Blasio, 52, who has built a network over decades in New York politics. He was Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign manager during her 2000 Senate race, then served eight years on the New York City Council before being elected as the city’s public advocate in 2009. De Blasio’s blunt discussion of wealth has resonated with many voters, especially African Americans and disenchanted liberal whites. The issue helped fuel his surge from fourth place in a crowded Democratic field in early summer to head of the pack by the September primary, when he defeated City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. The Brooklyn resident has said he would become the first mayor in the city’s history with children enrolled in public schools. “He knows our issues because he has children in the trenches with us,” said Freddie Sneed Jr., 55, a truck driver. Jef Pollock, a New York-based pollster who worked on de Blasio’s 2009 campaign for public advocate, said de Blasio has built a diverse coalition of supporters by tapping into emotions surrounding income disparity and resentment over Bloomberg’s Manhattan-focused mayoralty. “That reliance on old-school, coalition politics, where we just assume that people are going to vote for the candidate who looks and sounds like them — that mold has been broken,” Pollock said. On the campaign trail, de Blasio played up his solidarity with the often-neglected outer boroughs. At Monday’s rally in the Rochdale Village housing complex in Queens, city parks employee William Hightower said, “It’s about time we had change. “Classism here is a huge problem,” Hightower, 48, said. “It’s haves and have-nots. But he understands about the have-nots.” On Tuesday night, de Blasio’s victory speech was perfectly pitched to the have-nots. “The growing inequality we see, the crisis in affordability we face, it has been decades in the making,” de Blasio said. “But its slow creep upon this city cannot weaken our resolve, and it won’t.” |||||","output":"Bill de Blasio became the 109th mayor of New York City in a big election win.

Translate to English","output":"We must have an ambitious agricultural and food policy in order to ensure that the food needs of our citizens are met. In today's rapidly changing global scenario, it is imperative that we focus on developing and implementing an ambitious agricultural and food policy. Not only will it serve to address the food requirements of our citizens but it will also help in building a strong foundation for a sustainable future. Here are some crucial aspects of such a policy: 1. Promote sustainable agricultural practices: Emphasize the adoption of environmentally friendly farming methods that reduce the use of chemicals, improve soil health, and conserve water resources. This may include measures like crop rotation, integrated pest management, organic farming, and agroforestry. 2.

Rattlesnakes, like all organisms, reproduce to ensure the continuation of their species. The success rate of reproduction and survival of offspring plays a significant role in population growth or decline. Several factors influence successful reproduction in rattlesnakes, including: 1. Availability of suitable mates: A rattlesnake's ability to find a compatible mate during the mating season is essential for successful reproduction. Both male and female rattlesnakes engage in mate-searching behavior, which may include leaving their usual territory to seek potential partners. 2. Environmental conditions: Favorable environmental conditions, such as appropriate temperature and humidity, are crucial for successful reproduction. Unfavorable conditions can negatively impact mating behavior, egg-laying (in oviparous species), or live birth (in viviparous species). 3. Predation and threats: Rattlesnakes, like other animals, face various threats, such as predation by other animals, humans capturing or killing them, and habitat destruction. These threats can affect their reproductive success by reducing the chances of finding a mate or the survival rate of their offspring. 4. Availability of resources: Access to adequate resources, such as food and suitable habitat, plays a crucial role in supporting the growth and overall health of a rattlesnake population. Insufficient resources may decrease reproductive success due to malnutrition or increased vulnerability to predation. Assuming that the preceding conditions are favorable, a rattlesnake that mates successfully and produces offspring that can survive to adulthood will ultimately contribute to an increase in the rattlesnake population."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, that neither agree with nor contradict each other.

It was then that Laura began to investigate Jennifer's true intentions secretly. The more she found out, the more she began to understand the gravity of the situation. This wasn't simply a case of sibling rivalry or jealousy. No, Jennifer's intentions had been hardened and twisted over time, forming an iron resolve for destruction that threatened to consume their entire family. Jennifer's new friends provided her with a web of connections that gave her access to vast resources and the ability to carry out her dastardly plans. What Laura couldn't understand was the reason behind Jennifer's murderous intent. Was it a mere thirst for power, or perhaps something deeper and more personal? Laura knew she couldn't let the truth come out. She had to protect her family at all costs, even if that meant keeping the knowledge of Jennifer's plans to herself and facing the threat head-on. It became her personal mission to counteract Jennifer's every move, to ensure that her family remained safe from the twisted intentions of her step-sister. It was a lonely, never-ending battle that took a toll on Laura. She couldn't confide in anyone, afraid that it might expose her secret vigilance and put her family at even greater risk. Every night Laura lay awake in her bed, consumed by the fear that came with living in the shadows, knowing that she was their only line of defense against the monster that lived under their roof. Despite the emotional and physical toll the secret-warfare took on her, Laura never faltered. There were too many lives at stake for her to entertain thoughts of giving up. She knew that one wrong move could mean the unraveling of everything she had worked so hard to protect. And so, she endured, living each day with a desperate determination that was fueled by the love she had for her family. In the end, it wasn't clear if Jennifer ever realized that her stepsister was the one who had been consistently thwarting her plans. But what was clear was that Laura would never give up, for as long as Jennifer harbored those cold, murderous thoughts, her family would never truly be safe. Thus, Laura resolved to stand guard against the darkness, quietly preserving the innocence and joy of the family she cherished."},{"instruction":"Solve 7*b - 4*b - 6 = 0 for b.. What is the answer??","output":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step, like we're playing with building blocks. We have the equation: 7 * b - 4 * b - 6 = 0 First, let's look at the blocks with 'b' in them. We have 7 blocks with 'b' and 4 blocks with 'b'. If we take away 4 \\"b\\" blocks from the 7 \\"b\\" blocks, we will have 3 \\"b\\" blocks left. So, it becomes: 3 * b - 6 = 0 Now, let's find out how many blocks we need to add to -6 to make it equal to 0. If we add 6 blocks to -6, it will become 0. So we do this: 3 * b = 6 Finally, we need to find out how many times we have the 'b' in the 6. Since we have 3 \\"b\\" blocks equal to 6, we can find 'b' by dividing 6 by 3: b = 6 / 3 When we divide 6 by 3, we get: b = 2 So the answer is: b = 2."},{"instruction":"The most popular items in eBay’s marketplace are electronics, clothing and accessories and collectibles.

Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set. The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it. The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face. The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment. The sets are excruciatingly bad. The production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint \\"Precinct 707\\" on a cardboard wall. Since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of European emigres (possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands), bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms. Sadly, they couldn't afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental. More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated. The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her. Don't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride. After much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes. Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway. At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno into the soundtrack. We're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty. Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog. Yes, a golden shower it is. I won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. All I can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is very negative.

Hypothesis: The Canada Steamship Line has no pension fund.","output":"Based on the given context, we cannot draw the hypothesis that the Canada Steamship Line has no pension fund. In fact, the context suggests exactly the opposite. The context states that a conversation with ethics counsellor Howard Wilson was held about the minister's involvement with a certain legislation. The legislation in question is the Pension Benefit Standards Act. From the discussion, it has been highlighted that the Canada Steamship Line's pension fund is incorporated under the Pension Fund Societies Act, which falls under the purview of the Department of Industry. Further, it is mentioned that due to this arrangement, the Canada Steamship Line's pension fund will not be directly affected by the Pension Benefit Standards Act.

In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the...

Since Whitehead's metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience, he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living, self-conscious beings. The term he coined was \\"prehension\\", which comes from the Latin prehensio, meaning \\"to seize.\\" The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious, applying to people as well as electrons. It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of representative perception, in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities. For Whitehead, the term \\"prehension\\" indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself. In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them. Further, Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes, causal efficacy (or \\"physical prehension\\") and presentational immediacy (or \\"conceptual prehension\\"). What did Whitehead state are the two types of perception?","output":"Whitehead stated that the two types of perception are causal efficacy (or \\"physical prehension\\") and presentational immediacy (or \\"conceptual prehension\\")."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less rockets will be launched into space happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis proposed, supposing that fewer rockets will be launched into space, could have a potential impact on the process of fossil formation. To assess this potential effect (direct or indirect), it is essential to delve into both the process of fossil formation and how rocket launches can affect the environment. Fossil Formation Process: The process of fossil formation consists of several steps, including the death of animals and plants in soft soil or mud, sediment buildup over the remains, decomposition of the remains, replacement of remaining parts with minerals, and the eventual formation of a fossil. This process typically takes thousands to millions of years to occur and relies on specific geological and climatic conditions that promote preservation of the remains. Rocket Launch Effects on Environment: Rocket launches can have various direct and indirect impacts on the environment. These may include: 1. Greenhouse gas emissions: Rockets emit CO2, water vapor, and other greenhouse gases that can contribute to global warming and climate change. 2. Ozone depletion: Rocket engine exhaust contains chemicals that can damage the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. 3. Space debris: Rockets generate space debris, such as spent stages or defunct satellites, which can pose risks to other spacecraft and potentially disrupt the Earth's natural environment in the long-term. 4. Land transformation: Rocket launch facilities necessitate the clearing of natural areas, which can lead to habitat loss for plants and animals. Considering these factors, it is possible to imagine some indirect effects reduced rocket launches could have on the process of fossil formation: 1. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions: Fewer rocket launches could lead to a slight reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which may positively impact climate change mitigation. If climate change is slowed down, it could promote more stable conditions for fossil formation, as fluctuations in temperature, sea level, and other climate factors could undermine preservation conditions. 2. Mitigated ozone depletion: With less depletion of the ozone layer, there could be a reduction in UV radiation, which may affect the evolutionary pressures experienced by plants and animals. This, in turn, may influence the types of species that are preserved as fossils. However, it is essential to keep in mind that the direct and indirect effects of rocket launches on fossil formation may not be easily quantifiable. Rocket launches contribute a small fraction to overall greenhouse gas emissions and ozone depletion when compared to other industrial processes. To conclude, while fewer rocket launches into space might have some indirect effects on the process of fossil formation, their overall impact is likely to be relatively minor, especially when compared to other significant drivers of climate change and environmental disruption. Nevertheless, any action that contributes to a reduction in environmental impact, even on a smaller scale, can still have a positive effect on the Earth's ecosystems and the preservation of species for future generations."},{"instruction":"Article: The art of public speaking began in ancient Greece over 2,000 years ago. Now, twitter, e-mail, blogs and QQ chat offer approaches to communication-- but none can replace the role of a great speech. The spoken word can handle various important functions: persuading or inspiring, informing, paying tribute , entertaining, or simply introducing someone. Persuading is used in dealing with or _ different points of view. When the leaders met in Copenhagen in December, 2009, persuasive words from activities encouraged them to take former action. Inspirational speeches deal with emotions. They focus on topics and matters that are close to people' s hearts. Last year, during the fighting in Iraq, generals used inspiring speeches to prepare the troops for battle. Some speeches spread knowledge and deepen understanding. When the H1N1 flu was announced, the disease scared many people. Informtive speechs from World Health Organization (WTO) officials helped people to keep their panic under control so they could take necessary preventive measures. Sad events are never easy to deal with but a speech that pays tribute to the loss of a loved one and gives praise for their contribution can be comforting. Madonna's speech about Michael Jackson after his death showed the fact that he will continue to live on through his music. It's not only in world forums where public speaking plays an important role. It can also be helpful in the course of our own life. You may be asked to do a presentation at college or work to inform others about an area of great importance. On a more personal level, a friend may be upset and need comforting. Or you might be asked to introduce a speaker at a family gathering or to speak at a wedding, where your language will be needed to move people or make them laugh. Great speaking ability is not something we're born with. Even Barack Obama works hard to perfect every speech. Question: What would be the best title for the passage?

New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich were the most important artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or copperplate engraving) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters' guild, and the two became friends.By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision. Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. Hieronymus Bosch, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters. He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The full name of the Netherlandish painter who was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence, and perspective is Hieronymus Bosch. Born as Jheronimus van Aken, Bosch was active during the late 15th and early 16th centuries and became one of the most important and popular painters of his time. His works were unique as they often featured fantastical, surreal, and hallucinatory elements, a stark contrast to the more realistic styles of his contemporaries. Hieronymus Bosch's paintings were heavily influenced by moralism and pessimism, and he was relatively independent of the prevailing trends of his time. While other artists were integrating Italianate influences into their works, Bosch's paintings remained predominantly free of such characteristics. Notable works of his include \\"The Garden of Earthly Delights,\\" \\"The Last Judgment,\\" and \\"The Temptation of St. Anthony,\\" all of which showcase his distinctive and imaginative artistic style. In conclusion, the full name of the artist in question is Hieronymus Bosch, who was renowned for his unique approach to painting, marked by fantastical elements and a departure from the realistic depictions of nature, human existence, and perspective that were typical of other artists during the era of Early Netherlandish painting."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"Six men seat in a wooden boat while two are the background surrounded by logs and a green landscape\\", is the sentence \\"Six men are riding in a truck.\\" a true sentence?

Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\".

It always puzzled Lawrence how his seemingly identical lifestyle to Michael's could result in such a stark contrast in their personal grooming issues. They were both in their mid-thirties, relatively healthy, played rugby on weekends, and even worked in the same heated office space. One day, after another unsuccessful attempt at combating his dandruff issue, he decided to confide in Michael about his struggle. Surprised by his friend's dilemma, Michael closed his laptop and turned towards Lawrence, \\"You know, I used to have some awful dandruff myself.\\" Lawrence was shocked. \\"Really?

Michael simply smiled and started sharing about his journey, from his initial days of dandruff embarrassment to his eventual success in defeating the issue. As it turned out, the solution was simpler than Lawrence had expected: a change in hair-care routine and diet. Inspired by his friend's transformation, Lawrence decided to adopt Michael's practices. The implementation was not quick nor easy, but Lawrence was patient and persistent. His adjustments gradually bore fruit, and eventually, much to his delight, the snowy specks on his shoulders became a thing of the past.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: To answer this question, we need to consider the intricate and unpredictable nature of weather patterns. First, the formation of clouds is a complex process that depends on various atmospheric factors, such as temperature, humidity, and air pressure. Even if we can determine the overall conditions that lead to rain, pinpointing the exact moment a specific raindrop will fall from a cloud proves to be nearly impossible. Raindrops form and fall due to a combination of countless micro-scale interactions within the cloud, influenced by the random movement of air molecules and water droplets. Additionally, external factors like wind, temperature changes, and even the presence of pollution can all have an impact on the timing and location of rainfall. Given the multitude of factors and the randomness associated with many of them, it is not possible to tell the exact moment a specific raindrop will fall from a cloud during a thunderstorm."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

A:","output":"The North Korean propaganda song, \\"We Will Follow Only You\\" (also translated as \\"We Will Go Along Only With You\\"), is dedicated to the late North Korean leader Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il. They are considered the \\"parents\\" (figuratively, as they are not biologically related to the entire nation) of the North Korean people in the context of this song, as it expresses loyalty, admiration, and commitment to following their leadership and guidance. Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea and the country's first leader – known as \\"Great Leader\\" or \\"Eternal President\\" – ruled from 1948 to 1994. Under his leadership, North Korea established a socialist system and closely aligned itself with the Soviet Union. His son, Kim Jong-il, referred to as \\"Dear Leader,\\" succeeded him and ruled North Korea from 1994 until his death in 2011. Kim Jong-il continued and expanded upon his father's policies, further developing North Korea's military capabilities and strengthening the cult of personality around the Kim family. The song \\"We Will Follow Only You\\" is performed by the Moranbong Band, a popular all-female music group in North Korea, which was reportedly founded by Kim Jong-un, the grandson of Kim Il-sung and the third generation leader of North Korea.

Problem:Question: Who served as King's Council the year before Blackburne was nominated for the position? Passage:He was called to the Irish Bar in 1805 and practised with great success on the home circuit. Blackburne was nominated a King's Counsel in 1822 and administered the Insurrection Act in Limerick for two years, effectually restoring order in the district. In 1826 he became the King's Third Serjeant-at-law and in 1830 was advanced to the Second Serjeant. A year later, he was appointed Attorney-General for Ireland in the Whig administration of Earl Grey 'though known to be a tory ... with a view to the Irish administration having a broad political base' and on this occasion was sworn of the Privy Council of Ireland. He held the post as Attorney-General until 1834; he was readmitted in 1841 and after serving for a year, became Master of the Rolls in Ireland. As Attorney General he clashed with Daniel O'Connell when he insisted, against O'Connell's wishes, on the appointment of Abraham Brewster as Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (in effect, a deputy to Brewster himself). Blackburne's statement that he \\"would not tolerate a refusal to ratify the appointment\\", is an indication of the influence which could then be wielded by a strong Attorney General. In 1845, he was chosen Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench. Blackburne was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland in February 1852, but was replaced in October. After a break of four years, he became a Lord Justice of Appeal. In 1858 'he was invited by Lord Derby again to become lord chancellor, but he declined on account of his advanced age and failing health. He changed his mind, however, and decided to accept Derby's offer but was told that the position had been offered to and accepted by Joseph Napier.' He was bitterly disappointed, referring to the decision as \\"a harsh and cruel blow\\". In 1866, he began a second term as Lord Chancellor, which ended with his death in the next year.

The single, released in late July, was a number-one hit in the United States, and became a big international seller. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 3 song for 1967 (the other two were #2 \\"The Letter\\" by the Box Tops and #1 \\"To Sir With Love\\" by Lulu). The song is ranked #412 on Rolling Stone's list of \\"the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\" and at #144 in Pitchfork's 200 Best Songs of the 1960s. The song is a first-person narrative to \\"sparse\\" musical accompaniment. It reveals a tale, mostly in the form of brief dialog extracts by the narrator's family at dinnertime, on the day that a local boy - and apparently friend of the narrator - jumped to his death from a nearby bridge. Throughout the song, the suicide and other tragedies are contrasted against the banality of everyday routine and polite conversation. The final verse conveys the quick passage of events and other deaths in a year's time. The song begins with the narrator, her brother and her father returning, after agricultural morning chores, to the family house for dinner (on June 3). After cautioning them about tracking in dirt, \\"Mama\\" says that she \\"got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge\\" that \\"Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\". At the dinner table, the narrator's father appears unmoved and almost dismissive; he comments that \\"Billie Joe never had a lick o' [meaning, any] sense\\", and asks for the biscuits to be passed to him, and comments that he has \\"five more acres in the lower forty\\" to plow. Her brother seems somewhat taken aback (\\"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday ... And now you tell me Billie Joe has jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\"), but follows the comment by asking for a second slice of pie. He recalls a prank that he and his friends played on the narrator, and that he saw her and Billie Joe talking after church a few days previously. The only person who seems genuinely upset is the narrator. Her mother - who eventually notices the narrator's abrupt and complete change of mood at the news - seems unable to realize she is affected by the news (\\"Child, what's happened to your appetite? I been cookin' all mornin' and you haven't touched a single bite\\"). She shares other news instead, that a local preacher visited earlier in the day, and almost as an aside, that the preacher had mentioned seeing Billie Joe and a girl who looked very much like the narrator herself \\"throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\" - the object they were throwing is not identified. But again, the narrator's mother fails to connect this in any way to her daughter's emotional distress. In the song's final verse, a year has passed, and brought more harm and pain. The narrator's brother has married Becky Thompson, but they have moved away to another town (\\"bought a store in Tupelo\\"). Their father died from an unspecified viral infection, and their mother has been depressed and despondent, and \\"doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything\\". The narrator is also affected by the malaise; the main change she describes in her own life, is that she often visits Choctaw Ridge and picks flowers there to drop from the Tallahatchie Bridge into the murky waters of the river where Billy Joe jumped to his death. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What does her mother do?","output":"Her mother in the song \\"Ode to Billie Joe\\" cooks food for the family, shares news with them, and notices the narrator's change in mood at the dinner table but is unable to understand the reason behind it.

Keeping your weight low and centered on the balls of your feet will help you stop quickly, accelerate faster, and react better to the ball. Your back should be level from your shoulders to your hips and slightly arched, but not totally straight. To help you get a feel for the posture, reach your hands down to the ground while sticking your chest up. Your upper body will lean forward a bit, but keep your weight balanced. This stance might seem uncomfortable at first, but it will feel more natural with practice. Making sure your back is flat will protect it from injury while keeping you balanced. Experiment with placing your hands out to the sides, or placing one hand wide while keeping the other at the offensive player’s hip or using it to dig for the ball. Whatever you do, don’t let your hands fall to your sides. Your coach might have a specific hand placement they want you to use depending on how aggressive your defense is. If not, just focus on keeping your hands up and active. Try different positions and see what feels natural and effective.","output":"Achieve a strong defensive stance in sports by placing feet wider than shoulder-width, lowering your body into a squat, keeping weight centered on the balls of your feet, maintaining a flat back, and experimenting with active hand placement."},{"instruction":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: yes","output":"Question: Is it possible to use art as a means of expressing emotions and connecting with others? Justification: Yes, art has long been a powerful medium of communication, allowing individuals to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences in a creative and non-verbal manner.

As a result, art not only fosters an environment for self-expression but also facilitates empathy and understanding among diverse individuals."},{"instruction":"Formerly, men not wearing military uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included obligatory trains and tiaras or feathers in their hair (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World War I, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King George V was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.

But when you close the door (turn off the switch), the little balls can't go through anymore, which means they stop moving. When they're moving and bump into each other in the pipe, it causes the pipe to get warm or hot. That's called Joule heating. So, when you close the door (the switch), the little balls stop moving, which stops them from bumping into each other.

Midway through the first quarter, Brady hit Gronk for a 45-yard catch-and-run to the Patriots 7. Two plays later, Brady threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to LaFell, but the play was nullified by an illegal formation penalty, pushing the ball back to the 11. Two plays later Brady threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Keyshawn Martin, which counted, and the Patriots led 7-0. The Texans reached the Patriots 20 on their ensuing drive, but were forced to settle for a 38-yard field goal by Nick Novak. The Patriots answered by reaching the Texans 25, but their stiff defense forced the Patriots to settle for a 43-yard field goal by Gostkowski. The Texans responded with a second straight field goal, this one a 45-yarder. After both teams traded punts, the Patriots took advantage of great field position (the Texans 41) and increased their lead to 17-6 with Brady's 1-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski with just 0:14 seconds left in the half. The Patriots took the opening kickoff of the second half, and, despite only reaching the Texans 31, Gostkowski was good from 49 yards away, and the Patriots led 20-6. The Patriots forced another punt, but Martin muffed it with recovering at the Patriots 21. However, the Patriots stout defense only allowed 6 yards and the Texans turned the ball over on downs. Early in the fourth quarter, Sheard stripped Brian Hoyer with Malcolm Brown recovering at the Texans 7. Three plays later, James White scored on a two-yard touchdown run, putting the game out of reach. The Texans did nothing on their final two drives and the Patriots won the game. With the win, the Patriots improved to 11-2, and they clinched the AFC East title for a seventh straight season after the Giants defeated the Dolphins the following Monday night.

According to Trump, he received approval for a 3,600-square-foot (334.5 m2) sign from Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's administration in 2009, but renegotiated with Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration. In October 2013, Trump received approval to erect 20-foot (6.1 m) tall stainless steel letters back-lit with white LED lighting spelling out TRUMP on the 16th floor of the building. He made his impending plans for the sign public in February 2014. According to a city planning department spokesperson, standard protocol for such a sign is to require approval from the local alderman (Brendan Reilly, 42nd ward) and the full Chicago City Council. The five letters span a width of approximately 141 feet (43 m), making the final approved version approximately 2,800 square feet (260.1 m2)—2,891 square feet (268.6 m2) according to some sources—rather than the originally proposed size. The sign is located about 200 feet (61 m) above ground level.Crews began hanging the sign in May 2014. When Chicago Tribune architecture critic Kamin warned Trump that his review of the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded \\"As time passes, it'll be like the Hollywood Sign\\"; architect Smith distanced himself from the sign saying \\"Just for the record, I had nothing to do with this sign!\\" The controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the Associated Press ran a story about Mayor Emanuel's disapproval in mid-June. According to the Mayor's spokeswoman Kelley Quinn, \\"Mayor Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign\\". Kamin has noted that part of the problem is the architectural traditions of the city: \\"If this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care—but it is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward\\".

There is a desk and a comfortable chair with a high-quality e-reader lying on it. Characters: 1. Anne (In her 30s, a voracious reader who loves physical books) 2. Brian (In his 30s, a tech-savvy reader who prefers e-books) (Anne is arranging her books on the bookshelf and admiring the collection, while Brian is browsing through the e-reader.) Anne: *sighs in satisfaction* Isn't there something so magical about physical books? I love the smell of the pages, the feel of the cover in my hands, and seeing my collection grow on these shelves. I don't think I could ever switch to e-books. Brian: *smirks* Anne, we've had this conversation before. There's no denying that physical books have a certain charm, but e-books offer so many practical advantages that it's hard to overlook them. For starters, just think about the convenience! I can carry thousands of books in this e-reader, and it weighs far less than a single book. Anne: That may be true, but I treat each book like a treasure. I enjoy writing my thoughts or quotes in the margins and marking my favorite pages with colorful bookmarks. Flipping through the pages, discovering the stories within—these experiences just can't be replicated electronically. Brian: Well, e-readers do offer options to make annotations or highlight passages. Plus, they have built-in dictionaries for those moments when you encounter a tricky word. You can change the font, size, background color, and brightness for your reading comfort. Not to mention, you can save countless trees by going digital! Anne: *frowns* I see your point, but physical books have an emotional connection that's hard to replicate with an e-reader. They can be handed down from generation to generation, contain inscriptions, or be cherished as a gift from a loved one. And what about independent bookstores or libraries, which are essential to our communities? E-books can't replace those experiences. Brian: *nods* I understand where you're coming from, and I do appreciate the emotional value of physical books. But keeping up with technology is also important. Think about how e-books can be a more accessible and affordable option for many people. There are thousands of free e-books available, and you don't need to worry about late library fees. Plus, for those with reading difficulties like dyslexia, e-readers offer specific fonts and tools that make the reading process easier. It's about inclusivity. Anne: That is indeed a compelling argument, Brian. I admit that e-books can provide an accessible option for many people. I guess it ultimately comes down to personal preferences and our emotional connections to our chosen mediums. Brian: Absolutely, Anne. And maybe, just maybe, our two worlds can coexist in harmony. Imagine the power of a world that embraces the magic of physical books and the practicality of e-books. After all, the ultimate goal is to foster a love for reading, regardless of the platform. Anne: *smiles* Yes, that's exactly what's important—the love of reading. Although I am not ready to give up physical books, I'm glad you have found joy in e-books. To each their own.

Which country had more species of animals disappear? Belgium and France are two countries participating at a human health meeting. Belgium has a lower biodiversity, while France's biodiversity is much higher. Hint: Biodiversity's relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss. This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University.The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health. Partly, the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting preservation of water resources. While the distribution of clean water increases, in some parts of the world it remains unequal. According to the World Health Organisation (2018) only 71% of the global population used a safely managed drinking-water service.Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal resources, social and psychological health. Biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts.Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources.

Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the National Gallery of Canada wanted to purchase In the Northland, but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to purchase Spring Ice instead. The reception of Thomson's paintings at this time was mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the Toronto Daily Star wrote, \\"Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper.\\" A more favourable take came from artist Wyly Grier in The Christian Science Monitor: Tom Thomson again reveals his capacity to be modern and remain individual. His early pictures—in which the quality of naivete had all the genuineness of the effort of the tyro and was not the counterfeit of it which is so much in evidence in the intensely rejuvenated works of the highly sophisticated—showed the faculty for affectionate and truthful record by a receptive eye and faithful hand; but his work today has reached higher levels of technical accomplishment.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the isotope becomes more stable happens, how will it affect the isotope woud emit more radiation. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you proposed states that if an isotope becomes more stable, it would emit more radiation. To assess the effect of this hypothesis on the process, let's analyze each step in the process, considering the perturbation. 1. An isotope has too many protons: This suggests that the isotope contains an imbalance in its atomic structure, leading to instability. 2. The isotope is unstable: The instability is due to an imbalance in the number of protons, causing the isotope to seek more stable configurations. 3. The isotope emits radiation: As the isotope experiences instability, it generally emits radiation to reduce excess energy and move towards a stable state. 4. The isotope decays: The emission of radiation causes the isotope to lose particles such as protons, electrons, or neutrons, leading to radioactive decay. 5. The isotope loses some atomic particles: As the isotope decays, it undergoes a change in atomic structure, losing particles and becoming a different element or isotope. 6. The isotope turns into a different element: After undergoing decay and particle loss, the isotope's atomic structure has changed, and it transforms into a different element or isotope. 7. The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation: Once the isotope has reached a stable state, it stops decaying and emitting radiation. Now, considering the perturbation hypothesis, if the isotope becomes more stable, it suggests that the isotope is moving towards a balanced atomic structure. In this scenario, the isotope may experience reduced radioactive decay rates. Contrary to the perturbation hypothesis, a more stable isotope would generally emit less radiation instead of more radiation, as it is closer to a balanced, non-decaying state. So, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process, but it is not a direct one. As the isotope becomes more stable, it will emit less radiation and might eventually stop decaying. This change contradicts the perturbation hypothesis, which stated that the isotope would emit more radiation as it becomes more stable."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - Karma yoga, or the \\"Yoga of action\\" is a form of yoga based on the teachings of the \\"Bhagavad Gita\\", a sacred Sanskrit scripture of Hinduism.

Question: suppose the weather gets cold enough happens, how will it affect LESS global warming. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"B: less If the weather gets cold enough, it would lead to less global warming. This is because colder weather would reduce the overall temperature of the Earth, counteracting the warming effect caused by greenhouse gases. In colder temperatures, the Earth's surface and oceans would absorb less heat, and there would be reduced evaporation, which could lead to a decrease in the concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere. Water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas, and its reduced presence in the atmosphere would contribute to less heat being trapped. Additionally, colder weather could result in increased snow and ice coverage, which reflects more sunlight back into space, further reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the Earth. However, it is important to note that short-term cold weather events would not have a significant long-term impact on global warming. Long-term changes in temperature trends and atmospheric dynamics would be necessary to sustain such an effect."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"What was the capital in Oklahoma after 1907?\\" is in \\"By the time Oklahoma was admitted to the Union in 1907, Oklahoma City had surpassed Guthrie, the territorial capital, as the population center and commercial hub of the new state.

Parents are concerned about the lack of quality in television programs for children.The degree of violence in many of these shows also worries them.Studies indicate that,when children are exposed to violence,they many become aggressive or insecure. Parents are also concerned at,out the commercials that their children see on television. Many parents would like to see fewer commercials during programs for children.And some parents feel that these shows should not have any commercials at all because young minds are not mature enough to deal with the claims made by advertisers. Educational television has no commercials and has programs for children that many parents approve of The most famous of these is Sesame Street,which tries to give preschool children a head start in learning the alphabet and numbers.It also flies to teach children useful things about the world in which they live. Even though most parents and educators give Sesame Street and shows like it high marks for quality,some critics argue that all television,whether educational or not,is harmful to children.These critics feel that the habit of watching hours of television every day turns children into bored and passive consumers of their world rather than encouraging them to become active explorers of it. In what ways do children suffer from television?

Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report. The reason why \\"Apple a day may poison children\\" is that _ . A) there are some pests in the apple B) children would get a poisonous level of pesticides because of the remains on the apple C) there are always more pesticides on the apples produced in Britain D) the apple is too hard for children to eat The answer is:","output":"B) children would get a poisonous level of pesticides because of the remains on the apple. The research conducted using the data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit, collected from supermarkets, indicates that children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding the pesticide safety limit due to the pesticide residues on the fruit. The government's assurance of safe levels of pesticides may be misleading, as their method of measuring involves crushing a batch of 10 apples and taking an average reading of pesticide content. This internationally accepted method, however, does not account for variations in pesticide concentration on individual fruits, as some apples could contain a significantly higher percentage of the total pesticide residue. The research utilized mathematical modeling to measure the potential exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. These pesticides could have detrimental effects on children's health, including disruption of hormonal balance and a potential increased risk of cancer. The study did find some solace in the fact that British-grown fruit samples had lower pesticide levels compared to imported fruit, suggesting that by purchasing locally produced fruit, the danger from pesticide exposure could be somewhat reduced.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"To remove oil stains, the best solution using simple physics reasoning would be: 1. First, gently dab the oil stain with a clean, dry cloth or paper towel to absorb as much oil as possible. Be careful not to rub the stain, as this could spread the oil further. 2. Next, sprinkle cornstarch, baking soda, or baby powder on the stain. These powders can help absorb the oil from the fabric. Let the powder sit on the stain for about 15-30 minutes. 3. After that, gently brush off the powder from the fabric, and check if the stain is still visible. If it is, repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed. 4. Once the stain is lighter, you can wash the fabric using a heavy-duty laundry detergent. Make sure to follow the washing instructions on the clothing label. Check the stain after washing. If it's gone, you can dry the fabric as usual. If it's still there, you might need to repeat the washing process again. Using simple physics reasoning, this solution works because powders like cornstarch and baking soda can absorb oil from the fabric, making the stain easier to remove when washing the clothing."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a task that requires knowledge of physical objects to perform?","output":"An example of a task that requires knowledge of physical objects to perform is organizing a cluttered workspace. Let's break this task down step-by-step: 1. Observe the workspace: Examine the workspace to determine the types of objects present (papers, pens, books, electronic devices, etc.) and approximate their locations. 2. Identify categories: Based on the observed objects, create categories for relevancy and purpose (e.g., office supplies, books, electronics, personal items). 3. Gather necessary storage or organizing tools: Based on the categories and available space, select appropriate storage tools like file organizers, drawers, or containers. 4. Sort objects into categories: Physically pick up each item in the workspace, and place it into the corresponding category. As you sort the items, consider whether they are worth keeping, need repair or should be discarded. 5. Organize by importance: Within each category, prioritize items based on their frequency of use or relevance to ongoing projects. 6. Assign storage locations: Designate specific storage areas for each category, keeping in mind accessibility and visibility according to the importance of the items (e.g., frequently-used items should be within easy reach). 7. Place items into storage: Physically place each item into its designated storage location, ensuring everything is neat and easily identifiable. 8. Evaluate the organization: After completing the organization process, review the workspace to ensure it has become clutter-free, functional, and visually appealing. 9. Maintain organization: Periodically check the workspace and perform minor adjustments as needed to keep it organized over time. This task requires knowledge of physical objects such as understanding their function and properties, as well as the spatial arrangement of the workspace.

Începând cu sporturile, regiunea balcanică a avut o serie de evenimente interesante în ultima perioadă. Una dintre cele mai mari realizări a fost calificarea echipei de fotbal a Serbiei la Campionatul Mondial FIFA 2022, după ce au învins Portugalia într-un meci decisiv.

Seeking to cement the celebrations with a grand show at the Colosseum, Caesar instructs the head of a prominent Gladiator School, Caius Fatuous, to ensure that the Circus Maximus is a success, promising to make him the wealthiest man in Rome, or the main attraction of the show if he fails. While discussing about the many gifts he has received from his Empire, Caius knows that one province hasn't, since it has yet to be conquered - a small village in Gaul.

However, upon returning with a bouquet for Panacea, his heart is quickly broken when he sees her reunite with the recently returned Tragicomix, a handsome, young man whom Chief Vitalstatistix reveals will be soon marrying Panacea. Seeking to spend more time together following their reunion, the two lovers venture out into the nearby woods, but are swiftly ambushed and captured by a group of Romans, led by a fresh recruit hoping to make a good impression of himself with his Centurion, the head of a nearby garrison.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Reign of Fire Context: The film opens in the undated past. During construction on the London Underground, workers penetrate an underground cave. A huge dragon emerges from hibernation, incinerating the workers with its breath. The only survivor is a boy, Quinn Abercromby (Ben Thornton), whose mother, Karen (Alice Krige) -- the construction crew chiefâis crushed to death protecting him. The dragon flies out of the Underground, and soon more dragons appear. It is revealed through newspaper clippings and the narration that dragons are the species responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. They are speculated to hibernate after destroying most living creatures until the planet repopulates. After the dragons reawaken, humanity resists with military force, including with nuclear weapons in 2010. This, however, only hastens the destruction, and within a few years, humans are nearly extinct. In 2020, Quinn (Christian Bale) leads a community of survivors in a Northumberland castle. They are starving while awaiting harvest. Although most trust Quinn, some are restless and defiant. Eddie (David Kennedy) and his group steal a truck to pick tomatoes, though it is too soon for harvest. They are attacked by a dragon; one man is killed, and the rest are surrounded by fire. Quinn, Creedy (Gerard Butler), and Jared (Scott Moutter) rescue them with old fire engines, but the dragon kills Eddie's son before escaping.

I submitted a profit and loss statement for my business to qualify for a loan, but the bank refused because the","output":"document was incomplete. To resolve this issue, it is crucial to understand both the contents of a profit and loss statement as well as the reasons why a bank might refuse a loan based on this document. A profit and loss (P&L) statement, also known as an income statement, is a financial statement used by businesses to summarize the revenues, costs, and expenses incurred during a specific period of time (monthly, quarterly, or annually). It provides information about a company's ability to generate profit by increasing revenue, reducing costs, or doing both. The P&L statement includes key parts, such as: 1. Revenue: This is the money you earn from your business operations. It might be broken down into categories, such as sales and service revenue, based on the nature of the business. 2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): These are the costs directly tied to your production or provision of goods and services. They may include costs for materials, direct labor, and product production. 3.Core operational expenses: These reflect the costs that go into running your company whether you make a sale or not. Examples include rent, utilities, insurance, salaries of non-production staff, and office supplies. 4. Depreciation and amortization: These lines indicate the diminishing value of assets over time. 5. Taxes, interest, and other expenses: Includes corporation tax, interest on loans, and other miscellaneous outgoings. 6. Net profit: This is the final line in your statement, which shows your business’s profits or losses over the stated accounting period. Now, coming to the possible reasons why the bank might have refused the business loan on the basis of your P&L statement. 1. Problems with profitability: If your P&L statement shows that the business is not profitable, i.e., the expenses are consistently greater than the income, this raises a red flag for the bank. They may perceive your business as a risky investment and can refuse a loan. 2. Incomplete or inaccurate information: While preparing the P&L statement, if any section has been left out or filled in incorrectly, it may lead to your financial statement being deemed incomplete. In such cases, the bank cannot assess the financial stability of the business. 3. Inconsistent Income: If your business shows irregular income, the bank may deem this as a sign of instability, leading to refusal of your business loan application. 4. Poor cash flow management: If a business's P&L statement shows poor cash flow management, i.e., lack of enough cash to cover the regular business expenses, it could lead to the refusal of a business loan application. 5. Past financial troubles: Historical data showing losses can impact your ability to secure a loan, as this paints a picture of financial instability. So, to rectify the refused loan issue based on your current P&L statement, understand which aspects the bank is having concerns with. If the P&L statement is inaccurate or incomplete, consult with an accountant or financial advisor to ensure it’s correct, precise, and presents a complete, up-to-date picture of your organization's financial situation. If profitability is the problem, develop a solid plan to boost sales, cut unnecessary expenses, and maximize operational efficiency. Reconsider your pricing strategy and review whether you can introduce new products or services to tap into a part of the market you haven't reached yet. With proper revisions, insight-driven financial management, and a cautious approach towards fiscal stability, you can refine your P&L Statement in a way that enhances your chances of securing a loan from the bank. Remember, banks generally want to lend, but they need to be assured that the risk is minimized and the borrower has the capacity to repay."},{"instruction":"Este absolut indispensabil să existe un sistem competitiv al brevetelor.

Movie Review: Title: The Nightfall Disaster The Nightfall Disaster promised an adrenaline-pumping thriller, but sadly fell short in almost every respect. Riddled with clichés and uneven pacing, the film left me utterly disappointed and questioning how it made it to the big screen. The plot, which initially seemed intriguing, followed a group of friends on a camping trip that quickly turned into a fight for survival against unexplained supernatural forces. Unfortunately, the supernatural elements felt haphazardly thrown together, as if the writers borrowed every horror cliché imaginable and forced them into one disjointed narrative. The result was a confusing mess, with plot points left unresolved and massive leaps in logic. Moreover, the characters were poorly developed. The dialogue felt forced and unnatural, and the actors struggled to breathe life into their one-dimensional roles. It was challenging to feel any empathy or concern for their plight, let alone invest in their fight for survival. The special effects in The Nightfall Disaster also left much to be desired. The CGI seemed cheap and unpolished, taking me out of the movie every time a supernatural creature appeared. Scenes intended to be intense and frightening ended up evoking more laughter than fear. In conclusion, The Nightfall Disaster is a poorly-executed thriller that fails to deliver on its initial promise. The weak plot, underdeveloped characters, and subpar special effects make it a film that is best left unwatched. For those seeking a thrilling movie night, I recommend looking elsewhere – like the 2017 hit \\"Get Out\\" that masterfully blends fear with social commentary."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Ra Rajukumar\\" The answer is:","output":"It is not possible to determine the star-rating of this review based solely on the text provided, \\"Ra Rajukumar.\\" The text does not provide any information about the reviewer's experience, satisfaction, or opinions on the product, service, or place being reviewed.

One day, he went to court because he was in trouble for not following some rules. While he was there, the people in charge said he had done something wrong with a horse. The horse was in a special place called \\"impound,\\" because it was found loose and needed to be kept safe. But Ryan took the horse out of there without asking, and this made it hard for the people who take care of animals to do their job. Ryan said he didn't understand what he did wrong, so he told the judge he wasn't guilty. The people in charge at the court, called deputies, said that Ryan didn't listen to them and even scuffled with them. They said he was being difficult and told them he wouldn't let them arrest him. So, Ryan had to spend a night in jail because he didn't follow the rules and listen to the deputies.

Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

Since his impressive first-round victory on Sunday, Mr Macron is still at least 20 points ahead, which sounds an unassailable lead. The omens look good for him too. He won 8,657,326 votes on Sunday, almost a million more than his National Front runner-up. And the polls also suggest many voters from the other main candidates are likely to back him in the second round. He has strong backing from key political figures: outgoing Socialist President François Hollande and candidate Benoît Hamon on the left and defeated Republican candidate François Fillon and ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy on the right. So what could go wrong for him? Abstention is the biggest threat, says political scientist Aurélien Preud'homme. \\"If there is a very weak turnout for Macron and very strong support for Le Pen, she could go above 50% of the vote,\\" he told the BBC. Marine Le Pen does not even need to go above 50% in the polls to become president, according to one expert, as long as Macron voters stay away in big enough numbers. All she needs is to advance a little more in the polls, and this is how she could do it. \\"If she gets 42% of the vote, which isn't impossible, and Macron gets 58%, normally she loses the election,\\" physicist and Sciences Po political expert Serge Galam told RMC radio. \\"But if 90% of people who said they would vote for Le Pen do it, and at the same time only 65% of people who declared they would vote for Macron actually do it, then it's Marine Le Pen who wins the election with a score of 50.07%.\\" It is not that the polls are wrong, it is just that they cannot gauge the level of voter apathy in advance. Under Serge Galam's mathematical formula, he gives three examples of how Marine Le Pen can win, where she is candidate \\"A turnout x\\" and Emmanuel Macron is \\"B turnout y\\" with a Turnout (T). He calls this model \\"differentiated abstention\\". Whether or not the polls might fail, it is worth pointing out that almost all the polling organisations were uncannily accurate in predicting where the top six candidates would finish. US pollster Nate Silver gives Marine Le Pen no chance at all, arguing she is in a far worse hole than Donald Trump ever was. But Ian Bremmer of risk consultancy Eurasia Group puts the chance of a Le Pen victory at 30%. \\"I feel he's going to win but it's not a safe bet. It's significantly about turnout and there are externalities that are very plausible.\\" One of those external factors, he believes, might be a terrorist attack on a greater scale than the murder of policeman Xavier Jugelé in central Paris three days before the first round. Or perhaps an outbreak of fake news. It could happen, as the 7 May run-off comes in the middle of a holiday weekend. Why make a special effort to stay home and vote on Sunday when Monday is a public holiday? It could work both ways but the Macron vote is more city-based and more likely to venture away from home. Then there are the significant groups who cannot bring themselves to back an economic and social liberal in Emmanuel Macron. All of them are attracted to the hashtag #SansMoile7mai (Without me on 7 May). One is Sens Commun (Common Sense) a socially conservative group opposed to same-sex marriage and adoption. Their leader sees the \\"political decay\\" of Mr Macron as no different to the \\"chaos\\" offered by Le Pen. Historically, however, turnout in the second round is as high as 80%, so there would need to be a dramatic decline. The far-right leader has only a few days to claw back a 20-point deficit but she has hit the ground running since she polled 21.3% on Sunday, well behind her rival on 24%. She has already stolen the limelight with prime-time interviews two nights running on France's top two TV channels and a dramatic political stunt, upstaging her rival in front of striking workers at Amiens. By contrast Mr Macron has appeared flat-footed, beginning with a celebration party on Sunday night at a pricey Paris bistro and what sounded like a rebuke from President François Hollande. \\"We need to be extremely serious and mobilised and not think it's a done deal, because a vote is earned, it's fought for.\\" But the centrist favourite has begun to hit back and a lot will hang on the TV duel on 3 May. In earlier TV debates Mr Macron performed noticeably better than his National Front rival. Marine Le Pen has already achieved a record number of votes for her party and is even trying to distance herself from the brand by restyling herself as the people's candidate with ex-banker Emmanuel Macron as a \\"candidate of the oligarchy\\". The key lies with two blocs: the right wing of François Fillon's Republican support base and the radical left who opted for the surprise package of the first round, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Together the two candidates polled almost 40% of the vote. And Mr Mélenchon refuses to back either candidate, raising the possibility that a section of anti-globalisation voters could find common cause with Marine Le Pen. Political scientist Aurélien Preud'homme says many on the right too are leaning towards Marine Le Pen and it just depends on whether she can shift the focus during the final days of campaigning to her strongest suit, security and terrorism. Perhaps it was unsurprising that she was heading for Nice on Thursday for her first big election rally - where a Tunisian inspired by militant Islam killed 86 people on Bastille Day last July. \\"What stops the right backing Le Pen is Europe and the euro,\\" says Mr Preud'homme. Most Fillon voters are of a certain age and they're the ones who worry about leaving the euro - it would be very worrying for them.\\" Marine Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen has already said she should have adopted a more aggressive campaign style in the manner of Donald Trump. He overturned a double-digit lead over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to win the US election last November. But she has little time left and may not find enough voters to win over. It is worth remembering that when she won the first round of elections in six of France's 13 regions in 2015, she looked on course to change the course of French politics. But it never happened and her party was defeated in the second round. % Emmanuel Macron % Marine Le Pen Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart.

What is a summary of this text?","output":"In order for far-right leader Marine Le Pen to win the French presidential election on 7 May, she will likely need a weak turnout for opponent Emmanuel Macron, according to political scientist Aurélien Preud'homme. If there is low voter turnout for Macron and strong support for Le Pen, she could possibly win over 50% of the vote, despite Macron's current 20-point lead in the polls. Voter apathy could play a role in influencing the election outcome, with some voters potentially choosing to abstain. Meanwhile, external factors such as a terrorist attack or the spread of fake news could also contribute to an upset in Macron's favour."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Yes, they do, Ty.\\" to Czech?","output":"In Czech, \\"Yes, they do, Ty.\\" translates to \\"Ano, dělají, Ty.\\" Here's how it breaks down: \\"Yes\\" means \\"Ano\\", \\"they do\\" means \\"dělají\\", and the name \\"Ty\\" remains the same.

Notably, the Prairie provinces or simply the Prairies comprise the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, as they are partially covered by prairie (grasslands). In a more restricted sense, the term may also refer only to the areas of those provinces covered by prairie; their portions of the physiographic region known as the Interior Plains. Prairie also covers portions of northeastern British Columbia, though that province is typically not included in the region in a political sense. - Amegilla is a large genus of bees in the tribe Anthophorini. Several species have blue metallic bands on the abdomen, and are referred to as \\"blue-banded bees\\". - The Centridini are a tribe of large apid bees, many of which possess adaptations for carrying floral oils rather than (or in addition to) pollen or nectar. The floral oils are often gathered from plants of the family Malpighiaceae, though other plants may be visited. The oil-collecting species typically have \\"combs\\" composed of closely spaced, flattened, blunt bristles on the margins of the first tarsal segments of the front and middle legs; others may have velvety \\"pads\\" to absorb the oils. They also commonly gather plant resins for use in nest cell construction. They have a tiny pterostigma in the forewing, the female scopa is very bushy, and the first flagellomere of the antenna is often longer than the scape. - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - The bee genus Anthophora is one of the largest in the family Apidae, with over 450 species worldwide in 14 different subgenera. They are most abundant and diverse in the Holarctic and African biogeographic regions. All species are solitary, though many nest in large aggregations. Nearly all species make nests in the soil, either in banks or in flat ground; the larvae develop in cells with waterproof linings and do not spin cocoons. Males commonly have pale white or yellow facial markings, and/or peculiarly modified leg armature and hairs. \\"Anthophora\\" individuals can be distinguished from the very similar genus \\"Amegilla\\" by the possession of an arolium between the tarsal claws. - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming. - Texas is the second largest state in the United States by both area and population. Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares borders with the U.S. states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the southwest, while the Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. - The Melectini are a tribe of medium - to large - sized apid bees found essentially worldwide . They are brood parasites of the related typical digger bees ( Anthophorini ) and occasionally visit flowers e.g. in prairie landscapes of the United States . As in other cuckoo bees , females can be easily distinguished from those of their hosts by the lack of scopae and other pollen - collecting adaptations , as well as lacking prepygidial fimbria and basitibial plates . Their body hair is rather short and on the abdomen lies flat against the exoskeleton . They may , therefore , be difficult at first glance to distinguish from the Nomadinae , but the details of their wing venation are characteristic : the marginal cell is shorter than the first two submarginal cells , and the second abscissa of vein M + Cu is extremely short , with the cells it connects being almost adjacent to each other . The jugal lobes are very small , less than half as long as the vannal lobes . - Saskatchewan (or ) is a prairie and boreal province in west-central Canada, the only province without natural borders. It has an area of , nearly 10 percent of which is fresh water, composed mostly of rivers, reservoirs, and the province's 100,000 lakes. - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States.

The family includes some of the most commonly seen bees, including bumblebees and honey bees, but also includes stingless bees (also used for honey production), carpenter bees, orchid bees, cuckoo bees, and a number of other less widely known groups. Many are valuable pollinators in natural habitats and for agricultural crops. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - The Anthophorini are a large tribe in the subfamily Apinae of the family Apidae. Species in this tribe are often referred to as digger bees, although this common name is sometimes also applied to members of the tribe Centridini. It has over 750 species worldwide that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae; the vast majority of species are in the genera \\"Amegilla\\" and \\"Anthophora\\". - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico.

Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Alberta is a western province of Canada. With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1, 2015, it is Canada's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Its area is about .

The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015. - Prairies are ecosystems considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and a composition of grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay as well as the steppes of Eurasia. Lands typically referred to as \\"prairie\\" tend to be in North America. The term encompasses the area referred to as the Interior Lowlands of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which includes all of the Great Plains as well as the wetter, somewhat hillier land to the east. In the U.S., the area is constituted by most or all of the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and sizable parts of the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and western and southern Minnesota. The Central Valley of California is also a prairie. The Canadian Prairies occupy vast areas of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. - The Apinae are the subfamily that includes the majority of bees in the family Apidae.

It also includes all but two of the groups (excluding Nomadinae and Xylocopinae) that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae. - In geography, a plain is a flat area. Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys, coastal plains and as plateaus or uplands at high elevations. In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometime termed a gap). Plains may have been formed from flowing lava, deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains. - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America. It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the Río de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast.

Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.

Passage: The country officially exited recession in 2010, assisted by a growth in exports from US multinationals in Ireland. However, due to a rise in the cost of public borrowing due to government guarantees of private banking debt, the Irish government accepted an €85 billion programme of assistance from the EU, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and bilateral loans from the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark.

This decision has not only stirred up conversations surrounding security measures for religious leaders but has also highlighted the modest nature of the 266th and current Pope of the Catholic Church. The Humble Beginnings: Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, hails from Argentina and has a reputation for living a simple and humble life. Before ascending to papacy, he was known to commute using public transportation in Buenos Aires and even lived in a small apartment, rather than the opulent archbishop's residence. Since his election as Pope in 2013, he has continued to live modestly, often surprising followers and the general public with his humble choices. Why Ditch the Bulletproof Popemobile? The bulletproof Popemobile was first introduced for Pope John Paul II after the assassination attempt on his life in 1981. Although Pope Francis's decision to abandon this security measure might appear risky, it aligns with his core principles of humility and accessibility. He believes that using the bulletproof vehicle distances him from the faithful who wish to interact with him and that nothing should stand between a religious leader and their followers. Pope Francis has been quoted as saying, \\"It's true that anything could happen, but let's face it; at my age, I don't have much to lose.\\" This lighthearted yet telling statement reflects the Pope's desire to live a more authentic life, regardless of potential security threats. Alternative Transportation: Without the bulletproof Popemobile, the Pope has opted for more conventional modes of transportation during his public appearances. A keen supporter of environmental conservation and climate change initiatives, he has used a compact electric vehicle outfitted with a Vatican City flag. Other times, he has opted for simple open-air vehicles, which have allowed him to be closer to the people he serves. In 2015, for example, Pope Francis used a Jeep Wrangler to travel around New York City during a visit to the United States. Security Concerns: Although Pope Francis's decision to ditch the bulletproof Popemobile may appear brave or even reckless in the face of past assassination attempts on popes, the Vatican's security forces continue to work tirelessly to ensure his safety during public events. Experts believe that the risks are managed effectively without compromising the Pope's desire for a more human and accessible image. The Impact on the Papacy: Pope Francis's choice to abandon the bulletproof Popemobile speaks volumes about his stance as a religious leader. By opting for more modest and environmentally friendly forms of transportation, he is sending a clear message about the importance of humility and ecological responsibility within the Catholic Church. Furthermore, by actively choosing to be closer to the faithful, he illustrates his commitment to a more open and inclusive church. In Conclusion: Pope Francis's decision to ditch the bulletproof Popemobile has been met with a wide range of reactions, from admiration for his courage and humility to concern for his safety. However, it is evident that this choice is in line with his values as a leader and his desire to bring the Church closer to its people. While the long-term impacts of this decision remain to be seen, it is undeniable that Pope Francis has made a powerful statement with his actions, one that may very well alter the future of the papacy and the perception of the Catholic Church."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: A woman holds a dog while another dog stands nearby in a field.

The town council not only rejected a proposed solar farm project but also placed a moratorium on all similar future projects. What has drawn ridicule, however, are the concerns and comments expressed by local residents during the comment period, as reported by the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald.

A retired science teacher voiced her concern that solar farms could interfere with photosynthesis, resulting in plant death around the town, and might even be a cause of cancer. She demanded more information about the potential impact of these projects. The representative from the company that proposed the solar farm project offered reassurances, stating that solar panels only make use of the sunlight that directly hits them, and they don't \\"draw additional sunlight.\\" However, despite these explanations, the decision to reject the project and place a moratorium on future solar initiatives was made.

When I was a teen I heard the word Wicca. I didn’t know what that was. I was curious and decided to investigate it. So, the next day I went to a book store. I asked the lady behind the counter if they had any books on “Wicca.” She got excited and whisked me off to the metaphysical section of the store. She told me she was pagan and started handing me book after book into my arms. Soon I could barely see over the books in my arms. I mumbled behind the books, “Which ONE book would you recommend.” She then handed me Scott Cunningham’s book Wicca, A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner. I purchased the book and took it home. With my dyslexia it was not easy for me to read. But I started reading and plowed through the book. I found many things I was already doing. He talked about things I already understood to be true. The book rang true for me. I dedicated myself to the God and Goddess when I finished the book. Have you ever had any bad experiences after completing a spell? I did a prosperity spell once and got the opposite reaction I was hoping for. I lost all my income! I realized later my mistakes and redid the spell correctly and then got the results I truly wanted. Question: Why do you think the lady at the bookstore was happy to help the author? === The answer to the above question is a). She was helping a customer.. b). She was dislexic. c). She was Pagan and wanted to share her knowledge. d). not enough information. The answer is:","output":"c). She was Pagan and wanted to share her knowledge. From the context in the passage, the lady at the bookstore seemed excited and was enthusiastic about helping the author when they inquired about Wicca. She guided them to the right section and suggested numerous books, showing her familiarity and personal interest in the topic. Although the passage does not explicitly state her motivations, it does reveal that she identified herself as a pagan, which suggests that she might have been eager to share her knowledge and help someone explore the path that she herself had chosen. It's important to note that helping a customer (option a) might have been part of her job, but it doesn't specifically explain her happiness or enthusiasm. The author of the passage was the one with dyslexia (option b), not the bookstore lady. There's no context suggesting option d). Therefore, option c) seems to be the most likely answer."},{"instruction":"former u.s. \`\` drug czar '' lee brown , with a pledge for inclusion and a call for residents to help him make the city prosperous , safe and clean , on friday took his oath as houston 's first african-american mayor .

'' Thus roused , Hermanfrid made a pact with the king of Metz , Theuderic I , to march against Baderic . Baderic was overcome by the Franks and beheaded , but Hermanfrid refused to fulfill his obligations to Theuderic , which led to enmity between the two kings . In 531 or 532 , Theuderic , his son Theudebert I , and his brother King Clotaire I of Soissons attacked the Thuringii . The Franks won a battle near the river Unstrut and took the royal seat at Scithingi ( modern Burgscheidungen ) .

However, it does provide insight into the social divisions and the limitations experienced by the plebeians in Roman society during the early Republic and regal era. To answer the original question more comprehensively, it is necessary to discuss the concentration of power within the Roman political structure, as well as the interplay between different social classes, institutions, and individuals who held key positions in this power dynamic. In ancient Rome, power was distributed among various levels of the society divided mainly between the patricians (elite, aristocratic class) and the plebeians (commoners). The basic power in Rome can be traced back to its political and social institutions, such as the Senate, the Assemblies, and the Consuls. 1. The Senate: The Senate was the primary institution where power resided in ancient Rome. Predominantly composed of patricians, it was responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies, laws, and governance. It held immense authority and influence over both domestic and foreign affairs. However, over time, the Senate did open up to some plebeians who were able to ascend the political hierarchy. 2. The Assemblies: The Roman assemblies also held a certain degree of power, as they served as a platform for the citizens of Rome to voice their concerns, vote on matters, and elect their officials. The primary assemblies included the Centuriate Assembly, the Tribal Assembly, and the Plebeian Assembly. While the patrician class held considerable sway over some of these assemblies, the Plebeian Assembly particularly represented the interests of the commoners. 3. The Consuls: The two annually-elected Consuls represented the highest executive authority in the Roman Republic. They served as military and civil leaders, sharing power and responsibilities. Although initially reserved for the patricians, plebeians eventually gained the right to run for consulship. 4. The Conflict of the Orders: Despite the existence of these political structures, power in Rome was not equally distributed between patricians and plebeians. This conflict led to a power struggle known as the Conflict of the Orders, which took place from around 494 BC to 287 BC. During this period, plebeians fought for their rights to political representation and equal application of laws, gradually securing access to various offices and rights, including the ability to become part of the Senate and serve as Consuls. 5. Magistrates and other positions of power: In addition to these key political institutions, numerous magistrates and elected officers played significant roles in the Roman power structure. These included the Praetors, Censors, Aediles, and others. In conclusion, while the statement provided does not directly answer where the basic power in Rome could be found, it does allude to the imbalanced distribution of power between the patricians and plebeians. The power in Rome was primarily concentrated in the Senate, the Assemblies, and the Consulship, but also involved several other magistrates and officers. While the patricians initially held the majority of this power, plebeians steadily gained access to these positions and institutions during the struggle that was the Conflict of the Orders."},{"instruction":"Generate a short summary this sentence: the u.s. dollar rose against most other major currencies in european trading thursday morning .

Other options like \\"at the park,\\" \\"martorell,\\" \\"jeep,\\" and \\"airplane\\" are not the most suitable choices for the scenario described. It is essential to understand each option's context to know why it is not the best answer. \\"At the park,\\" while technically possible, is not the most suitable option because parks are open spaces and typically do not have designated areas for movie-watching. While there might be instances where movies might be shown in a park, such as a special event or a film festival, it is not as common as watching a movie in a cinema. \\"Martorell\\" is a town in Spain, and there are many places within it, so this option does not provide a specific location for watching a movie. Additionally, it is unlikely that the word 'martorell' would be associated with movie-watching as a primary activity. A \\"jeep\\" is not a viable option because it is a vehicle primarily used for transportation and is not typically designed to provide a movie-watching experience. This choice would not be suitable as there are no clear indications that the person would be watching a movie in a moving vehicle. An \\"airplane\\" could be a possibility only if the scenario was different and focused on air travel. Airplanes often provide in-flight entertainment, including movies, for passengers.

Accordingly, you should figure out who to contact about making an offer for rights: If you are a publisher, then you should negotiate with the author’s agent or, if there is no agent, then with the author directly. Foreign publishers will probably need to contact the publishing house which published the book initially. They typically have specialist rights staff that you work with. Alternately, you may need to work with a sub-agent. Book publishers often offer the author an advance, which is an amount of money. The advance is usually deducted from future royalties. For example, if you offer a 10,000 advance, then the author doesn’t begin to receive royalties on each book sold until they have earned at least 10,000 in royalties. There is no easy way to determine how much an advance should be. If the author is unknown, then you might not need to offer any advance. Advances are also broken up and paid in installments. For example, one third may be paid upon accepting the manuscript, another third when the author delivers the manuscript, and the final third on publication. Royalties are standard and don’t vary much from contract to contract. However, you need to understand royalties before going into negotiations. Consider the following: Book royalties are typically calculated as a percentage of the retail price. For example, if a hardcover sells for 25.95 and the royalty rate is 15%, then the author gets around 3.90 per book. As a publisher, you might try to get the royalty based on the net price. This is the amount you receive as publisher after the book is sold. Royalty scales can be graduated. In other words, the royalty percentage increases as the number of books are sold. An author will want to know quite a bit of detail before agreeing to sign on with you. Accordingly, you should determine the following information before going any further: expected first run (e.g., 10,000 copies) proposed publication schedule local retail price your marketing plans the amount of your advance Call up the appropriate person (author, agent, publisher) and express interest in the work. You should be prepared to discuss how much you are willing to offer as an advance, as well as your expected first run. If what you are prepared to offer is far from what the author wants, they can decline to negotiate with you. You also should be prepared to talk about your publishing house. Ideally, you will have a brochure or a list of published works that you could share with the author or agent. This is particularly important if you are buying foreign rights, because the author might not be familiar with your reputation in a different country. Before moving on to draft a contract, you should reach agreement with the author on the details of publication. This will make the contract drafting much easier. Talk about the following: proposed formats for publication (e-book, paperback, hardback) whether the copyright will be in the author’s name or the publisher’s the applicable currency publication schedule length of license any additional rights (such as the right to re-license in your territory) proposed changes price and availability of electronic files who will obtain permission to reproduce illustrations or other images Summary:","output":"When getting a book published, you talk to different people like authors, agents, or publishers, and discuss things like money, how many books to make, and how to share the book's earnings, so everyone is happy and the book can be made and sold."},{"instruction":"Premise: Just opposite is the hospital, ages old but still in use.

First of all, a star for the decor and ambiance. It's so cute and colorful and comfy!

This may seem like a great idea, but I was able to watch food get sent back (3 different meals in the time we waited for ours) and see how long certain plates were left under hot lamps.

Police pulled a man over on Route 29 in Silver Spring last week because of a problem with his plates. This would not ordinarily make international news, but the car was a black Lamborghini, the license plate was the Batman symbol, and the driver was Batman, dressed head-to-toe in full superhero regalia. HOLY MOVING VIOLATION! It didn’t take long before images of the Dark Knight’s encounter with law enforcement began turning up in Facebook news feeds, on CNN and the London tabloids. The episode even made it into Jimmy Fallon’s monologue on NBC earlier this week. Jokers emerged instantaneously too. “Let him do his job,” one commenter urged on the Post Web site. “Batman has expensive taste,” noted another. Meanwhile, questions about Batman’s identity mounted: “Did they make him take off his mask?” someone asked. No, they did not. Even Montgomery County police honor a superhero code of conduct, just like the Howard County officers who once helped him with a flat bat tire. Batman told officers his real name was not Bruce Wayne but Lenny B. Robinson, and that his real tags were in the car. (He was not ticketed then, but has been before for a heavy bat foot.) The Caped Crusader is a businessman from Baltimore County who visits sick children in hospitals, handing out Batman paraphernalia to up-and-coming superheros who first need to beat cancer and other wretched diseases. “I’m just doing it for the kids,” he says. But in light of him going viral — “Gotham City is on the verge of chaos,” Anderson Cooper informed CNN viewers — I asked him whether I could unveil the man behind the mask. He acquiesced but suggested I do so by accompanying him to the cancer ward at Children’s National Medical Center in Northwest Washington for a superhero party thrown by the Hope for Henry organization. On Monday, he pulled up in his black Lambo with yellow Batman symbols on the doors, the floor mats, the headrests — pretty much everywhere — and he was dressed in his heavy leather and neoprene uniform that he bought from a professional costume maker. He carried two large bags of Batman books, rubber Batman symbol bracelets and various other toys up to the front desk, where the check-in attendant asked him his name. “Batman,” he said. Lenny B. Robinson and Wonder Woman (Leslie Vincent from Cast of Thousands) visit patients at the annual Hope for Henry Superhero Celebration at Georgetown University Hospital. (Allen Goldberg) The check-in attendant asked for identification. Batman said it was in his Batmobile. The check-in attendant, just doing her job, asked for his real name. “Lenny,” he announced. “B, as in Batman. Robinson.” It took Batman approximately 20 minutes to reach the elevators. He stopped to hand out Batman toys to every child he saw, picking them up for pictures, asking them how they were feeling. LaTon Dicks snapped a photo of Batman standing behind her son DeLeon in his wheelchair. She’d recognized the Batmobile on her way in to the hospital. Like everyone else, she’d seen a TV report on him being stopped by the police and protested, “You can’t pull over Batman.” When Batman finally reached the elevator for the slow ride up to the cancer ward, I could see his face already sweating behind the mask. He told me he loses 5 to 6 pounds in water weight when he wears the superhero uniform. He paid 5,000 for it. He spends 25,000 a year of his own money on Batman toys and memorabilia. He signs every book, hat, T-shirt and backpack he hands out — Batman. Batman is 48. He is a self-made success and has the bank account to prove it. He recently sold, for a pile of cash, a commercial cleaning business that he started as a teenager. He became interested in Batman through his son Brandon, who was obsessed with the caped crusader when he was little. “I used to call him Batman,” he told me. “His obsession became my obsession.” Batman began visiting Baltimore area hospitals in 2001, sometimes with his now teenage son Brandon playing Robin. Once other hospitals and charities heard about his car and his cape, Batman was put on superhero speed dial for children’s causes around the region. He visits sick kids at least couple times a month, sometimes more often. He visits schools, too, to talk about bullying. He does not do birthday parties. His superhero work is limited to doing good deeds, part of a maturation process in his own life. In his earlier years, he acknowledges that he sometimes displayed an unsuperhero-like temper and got into occasional trouble with the law for fights and other confrontations. Putting on the Batman uniform changes and steadies him. “Eventually, it sinks in and you become him,” Batman told me. “It feels like I have a responsibility that’s beyond a normal person. And that responsibility is to be there for the kids, to be strong for them, and to make them smile as much as I can.” He understands that might sound corny, but he doesn’t care. View Photo Gallery: Five things you can learn from a superhero. Batman stepped off the elevator on the fourth floor of Children’s. Spider-Man and Wonder Woman were there too — both professional actors from talent agencies, on the clock. He picked up a little boy and said, “I have a present for you.” He shook hands with a father and handed him a yellow rubber Batman bracelet, saying, “This will bring you good luck.” The father said, “We need good luck.” The parents always say that. Batman asked each child his or her name. He lifted up almost every child. Many were weak, their hair thin from chemo. He always told them, “I have a present for you.” When a little girl ran away, perhaps a bit scared, Batman said, “That’s the story of Batman’s love life.” (He is divorced.) Batman overheard a mother tell someone that her toddler was going home the next day, and holding the toddler, and hugging him gently, Batman said, “I’m really glad you are feeling better.” Stephanie Broadhead of California, Md., was leaning against the wall while her 10-year-old daughter Claire was having her face drawn by an artist. Claire has leukemia. Batman stopped by to marvel at the picture and hand Claire some gifts. “This makes a very hard thing to deal with a little easier,” Claire’s mom said. Superhero visits to hospitals let kids be kids in a scary, adult place, but the activities are indeed therapeutic, too, the chief doctor on the cancer floor told me. “These visits provide an immediate boost for these kids,”said Jeffrey Dome, the oncology division chief at Children’s. “Some of these children have to stay for weeks or months at a time. That wears down the children and it wears down the family. You have to keep up morale. A visit from a superhero is sort of like a fantasy in the middle of all this hard-core therapy.” As Batman wandered around from child to child, I asked him, “Isn’t this hard?” His children are healthy. My children are healthy. “We are very lucky,” he said. “All I can say is we are very, very lucky.” The party began winding down. Spider-Man changed out of his costume. Wonder Woman changed out of hers. They said goodbye to Batman, still working the floor, as he posed for a photo with a patient’s father. The father thanked Batman and said, “I saw you on the news — Route 29.” “I think everyone saw me on Route 29,” Batman acknowledged. He asked the nurses at the front desk whether there were any children who couldn’t come out of their rooms to see him. Assured that there weren’t, Batman headed back down to his Batmobile, followed by the mother of a baby girl with cancer and her healthy 4-year-old son, whose only goal in life at that moment was to see the Batmobile. When the boy saw the car, I thought his eyeballs were going to separate from his body. (Batman is actually in the process of having a just-like-the-movies Batmobile built for 250,000, but it’s not ready yet.) Batman revved the engines and blasted the audio system — the Batman theme song. Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, Batman! He revved the engine some more. The little boy didn’t want to say goodbye, but his mom told him, “Batman needs to go fight the bad guys.” The little boy cried. “I want to go help him fight the bad guys,” he said. His mom said, “You need to go help your sister fight cancer.” Batman sped away.

They haven't felt like they had something proud [in hip-hop] to stand on, so being both Latin and black, I wanted to rep my Latin side for once.

While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady.

Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with the Union.

Answer:","output":"What aspect of the movie plot showcases intricate attention to detail and precision, effectively contributing to the overall quality of the film's storytelling?"},{"instruction":"Which Austrian composer wrote the music for the German National Anthem?","output":"The Austrian composer who wrote the music for the German National Anthem is Joseph Haydn. Haydn, born on March 31, 1732, in Rohrau, Austria, was a prolific and prominent composer of the Classical period. He is often referred to as the \\"Father of the Symphony\\" and the \\"Father of the String Quartet\\" due to his significant contributions to these musical forms. Haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the Esterházy family at their remote estate, where he was isolated from other composers and constantly challenged to produce a steady output of works. The music for the German national anthem, titled \\"Deutschlandlied\\" (also known as \\"Das Lied der Deutschen\\" or \\"The Song of the Germans\\"), originally comes from Haydn's composition called \\"Kaiserhymne\\" (Emperor's Hymn) or \\"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\\" (God Save Emperor Francis), which served as an Austrian patriotic song to celebrate the birthday of the Austrian Emperor Francis II in 1797. The melody later became the tune for the German national anthem. The lyrics of the German national anthem were written by August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben in 1841. The first verse, which begins with the words \\"Deutschland, Deutschland über alles\\" (Germany, Germany above all), was widely associated with the nationalism and expansionism during the Nazi era. However, after World War II, only the third verse of the lyrics, which starts with \\"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\\" (Unity and justice and freedom), was adopted as the official anthem of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1952. In conclusion, Joseph Haydn, the highly influential Austrian composer, wrote the music for the German National Anthem, borrowing from his own composition initially meant to celebrate the Austrian Emperor. The melody, combined with the lyrics by Hoffmann von Fallersleben, has become a symbol of unity and national pride for Germany."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Therefore, I will provide an elaborative explanation on the art of crafting concise sentences, exploring various aspects like sentence structure, choice of words, and overall effectiveness in communication. To begin, crafting a brief sentence necessitates a clear understanding of the core message that needs to be conveyed. A concise sentence aims at expressing a single thought as simply as possible, without compromising on clarity and coherence. It is important to recognize that less is more when it comes to constructing brief sentences, as they are intended to convey information with efficiency and ease. When crafting a brief sentence, it is crucial to focus on the subject, verb, and object (SVO) structure as this allows for maximal clarity. The subject refers to the person, place, or thing the sentence is about; the verb represents the action being performed; and the object indicates the entity receiving the action. By adhering to this format, one can ensure that the message is coherent and logical. For example, a well-crafted brief sentence would be, \\"John reads books.\\" Moreover, in an effort to maintain brevity, it is advisable to avoid using redundant or superfluous words. Unnecessary adverbs and adjectives can often extend a sentence without adding value or meaning. For example, instead of writing, \\"John quickly and efficiently reads many different types of books,\\" one could simply say, \\"John reads diverse books.\\" Furthermore, the choice of words plays a crucial role in a sentence's effectiveness. Selecting precise, descriptive, and lucid terms can aid in delivering the intended message accurately. For example, compare the sentence, \\"The cat moved quietly,\\" to \\"The cat prowled.\\" While both convey similar ideas, the latter is considerably more evocative and concise. Additionally, the use of strong, active verbs rather than passive ones enables the construction of a brief sentence with greater impact. Consider the difference between, \\"The ball was kicked by the player,\\" and \\"The player kicked the ball.\\" The second sentence uses an active voice, which allows the sentence to be both shorter and more engaging. Lastly, it is worth keeping in mind that crafting a brief sentence does not mean sacrificing meaning or emotional impact. A well-crafted brief sentence should be able to convey its message effectively and evoke the desired response from the reader, all while adhering to the principles of clarity and brevity. In conclusion, the art of crafting a concise sentence involves focusing on the SVO structure, avoiding redundant words, selecting precise terms, and using strong active verbs. It is essential to consider these factors when looking to convey information in a simple, efficient, and impactful manner."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

But when people want the same thing, sometimes they fight over it, just like how kids fight over toys. This has happened in some sea areas near China too. But don't worry, there's a magic rule called the Antarctic Treaty that helps stop the arguing. It says that no one can claim parts of the cold areas and also no fighting is allowed.

Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been, which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes \\"being ahead of oneself\\" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended. We are not stuck in sequential time. We are able to remember the past and project into the future—we have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.

Letty climbs onto the GNX's hood and hops onto the last fuel tanker while Dom pulls ahead of the semi and stays in front of it to keep it at a certain speed. The first pickup (driven by Han from the third film, 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift') does a perfect 180-degree U-turn and continues in reverse while his female occupant flips over a part of the truck and lands perfectly onto the hitch on the back of the last fuel tanker.

With rates at just 0.05 percent—deposit rates are actually negative in real terms—investors have little reason to put money in euro-denominated assets. To spur demand for euros the central bankers are now turning once more to the idea of buying bonds issued in euros, a policy called quantitative easing that the U.S. Federal Reserve deployed shortly after the financial crisis unfolded in 2008. Now, with roughly 4.5 trillion in holdings sitting in its vaults—the Fed recently ended its buying spree. In sharp contrast, Europe central bankers have deployed much more tepid response, in large part because of more limited powers, political squabbling and bureaucratic paralysis. Now, with interest rates at zero and Europe mired in deepening stagnation, speculation has risen that central bankers will finally decide at their upcoming Jan. 22 meeting that a U.S.-style bond-buying program is the Continent's last best hope to revive growth. Read More US economic recovery finally taking hold In the meantime, a weaker euro is already helping spur demand for European goods and services, especially among consumers using dollars to pay for them. Since May, the euro has slid nearly 15 percent against the dollar, effectively creating a generous markdown. A year ago, for example, the cheapest fare for a round-trip, nonstop flight from New York to Frankfurt in July cost 1,460. Today, you can buy the same ticket for 1,193. (To be sure, lower fuel prices account for at least part of the savings. Those lower costs should also help Europe jump-start growth.) Read MoreCrude price slide hits oil exporter currencies The weaker euro should also help spur European consumer demand for locally produced goods, which can be bought at a discount compared with imported goods from the U.S., which are priced in stronger dollars. All of which should help the euro zone economy pull out of its stall and grow by 1.4 percent this year compared with just 0.8 percent growth in 2014, according to IHS Global Insight's chief European economist, Howard Archer. \\"(But) there is a significant risk that the anticipated help to growth coming from low oil prices and the weak euro will be diluted by persistent business and consumer caution resulting from fragile confidence,\\" he said in a note to clients.

Some analysts think the euro zone currency could soon trade at parity, a level not seen since at the end of 2002. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article revolve around the economic impact of the euro's slide and the potential for quantitative easing in Europe. The key points are as follows: 1. Europe's central bankers have cut interest rates to nearly zero to encourage borrowing and boost economic growth, but these measures have not been as effective as hoped. 2. With low-interest rates and negative deposit rates in real terms, investors have limited incentive to invest in euro-denominated assets. 3. European central bankers are now considering quantitative easing, similar to the policy the U.S. Federal Reserve introduced in 2008, by buying bonds issued in euros to stimulate demand. 4. The euro's slide is already generating increased demand for European goods and services due to the markdown effect, especially for consumers paying in dollars. Since May, the euro has lost nearly 15% of its value against the dollar. 5.

Verbs generally go towards the end in a sentence. Also, Russian does not use articles (\\"a\\" or \\"the\\"), so specific phrases can be tricky to translate directly. Moreover, medical language can be different between languages. For example, whereas we use \\"HIV negative\\" in English to describe someone who does not have the virus, in Russian the more common phrasing is \\"patients with negative results for HIV\\" (\\"Пациенты с отрицательными результатами на ВИЧ\\"). In addition to that, note that the letters \\"ВИЧ\\" stands for \\"Вирус иммунодефицита человека\\", which is the direct translation for \\"Human Immunodeficiency Virus\\".

This task involves understanding the properties and interactions of various physical objects like wood, tools, and various hardware components. It also necessitates applying practical woodworking skills to complete the project successfully. Here's a detailed explanation of the process: 1. Planning and designing: First, it is essential to identify the space, dimensions, and desired style of the bookshelf. This will require taking accurate measurements of the intended location and evaluating the load capacity required to hold the books and other potential items. Then, a blueprint or design sketch can be drawn up featuring the overall design, layout, and dimensions. Knowledge of different types of wood and materials will help you choose the one that best suits your budget and aesthetic preferences. 2. Sourcing materials: Once the design is ready, materials like wood planks, screws, nails, wood glue, and other hardware components need to be procured. You will need to select the appropriate type of wood (e.g., oak, pine, or plywood), considering factors such as durability, weight, and appearance. Other essential tools and supplies include a handsaw or circular saw, drill, sandpaper, levels, clamps, tape measure, and protective gear like gloves and goggles. 3. Cutting and shaping: With the materials and tools ready, the next step is accurately cutting and shaping the wood planks according to the design's dimensions. This requires knowledge of how to operate power tools like saws and drills safely, as well as properly measuring, marking, and cutting the wood to maintain aesthetics and functionality. Any rough edges should be smoothed using sandpaper to prevent splintering or injuries during assembly. 4. Assembling the bookshelf: The individual pieces should be assembled systematically, based on the design plan. This often involves securing the shelves to the vertical sides using wood glue and screws or nails. Either a corner clamp or a T-bar clamp is used to hold the components in place throughout the assembly process, ensuring that all parts are aligned correctly. Additional support may be necessary, depending on the design and weight requirements. 5. Finishing touches: After the bookshelf has been assembled and is structurally sound, it's time to focus on its appearance. Wood fillers can be used to fill any gaps or imperfections, followed by another round of sanding. Finally, a finish like paint, stain, or varnish can be applied, depending on the chosen look and desired level of protection against wear and tear. Allow adequate drying time before placing any items on the shelves. In summary, building a custom wooden bookshelf requires extensive knowledge and understanding of physical objects, their properties, and how they interact with one another. It involves meticulous planning, design, and execution using various tools and techniques to create a functional and visually pleasing piece of furniture."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film opens with an animated prologue revealing the origins of leprechauns, stating that they were summoned by a king to protect his gold from those who would try to steal it.

Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Problem:The gut microbiota has been proposed as an environmental factor that affects the development of metabolic and inflammatory diseases in mammals. Recent reports indicate that gut bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can initiate obesity and insulin resistance in mice; however, the molecular interactions responsible for microbial regulation of host metabolism and mediators of inflammation have not been studied in detail. Hepatic serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are markers and proposed mediators of inflammation that exhibit increased levels in serum of insulin-resistant mice. Adipose tissue-derived SAA3 displays monocyte chemotactic activity and may play a role in metabolic inflammation associated with obesity and insulin resistance. To investigate a potential mechanistic link between the intestinal microbiota and induction of proinflammatory host factors, we performed molecular analyses of germ-free, conventionally raised and genetically modified Myd88-/- mouse models. SAA3 expression was determined to be significantly augmented in adipose (9.9+/-1.9-fold; P<0.001) and colonic tissue (7.0+/-2.3-fold; P<0.05) by the presence of intestinal microbes. In the colon, we provided evidence that SAA3 is partially regulated through the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling axis. We identified epithelial cells and macrophages as cellular sources of SAA3 in the colon and found that colonic epithelial expression of SAA3 may be part of an NF-kappaB-dependent response to LPS from gut bacteria. In vitro experiments showed that LPS treatments of both epithelial cells and macrophages induced SAA3 expression (27.1+/-2.5-fold vs. 1.6+/-0.1-fold, respectively). Our data suggest that LPS, and potentially other products of the indigenous gut microbiota, might elevate cytokine expression in tissues and thus exacerbate chronic low-grade inflammation observed in obesity.

There is a gathering of the king's subjects to hear details from the clergy as to why England has the right to claim the lands of the French. According to the clergy, by contract from previous encounters, the french must have a male heir, but at present have a female one, which effectually nullifies French royalty's claim to the french kingdom.The king warns the clergy to state the facts -- any other entreaty would lead to \\"much fall of blood,\\" which is expected due to the two contending kingdom's property.

Answer the above question based on the context below: When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

Answer should be yes or no. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Q: Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Jerry Jones is Positive . FRISCO Texas (AP) â Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones says his objection to a contract extension for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is not because of star running back Ezekiel Elliott's six-game suspension over alleged domestic violence. Jones said on his radio show Friday he wants all 32 owners to have a chance to approve the deal being negotiated between Goodell and the compensation committee that includes six owners. Jones is not on the committee. The NFL has said owners already voted unanimously to extend Goodell's contract and authorize the committee to work out the deal. Jones said circumstances have changed since that May vote including the escalation of the protests over social injustice that have involved the national anthem. Jones also said \\"behavioral policies\\" have been an issue since May. Goodell suspended Elliott in August. He suggested he was at odds with the compensation committee chairman Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank. Jones said he disagrees with Blank's assertion that the compensation committee can complete the deal without another vote of all owners. Jones spoke a day after a federal appeals court on Thursday denied bid by Elliott to keep his six-game ban on hold making him ineligible to play against Atlanta on Sunday. \\"I really fervently disagree that we shouldn't have him on the playing field \\" Jones said. \\"But a lot of people are trying to tie it in frankly with the issue regarding my stance as to the chairman and renewing the commissioner. That's really not right.\\" The 75-year-old Jones said the compensation committee could appease him by agreeing to let the remaining owners review and approve the final contract with Goodell. \\"I think just since the period of time that we first addressed extending Roger I think we've had several material adverse conditions happen \\" Jones said. \\"We should basically honor those conditions such things as the anthem such things as behavioral policies. Jones said his relationship with Goodell and issues related to his compensation are deeper than his recent concern over the league's handling of Elliott's case. \\"I've been dealing with this commissioner for almost 28 years as an employee of the NFL \\" Jones said. \\"Zeke's been involved here a year a year and a half. The policy that we have that has impacted Zeke is more of my issue with the commissioner more so than Zeke's particular circumstance.\\" The anthem issue flared after President Donald Trump criticized kneeling players and again when Jones declared he would bench any player he felt was disrespecting the flag. The NFL hasn't changed a guideline that encourages but does not require players to stand during the anthem. \\"This is simply about making sure that all clubs have input into not only what the commissioner his extension but also in future years his decisions \\" Jones said. \\"We've given him a lot of power. I think we need the checks and balances of ownership having to actually be in a position to not just suggest but approve of his decisions.\\" A:","output":"The task is asking you to verify if the sentiment towards the entity, Jerry Jones, in the given document is positive.

We can eliminate \\"longing\\" and \\"enjoyable\\" immediately because the sentiment conveyed in the question is negative, and these two options have positive connotations. James hated baseball and didn't find it fun, so an outcome with a positive emotion wouldn't make sense. Now, we are left with \\"grief,\\" \\"boredom,\\" and \\"stress.\\" But nothing in the question suggests that baseball caused James personal distress or deep sadness to experience grief, nor are there any explicit cues that he felt stressed while watching the game. The suitable option remaining is \\"boredom.\\" The question explains that James hated baseball and didn't find it fun to watch. Boredom is the feeling of being unsatisfied or uninterested in an activity, which aligns perfectly with the context.

In addition to annuity payments system assumes that, in the first half of the loan period you pay in interest on the loan. Please remove spaces between words.","output":"The main disadvantage of annuity payments lies in the fact that the total amount paid as interest on the loan tends to be higher than when using a differentiated payment system. This is because the annuity system expects borrowers to make a significant portion of their interest payments during the early years of the loan term. Annuity payments are characterized by a fixed monthly payment, which remains unchanged for the entire loan period. This fixed payment is comprised of two parts: interest and principal. In this payment system, the interest portion of the payment is much higher during the initial phase of the repayment period, whereas the principal repayment gradually increases over time. As the interest portion decreases, more of the borrower's payment starts to be applied towards the repayment of the principal, resulting in a reduction of the overall outstanding loan balance. On the other hand, the differentiated payment system is designed so that the borrower repays the principal in equal installments throughout the entire loan period. As a result, the monthly payment amount decreases gradually as the outstanding balance reduces, leading to less overall interest paid over the loan term. To summarize, the main disadvantage of the annuity payments system is the relatively higher total interest paid on the loan, mainly due to the higher interest levied during the initial half of the loan period. This is in contrast to the differentiated payment system, which typically results in lower overall interest payments, making it a preferable option for borrowers seeking to minimize their long-term financial liability."},{"instruction":"Here are some keywords about a restaurant: name = The Waterman, eatType = restaurant, food = French, priceRange = more than £30, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes.

David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a \\"Daniel Vavinsky,\\" published in 2008 in Actualité Juive in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.The court established that \\"Daniel Vavinsky\\" was a pseudonym for Clément Weill-Raynal, a deputy editor at France 3. In 2011 it ruled that David and Actualité Juive had defamed Jamal. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of Actualité Juive, were fined €5,000 each, and Actualité Juive was ordered to print a retraction. The Israeli government said it would fund David's appeal. The appeal was upheld in 2012; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli's prime minister, telephoned David to congratulate him. Jamal Al-Durrah said he would appeal the court's decision.In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote in Haaretz that he had examined Jamal's 50-page medical file, and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were \\"completely different wounds\\" from the 1994 injuries. Walden listed \\"a gunshot wound in the right wrist, a shattered forearm bone, multiple fragment wounds in a palm, gunshot wounds in the right thigh, a fractured pelvis, an exit wound in the buttocks, a tear in the main nerve of the right thigh, tears in the main groin arteries and veins, and two gunshot wounds in the left lower leg.\\", can you guess it ?

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Organic semiconductors are a class of materials that possess semiconducting properties and are primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, along with other elements like oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen. These materials can exist in the form of small molecules, polymers, or molecular crystals, and have gained significant interest in recent years due to their potential applications in flexible electronics, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes. The concept of HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) in organic semiconductors relates to the energy levels of the molecular orbitals. These energy levels determine the electronic properties of the material, such as its ability to conduct electricity or emit light. HOMO is the highest energy level in which the electrons are present, while LUMO is the lowest energy level that is empty or unoccupied. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO is known as the bandgap, which defines the minimum energy required for an electron to be excited from the HOMO level to the LUMO level. Organic semiconductors tend to have comparably smaller bandgaps than inorganic semiconductors, which enables them to absorb light and emit photons over a wider range of wavelengths. The statement, \\"Mainly due to low mobility, even unpaired electrons may be stable in charge-transfer complexes,\\" refers to the fact that organic semiconductors generally have a lower charge carrier mobility compared to inorganic semiconductors due to the weak, non-covalent interactions between the molecules. As a result, the unpaired electrons in organic semiconductors may be stabilized in charge-transfer complexes, which are formed when electrons from one molecule get transferred to another molecule. These complexes can play a role in various electronic processes, such as charge separation and recombination in devices like solar cells or organic light-emitting diodes. In summary, organic semiconductors are materials with semiconducting properties composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The concept of HOMO and LUMO energy levels is essential in understanding their electronic properties. The provided statement is correct, highlighting the inherent low mobility of charge carriers and the ability to stabilize unpaired electrons in organic semiconductors."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: A lion cub (their baby) for the following movie plot: The Lion King takes place in the Pride Lands of Africa, where a lion rules over the other animals as king.

It's important to remember that you're not above your peers, your teachers, or anyone at your school. The more you can accept the things that make you alike, instead of focusing on the ways in which you're different, the easier getting through school will be. If you struggle to make friends in school, things can be a lot more challenging. Try to find a small group of people that you trust and enjoy to spend time with. Often, people who struggle with antisocial tendencies can thrive with a good group of friends. The \\"popular\\" kids at your school don't make for ideal friends in every case. Ignore them and make a different group of friends. Antisocial teenagers commonly describe a disdain for the popular crowd, and it's always more healthy to ignore that scene as much as possible. The workplace can be another challenging environment for antisocial people. Having to deal with a variety of personalities and authority figures can tax anyone's social skills, especially if you prefer your own company. While lots of the specifics of negotiating your work day will have to do with your particular job, you can learn to do a few things to keep yourself happy and healthy. Avoid group projects and collaborative efforts, which can cause conflicts for people with antisocial tendencies. Do your own work. Nod and smile to authority figures. You don't have to like your boss, but if you want to keep your job, you need to keep your feelings under control. Avoid awkward confrontations. Have a variety of other hobbies and interests outside of work. If work proves to be a challenging social environment, make friends and spend time doing lots of things outside of work to help keep your personal time busy and engaged. Big crowds of people yelling and dancing and screaming and taking selfies? Parties are a big bummer for introverts and antisocial people alike, and trying to negotiate invitations can cause stress and anxiety. Stop worrying about whether or not you'll let an acquaintance down by not showing up to the party because you want to stay home and read. Plan to make a quick stop in and then go back to doing what you want to do. Do a quick run through the party, stay long enough for a snack and a free drink, make a break for the bathroom, then ditch out the backdoor and make your getaway.

This implies that Kai was imitating or copying the fashion of others around her rather than developing her own unique sense of style. As a result, others may feel a variety of emotions. Some people might feel flattered that Kai is emulating their style, thinking that imitation is the highest form of compliment. They may appreciate that she recognizes their good taste in fashion and feel pleased that she is following their example. On the other hand, there are those who may feel offended or annoyed by Kai's behavior, thinking that she is unoriginal or lacks creativity. They may see her copying as a lack of individuality, which could be especially frustrating for those who take pride in expressing their unique sense of style through fashion.

Step-by-step reasoning process: A car motor can not run on water. The question and answer:","output":"Question: Why can't a car motor run on water instead of gasoline or other fuels? Answer: A car motor, or specifically an internal combustion engine, cannot run on water because it requires a fuel that can be combusted when mixed with air and ignited by a spark inside the engine's cylinders. Water is not a combustible substance; it does not catch fire or burn, which makes it unsuitable as a fuel for most car engines. In an internal combustion engine, fuel is mixed with air, compressed in the cylinders, and ignited by a small spark, which releases energy in the form of expanding gases. This energy drives the pistons, converting the linear motion into rotational motion to power the vehicle. Gasoline and other fuels are used because they have high energy content that is released through combustion. Water, on the other hand, is chemically stable and does not combust. Being made up of hydrogen and oxygen, water is already a combustion product, and it would take more energy to separate these elements than what can be gained from burning them together. Consequently, using water as a fuel would not produce the necessary energy to move the car. In summary, a car motor cannot run on water because water is not a combustible fuel and cannot provide the necessary energy to power the engine effectively."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: Anabasis Alexandri","output":"Anabasis Alexandri - Alekseanterin Anabasis Step 1: Identify the language of the original text.

It is the opinion of several historians that during the Spanish Civil War, Franco's goal was to turn Spain into a totalitarian state like Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. However, its entry into the war on the Axis side was prevented largely by, as was much later revealed, British Secret Intelligence Service (MI-6) efforts that included up to 200 million in bribes for Spanish officials to keep the regime from getting involved.

No. Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what can be used to cook eggs?\\" is \\"the egg timer\\", given that eggs can be cooked on a stove? A:","output":"As an AI assistant, I understand that you have offered two choices, \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\", and are seeking a detailed and long answer incorporating the given information. To clarify, the question at hand is whether the egg timer is the correct answer to the question of what can be used to cook eggs, considering that eggs can be cooked on a stove. Firstly, let us examine the basic functions of both the egg timer and stove. An egg timer is a device that is designed to measure and keep track of time, usually for the purpose of ensuring that eggs are cooked to the desired level. On the other hand, a stove is a kitchen appliance that allows for direct cooking through the use of various heat sources like electric coils, gas burners, or induction plates. Evidently, these two items serve distinctly different purposes within the realm of cooking and food preparation. Given that the primary function of an egg timer is to keep track of time in relation to cooking, it does not inherently possess the ability to cook eggs on its own. While it may be essential in determining when the eggs are ready to be consumed, the physical act of cooking is not facilitated by the egg timer itself. Instead, it serves as a supplementary tool, working in tandem with stoves, ovens, and other appliances that generate heat for actual cooking. On the contrary, stoves possess the essential heating elements required for cooking eggs, like frying eggs in a pan, boiling eggs in water, and even scrambling eggs. The heat generated by the stove provides the direct means for cooking, whereas an egg timer can only monitor time and signal when the eggs are expected to be properly cooked. Therefore, the stove, rather than the egg timer, should be considered the key appliance used for cooking eggs. As a result, the right answer to the question \\"what can be used to cook eggs?\\" is not \\"the egg timer\\". The egg timer is primarily a tool used to assist in timing an egg's cooking process, while the item responsible for actually cooking the eggs is the stove. Accurately recognizing and distinguishing the core functionalities of both the egg timer and stove demonstrates that the stove is indispensable for cooking eggs. Consequently, option (ii) \\"No\\" would be the appropriate selection."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Six very colorful hot air balloons getting ready to fly.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The balloons just took off.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - In the botanical classification of plants, Aeridinae (formerly Sarcanthinae) is a subtribe of the Tribe Vandeae (Family Orchidaceae) whose representatives all have a monopodial growth habit and do not possess pseudobulbs. - The Vandeae is a large monophyletic tribe within the family of orchids. - An epiphyte is a plant that grows harmlessly upon another plant (such as a tree) and derives its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and sometimes from debris accumulating around it. Epiphytes differ from parasites in that epiphytes grow on other plants for physical support and do not necessarily negatively affect the host. An epiphytic organism that is not a plant is called an epibiont. Epiphytes are usually found in the temperate zone (e.g., many mosses, liverworts, lichens, and algae) or in the tropics (e.g., many ferns, cacti, orchids, and bromeliads). Epiphyte species make good houseplants due to their minimal water and soil requirements. Epiphytes provide a rich and diverse habitat for other organisms including animals, fungi, bacteria, and myxomycetes. - East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe. - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - In plant systematics Epidendroideae is a subfamily of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Epidendroideae is larger than all the other orchid subfamilies together, comprising more than 15,000 species in 576 genera. Most Epidendroid orchids are tropical epiphytes, typically with pseudobulbs. There are, however, some terrestrials such as \\"Epipactis\\" and even a few myco-heterotrophs, which are parasitic upon mycorrhizal fungi. - Rhynchostylis (abbreviated Rhy in the horticultural trade) is a genus in the Orchid family (Orchidaceae),closely allied to the genus Vanda (from which it differs in the one-lobed lip of the flower) and comprising four currently accepted species native to the Indian Subcontinent, China, Indochina, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The name consists of a compound of two Greek elements : \\"rhynchos\\" 'beak' and \\"stylis\\" 'column' - in reference to the very boad, fleshy column of the flower. The flowers are borne in dense racemes and are noted for their intense, spicy fragrance. Although lacking in pseudobulbs, the plants have leathery leaves that are drought-resistant. These orchids grow naturally in warm, moist, shaded tropical areas and will thrive in cultivation if given consistent warmth, uniform moisture and bright, but indirect light. Hobbyists wanting to grow them will need a warm, humid growing environment with gentle air movement. They can be grown in pots, but are better grown in baskets, owing to the extreme fleshiness of their roots. Their unusually fragrant blooms often appear in the slightly cooler Winter months. - A raceme (or ) is an unbranched, indeterminate type of inflorescence bearing \\"pedicellate\\" flowersflowers having short floral stalks called pedicelsalong its axis. In botany, an \\"axis\\" means a shoot, in this case one bearing the flowers. In indeterminate inflorescence-like racemes, the oldest flowers are borne towards the base and new flowers are produced as the shoot grows, with no predetermined growth limit. A plant that flowers on a showy raceme may have this reflected in its scientific name, e.g. \\"Cimicifuga racemosa\\". A compound raceme, also called a panicle, has a branching main axis. Examples of racemes occur on mustard (genus \\"Brassica\\") and radish (genus \\"Raphanus\\") plants. - Vanda is a genus in the orchid family (Orchidaceae), which although not massive (about 80 species), is one of the genera more commonly found in the marketplace. This genus and its allies are considered to be among the most specifically adapted of all orchids within the Orchidaceae. The genus is highly prized in horticulture for its showy, fragrant, long-lasting, and intensely colorful flowers. \\"Vanda\\" species are widespread across East Asia, Southeast Asia, and New Guinea, with a few species extending into Queensland and some of the islands of the western Pacific. The genus is sometimes abbreviated as\\" V.\\" in the floral trade. Systematic. In a recent molecular study of the genus \\"Vanda\\" , several Genera including the former Genus \\"Ascosentrum\\", \\"Neofinitea\\" and \\"Euanthe\\" were believed as a synonym of \\"Vanda\\", - Queensland (abbreviated as QLD) is the second-largest and third-most-populous state in the Commonwealth of Australia. Situated in the north-east of the country, it is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean. Queensland has a population of 4,750,500, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. The state is the world's sixth largest sub-national entity, with an area of 1,852,642 km. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. Often referred to as the \\"Sunshine State\\", Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy. Tourism in the state, fuelled largely by its warm tropical climate, is a major industry. - The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and often fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family. - × Perreiraara , abbreviated Prra . in the horticultural trade , is the nothogenus for intergeneric hybrids between the orchid genera Aerides , Rhynchostylis and Vanda ( Aer . x Rhy . x V. ) . - Aerides, known commonly as cat's-tail orchids and fox brush orchids, is a genus belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) (subfamily Epidendroideae, tribe Vandeae, subtribe Aeridinae). It is a group of tropical epiphyte orchids that grow mainly in the warm lowlands of tropical Asia from India to southern China to New Guinea. They are valued in horticulture for their racemes of showy, fragrant, colorful flowers. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands.

In this translation, the original English sentence \\"They just hadn't twigged to the fact that their communications were vulnerable.\\" is translated into Czech as \\"Oni prostě nepřišli na to, že jejich komunikace byla zranitelná.\\" Here is a breakdown of the translation: - \\"They\\" translates to \\"Oni\\", which is a plural third person pronoun in Czech. - \\"just\\" translates to \\"prostě\\", which is an adverb that adds emphasis to the sentence. - \\"hadn't twigged\\" is translated as \\"nepřišli na to\\". The verb \\"přijít na\\" means \\"to come to\\" or \\"to realize\\" in Czech. Adding the negative prefix \\"ne-\\" to the verb creates the meaning \\"hadn't realized\\". The past tense is indicated by \\"přišli\\", which is the past tense form of \\"přijít\\". - \\"to the fact\\" is translated as \\"na to, že\\" in Czech. \\"Na\\" is a preposition that means \\"to\\" or \\"on\\", and \\"že\\" means \\"that\\", used as a conjunction in this case. - \\"their communications\\" is translated as \\"jejich komunikace\\". The possessive pronoun \\"jejich\\" means \\"their\\" and the noun \\"komunikace\\" means \\"communication\\" in Czech. - \\"were vulnerable\\" is translated as \\"byla zranitelná\\". \\"Byla\\" is the past tense form of \\"být\\" (\\"to be\\") in Czech, and \\"zranitelná\\" is the adjective that means \\"vulnerable\\". Thus, the entire sentence in Czech communicates the same meaning as the original English sentence, stating that the subjects had not realized that their communication method was vulnerable to outside threats or issues."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Options: - the ground - outside - park - ground - uzbekistan The answer is \\"ground\\" because A:","output":"Apple trees drop their fruit primarily to the ground due to several reasons that are rooted in biology, evolutionary adaptation, and environmental conditions. The answer \\"ground\\" is the most accurate among the provided options, and here is a detailed explanation as to why this occurs. 1. Biology and growth cycle of apple trees: Apple trees, like any other fruit trees, undergo a natural growth cycle that consists of three main stages - flower bud formation, fruit set, and fruit ripening. As apples mature and reach their peak ripeness, they develop their full color, size, and taste. When the fruit is ripe, it detaches easily from the tree, signifying it is ready to be eaten or used for other purposes. The most common scenario that follows is the fruit dropping to the ground due to natural detachment or external factors such as wind, rain, or animals. 2. Evolutionary adaptation: Apple trees, like many other fruit-bearing plants, have evolved to attract various animals and insects to aid in seed dispersal for propagating their species. The purpose of a fruit, such as apples, is to provide nourishment and incentive for animals to consume the seeds surrounded by the delicious and nutritious fruit flesh. When animals or birds consume the apple, they often move away from the tree to rest or find more food, discarding or defecating the seeds that were consumed in the process. This unintentional seed dispersal helps the apple tree spread its genetic material further, thus ensuring the survival of the species. Dropping apples to the ground helps facilitate this process by making the fruit more accessible to ground-dwelling animals such as rodents, deer, and other wildlife. 3. Environmental influence: During the growth and ripening period, environmental conditions such as weather, temperature, humidity, and soil nutrient levels play a significant role in determining when and how the apple falls from the tree. As the apple tree faces external factors like heavy winds or storms, the weaker or overripe apples that can no longer hold onto their branches due to weight and time are more susceptible to falling to the ground. In some cases, this premature or forced detachment from the branches may result in damaged or spoiled fruits; however, generally speaking, these environmental influences contribute to the natural process of apple trees shedding their fruit. 4. Harvesting practices: In commercial orchards, apples are often picked by hand or using specialized equipment to minimize fruit damage and maximize yield. However, some apples remain on the tree after the harvest, resulting in a natural fruit drop in the days or weeks that follow. This can occur due to human oversight, fruit abundance or hidden fruits within the tree's foliage. These apples that remain on the tree will likely drop to the ground as they continue to ripen and lose their attachment to the branches. In conclusion, apple trees drop their fruit primarily to the ground as part of their biological and evolutionary processes aimed at propagation and survival of their species. This occurrence is influenced by factors such as the tree's growth cycle, environmental conditions, and fruit harvesting practices. While it can create some inconveniences, such as the need to clear dropped apples from gardens and orchards, this natural process is essential for the apple tree's life cycle and ensures the continued existence of the species."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"The SCN projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles.

Question: suppose more electrostatic energy builds happens, how will it affect MORE acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The perturbation of more electrostatic energy in the context of the question seems to be unrelated to the process of acid rain formation. Acid rain is primarily caused by the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) during the burning of coal, which then reacts with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These compounds mix with water droplets in clouds and ultimately fall as acid rain. Electrostatic energy typically refers to the energy associated with the electric charge stored on an object or a system. While electrostatic forces can play a role in particle behavior and air quality, they do not directly influence the formation of acid rain or the amount of pollutants released from coal combustion. Moreover, clouds are already acting as effective condensation sites for acid rain formation, so it is unlikely that increasing electrostatic energy would have a significant effect on this process.

While Sara felt Betty didn't hold up her end of the conversation, Betty complained to Steve that Sara never gave her a chance to talk. The problem had to do with expectations about pacing and pausing. Conversation is a turn-taking game. When our habits are similar, there's no problem. But if our habits are different, you may start to talk before I'm finished or fail to take your turn when I'm finished. That's what was happening with Betty and Sara. It may not be coincidental that Betty, who expected relatively longer pauses between turns, is British, and Sara, who expected relatively shorter pauses, is American. Betty often felt interrupted by Sara. But Betty herself became an interrupter and found herself doing most of the talking when she met a visitor from Finland. And Sara had a hard time cutting in on some speakers from Latin America or Israel. The general phenomenon, then, is that the small conversation techniques, like pacing and pausing, lead people to draw conclusions not about conversational style but about personality and abilities. These habitual differences are often the basis for dangerous stereotyping . And these social phenomena can have very personal consequences. For example, a woman from the southwestern part of the US went to live in an eastern city to take up a job in personnel. When the Personnel Department got together for meetings, she kept searching for the right time to break in -- and never found it. Although back home she was considered outgoing and confident, in Washington she was viewed as shy and retiring. When she was evaluated at the end of the year, she was told to take a training course because of her inability to speak up. That's why slight differences in conversational style -- tiny little things like microseconds of pause -- can have a great effect on one's life.

It is surrounded by the \\"Three Towns\\": Khartoum (the capital of Sudan), Omdurman (the largest city in Sudan), and Khartoum North (also known as Bahri, a large industrial center). Despite this, Tuti is home to only one small village (founded in the late 15th century), with grassland being the main makeup of the island. In the past the only approach to Tuti Island was via several ferries that cross the river every so often, but now the Tuti Bridge, a modern suspension bridge, has been completed and can be used instead. Tuti Island is mainly agricultural and where Khartoum gets most of its supply of fruits and vegetables and therefore, you can find many farms situated all around the island, many of them still using manual methods of farming. You will find acres of green fields and lime groves. - The Tuti - Kartoum Bridge is a modern suspension bridge linking between Tuti Island and the City of Khartoum that was completed in February 2008 . In the past the only approach to Tuti Island was via ferries but thanks to the Tuti - Khartoum Bridge , easy access to the island is possible . The Tuti Bridge in Khartoum is considered to be the first suspension bridge to be constructed in Sudan and one of the first constructed in Africa . The concept design of the bridge was proposed by Alfatih Ahmed , with the final working design by A&A Company Its construction depended on new bridge technology , enabling the erection to be carried out using local expertise & equipment . The Tuti - Kartoum Bridge is the first among a series of bridges that will connect the cities of Khartoum , Omdurman and Bahri ( North Khartoum ) , and will help to alleviate traffic throughout the cities . The development has immediately commercialized the previously isolated Tuti Island . - Lake Victoria (' in Luo; ' in Luganda; \\"\\" in Kinyarwanda and some Bantu languages) is one of the African Great Lakes. The lake was named after Queen Victoria by the explorer John Hanning Speke, the first Briton to document it. Speke accomplished this in 1858, while on an expedition with Richard Francis Burton to locate the source of the Nile River. - Omdurman (standard \\"Umm Durmn\\") is the largest city in Sudan and Khartoum State, lying on the western banks of the River Nile, opposite the capital, Khartoum. Omdurman has a population of 2,395,159 (2008) and is the national centre of commerce. With Khartoum and Khartoum North or Bahri, it forms the cultural and industrial heart of the nation. - The White Nile (\\"\\") is a river of Africa, one of the two main tributaries of the Nile, the other being the Blue Nile. - Khartoum is the capital and second largest city of Sudan and Khartoum state. It is located at the confluence of the White Nile, flowing north from Lake Victoria, and the Blue Nile, flowing west from Ethiopia. The location where the two Niles meet is known as \\"\\"al-Mogran\\"\\" , meaning the confluence. The main Nile continues to flow north towards Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\", \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. - Khartoum North or Bahri (\\"al-Kharm Bar\\") is the third-largest city in the Republic of Sudan. It is located on the east bank of the Blue Nile near its confluence with the White and bridges connect it with Khartoum to its south and Omdurman to its west. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - Sudan (\\"as-Sdn\\", ), also known as North Sudan and officially the Republic of the Sudan (\\"Jumhriyyat as-Sdn\\"), is a country in Northern Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea, Eritrea, and Ethiopia to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west and Libya to the northwest. It is the third largest country in Africa. The River Nile divides the country into eastern and western halves. Before the Sudanese Civil War, South Sudan was part of Sudan but broke away in 2011. Its predominant religion is Islam. - The Blue Nile (transliterated: Abbay but pronounced \\"Abbai\\", \\"\\") is a river originating at Lake Tana in Ethiopia. With the White Nile, the river becomes one of the two major tributaries of the Nile. The upper course of the river is called the Abbay in Ethiopia, where many regard it as holy.

There you go.\\" Delivering his coup de grace, Macron told the teen, who had begun by singing a few lines from the Socialist anthem The Internationale -- a dig at the president's pro-business reforms -- to \\"do things in the right order\\". \\"The day you want to start a revolution you study first in order to obtain a degree and feed yourself, ok? And then you can lecture others,\\" he said. The exchange, which was captured on camera, was widely shared on social media. It comes as Macron -- who adopted a regal, top-down style on taking office -- himself faces criticism for his at-times blunt language. In an official video shared by his office last week he complained that the French were spending a \\"crazy amount of dough\\" on social security. Macron's critics held the video up as evidence that the man they call the \\"president of the rich\\" lacked empathy with the poor. Last year, Macron also raised the hackles of the left by calling protesting opponents of his labour reforms \\"slackers\\". ||||| French President Emmanuel Macron scolded a teenage boy on Monday after he addressed the 40-year-old leader as \\"Manu,\\" a common French nickname for Macron's first name. The incident occurred during an event north of Paris commemorating former President Charles De Gaulle's call for popular resistance against Nazi German occupation during World War II. As Macron shook hands with bystanders, the boy sang several lines from the Socialist anthem \\"The Internationale\\" before asking the president: \\"How's it going, Manu?\\" Read more: Macron needs to shed his image as president of the rich Don't mess with 'Manu' \\"No,\\" Macron snapped back. \\"You can't do that.

Article: I used to hate my mother because she worked a lot and didn't spend much time with me. Then one Friday morning I took part in a three-day self-help program for teenagers. Whether you believe it or not, that weekend changed my life. About 100 other teenagers were there. During the first two days I met a lot of great people. I was glad because I made so many friends there. On Sunday, the leader did an interesting exercise called \\"Chocolate or Toys\\". He asked a girl which she liked better, chocolate or toys. She chose chocolate. Then he asked her to choose again between chocolate and chocolate. Of course, she didn't have a choice. This exercise told us that sometimes we don't have a choice in life, and that sometimes we have to accept something, rather than complaining . A girl stood up and started talking about her mom who was a drug addict and how much she hated her mother. \\"I want a new mom,\\" she cried. \\"Unluckily, you can't have one,\\" the leader replied. \\"You have to accept the mother that you have.\\" This hit me hard. I realized that, for better or worse, my mom was my mom. I couldn't choose another mom, but I could try to make the best of the situation. Question: The writer used to hate his mother because _ . Options: A: she didn't care for him. B: she had no time to be with him C: she was a drug addict. D: she was too strict with him. The answer is:","output":"B: she had no time to be with him. The article states that the writer used to hate their mother because she worked a lot and didn't spend much time with them. This absence and lack of time together led to the writer's initial feelings of hatred towards their mother. However, after participating in the self-help program, the writer gained a better understanding of the situation and learned to accept their mother for who she is."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A boy and girl are dancing.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A boy and girl go out for ice cream.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Premise: \\"A boy and girl are dancing.\\" This statement tells us that there is a boy and a girl, and their current activity is dancing. Hypothesis: \\"A boy and girl go out for ice cream.\\" This statement suggests that the same boy and girl (or any boy and girl) go out together to get ice cream. Based on these statements, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise tells us about a specific event (dancing), but it does not provide any information about the boy and girl's activities outside of dancing, such as getting ice cream. While it's possible that the boy and girl could have gone for ice cream together before or after dancing, the premise does not provide us with enough information to make that assumption.

Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft, in which the wings form a rotor mounted on a spinning shaft, and ornithopters, in which the wings flap in similar manner to a bird. - General Dynamics Corporation is an American aerospace and defense multinational corporation. Formed by mergers and divestitures, it is the world's fifth-largest defense contractor based on 2012 revenues. General Dynamics is headquartered in West Falls Church, Fairfax County, Virginia. - In military tactics, close air support (CAS) is defined as air action by fixed or rotary-winged aircraft against hostile targets, that are in close proximity to friendly forces, and which requires detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of these forces. - In the broadest definition, a sensor is an object whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and sends the information to the computer which then tells the actuator (output devices) to provide the corresponding output. A sensor is a device that converts real world data (Analog) into data that a computer can understand using ADC (Analog to Digital converter) - A fire-control system is a number of components working together, usually a gun data computer, a director, and radar, which is designed to assist a weapon system in hitting its target. It performs the same task as a human gunner firing a weapon, but attempts to do so faster and more accurately. - The Lockheed AC-130 gunship is a heavily armed, long-endurance ground-attack variant of the C-130 Hercules transport fixed-wing aircraft. It carries a wide array of anti-ground oriented weapons that are integrated with sophisticated sensors, navigation, and fire-control systems. Unlike other military fixed-wing aircraft, the AC-130 relies on visual targeting. Because its large profile and low operating altitudes (around 7,000 ft) make it an easy target, it usually flies close air support missions at night. - Navigation is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another. The field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation. - The General Dynamics GAU - 12/U Equalizer is a five - barrel 25 mm Gatling - type rotary cannon . The GAU - 12/U is used by the United States , Italy and Spain , which mount the weapon in their fighter jets such as the AV - 8B Harrier II , airborne gunships such as the Lockheed AC - 130 , and land - based fighting vehicles . - An 'electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The reverse of this is the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and is done by an electric generator. - A multinational corporation\\"\\" or worldwide Enterprise is a corporate organization that owns or controls production of goods or services in one or more countries other than their home country. It can also be referred as an international corporation, a transnational corporation, or a stateless corporation. - A gunship is a military aircraft armed with heavy guns, primarily intended for attacking ground targets. - A rotary cannon, rotary autocannon, or Gatling-type cannon is a rapid-firing weapon that utilizes multiple barrels in a rotating cluster to provide a sustained rate of fire greater than single-barreled machine guns or automatic cannon of equivalent caliber. The loading, firing, and unloading functions are performed simultaneously in different barrels as they rotate, and the rotation also permits the barrels some time to cool. The rotating barrel cluster on most Gatling-type guns is powered by an external force such as an electric motor, although gas-operated versions have also been developed. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - A cannon (plural: \\"cannon\\" or \\"cannons\\") is any piece of artillery that uses gunpowder or other usually explosive-based propellants to launch a projectile, which may or may not be explosive. Cannon vary in calibre, range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. The word \\"cannon\\" is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as \\"tube\\", \\"cane\\", or \\"reed\\". In the modern era, the term \\"cannon\\" has fallen into decline, replaced by \\"guns\\" or \\"artillery\\" if not a more specific term such as \\"gun\\", \\"mortar\\" or \\"howitzer\\", except for in the field of aerial warfare, where it is often used as shorthand for autocannon.

Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. and the situation: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure.

In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714, Naples was given to Charles VI, the Holy Roman Emperor. He also gained control of Sicily in 1720, but Austrian rule did not last long. Both Naples and Sicily were conquered by a Spanish army during the War of the Polish Succession in 1734, and Charles, Duke of Parma, a younger son of King Philip V of Spain was installed as King of Naples and Sicily from 1735. When Charles inherited the Spanish throne from his older half-brother in 1759, he left Naples and Sicily to his younger son, Ferdinand IV. Despite the two Kingdoms being in a personal union under the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasts, they remained constitutionally separate. Being a member of the House of Bourbon, Ferdinand IV was a natural opponent of the French Revolution and Napoleon. In 1798, he briefly occupied Rome, but was expelled from it by French Revolutionary forces within the year. Soon afterwards Ferdinand fled to Sicily. In January 1799 the French armies installed a Parthenopaean Republic, but this proved short-lived, and a peasant counter-revolution inspired by the clergy allowed Ferdinand to return to his capital. However, in 1801 Ferdinand was compelled to make important concessions to the French by the Treaty of Florence, which reinforced France's position as the dominant power in mainland Italy.

Police say the adolescent and four other boys, ranging in age from 10 to 15, set the Yeshiva bus ablaze on Brooklyn Ave. near Lefferts Ave. in Crown Heights shortly before 6 p.m. Sunday, authorities said. Security video, obtained by the website CrownHeights.Info, shows the five children running into the bus with pieces of cardboard. Flames appear towards the front of the bus within seconds as the kids pile out. Within minutes, thick black smoke engulfs the yellow bus, which was parked outside Beth Rivkah, a private girls school, the video shows. Neighborhood residents said they were saddened to hear that a hate crime may have been perpetrated by such young boys. \\"It's terrible,\\" said Chani Klein, a parent at the school. \\"I'd like to see these kids get some help.\\" \\"I don't know why they would do that. Maybe they were just bored, or maybe it really was about hate. Either way they blew up a bus. They need help,\\" she said. The 11-year-old was charged with criminal mischief as a hate crime and arson as a hate crime. Cops are searching for the other four boys. Chaim Rosenstein, 26, who lives in the area, said the bias allegation has residents concerned. \\"It's very sad that there was just enough mischief and possibly bias and hate pent up up inside an 11-year-old,” he said. \\"People are very shocked,\\" Rosenstein added. \\"They're concerned.” Scorched prayer books a cell phone and a camera laid amongst the broken glass, seat cushion stuffing and charred detritus outside the bus. The bus, which is not clearly marked for Yeshiva transportation, is owned an operated by BSD Trans Corp. Leon Yavich, who owns the company, said he was not ready to suggest the children were motivated by hate. “I am not going to jump the gun and accuse these kids of a hate crime,” said Yavich, 54, who is Hasidic. “I will not accuse them of a hate crime simply for the fact that I have not spoken to them,” he said, adding, “my bus doesn’t have any Jewish markings. It doesn’t belong to the Yeshiva,” he said. No one was injured in the fire. Police sources said another Jewish school bus was targeted less than a mile away from the fire scene on Thursday. The bus driver told police he was driving down Eastern parkway when someone hurled a brick at it, shattering the driver side mirror around 2:25 p.m. near Albany Ave., the sources said. Then on Friday, a Jewish man reported to cops that a 13-year-old boy began shooting rubber bands at him at about the same time and location from the day earlier. When the man confronted the teen, the boy punched him in the face, according to the sources. Despite the punches, the man managed to grab the teen and hold on until police officers arrived, cop sources said. As of Sunday, there had been 110 hate-crimes across the city, an uptick from 91 such crimes when compared to the same time period in 2015.

Hosted by Chris Evans, the show gained a cult following thanks to its mix of celebrity interviews, live music, and comedy skits. In 2015, the show was revived for a special anniversary episode, followed by a short new series in the same year. Step 2: Reasons for the decision to not commission more episodes While Channel 4 has not provided specific reasons for its decision to not commission more episodes of \\"TFI Friday,\\" it's possible that a few factors may have contributed. One potential reason could be the increasing demand for on-demand streaming content, as viewers shift away from traditional TV formats. Additionally, the show might not be considered a good fit for Channel 4's current programming lineup. Step 3: Reactions from fans, celebrities, and host Chris Evans The announcement that \\"TFI Friday\\" will not be returning has undoubtedly left fans of the show disappointed. It is unclear how Chris Evans and other celebrity guests who have appeared on the show feel about the decision. However, it is worth noting that Evans currently remains a prominent media figure, hosting the popular \\"Virgin Radio Breakfast Show\\" and enjoying a successful radio career. Step 4: Alternatives for fans of the show Although the current decision means that fans won't see any new episodes of \\"TFI Friday,\\" they can find solace in the fact that reruns of the show are still available on Channel 4's online platform and other streaming services.

Let's reason through each sentence step by step: Sentence A: \\"The repairman fills the air into the tire.\\" This sentence is in line with common sense because tires are designed to be filled with air to function correctly. Air provides the cushioning and support needed for a smooth and safe ride. Filling tires with the appropriate amount of air is a routine maintenance task. Sentence B: \\"The repairman fills the water into the tire.\\" This sentence is against common sense because filling a tire with water is not a normal practice. Using water instead of air in a tire may cause internal damage and compromise tire strength, leading to poor performance or safety hazards. Tires are engineered to hold air, and deviating from this standard may lead to unpredictable consequences.

A backpacker is generally someone who travels or hikes with a backpack, often for an extended period. A hiker is someone who walks or treks, often in the outdoors for fun or exercise. While these terms can be used interchangeably in some contexts, they are not identical concepts. Second, let's consider the actions: points vs. points to his next conquest. Both the premise and the hypothesis mention the subject pointing towards something. However, the hypothesis adds an element of intention by stating that the mountain is \\"his next conquest.\\" Step 3: Determine entailment To test for entailment, we need to evaluate whether the information in the premise guarantees that the information in the hypothesis is true. The premise states that the backpacker is pointing to the snowcapped mountains while standing on a rocky plain. However, it does not provide any information about the intention behind the action. As a result, we cannot say for sure that the person is pointing to the mountain as their \\"next conquest.\\" Conclusion: We cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the premise lacks sufficient information regarding the intention behind the action of pointing at the mountain."},{"instruction":"Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person whose sister had some involvement in the 1999 recording sessions? is inside the article: Deal began recording again in 1999, first in Austin, Texas, and then at Electrical Audio studio in Chicago with Steve Albini, with whom she had previously worked on Pod, Pacer, and the Pixies' album Surfer Rosa.

Q: Abstract: The class B glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) G protein-coupled receptor is a major target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Endogenous and mimetic GLP-1 peptides exhibit biased agonism—a difference in functional selectivity—that may provide improved therapeutic outcomes. Here we describe the structure of the human GLP-1 receptor in complex with the G protein-biased peptide exendin-P5 and a Gαs heterotrimer, determined at a global resolution of 3.3 Å. At the extracellular surface, the organization of extracellular loop 3 and proximal transmembrane segments differs between our exendin-P5-bound structure and previous GLP-1-bound GLP-1 receptor structure. At the intracellular face, there was a six-degree difference in the angle of the Gαs–α5 helix engagement between structures, which was propagated across the G protein heterotrimer. In addition, the structures differed in the rate and extent of conformational reorganization of the Gαs protein. Our structure provides insights into the molecular basis of biased agonism..

He was the son of King Manuel I and Maria of Aragon, the third daughter of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. John succeeded his father in 1521, at the age of nineteen. During his rule, Portuguese possessions were extended in Asia and in the New World through the Portuguese colonization of Brazil. John III's policy of reinforcing Portugal's bases in India secured Portugal's monopoly over the spice trade of cloves and nutmeg from the Maluku Islands, as a result of which John III has been called the \\"Grocer King\\". On the eve of his death in 1557, the Portuguese empire had a global dimension and spanned almost 1 billion acres . During his reign, the Portuguese became the first Europeans to make contact with both China, under the Ming Dynasty, and Japan, during the Muromachi period. He abandoned Muslim territories in North Africa in favor of trade with India and investment in Brazil. In Europe, he improved relations with the Baltic region and the Rhineland, hoping that this would bolster Portuguese trade. Based on the above article, answer a question.

If somebody is smoking weed around me, is it possible to get high off of second hand smoke? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choose your answer from: A). no. B). yes.","output":"To answer the questions, I will gather information related to secondhand smoke and its effects, especially in the context of marijuana. Step 1: Research about secondhand smoke from marijuana I found that secondhand smoke is the smoke that is exhaled by the person smoking and the smoke that comes from the burning end of the cigarette or marijuana joint. There have been few studies on the effects of marijuana secondhand smoke; however, these studies suggest that it is possible, although unlikely, for someone to experience a \\"contact high\\" from being in a closed, poorly ventilated space with heavy marijuana smoke. Step 2: Analyze the probability of getting high from secondhand smoke outside Since the studies on marijuana secondhand smoke consider closed and poorly ventilated spaces, it's important to take into account that the questions relate to outside smoke. Being outdoors with proper ventilation and fresh air makes it even less likely for a person to experience a contact high from secondhand marijuana smoke. Step 3: Answer the questions Based on the information gathered, yes, it is possible but very unlikely for someone to get high off of secondhand marijuana smoke outside. Now, addressing the multi-choice problem: Both questions are related to the possibility of experiencing a contact high from secondhand marijuana smoke. They are inquiring about the same information but presented in slightly different ways.

Choices: - creating flowers - stunning flowers - Upward Flowers - perfect flowers A: Answer:","output":"A: The kind of flowers that carry both male and female floral organs are called perfect flowers. Perfect flowers contain both the male reproductive structures, called stamens, and the female reproductive structures, called carpels. These flowers are also known as bisexual flowers or hermaphroditic flowers, since they possess both gender reproductive parts. The presence of both male and female organs in perfect flowers is an evolutionary adaptation to facilitate reproduction. This structure allows the flower to self-pollinate if cross-pollination is not possible. However, cross-pollination is still the preferred method of fertilization in most plants, as it increases genetic diversity and provides resilience against environmental stressors and pests. Creating flowers, stunning flowers, and upward flowers are not correct choices as they do not accurately describe the classification of flowers based on the presence of sexual organs. The term \\"perfect flowers\\" is used specifically to describe flowers containing both male and female reproductive structures. In contrast to perfect flowers, there are imperfect flowers that only have either male or female reproductive structures. These flowers are called unisexual flowers and are further classified into two types: staminate flowers, which only have male organs (stamens), and pistillate flowers, which only have female organs (carpels). Examples of plants that possess imperfect flowers include cucumbers, melons, and squash. In conclusion, perfect flowers are the type of flowers that carry both male and female floral organs, providing a reproductive advantage by enabling self-pollination when cross-pollination is not possible. This characteristic has evolved as a way to increase the chances of reproduction and ultimately the survival of plant species."},{"instruction":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Cool\\" Answer:","output":"I would rate this review a 2.

She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Determine the number of frisbees Bella has. Since Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees and she has 60 marbles: (Number of marbles) = 2 * (Number of frisbees) 60 = 2 * (Number of frisbees) Dividing by 2 gives: Number of frisbees = 60 / 2 = 30 Step 2: Determine the number of deck cards Bella has. Bella has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. Number of deck cards = (Number of frisbees) - 20 Number of deck cards = 30 - 20 = 10 Step 3: Calculate the amount of new items she will buy.

This is just one of many equally suspicious fires in the last few years, where the insurance claims following the fires has been filed by the same agent, Frederick P. Fender. There is suspicion that Fender is somehow involved in the disappearance of all the destroyed stores' goods as well. Joe begins with Peyson, the store owner, and visits his apartment that was also raged by fire not long ago. He meets the baby-sitter, Jane, a pretty young teacher, and they get along so well that Joe drives her home and ask her out on a date the next evening.

Question: suppose there are more animals in the sea happens, how will it affect LESS oil. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"When considering the scenario where there are more animals living in the sea, we must examine each step of the process outlined and determine how this increase in sea life will influence the formation of crude oil. 1) Living organisms in the sea die In this case, if there are more animals in the sea, it would naturally lead to an increased amount of dead organic matter as these organisms die. This could potentially have a significant impact on the quantity of future crude oil deposits, as a higher volume of organic material is available for conversion into hydrocarbons. 2) The matter forms on the sea floor As the increased amount of dead organic material accumulates on the sea floor, it could potentially lead to thicker layers of sediment. The overall rate at which this matter is deposited could be influenced by factors such as ocean currents, the availability of nutrients, and sea-floor topography. In any case, the main point here is that more organic matter would be available for the subsequent formation of crude oil. 3) Layers of sediment form above the matter compressing it As layers of sediment continue to accumulate and exert pressure on the organic material below, the increased quantity of dead organisms could lead to more significant compression and heating relative to the same area with fewer marine organisms. However, this effect may be somewhat mitigated if the increased volume of organic matter results in more even distribution across the seafloor, reducing the overall concentration in any given location. 4) After many years the matter is compressed and heated Given enough time under the right conditions of pressure and temperature, the organic material undergoes a series of chemical reactions, eventually forming crude oil. In this scenario, with more dead organisms, the available organic material for conversion into hydrocarbons would be greater. Hence, there is the potential for a more significant formation of crude oil deposits over time. 5) The result is that crude oil forms In summary, if we were to hypothetically assume there are more animals in the sea, it could potentially lead to more crude oil formation. However, it is important to note that the actual outcome depends on a myriad of factors and is subject to numerous variables, such as the types of organisms, environmental conditions, and geologic processes. One must also consider the possibility that increased sea life could disrupt existing ecosystems, which might limit or counteract these effects. Therefore, while an increase in sea life may intuitively seem to result in more oil formation, the net effect could be less or have no significant impact, depending on the specific circumstances and factors involved in the process."},{"instruction":"If \\"A young boy in a green shirt is holding a red and blue soccer ball.\\", does this mean that \\"A boy holding a soccer ball.\\"?

A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in.

It was hosted by comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. Laugh-In originally aired as a one-time special on September 9, 1967, and was such a success that it was brought back as a series, replacing The Man from U.N.C.L.E. on Mondays at 8 pm (ET). The title of the show was a play on the \\"love-ins\\" or \\"be-ins\\" of the 1960s hippie culture, terms that were, in turn, derived from \\"sit-ins\\", common in protests associated with civil rights and antiwar demonstrations of the time. The first season featured some of the first music videos seen on network TV, with cast members appearing in films set to the music of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the Bee Gees, the Temptations, the Strawberry Alarm Clock, and the First Edition. During the September 16, 1968, episode, Richard Nixon, running for president, appeared for a few seconds with a disbelieving vocal inflection, asking \\"Sock it to me?\\" Nixon was not doused or assaulted. An invitation was extended to Nixon's opponent, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, but he declined.

On multiple occasions, producer George Schlatter attempted to get William F. Buckley Jr. to appear on the show, only to be refused each time until he suddenly agreed to an appearance. In the episode that aired December 28, 1970, Buckley appeared in an unusual sit-down segment (portions of which were scattered throughout the episode) flanked by Rowan and Martin and fielding questions from the cast (which included Lily Tomlin doing her Fast Talker shtick) and giving humorous answers to each. Near the end, when Rowan asked Buckley why he finally agreed to appear on the show, Buckley explained that Schlatter had written him \\"an irresistable letter\\" in which he promised to fly Buckley out to California \\"in an airplane with two right wings\\". At the end, Rowan thanked him for appearing, noting that \\"you can't be that smart without having a sense of humor, and you have a delightful one\\".

It is a \\"high-propulsion\\" cloud of mucus and saliva that spreads across entire rooms, even reaching ceilings and the ventilation ducts found there, in a matter of minutes. MIT researchers first gained attention last year with these findings, reports CBS Boston, and they're about to release their latest findings in the journal Experiments in Fluids. This time they used two cameras to capture high-speed videos of two healthy people sneezing roughly 50 times over the course of several days. They were looking to gain an understanding of the first stage of the sneeze, \\"the part that is still a big unknown. ... I wanted to ... go upstream and look at the mouth, at what is coming out,\\" says lead researcher Lydia Bourouiba. What Bourouiba and her team found was that the droplets don't exit the mouth \\"already formed and neatly distributed in size,\\" as had long been assumed, she says in a press release.

Jim: Oh, it was ok, I thought my muscles would hurt more after it Josie: Hah, well, good for you! What were they talking about?","output":"Josie and Jim were discussing Jim's first experience at the gym. Jim had presumably recently begun to go to the gym in order to get more exercise or improve his fitness level. A gym is a place where people go to engage in physical activities involving exercise equipment, cardiovascular machines, resistance training, fitness classes, and weightlifting, among other activities. Based on their conversation, it can be inferred that Jim has just completed his first workout session or day at the gym. He predicted that, as a result of engaging in strenuous exercise after potentially a long period of not doing so, his muscles would be sore or hurting afterwards. This is a common experience for many people when they start a new exercise regimen, especially if their bodies are not accustomed to those particular movements or that level of physical activity. The exertion and strain on the muscles can result in a condition known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS), characterized by inflammation, aching, and muscle stiffness, usually developing about one to two days after the workout. However, to Jim’s surprise, his muscles did not hurt as much as he had anticipated. It could be an indication that he didn't overexert himself, he warmed up correctly, or his body is adjusting well to the new physical activity. He might have also engaged in post-workout routines like stretching, cooling down, or proper hydration that alleviated potential muscle pain. Josie on the other hand showed support towards Jim's new venture and expressed happiness that he was not in discomfort as he had thought he would be. The phrase \\"good for you\\" is often used to express approval or to show that one is pleased about someone else's success or good fortune, which in this case was Jim's less painful than expected initiation to the gym.

But the more those in blue shirts chased the ball, the further away it went. England, bursting with confidence and belief, were tormenting their hosts, sending them dizzy with possession as they dumped them out of Euro 2015. England qualified for the 2015 European Under 21 Championship with a 4-2 aggregate win over Croatia in their play-off. England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate celebrates after guiding his team to their 10th straight victory. Croatia U21: Livakovic, Milos, Datkovic, Mitrovic, Milic, Pasalic (Caktas 67), Halilovic (Misic 79), Bradaric, Pjaca, Livaja, Rebic (Bagaric 33). Subs not used: Delac, Galovic, Perica, Brucic.

Subs not used: Bond, Garbutt, Pritchard, Lascelles, Baker, Woodrow. Goals: Moore 9, Hughes 73. Booked: Hughes. Referee: Clement Turpin (France). And to think they say England never win with style. With the stakes high and the pressure intense, England secured a place at next summer’s Under 21 European Championship in a very un-English way. There was no scrapping, no backs against the wall, no bitten fingernails, just the smooth execution of meticulous planning and preparation. Thanks to goals from Leicester’s Liam Moore and Derby midfielder Will Hughes, giving them a 2-1 win on the night — 4-2 on aggregate — Gareth Southgate’s squad will head to the Czech Republic next summer as one of the favourites to lift the trophy. As England were victorious in Vinkovci, playing football as it should be, Spain — winners of this competition in 2011 and 2013 — were falling by the wayside, as were Holland. Do not underestimate what an achievement it is to be in the finals of this tournament. Southgate has not put a foot wrong in the last 13 months and this game saw everything he has been working towards fall into place. England, even without many key players, dismantled Croatia and in the process laid down a blueprint for the future. Vinkovci, famed for being the town where the train broke down on Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express, may have been a surprise destination for this game, but the hosts were welcoming and there was no sinister edge, as had been the case in Krusevac when England faced Serbia two years ago. Croatia almost had the perfect start, too. With just two minutes gone, they broke swiftly down England’s left and Marko Pjaca crossed for Mario Pasalic, who seemed certain to score with a right-foot half-volley, until Jack Butland intervened. England took the lead through Liam Moore (second left) in the first half in Vinkovci and never looked back. Moore slotted into the top corner from a set-piece in the ninth minute to extend England's aggregate advantage. Butland cannot get a game for Stoke but he is a cornerstone of this England team and the captain showed his worth with a magnificent instinctive save to thwart Pasalic. Given the delicate balance of this contest, it was a moment of great significance. Croatia had been bolstered by the presence of Barcelona B midfielder Alen Halilovic, one of the finest young talents in Europe. He had warmed up for this by playing 30 minutes for Croatia’s senior side on Monday night against Azerbaijan. Moore runs away to celebrate his goal having given England the lead in Vinkovci in the second leg of their play-off. Ante Rebic reacts in despair as England celebrate taking the lead in the second leg in Vinkovci. England, however, swiftly got back on an even keel and began passing the ball in the manner Southgate desires. They had willing runners, particularly in the shape of the eye-catching Nathan Redmond, and a belief they could cause Croatia problems. So it proved. In the eighth minute, a corner that had been won by the tenacity of Hughes was swung in by Tom Carroll and met flush on the volley by Moore, who jubilantly wheeled away after his shot had hit the roof of Croatia’s net. Moore had silenced the home supporters and given his team the confidence to look for the second goal that would have killed the tie. Norwich winger Nathan Redmond (right) battles for the ball with Croatia's Marko Pjaca (left) Croatia players celebrate after Marko Livaja brought them level seven minutes before half-time in Vinkovci. Derby's Will Hughes evades Croatia's Ante Rebic (left) as England U21 manager Southgate watches on in Vinkovci. England's two goalscorers Moore (left) and Hughes (centre) celebrate helping England qualify for the European U21 Championship. Croatian supporters get behind their team in the second leg of their play-off against England. It should have arrived in the 36th minute when Hughes surged into the area, but seemed reluctant to shoot. The ball fell to Redmond but his effort was straight at keeper Dominik Livakovic. In the next attack, a long ball was hit up field by Filip Bradaric and, as England’s defence dithered, Marko Livaja nipped in to score. Now Halilovic began to impress. One ball he played with outside of his left foot to launch an attack, having not broken his stride, was majestic. But half-time gave England the chance to regroup and they began the second period with a renewed sense of calm. This was England’s biggest test, but they were passing it with style. Saido Berahino might have won it in the 59th minute but his shot smashed against the post. No matter. Not long after, the outstanding Hughes waltzed forward and finished with aplomb. Cue celebrations. It was his 13th game and 10th consecutive win. And, for Southgate, it was just about perfect.","output":"In 2014, England's Under 21 team played against Croatia's Under 21 team in a soccer match.

M. E. McTaggart, seeks to solve the problem of the flow of time within the realm of analytic philosophy. Time, as a concept, has puzzled philosophers for centuries, with various theories and explanations arising concerning its nature, our perception of it, and how it influences the world we live in. McTaggart's paper presents two distinct temporal series that attempt to account for our intuitions and understanding of time, addressing the issues surrounding temporal becoming and the relations between past, present, and future events. The first temporal series, known as the A-series, is designed to address our intuitive sense of temporal becoming, which can be described as the ever-changing nature of time and the idea of a constantly moving \\"Now.\\" The A-series orders events based on their position in the past, present, or future, both in their simplest form (i.e., as independently categorized) and in comparison to each other. This series attempts to capture our day-to-day experiences and observations of time, as we often perceive and discuss events in terms of their chronological status relative to our current position in time. By exploring the A-series, the paper aims to investigate how our understanding of time as a constantly shifting sequence of past, present, and future events can be better comprehended and explained within the framework of analytic philosophy. The second temporal series, termed the B-series, takes a different approach to conceptualizing time by eliminating all references to the present moment, as well as the related temporal modalities of past and future. Instead, the B-series orders events solely using the temporal relations \\"earlier than\\" and \\"later than.\\" By focusing on these relations, the B-series seeks to present a more objective and detached perspective on time, one that does not rely on our personal experiences or the concept of a moving \\"Now.\\" This series allows for a more structured analysis of time, free from the subjective influence of our perceptions and feelings regarding the passage of time. In summary, the paper written by J. M. E. McTaggart aims to address the complex and often perplexing problem of the flow of time in analytic philosophy by proposing two distinct temporal series – the A-series and the B-series. These series offer differing perspectives on time and its relations, with the former focusing on our intuitive sense of temporal becoming and the latter providing a more detached and objective view through the exclusive use of temporal relations. By exploring and analyzing these two temporal series, the paper seeks to contribute to our understanding of the nature of time, reconcile the differences in these perspectives, and offer potential explanations for our experiences of time's flow."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What key details about naga munchetty can be extracted from the following bio?

Meanwhile, the term “wild card” has a political resonance as never before with the candidacy of Donald Trump. As Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) recently told the Huffington Post when asked to justify his support, “Trump is a wild card, and I’ll take a wild card over unworthy anytime.” “Wild card” has become a versatile term in sports and politics, with roots, naturally enough, in the game of poker. In the 1870s, decks of cards were manufactured with extra “jokers,” originally used as trump cards in the game of euchre. But poker players found their own use for joker cards, coming up with variants on the game where the joker could assume any value the player wishes. Players began experimenting with liberating other cards in the deck, particularly “deuces,” or twos, typically the least valuable cards in the game. This was called “deuces wild,” a phrase that shows up as early as 1896 in the New Harvard Song Book. The university’s Glee Club sang this about one of their members: “ Ben Stephenson looks just the same / He’s always ready for a game / Of deuces wild with aces up the sleeve— / You wouldn’t think he could deceive!” While “wild” in “deuces wild” functions as an adverb, the word soon got used as an adjective modifying “card.” In a 1916 story in the Chicago Tribune , Ring Lardner tells of a long night of poker that starts with “nothing wild,” with one player scoffing, “That’s the idear. Wild cards are a joke.” (As the night wears on, the group ends up playing with “fives, sixes, nines and jacks wild.”) “Wild card” made the move into football in 1959, when the NCAA agreed on a rule that allowed college teams to designate a “wild card” player who could come into a game at any time as a substitute. In 1970, football was also the first sport to introduce a “wild card” team into its playoff system, with the best team not to win a division joining the three division champs. Baseball followed suit when it expanded to three divisions in 1994, then added a second wild-card team per league in 2012. The phrase made its mark in politics as well, used to describe an unpredictable factor. In a Newsday column in 1964 about that year’s presidential race, Myron S. Waldman wrote, “In the great American game of politics, the surprise issue is the wild card.” “Wild card” also came to be applied to public figures who upend conventional expectations. During the Iran-Contra congressional hearings in 1987, the Chicago Tribune reported that committee members were having second thoughts about letting Col. Oliver North testify, “fearing he is a wild card that could upset their carefully prepared script.” Mr. Trump earned the label at the beginning of his improbable campaign last year, when a Wall Street Journal headline announced, “In Donald Trump Candidacy, GOP Strategists See a Wild Card.” Since then, the Trump card has remained wild.","output":"As the baseball season draws to a close and wild card teams prepare for the playoffs, the term \\"wild card\\" has gained political significance with the candidacy of Donald Trump, who is often described as unpredictable.

We got onto the freeway and drove away. But the chatting had stopped. Hayley was quiet all the way there. We spent a few hours at Grandma's then packed up to head home. As we drove back, Hayley rustled around in her seat, trying to reach something on the floor of the car. I asked her to sit still, worried her seatbelt would slip from the booster seat. She mumbled something and sat back. \\"Mom, will the homeless man still be outside tonight?\\" I told her I was not sure, maybe. It was a freezing night, and I started to think of the man now too, and how cold he must be. All of a sudden, as we got onto the freeway exit, Haley shrieked : \\"There he is!

Despite these immense hardships, these early colonists persisted, eventually laying the foundation for the United States as we know it today. Recently, researchers have discovered chilling evidence that suggests these settlers engaged in the most desperate of acts to stave off starvation during a particularly cruel winter - cannibalism. This discovery sheds new light on the lengths to which humanity may go to survive in the most abysmal of circumstances. The Harsh Winter of 1609-10: In 1607, English settlers established a colony at Jamestown, Virginia, unwittingly setting the stage for a series of events that would culminate in the gruesome winter of 1609-10. This perilous period, commonly known as the \\"Starving Time,\\" saw the colonists driven to extreme measures to stay alive. The winter of 1609-10 was a perfect storm of misfortune for the Jamestown settlers. A severe drought, combined with a strained relationship with the native Powhatan tribe, led to a deepening food crisis. To further complicate matters, the colonists' attempts to preserve their rapidly shrinking food stores were largely unsuccessful, resulting in spoilage and a precarious supply chain. New Evidence of Cannibalism: Recent archaeological findings in the Jamestown area have provided tangible evidence of the settlers' descent into cannibalism. A team of researchers led by the Smithsonian Institution uncovered human remains that bore telltale signs of cannibalistic activity. The remains, belonging to a 14-year-old girl dubbed \\"Jane\\" by the research team, displayed clear markings of butchery. The discovery of these remains, which showed evidence of defleshing and cleaving of bones, suggests that the settlers resorted to consuming human flesh to prolong their survival. Acknowledging the Disturbing Past: Prior to these discoveries, cannibalism amongst Jamestown settlers had been hinted at in historical records, but conclusive evidence remained elusive. With this newfound substantiation, historians must confront the uncomfortable truth of the struggles that shaped the early colonization of North America. This latest archaeological revelation forces us to acknowledge the parallel between the Jamestown settlers' extreme measures and the historically maligned practices of the indigenous peoples they displaced. It offers a powerful reminder of the struggles so often glossed over in the story of America's founding. The Larger Implications: The Jamestown settlers' ordeal is far from an isolated episode of cannibalism driven by desperation. Instances of survival cannibalism have been documented throughout history, from the desperate survivors of the ill-fated Donner Party in 1846-47 to the Uruguayan rugby team that crashed in the Andes in 1972. This macabre find in Jamestown serves as a stark reminder of the human capacity to adapt - and, in some cases, transgress moral boundaries - in the face of overwhelming adversity. As climate change, political instability, and other global challenges cast an increasingly long shadow over society, the lessons learned from these early settlers are more relevant than ever. Conclusion: The unearthing of human remains from the winter of 1609-10 at Jamestown has shed new light on the horrifying lengths to which humanity may resort to ensure survival. As we grapple with a future that promises increasing challenges, these revelations underscore the essential need to build resilience and better understand the complexity of the human spirit."},{"instruction":"What was the name of the memoir written by the co-founder of the black nationalism and social change organizaion US?

A clothing store is a specific type of retail store that specializes in selling garments, shoes, and accessories. These stores typically offer a wide range of choices, from casual wear to formal attire, and often arrange their merchandise by categories such as gender, age, style, or size. Shopping at a clothing store can offer a more focused experience, as all available products are related to fashion and attire. On the other hand, a mall (also known as a shopping mall or shopping center) is a large building or complex that houses multiple individual retail stores, including clothing stores, under one roof. Malls often have a diverse array of stores, selling not only clothes but also other products such as electronics, toys, cosmetics, and more.

The other options - house, toy store, and bedroom - are not ideal places to purchase clothes. A house or bedroom might be where one stores their personal wardrobe, but they are not generally places where new clothing is available for purchase, unless the house is hosting a garage sale or a similar event.

The other options do not make as much sense in this context: lighting a stick on top of the tube implies that she's igniting something which is not mentioned, stopping and tubing until the end doesn't clarify her initial purpose and seems vague, and diving into water with the tube is unrelated to her sitting on the floor next to the tubing."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved. - Air Vice Marshal Sir Charles Alexander Holcombe Longcroft KCB , CMG , DSO , AFC ( 13 May 1883 -- 20 February 1958 ) was a pilot and squadron commander in the Royal Flying Corps who went on to become a senior commander in the Royal Air Force . - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War, until it merged with the Royal Naval Air Service on 1 April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force. During the early part of the war, the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance. This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements, the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transportation facilities.

After a passionate embrace, John explains to the youthful milliner that he had abandoned their romance because Vergie's father had told him that she was pregnant by laborer Hugo McQueen and would be forced to marry. Vergie then tells John that, to keep her from marrying John, Laura's father had paid her father 10,000 to tell him that devastating lie. Still deeply in love, John and Vergie continue to see each other, but when John starts to campaign for Congress, Preston, a political boss, informs Vergie that, if John is to receive his vital support, she must forego their affair. Although Vergie agrees to Preston's terms, John refuses to end the relationship and spends a long evening with her before the election.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) As an old man, Adso, son of the Baron of Melk recounts how, as a young novice in 1327, he joined his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville on a journey to a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with Papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey also boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The suspicious recent death of the monk Adelmo of Otranto âa young but famous manuscript illuminatorâ has stirred fears among the abbey's inhabitants. The Abbot seeks help from William, known for his deductive powers. Adelmo's death cannot be a suicide because his body was found below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. William is reluctant, but also drawn by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also fears the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William soon concludes that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide; he fell from a different tower. Nevertheless, Venantius, a Greek translator âand the last to speak with Adelmoâ is found dead in a vat filled with the blood of slaughtered pigs. The translator's corpse bears a black stain on a finger and his tongue. At a loss, William insists that Adelmo killed himself and that the translator's death can be reasonably explained. The other monks suspect a supernatural cause, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan monk Ubertino of Casale warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the Book of Revelation. In the scriptorium, William inspects Adelmo's desk, but is blocked by Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian. Brother Malachia, Head Librarian, denies William access to the rest of the building. William encounters Salvatore, a demented hunchback, and...

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as Stefan Lochner and the painter known as the Master of the Life of the Virgin, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century Cologne, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts. New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich were the most important artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or copperplate engraving) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters' guild, and the two became friends.By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision. Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. Hieronymus Bosch, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters. He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych.

At cheek-in, you might consider asking for a room near the elevator so you won't need to walk down long, potentially ill-lit hallways to reach your room. When filling out guest registration forms, consider using your first initial instead of your name, and skip the\\" Mrs/Miss/Mr\\" check box. Additionally, make sure the clerk writes down your room number instead of saying it out loud. This will prevent anyone nearby from knowing where to find you later. Arrive during the day Arrive in new cities during the day. Areas around bus and train stations can be scary and/ojr deserted, and small towns tend to shut down early. Veteran solo traveler Mara Rothman of San Francisco notes that plenty of beautiful towns can appear mysterious at night, and locals who are genuinely trying to help you can appear unnecessarily threatening. Arriving during the day means you'll be able to find a place to stay and get to know where you are before dark. Keep your documents safe If you choose to wear a money belt, use it for storage and not as a purse. Constantly reaching under your shirt for money draws attention to it, and tends to defeat the purpose. Instead,keep your passport, extra stores of money, and other important documents well hidden, and use a bag or purse for carrying daily spending money. Dress appropriately To avoid attracting unwanted attention, dress as conservatively as the women you see around you.

He performs nightly at the exclusive Club Luna, captivating audiences with his smooth voice and charming demeanor. When he's not on stage, Nick indulges in his favorite pastime: playing the tables and winning large sums of money from his high-roller friends. One evening, Nick's world is turned upside down when he meets a nearly identical, and somewhat unrefined, doppelganger named Joe Santoro (played by Dean Martin, as well). Nick befriends his newfound twin, convinced that it could lead to fun and double the trouble in Sin City. However, what Nick doesn't know is that Joe is a small-time conman with a troubled past, and the resemblance between them was more than just a coincidence. Desperate to make a fast buck and escape an increasingly dangerous mobster to whom he owes a considerable sum of money, Joe secretly assumes Nick's identity. In his newfound role as a wealthy and popular entertainer, Joe hatches an ambitious plan to rob the casino's vault during one of Nick's performances. To complicate matters, Nick accidentally stumbles upon the plot and finds himself not only struggling to save his career but also to outwit Joe and save his true identity. Along the way, both men become romantically involved with the same woman, the beautiful and mysterious Maria Belmonte (played by Audrey Hepburn). Unaware of their dual identities, Maria becomes a vital yet unwitting part of their conflicting schemes. In a thrilling climax at the Club Luna, set against the backdrop of a high-stakes blackjack game, the two impersonators engage in a battle of wits as they both try to pull off the heist and win Maria's heart, all while entertaining the Vegas elite with style and grace. Ultimately, Joe reveals his true identity to the surprise of the audience and foils his own plan with Nick, moments before the heist would have closed. While the mob enforcers catch wind of the botched heist and plan to eliminate Joe for his failure, Nick saves Joe out of compassion by bribing the mobsters to leave the doppelganger alone. In exchange, Joe promises to turn a new leaf and disappears from Vegas, never to trouble Nick again. Nick bids farewell to Joe and refocuses his attentions on Maria, leaving behind his playboy lifestyle. As Nick returns to the stage, he dedicates his next performance to Maria, who sits at the front table, beaming at her new love.

Arturo and his family then discuss the possibility of going to the United States where \\"all the people, even the poor, own their own cars\\". Because of his attempts to form a labor union among the workers, Arturo and the other organizers are attacked and murdered by government troops when a co-worker is bribed to betray them...

Her brother, Riley, is awake for 3/4 of the day and spends 1/3 of his day outside and the rest inside. How much time, on average, do they spend inside? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","output":"To find out how much time Jonsey and Riley spend inside on average, we need to follow these steps: 1. Determine the fraction of time each sibling spends awake and outside. 2. Calculate the fraction of time each sibling spends awake and inside. 3. Compute the average time spent inside by both siblings. Let's start with Jonsey: 1. Jonsey is awake for 2/3 of the day and spends 1/2 of her time awake playing outside. The fraction of the day she spends outside is: (2/3) x (1/2) = 2/6 or 1/3 2. Since Jonsey spends 2/3 of her day awake, and 1/3 of the day outside, she spends the remaining time inside. The fraction of the day she spends inside is: (2/3) - (1/3) = 1/3 Now let's calculate for Riley: 1. Riley is awake for 3/4 of the day and spends 1/3 of his time awake outside. The fraction of the day he spends outside is: (3/4) x (1/3) = 3/12 or 1/4 2. Since Riley spends 3/4 of his day awake, and 1/4 outside, he spends the remaining time inside. The fraction of the day Riley spends inside is: (3/4) - (1/4) = 2/4 or 1/2 Finally, we will compute the average time spent inside by both Jonsey and Riley: 1. To compute the average, we first add the fractions of time Jonsey and Riley spend inside: (1/3) + (1/2) = 1/3 + 2/6 = 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6 2. After calculating the total time both spend inside, we will divide by 2 to find the average: (5/6) ÷ 2 = 5/12 So, on average, Jonsey and Riley spend 5/12 of their time inside."},{"instruction":"Definition: Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

Yes. I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what ancient cultures had marketplaces Suggested answer: Most Roman towns and cities had a forum , temples and the same type of buildings, on a smaller scale, as found in Rome. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, you should validate the given answer as it provides relevant and accurate information about the presence of marketplaces in ancient Roman towns and cities. Marketplaces have been a central aspect of many ancient cultures, enabling people to exchange goods, services, and ideas. Across these societies, marketplaces, also known as forums, bazaars, or agora, have played essential roles in economic, social, and political spheres. In the context of the Roman Empire, the forum (plural: fora) was a significant public space that served as a marketplace and a gathering area for various activities. Roman forums were typically situated at the heart of the city or town, making them easily accessible and visible to the populace. They were surrounded by important buildings, such as temples, basilicas, and government offices, indicating the significance of these places in everyday Roman life. In addition to the central forum, many Roman settlements also boasted smaller, specialized marketplaces catering to specific types of trades or goods, such as the Macellum for food or the Tabernae for small shops. Although the suggested answer focuses on Roman towns, it is worth noting that other ancient cultures also featured marketplaces, including the Greeks, Persians, Egyptians, and Mesopotamians. While the presence of marketplaces in Roman towns is essential to understand the structure and functioning of their societies, it should be acknowledged that they weren't the only ancient culture to have such places for commerce and social interaction.

A:","output":"Take It Easy has a maximum score of 307. Take It Easy is a strategic board game designed by Peter Burley and is suitable for 1 to 8 players. It is a tile-placement game that combines elements of luck and strategy. Each player has a set of 27 hexagonal tiles, numbered from 1 to 9, with three different colored lines connecting the sides. The players' objective is to create connecting lines of the same color on their respective game boards to score points. In Take It Easy, the players draw tiles one at a time and place them on their boards, attempting to create long, unbroken lines of the same color from edge to edge. The placement of tiles is crucial; once a tile is placed, it cannot be moved. Therefore, players must plan wisely and adapt their strategies as the game progresses, as drawing undesirable tiles can negatively affect their overall scores. The scoring in Take It Easy is determined by multiplying the color value by the number of tiles that make up a completed line. The color values are as follows: - Yellow Lines: 1 point per tile - Blue Lines: 5 points per tile - Red Lines: 9 points per tile - Green Lines: 7 points per tile - Orange Lines: 3 points per tile To maximize points, players should focus on forming long lines and strategically placing high-value tiles. An optimal game, in which a player forms the longest possible lines in each color without any breaks, will result in a maximum score of 307 points. This score is achieved by completing one line of each color, with specific arrangements and lengths that maximize point values: - Yellow Line (9 tiles): 9 points - Blue Line (8 tiles): 40 points - Red Line (7 tiles): 63 points - Green Line (6 tiles): 42 points - Orange Line (5 tiles): 15 points - Yellow Line (4 tiles): 4 points - Blue Line (3 tiles): 15 points - Red Line (2 tiles): 18 points - Green Line (1 tile): 7 points Total: 9 + 40 + 63 + 42 + 15 + 4 + 15 + 18 + 7 = 307 In conclusion, Take It Easy is the board game with a maximum possible score of 307, achieved through careful tile placement, strategic planning, and the formation of the longest possible lines in each color."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: The toothbrush was given to the man for free, where did the man get it?

This indicates a positive sentiment towards the service quality and the behavior of the employees. 2. Negative Sentiment: The \\"slow service\\" point mentioned in the review leans towards a negative sentiment as it implies that the reviewer experienced an unsatisfactory pace of service. This could have led to frustration and disappointment during their visit. 3.

Hypothesis: JAA helped to create common safety standards.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) helped create common safety standards from the given context. The context provides substantial information to support this hypothesis. The Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) was an associated body of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) that represented various civil aviation regulatory authorities from European States. These states chose to cooperate in developing and implementing shared safety regulatory standards and procedures for civil aviation. As an entity, the JAA acted as a medium for collaboration between these authorities, fostering the creation of a consistent set of safety standards that would ensure the well-being of passengers and the proper functioning of air transport across the participating European countries. It is important to note that the JAA in and of itself was not a regulatory body. This means that the JAA would not directly implement or enforce the safety standards it helped develop. Instead, its role was to facilitate cooperation among regulators of the member countries and develop these safety standards, with enforcement and regulation taking place through their respective member authorities. By acting as a coordinating organization, the JAA allowed the participating countries to share relevant knowledge, experience, and policy ideas to streamline their safety regulations, which in turn made air travel within the European region safer and more efficient.

US retailing and manufacturing interests led by Pittsburgh industrialist Robert Garland soon began lobbying for DST, but were opposed by railroads. The US's 1917 entry to the war overcame objections, and DST was established in 1918. What year did the United States finally adopt Daylight Saving Time?","output":"The United States first adopted Daylight Saving Time (DST) in 1918 during World War I to conserve fuel and utilize more daylight for productivity. The initial implementation began on March 31, 1918. However, after the war ended, DST was repealed in 1919 due to widespread opposition and inconsistencies in its adoption across states. In 1942, during World War II, the United States federally reintroduced DST as \\"War Time\\" under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which lasted until 1945. After the war, there was no federal law regulating DST usage, leading to confusion across different states and cities. It wasn't until 1966, with the passage of the Uniform Time Act, that a standardized system of observing DST was implemented across the United States. The Act stipulated that DST would begin on the last Sunday of April and end on the last Sunday of October, with an option for states to remain on Standard Time year-round. In 2007, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the duration of DST was extended. It now starts on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November.

However, he is also very stubborn and willful; for instance, he has one confrontation with a director over whether his character can get up and move center stage for a death scene. Michael storms off the stage and quits the play, even though apparently they are well into rehearsals.Michael lives with his best friend Jeff Slater, an eccentric playwright, and both men earn a living by waiting tables in a restaurant. As the film opens, Jeff and Michael's many friends and associates throw him a surprise birthday party, during which Michael's inability to connect with women becomes obvious. He has the tendency to lie, even about trivial things, to the point where the women see through him and avoid him. When Michael's potential love connection leaves the party with another man, Michael decides to console his neurotic friend Sandy Lester by walking her home. Sandy is nervous about an audition that she has the following day for a soap opera called \\"Southwest General\\", Michael coaches her and agrees to walk her to the audition the next day.When they get to the studio, the director refuses to even allow Sandy to read; he says she isn't intimidating enough.

Question: suppose more calm weather happens, how will it affect pressure inside of a volcano drops steadily. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"In the given process, calmer weather would not have a significant impact on the pressure inside the volcano, as pressure changes primarily result from the movement of magma within the Earth's mantle and crust. However, calm weather can influence the second effect mentioned (magma moving upwards) indirectly by affecting the cooling of lava that forms new rock. If there is more calm weather, the cooling of lava at the surface may be slower since there will be less wind to dissipate heat. This slow cooling may lead to the formation of denser rocks, which could make it slightly more difficult for magma to rise in response to pressure changes. So, in conclusion, more calm weather would have a minor effect on the pressure within a volcano and its influence on magma movement.

Thanks to Winfrey’s network, OWN, we have been sitting a yearlong shiva, watching the Christ-like Last Days through a show called \\"Oprah Behind the Scenes.\\" We’ve also witnessed celebrity after celebrity make their pilgrim’s progress to Chicago to tell Oprah how she’s brightened the lives of millions. (Because if there’s anyone who reflects the will of the people, it’s Madonna.) And traditional newspapers are already going on about Oprah as if she’s no longer alive. (“The Oprah Winfrey age comes to an end,” the Daily Mail keened.) What we haven’t really had is a reality check: This woman isn’t going anyplace — at least, anyplace where a camera can’t find her. She is barred from returning to a talk show until 2012, but that’s exactly what she plans to do once January comes. \\"Oprah's Next Chapter\\" is expected to feature footage with the megastar roughly three times a week. No, that’s not a daily dose of feel-good-yes-I-can-isms, but it’s a schedule that leaves Oprah plenty of opportunities to remind us about what soap she prefers or how chummy she is with Jennifer Aniston.In the meantime, Winfrey isn’t exactly shying away from celebrity, either. (There is no way that a person who shares her camping trips with the planet is ever, ever going to abandon life in front of a camera.) In September, Winfrey’s broadcast contract frees OWN to present vintage Oprah episodes, and the network has said it plans to do so, including 60 with new intros featuring Winfrey herself.Oprah has said she wants to leave behind the grind of a daily TV talk show. That we can believe. But we here at MOG will bet you dollars to doughnuts (if not Sprinkles cupcakes — thanks for the recommendation, Oprah!) that the billionaire will be on her deathbed before she ever, truly, steps down.

A: Answer:","output":"D). Proteins DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, encodes instructions for the synthesis of protein molecules. Proteins are fundamental molecules essential for various biological processes in living organisms. They are involved in virtually every function within a cell, including the maintenance of cell structure, regulation of metabolic pathways, immune responses, muscle movements, and signal transduction. The genetic information stored in the DNA molecule is contained in its sequence of nucleotide bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). This genetic information is organized and divided into functional units called genes. Each gene possesses a specific sequence of nucleotides that provides the blueprint for a unique protein. The process by which genetic information in DNA is converted into proteins occurs in two stages: transcription and translation. During transcription, a segment of DNA containing the gene of interest is copied into a complementary RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). This process is carried out by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. The newly synthesized mRNA then migrates from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the process of translation takes place. During translation, ribosomes, which are molecular machines composed of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), read the genetic information encoded in the mRNA molecule. The ribosome decodes the mRNA sequence into a series of three-nucleotide units called codons. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid, the building blocks of proteins. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which contain specific anticodon sequences, bind to the corresponding codons on the mRNA. The tRNA molecules also carry the appropriate amino acid that matches the codon they bind to. The ribosome then catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids, creating a growing polypeptide chain, which eventually folds into a functional protein. Thus, DNA encodes instructions for the synthesis of protein molecules. The proteins synthesized based on these instructions play crucial roles in various biological processes and help maintain the proper functioning of cells and the entire organism."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: While hosting a party in his Manhattan penthouse, financial publisher Chris Thorne (Chevy Chase) meets Diane Lightson (Demi Moore), a distraught young woman whose fiancee recently broke up with her.

He has won 43 events on the PGA Tour, including five major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), a PGA Championship (2005), and an Open Championship (2013). Mickelson is one of 16 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, where he has finished runner-up a record six times. Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments. Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event. That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut.

President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings.

The story follows Samantha Harrison, a detective looking for her missing sister, Lisa. When clues begin to unravel, the connection between the two families starts to become clear, especially with Milday de Winter, a mysterious and powerful businesswoman. The events take a turn when Samantha discovers that it's Milday's former brother-in-law, Thomas, who holds the key to the truth. Act 1: The movie opens with a flashback of a young Samantha and Lisa Harrison playing in the woods near their family's estate. Their friendship with the distant de Winter siblings, Milday and Thomas, is briefly hinted at, establishing an unspoken bond between the two families. However, their blossoming friendship takes a dark turn as mysterious events begin taking place. Fast forward to present-day, and Samantha is now a seasoned detective, called upon to investigate her sister Lisa's sudden disappearance. As she pieces together the evidence, she stumbles upon connections between her sister's life and the elusive De Winter family, particularly Milday, who has become a powerful businesswoman with possible underworld links.

As Samantha delves deeper, she discovers that Thomas, Milday's former brother-in-law, may have crucial information about the recent events. Thomas, once a proud and successful businessman, now leads a quiet life after a bitter divorce from Milday's sister, Catherine. Samantha approaches Thomas, who is initially reluctant to speak about his past, fearing retribution from the powerful De Winter family. However, after multiple confrontations, Thomas finally reveals significant details about the family’s shady business dealings and how he had caught Milday orchestrating a massive criminal operation. This discovery led to his fallout with the De Winters and the dissolution of his marriage. Act 3: Armed with this newfound knowledge, Samantha confronts Milday with the truth. Milday, although shaken by the revelation, refuses to admit her wrongdoings and challenges Samantha to prove her accusations. Meanwhile, Thomas, not wanting to be a bystander anymore, comes forward to help Samantha. Along the way, they uncover a sinister plot by Milday to broker illegal deals and consolidate her power within the criminal underworld. In the thrilling climax, Samantha, determined to bring justice to her sister and unveil Milday's true nature, takes a stand against Milday's empire. With Thomas's help, they orchestrate a sting operation to catch Milday and her associates red-handed.

Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada, and afflicted by malaria, the colony was abandoned two years later. The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, persuading the governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns. This occurred in 1707 with the Treaty of Union, establishing the Kingdom of Great Britain.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The settlers of Panama eventually failed due to several factors aside from disease, including: 1. Hostility from neighboring Spanish colonists: As the Scottish settlement was established on the isthmus of Panama, it was in close proximity to the Spanish colonies of New Granada. Spanish colonists viewed the Scottish presence as a threat to their interests in the area, leading to tensions and conflict. This hostility made it difficult for the Scottish settlers to gain access to the resources they needed, establish trade, and find allies in the region. 2. Lack of experience and knowledge in managing a colony: The Scottish settlers were inexperienced in establishing and managing a colony, especially in a tropical environment that was unfamiliar to them. They were ill-equipped to deal with the challenges posed by the climate, geography, and local flora and fauna, which led to difficulties in establishing a sustainable food supply, constructing infrastructure, and other essential aspects of a functional settlement. 3. Insufficient resources and funding: The Darien scheme was a significant financial undertaking for Scotland, requiring a considerable amount of capital. However, the funding was not sufficient to support the long-term development and management of the settlement. Additionally, the scheme's financial failure made it difficult for the settlers to acquire much-needed support and resources from Scotland, further hindering their ability to overcome the challenges they faced. 4. Isolation from Scotland: The distance between Scotland and the isthmus of Panama made communication and the transportation of supplies extremely difficult. This isolation made it challenging for the settlers to receive reinforcement, support, and guidance from their homeland, diminishing their morale and ability to maintain the settlement. 5. Political pressure and consequences: The failure of the Darien scheme had significant political ramifications, as it demonstrated the difficulties Scotland faced in establishing an overseas empire independently. This realization played a crucial role in persuading both the English and Scottish governments to pursue a union of their countries, culminating in the 1707 Treaty of Union and the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain. The political focus on this union likely diverted attention and resources away from the struggling Panama settlement, contributing to its ultimate failure."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

OVER the past decade, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation has demonstrated that it is among the best of the nation's industrial heavyweights when it comes to absorbing a punch. But can it throw one? The Pittsburgh-based giant was wounded several times in the 1970's by a series of costly and time-consuming events - an overseas bribery scandal, the decline and eventual sale of its well-known appliance business, a money-losing venture into urban housing development, quality-control problems with its large steam turbines, and a uranium contract dispute with billions of dollars at stake. Westinghouse not only survived, it emerged last year with most of its legal entanglements settled. Its newly slimmed-down operations generated record sales of 8.5 billion and record profits of 402.9 million. It also amassed a hoard of cash that enabled it to offer 646 million for the Teleprompter Corporation, the nation's largest cable television concern. Still, analysts today are more impressed with the company's past resiliency than with its prospects for the future. Because the vast majority of its revenue comes from the production, distribution, use and control of electricity - as has been true since the company was founded in 1886 - Westinghouse is deeply committed to the ''mature'' electrical equipment industry. Many of its products face wellentrenched competitors and others have questionable growth prospects. ''It is a turnaround situation that has turned,'' Robert McCoy, an analyst at Kidder Peabody, said. ''Now they really have their work cut out for them.'' With Westinghouse's common stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday at 30 1/8 - for a relatively low price/earnings ratio of 6 - Westinghouse's chairman, Robert E. Kirby, is sensitive about the reservations of analysts. He and other executives declined to be interviewed last month, in advance of the company's annual spring meeting with Wall Street analysts March 26. But it is not Westinghouse's current performance that concerns analysts; they are more interested in how the company will meet the challenges posed by increased foreign and domestic competition, changes in management techniques and shifts in demand. ''People don't believe Westinghouse can really deliver,'' said Kemp Fuller, an analyst at Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook & Weeden who has been one of the company's most resolute boosters. Part of the problem appears to be that many of the company's difficulties during the past decade were either caused or exacerbated by its own miscalculations. There is also a widely held perception that the company has often failed to take advantage of its strengths. ''Over the years, Westinghouse has had some great strengths in the technological area, but it has had trouble getting it all together strategically,'' Michael Porter, a strategic planning expert at the Harvard Business School, said. Doubters of the company's abilities cite several episodes in the 1970's that helped shape Westinghouse's current image. They point to the sale in 1974 of the company's large but ailing appliance business to White Consolidated Industries, which promptly returned it to profitability. They also mention a 300,000 fine assessed to the company after it pleaded guilty in 1978 to bribing Egypt's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Sultan. But the real blow, they say, was the company's miscalculation of the uranium market following the Arab oil embargo of 1973. In order to help market its nuclear-powered electric generating plants, Westinghouse had guaranteed delivery of uranium to utility customers at an average of 9.50 a pound into the 1990's. It counted on purchases in the open market, where prices were expected to remain below 10 a pound, to cover most of its obligations. Instead, prices skyrocketed and Westinghouse faced the prospect of having to acquire uranium at prices far higher than what it could charge on resale. (Analysts point with particular distress to the fact that the General Electric Company, which, at the time, also guaranteed uranium at fixed prices to utilities that purchased its nuclear power plants, had covered its exposure by contracting to purchase supplies at fixed prices.) IN September 1975, with uranium prices at 25 a pound and a possible liability of 2 billion, Westinghouse charged that the price increases had been engineered by an illegal cartel of uranium producers. For that reason, Westinghouse claimed, it was not obligated to fulfill its contracts. As expected, the utilities sued Westinghouse, and Westinghouse sued members of the alleged cartel. Although Westinghouse's move infuriated its customers, it proved to be financially adroit. Today, all but one of the suits against the company are settled, at a cost far below the outlay that would have been necessary to fulfill the contracts. And, with the liabilities already written off against earnings in the last few years, the company now is beginning to pile up money from settlements in the suit it brought against members of the alleged cartel.","output":"This news article is about a company called Westinghouse Electric Corporation. In the 1970s, they had some problems, like losing money and getting into trouble with the law. But, they were able to bounce back and do better. Last year, they made a lot of money and bought another company. Some people still worry about how well Westinghouse will do in the future, because they have a lot of competition and need to keep changing to stay successful. They've made some mistakes in the past, but they're trying to learn from them and do better."},{"instruction":"Is it possible to conclude that \\"Two ladies are crossing a street right in front of a restaurant.\\" if \\"Two women are walking outside.\\"?","output":"To determine if it's possible to conclude that \\"Two ladies are crossing a street right in front of a restaurant\\" based on the statement \\"Two women are walking outside,\\" let's break down the information given and analyze the logical steps. 1.

Context: The city struck fortune in the late 18th century with the inventions and industrial activity of Eli Whitney, a Yale graduate who remained in New Haven to develop the cotton gin and establish a gun-manufacturing factory in the northern part of the city near the Hamden town line. That area is still known as Whitneyville, and the main road through both towns is known as Whitney Avenue. The factory is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as \\"The Arsenal of America\\". It was in Whitney's gun-manufacturing plant that Samuel Colt invented the automatic revolver in 1836.

Article: There are lots of dangerous and terrible insects in Northeastern India, but the tree-bees are the most terrible. They are killers. Unlike most bees which will sting you only if they are disturbed , tree-bees will attack you in thousands for no reason. And they will chase you for your life. Walking along a dusty road while I was on holiday there last year. I found myself, without the least warning, the centre of such an attack. The air above me suddenly became thick with bees. Though it was hot, I went cold all over. Until then I had never heard of Indian tree-bees, but I had recently seen a film called \\"The Angry Swarm\\", which was about killer-bees. I began running to the village about half a mile away, but I was soon covered from head to foot with bees. I drove them away with my hands, only to make room for others. Each time I opened my mouth for breath, more bees entered my mouth, until it was stung to twice its usual size and I could hardly breathe. When I reached the village, I found some workers building a house. I ran towards them for help. But as soon as the workers saw the bees with me, they ran for safety at top speed. Soon my eyes had completely closed. I fell into a pile of brick dust. I pushed myself wildly down into it until my head and shoulders were covered. And then I tried hard to get out of the dust, the angry bees made a new attack on me. I was tired out and ran weakly about in circles. Soon I lost my consciousness . Later I learned that two quick-minded villagers ran to a pile of dry grass and quickly surrounded me with a thick wall of fire and smoke until the bees were driven away.

Here are possible answers to this question: - bowling alley - space shuttle - auditorium - rest area - beach I believe the correct choice is \\"space shuttle\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"Space shuttle. The seats in a space shuttle were specifically designed to accommodate the astronauts' cumbersome clothing, such as their spacesuits and other necessary equipment for their journey into space. These seats, known as the Crew Compartment Accommodations, were critical for both the safety and comfort of the astronauts during their space missions. Spacesuits are bulky, heavy, and restrict movement, so the seats had to be designed to ensure that the astronauts could be securely fastened in and still operate the shuttle effectively. The space shuttle's seats were arranged in a configuration that allowed them to be adjusted and customized for each specific astronaut's body shape and size. Additionally, the seats were equipped with important safety features such as harnesses, shoulder straps, and headrests that could protect the astronauts from extreme forces during launch and re-entry. In comparison to the other options: - Bowling alley: Seats in bowling alleys are designed for casual seating and do not need to accommodate cumbersome clothing. - Auditorium: Auditorium seating is designed to accommodate a large audience and may have minimal padding or basic foldable designs. They are not intended to accommodate cumbersome clothing. - Rest area: Rest area seating is typically for short-term use by travelers and typically features basic bench seating or picnic tables, which do not require any accommodations for bulky clothing. - Beach: Beach seating typically consists of some sort of simple lounge chair or beach towel on the sand, which also does not need to take into account cumbersome clothing. Considering these reasons, the correct choice among the given options is indeed \\"space shuttle\\" as the seats were specifically designed to accommodate the astronauts' cumbersome clothing."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

Private dwelling will rise if surrounding area floods creating a \\"free floating pontoon\\"","output":"Title: Exciting Floating Home Gets Permission to Be Built on the River Thames Hello little buddies! Today, we're going to talk about a fun and amazing home that has been given permission to be built right on the banks of the River Thames in the UK. This special home is called an \\"amphibious home\\". Why is it so special? Well, let's find out! An amphibious home is a super cool house that can float on water like a boat whenever there is a flood. Just like a rubber duckie floats in your bathtub, this home will rise up when there is too much water around it and become a \\"free-floating pontoon\\". A pontoon is a kind of floating structure, like a big, flat and strong raft. So how does this work? Think of a playground seesaw. When one side goes up, the other side goes down, right? Now, imagine that instead of a seesaw, there's a house sitting on a giant floating raft. When water starts to rise around the house, the raft lifts the house with it, helping the house stay dry and safe. The people who want to build this amazing floating home have asked the big bosses who make the rules for permission, and they have said \\"yes\\"! This means that they can go ahead and start building this one-of-a-kind private dwelling. Building a home like this is a super smart idea, especially if the area near the river has flooded before. This amazing amphibious home will help keep the people who live inside it safe and cozy, even when the river gets too high. This cool idea could also help other people living near rivers and lakes in the future. If floating homes become more popular, it could mean safer homes and happier families when the weather gets a bit too wet! And that's the story of the exciting floating home that will be built on the banks of the River Thames in the UK.

A:","output":"This task involves analyzing a text comment in Tamil and classifying it into one of three categories: Hope speech, Not Hope Speech, or Not in Expected Language. Task Explanation: 1. Read the Tamil text comment carefully. Firstly, you need to ensure the comment is written in Tamil. If the text is in a language other than Tamil, it should be categorized as 'Not in Expected Language'. 2. If the text is indeed in Tamil, you next need to understand the message it is conveying. Guidelines: (i) If the comment reflects an encouraging, positive, or supportive message about equality, diversity or inclusion, it should be classified as 'Hope Speech'. For example if the comment includes words or phrases that promote tolerance, acceptance, cooperation, unity, peace etc. or advocates for the rights and equality of all people, then it's 'Hope Speech'. (ii) If the comment does not contain any supportive or positive messages about equality, diversity or inclusion, it should be classified as 'Not Hope Speech'. This could be a neutral comment, a negative comment, an offtopic comment etc. To accomplish this, you need a basic understanding of the Tamil language to comprehend the text. Language tools or translators can be helpful if you're not fluent in Tamil. In the example, the text \\"Sooryave make up pott kuthira mele ukkara vech seekram chinakk anuppivey...\\" seems to be in Tamil, but without knowing the exact translation it's difficult to classify it into any of the given categories. This would be done by understanding the context and sentiment of the text and then categorizing it into one of the three given classes."},{"instruction":"Article:It has been frequently claimed that Qatar has relatively close ties, probably through intermediaries, with the Nusra Front. The Qatar foreign ministry has denied this, and proof is, unsurprisingly, difficult to find. But such an accusation has increasingly cropped up, particularly in terms of Qatar's prolific record of resolving hostage situations in Syria. Thirteen Greek orthodox nuns, an American journalist, and 45 Fijian peacekeepers are just some who have been released in the last 18 months with Qatar's and, it appears, often the Nusra Front's help. In the melange of designated terrorist and jihadist groups at play in Syria and Iraq, there is a vast spectrum ranging from the deranged like Islamic State (IS) to the more moderate groups like (the now defunct) Harakat Hazm that was supported by, among others, America. Being a directly affiliated al-Qaeda group, the Nusra Front is nearer the IS end of the spectrum. Yet, while the Qatari relationship with the Nusra Front appears to be far from straightforward with some of the state's initiatives failing, indicating some distance between the two, according to recent reports, Qatar appears to want to reform this relationship. This begs the question of why Qatar would want even loosely to associate itself with a group like the Nusra Front. Firstly, there are no \\"good choices\\" in Syria today. Qatar has surmised, it seems, that supporting or transforming the Nusra Front, is one of the \\"least worst\\" options. Secondly, the Nusra Front has pledged to concentrate its efforts on removing the Bashar al-Assad government, as opposed to attacking the \\"far enemy\\" (ie Western states). On this point, the Nusra Front is aligned tightly with Qatar, which also is implacably against the government and fundamentally believes that the situation in Syria will only improve if he is removed. This idea is also reflected in the Nusra Front's composition, which is far more Syrian-dominated than the foreign jihadist-magnet that is IS. Thirdly, with this goal in mind, and perhaps most crucially, the Nusra Front group is widely seen as one of the most effective groups operating in Syria against a wider backdrop of splintered groups whose powers are highly limited. The potential creation of an effective fighting force against IS (or the Syrian regime) is a significant draw for Qatar. Fourthly, Qatar possesses a small, young foreign ministry and it does not have a foreign intelligence service. Though far from alone on this issue, the state struggles to map the dynamic conflict and finds it difficult to plot the shifting actors. Instead, it seems that Qatar prefers to continue to support the people or groups with whom it already has relations. As the conflict inexorably deteriorated and groups became more and more extreme, it seems that Qatar, unable to chop and change support easily and wanting to retain relevance, maintained relations with its contacts in Syria, some of whom appear to have close affiliations with the Nusra Front. Nevertheless, the low-level Qatari contacts with this group (if, indeed, they do exist) are not sufficient to turn the tide in Syria, and rumours of such existing contacts have added fuel to the media frenzy that has alighted on Qatar and its allegedly nefarious links in recent years. Source: Quilliam Foundation Profile: Syria's Nusra Front New insight into Nusra Front This is why Qatar is hoping to bring the Nusra Front in from the cold. If the state can get the group to eschew its al-Qaeda affiliation and adhere to a broadly moderate Islamist platform, Qatar can officially commence, with Western blessing, the supply of one of the most effective fighting forces in Syria. Not an easy sell, but the promise of Qatar supplying a potential tsunami of support will prove to be a powerful negotiating tactic. Once again, the silence from Doha on this matter encourages speculation inferring that Qatar has some kind of a genuine sympathy with the goals of the likes of the Nusra Front. But the fact remains that Qatar is a key Western ally. It hosts a critical US military base, it grafted US and UK higher-education institutions and ideas onto its education system, and has long promoted the Middle East's most visible and powerful woman, Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al-Missned, the Emir's mother. These are transparently not the policies of a state with sympathies for the likes of IS or al-Qaeda. Indeed, there is no chance that Qatar is doing this alone: the US and UK governments will certainly be involved in or at least apprised of Qatar's plans. And, with increasing desperation in the face of IS and Bashar al-Assad's resilience, a reformed, effective fighting force would be welcomed by the West. Indeed, the UN special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, recently said that he would speak to anyone, including the Nusra Front, in the effort to save lives. Qatar is not the first state to reason that it is time to talk to groups that are unpalatable and extreme, but who are, nevertheless, influential. But the ultimate judgement on this emerging policy will rest on how well Qatar can manage this transition and if this new fighting force can alter the balance of power. The recent assassination of the Nusra Front's central military commander, Abu Hammam al-Shami, in Idlib, Syria, indicates the fluid nature of the conflict. Whether he was killed because of an internal disagreement about the putative negotiations to eschew the Nusra Front's al-Qaeda affiliation or not, this assassination indicates the daily changes at the tactical level that can have potentially profound strategic effects. In such a changeable, fractured operating environment, Qatar will not be able to engineer a clean break of the Nusra Front from al-Qaeda. But, in a context where the best that can be hoped for is the \\"least worst\\" solution, Qatar's plan is as viable as any other. Dr David Roberts is a lecturer in the Defence Studies Department at King's College London. He was the Director of the Qatar office of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). His book Qatar: Securing the Global Ambitions of a City State will be published in 2015.Follow him on Twitter @thegulfblog A summary of the above article is?","output":"Qatar has increasingly been accused of having close ties with the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group operating in Syria. Although the Qatari foreign ministry denies the allegations, Qatar's successful involvement in resolving hostage situations in Syria has led many to believe that there is some level of association between the two. It is important to analyze why Qatar would want to associate with the Nusra Front, even if the relationship is fairly loose. First, there are no \\"good choices\\" in Syria, and Qatar seems to support the Nusra Front as one of the \\"least-worst\\" options for achieving their goals. The Nusra Front aligns with Qatar's objective of removing the Bashar al-Assad government to reach a better situation in Syria. Additionally, the Nusra Front is more focused on fighting within Syria, as opposed to targeting Western states. Second, the Nusra Front is seen as one of the most effective fighting forces in Syria, which makes them appealing to Qatar in the battle against the Islamic State or the Syrian regime. Furthermore, Qatar's limited foreign intelligence service may cause them to lean on existing contacts, some of whom may have links with the Nusra Front. However, Qatar aims to bring the Nusra Front \\"in from the cold\\" by encouraging the group to abandon its al-Qaeda affiliation and adopt a more moderate Islamist stance. If this transformation occurs, Qatar can officially supply them with support, backed by Western countries. It is worth noting that Qatar is a key Western ally, hosting an important US military base and incorporating US and UK educational institutions and ideas into their system. As a result, it is unlikely to act alone, and the US and UK governments would most likely be involved or aware of Qatar's plans to transform the Nusra Front. Qatar's policy will be judged on their management of this transition and whether the new fighting force can alter the balance of power in Syria. In the unpredictable and volatile landscape of the Syrian conflict, Qatar faces significant challenges in distancing the Nusra Front from al-Qaeda. However, in a context where the search for the \\"least-worst\\" solution is ongoing, Qatar's approach might be as viable as any other."},{"instruction":"Q:A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","output":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. A weaker heat source would have an indirect impact on the process of boiling water. This is because a weaker heat source will take more time to heat the water to its boiling point. As a result, the formation of bubbles would be delayed and less frequent, as the energy produced by the weaker heat source would not be sufficient enough to generate vigorous bubble formation in the water as quickly or efficiently as a stronger heat source would. The steps of the process involving the addition of water to a pot, putting the pot over a heat source, turning the heat source on, waiting for a few minutes, and taking the pot off the heat source would remain unaffected. However, the steps where you are supposed to observe small bubbles in the water before it starts to bubble a lot and finally see steam rising would be indirectly impacted by the weaker heat source. The slower rate at which the weaker heat source is heating the water will result in less bubble formation, and it will take more time for steam to rise from the water as the temperature will rise slowly. The weaker heat source, therefore, will not directly change any step in the process but will indirectly affect the efficiency of the steps involving the water heating and bubbling."},{"instruction":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip","output":"This review has a negative opinion of the movie.

The legend spoke of a vengeful spirit named Suzette, cursed to wander the earth until her murderer, Fuad, was brought to justice. Lila, a curious young journalist, arrives in Bradbury to cover a story on the town's local lore. While investigating the legend of Suzette, she discovers that the rumors may not be far from the truth. Mysterious deaths have plagued the town for years, each victim beheaded in a gruesome fashion. The townspeople believe these murders are the work of Fuad's ghost, who recreates Suzette's death in a twisted form of atonement. As Lila delves deeper into the enigma, she uncovers a dark truth. Suzette was once a beautiful French dancer, who fell in love with Fuad, a skilled blacksmith with a passion for the occult. Unsuspecting of his true nature, Suzette became tangled in Fuad's obsession with forbidden rituals and dark arts. In an attempt to seek immortality, Fuad performed a gruesome ritual which required Suzette's decapitation. However, the ritual backfired, cursing the two lovers and binding Suzette's spirit to the mortal realm. Determined to break the curse and unravel the truth, Lila convinces her newfound ally, Patrick, a local historian, to help her decode Fuad's cryptic manuscripts. Along the way, they gradually unveil the forgotten history of Bradbury and the tragic love story between Suzette and Fuad. As they inch closer to the truth, they become targets for Fuad's spirit, who is desperate to prevent the pair from breaking his curse. With each exhaustive step, Lila and Patrick start to expose a hidden world of occultism, betrayal, and murder lurking beneath the picturesque facade of Bradbury. In a thrilling race against time, Lila and Patrick navigate the dangers of the cryptic past and manage to break the curse by completing an ancient ritual, which finally allows Suzette's spirit to rest in peace. Lila's determination to uncover the truth behind Fuad's morbid ritual not only brings solace to the restless spirit of Suzette but also redeems the tarnished reputation of the small coastal town. As the curse lifts and the truth comes to light in her article, Lila comes to terms with the fact that the darkest horrors lie not in the realm of supernatural, but within the hearts of men. The town of Bradbury, now free from the shadows of Suzette and Fuad, slowly begins to heal, its tightly-held secrets exposed and its vengeful spirits finally put to rest."},{"instruction":"Teacher:Given a statement about date and time, state whether the statement is true or false.

Please segment the words:","output":"The lion, as a highly skilled apex predator, should employ various tactics to ensure the success of capturing its meal. Some key tactics and strategies that a lion may use include stealth, ambush, stalking, teamwork, patience, speed, and adaptability. 1. Stealth: One of the lion's greatest assets is its ability to blend in with its environment. By using the tall grass and foliage found in the savanna, the lion can remain undetected as it approaches its prey. 2. Ambush: Lions have perfected the art of ambush hunting. By lying low and staying camouflaged, they patiently wait for their prey to approach within striking distance. Once close enough, the lion will pounce and subdue its prey with powerful bites and swipes from its claws. 3. Stalking: A lion will slowly and deliberately move towards its prey while maintaining a low profile. It moves silently and cautiously to avoid alerting the target. By the time the prey realizes there's a threat, it's often too late to escape. 4. Teamwork: Lions are social animals and often hunt together in groups known as prides. By hunting together, lions can take down larger prey than they could as individuals. Prides work together by surrounding their prey and coordinating their attack. 5. Patience: Hunting requires a great deal of patience, particularly for predators like lions. They are willing to wait for the perfect opportunity to strike, even if it means lying in wait for hours. This patience pays off when the prey finally comes within range. 6. Speed: Lions are incredibly fast runners, reaching speeds of up to 35 miles per hour (56 km/h) in short bursts. This impressive speed allows them to close the gap quickly between themselves and their prey, leaving little time for the prey to react. 7. Adaptability: Lions are highly adaptable hunters and are able to switch up their approach based on the specific behavior and needs of their prey. For example, if a prey is faster than the lion, it might use teamwork and strategic positioning to corner the prey. Alternatively, if the prey is well-defended, the lion might target more vulnerable, smaller individuals. By employing these tactics, the lion increases its chances of successfully capturing a meal and ensuring its survival as the king of the African Savannah."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"La vie est une succession d'événements imprévus, qui nous façonne et nous permet de grandir en tant qu'individus.\\" This French sentence translates to: \\"Life is a series of unexpected events, which shapes us and allows us to grow as individuals.\\" The sentence conveys a sentiment about life's unpredictability and how it helps shape our personal growth."},{"instruction":"Write a title: Consumer prices rose by a modest 0.2 percent in September as a decline in prices for new cars and airline fares helped to temper a rise in costs for medical care, gasoline and fuel oil.","output":"\\"Prices for Some Things Went Up a Little Bit in September, But Cars and Plane Rides Got Cheaper, So It's Not So Bad\\""},{"instruction":"Summer Camp Contact Kitty 6219-7830 Are you looking for a place where you can enjoy Chinese study and experience Chinese culture during the summer holiday?

One way that you can begin to cure stomach pain is to keep track of the foods that you eat and how they make you feel. Over time, you should begin to notice that certain foods cause stomach pain more than others, while some cause no pain at all. Adjust your eating habits to eliminate these causes of stomach pain. For example, if you notice that you get stomach pain after eating spaghetti and meatballs with pasta sauce, then that food may be causing your stomach pain. To determine if the sauce, pasta, or meatballs are causing your stomach pain, try eliminating one component each day. For example, you can eat just spaghetti and meatballs without sauce the following day and if you do not have stomach pain, then you will know that it was the sauce that caused the pain. You may also cure your stomach pain by eliminating some of the most common causes of stomach pain from your diet. Common problem foods to avoid include: Caffeinated drinks, such as coffee, black tea, and lattes Fatty foods, such as French fries, cookies, and pastries Carbonated drinks Acidic foods, such as pasta sauce and orange juice Alcohol Pasta Full-fat dairy products Keeping yourself well hydrated is another good way to start curing your stomach pain. Water helps your body digest your food and it also helps to reduce stomach acid. Most adults should drink about eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day. Try adding a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to a cup of water. Apple cider vinegar can help to neutralize stomach acid, which may also help to cure your stomach pain. Consuming a high-fiber diet is essential for good health, but it may also help with your stomach pain as well. Fiber keeps food moving through your system, so it may prevent you from becoming constipated. Try to eat an apple every day. Apples are a good source of fiber and they also contain pectin, which can help to neutralize acid. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: Stomach pain after eating may be caused by certain foods. To identify and eliminate the cause of stomach pain, keep track of the foods you eat and observe their effects on your body. Common problem foods include caffeinated drinks, fatty foods, carbonated drinks, acidic foods, alcohol, pasta, and full-fat dairy products. To help reduce stomach pain, stay well-hydrated by drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day and consider adding apple cider vinegar to water to neutralize stomach acid. Consuming a high-fiber diet, including foods like apples, can also help alleviate stomach pain by promoting regular digestion and neutralizing acid."},{"instruction":"Trivia question: What ambulance service is a common name used by a number of affiliated organisations in different countries dedicated to the teaching and practice of medical first aid and the provision of ambulance services, all of which derive their origins from an association founded in 1877 in England?

The correct spacing allows your readers to distinguish between words and sentences more easily, helping them make sense of the text. There are certain rules and guidelines when it comes to adding spaces to a text. Some important rules to consider are: 1. Use a single space between words: To separate words within a sentence, make sure to use only one space. Using too many spaces or no spaces at all can make the text difficult to read. 2. Use a single space after commas, semicolons, and colons: When using these punctuation marks, make sure to add a single space after them to improve readability. 3. Use a single space after a period (full-stop) and question marks: Ensure that you have a single space after you finish a sentence using these punctuation marks. This will allow the readers to differentiate between sentences and improve readability. 4. Ellipsis: When using an ellipsis, it is common to add a single space after the ellipsis and before the next word. However, this can also vary based on the style guide you are following. 5. No spaces around em dashes: Em dashes (—) should be used without any spaces around them. They are used to indicate a break in a sentence, and no space is required around them. 6. Single space after opening parentheses or brackets and before closing parentheses or brackets: When you have a parenthetical statement or additional information in brackets, use a single space after the opening parenthesis or bracket and before the closing parenthesis or bracket. Consistency in your spacing practices is critical to improve readability and clarity.

The use of strong negative language: Words like \\"unbelievably bad,\\" \\"sick to your stomach,\\" \\"pathetic,\\" \\"awful,\\" and \\"predictable\\" indicate that the author has strong negative feelings about the movie. These words are associated with disappointment, lack of quality, and frustration, which contribute to an overall negative sentiment in the review. 2.

The British backpacker who was viciously beaten up in Bundaberg, Queensland, on Saturday night has spoken for the first time about the ordeal and admitted only now does he realise how serious the attack was.

In his interview with MailOnline, Chris Luxton, the British backpacker, recounted his harrowing experience and expressed his gratitude for the medical professionals and Good Samaritans who came to his aid. According to Luxton, he was taking a stroll across the Burnett traffic bridge when he encountered the 22-year-old local, later identified as Braydon Adams, who seemed to be in an inebriated state. Adams allegedly initiated an unprovoked attack on Luxton, subjecting him to a brutal beating that left the young backpacker unconscious and dangerously injured. Alerted by a passing motorist who witnessed the incident, emergency crews quickly arrived on the scene to provide vital medical care to Luxton. Given the severity of his injuries, he was placed in an induced coma for a short period before being transported to the nearest hospital. Luxton's fractured skull resulted in a series of surgeries followed by an extensive recovery period. In the meantime, local authorities launched an investigation that resulted in the arrest of Braydon Adams, who is now facing charges of grievous bodily harm (GBH). In a shocking coincidence, Adams' attack on Luxton took place at the very same location where British backpacker Caroline Stuttle tragically lost her life over a decade ago in a similar incident, which has raised further concerns about the safety of travellers in the area. Throughout his recovery, Luxton has been overwhelmed with support from his loved ones back home in the UK, as well as from the British and Australian communities alike. Despite the lingering physical and emotional scars of his ordeal, Luxton has chosen to remain positive and focus on rebuilding his life. As part of his healing process, Luxton plans to complete a charity walk across the UK's coastline in honour of Caroline Stuttle, hoping to raise awareness of the importance of traveler safety and offer strength to others who've experienced similar traumas.

In this specific tweet, one first needs to understand the context in which the statement is made. Here, it seems like it is addressing a user named @thelemic about someone named Simon. In terms of sentiment, this tweet appears to carry a generally negative connotation, and here's why: 1. Accusation: The tweet mentions \\"Simon's lying,\\" which implies a negative sentiment as it accuses a person, presumably Simon, of not telling the truth. Lying, in most contexts, is considered a negative act because it breaks trust and shows dishonesty. 2. Vindication or clarification: The second part, \\"he beta'd too. for me.\\" seems to reveal some previously concealed information about Simon beta testing something, possibly a software product or game, for the tweet's author. The use of \\"too\\" means Simon is not alone in performing this action, and there might be some implications or misunderstandings troubling the author in the context of this discussion, leading to the need for this clarification. This can be seen as an attempt to set the records straight or expose Simon, which also exudes a negative sentiment. 3. Lack of positive emotion: There's no presence of any positive emotions or joyfulness in this tweet. When assessing sentiments, absence of positivity also usually leans towards a negative or neutral sentiment. 4. Directness and confrontation: Addressing someone directly about a third person and their actions tends to create an atmosphere of confrontation. Such an approach might trigger disputes or arguments which is generally considered negative.

The statement, \\"Small boy in a green shirt is buried up to his waist in sand,\\" provides us with a description of the situation. It tells us that the boy is buried in the sand, but it does not give any information about the circumstances leading to this situation or the boy's intention behind being buried. Therefore, we cannot confidently conclude that \\"The small boy is playing in the sand.\\" There could be multiple reasons for the boy to be buried in the sand, including: 1. Playing in the sand: The boy may indeed be playing in the sand with friends or family members, using it as a playful activity to pass the time at the beach. 2. Part of a game or competition: The boy may be participating in a sand-digging game or competition, which requires participants to be buried in the sand, either by themselves or with assistance from others. 3. A prank by friends or family: The small boy could be victim to a prank by friends or family members who buried him in the sand for fun or as part of a surprise. 4. Sand art or photography: The boy may be part of a sand art or photography project that requires him to pose while being buried in the sand. 5. Safety or protection: In a more worrisome scenario, the boy could be buried in the sand for safety or protection reasons, such as hiding from a threat or taking cover from harsh weather conditions. Although this might be less likely, it is still a possibility to consider. In conclusion, without further information about the context or the small boy's intentions, we cannot definitively conclude that he is playing in the sand.

Mr. Kevans, now a successful cartoonist, met Prince Harry at the Field of Remembrance event and shared his love for comics. His own experience in the Falklands War had inspired him to create a comic series that deals with the emotional and physical traumas faced by soldiers in combat, using humor and powerful storytelling to help address serious issues. His series, \\"Tumbledown Tales,\\" gained a strong following, particularly among veterans and active military personnel. After their conversation about comics, Prince Harry became a fan of \\"Tumbledown Tales\\" and began to read other graphic novels and comic series as well, discovering a newfound appreciation for the art form and the stories they tell. Inspired by Kevans, Prince Harry decided to use his royal influence and resources to create a project incorporating the use of comics, focusing on both the mental health challenges faced by military veterans and the healing impact of art. With Kevans onboard as a consultant and collaborator, Prince Harry established a charity organization named \\"Royal Frame,\\" which aimed to use comics and graphic novels to raise awareness about mental health issues faced by military personnel and veterans, while also encouraging them to express themselves through various forms of art. The initiative gained widespread popularity as veterans and active military members began sharing their stories, creating comics based on their experiences, and bonding over shared issues. \\"Royal Frame\\" also began hosting workshops and events where professional artists and writers would collaborate with veterans to create meaningful, eye-catching graphic novels, featuring the brave and inspiring stories of those who served their country and the challenges they faced in doing so. Several years after its inception, \\"Royal Frame\\" developed into a thriving nationwide charity, significantly contributing to the destigmatization of mental health issues within the military community. The charity's efforts extended beyond comics, eventually including other forms of art therapy, leading to numerous gallery exhibitions where veterans could display their work, share their experiences, and help heal together. Meanwhile, Prince Harry continued to nurture his interest in comics and art. He even lent his artistic talent to \\"Royal Frame\\" occasionally, creating his own comic strips and artworks that were auctioned off to raise funds for the charity.

The eruptive products range from basaltic andesite to rhyolite and rhyodacite. It is a predominantly rhyolitic stratovolcano overlying an older shield structure. Its modern structure is no more than 50,000 years old, and it last erupted about 2,000 years ago. Although its first eruptive events from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago were predominantly rhyolitic, between 38,000 and 32,000 years ago the volcano began to alternate between dacitic/rhyodacitic and rhyolitic eruptions. The volcano built a broad andesitic cone, forming a steep summit cone of andesite about 27,000 years ago. South Sister remained dormant for 15,000 years, after which its composition shifted from dacitic to more rhyolitic lava. An eruptive episode about 2,200 years ago, termed the Rock Mesa eruptive cycle, first spread volcanic ash from flank vents from the south and southwest flanks, followed by a thick rhyolite lava flow. Next, the Devils Hill eruptive cycle consisted of explosive ash eruptions followed by viscous rhyolitic lava flows. Unlike the previous eruptive period, it was caused by the intrusion of a dike of new silicic magma that erupted from 20 vents on the southeast side and from a smaller line on the north side. These eruptions generated pyroclastic flows and lava domes from vents on the northern, southern, eastern, and southeastern sides of the volcano. These relatively recent, postglacial eruptions suggest the presence of a silicic magma reservoir under South Sister, one that could perhaps lead to future eruptions. Unlike its sister peaks, South Sister has an uneroded summit crater about 0.25 mi (0.40 km) in diameter that holds a small crater lake known as Teardrop Pool, the highest lake in Oregon. Its cone consists of basaltic andesite along with red scoria and tephra, with exposed black and red inner walls made of scoria.

They encounter a wino (Paul Farrell) in an underpass, and beat him with their truncheons. Later, they arrive at a derelict theater. On the stage, another gang, led by a rival named Billy Boy, prepare to rape a voluptuous girl. Instead, the two gangs battle it out-- Alex and his two droogs are victorious.The trio next head out into the dark countryside looking for action. Alex pilots their stolen Durango 95 sports car. After playing \\"hogs of the road,\\" wherein they drive on the wrong side of the road and run a number of other motorists off into ditches and over embankments, Alex suggests making a \\"surprise visit.\\" They stop at a lonely country house that displays a backlighted sign that simply reads \\"Home.\\" Alex tricks his way into the house by claiming to be the victim of a car accident. They beat the homeowner, a writer named Frank Alexander (Patrick Magee), and gang rape his wife (Adrienne Corri) while Alex croons \\"Singin' in the Rain.\\"When they've finished having fun, the gang returns to the Korova. An opera singer seated at an adjacent table sings the chorus from Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Listening to the woman, Alex is ecstatic -- \\"I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise\\"-- but Dim ruins the mood when he makes a farting noise. Alex hits him in the crotch with his truncheon. Henceforth, Dim is resentful but Alex dismisses him.Alex arrives at his apartment just before dawn.

At the breakfast table she discusses the situation with... My question: What makes Alex contemplate violence and images of sex? A:","output":"Alex DeLarge's contemplation of violence and images of sex can be attributed to a combination of factors, including his personality, upbringing, and the society in which he lives. 1. Personality: Alex is a sociopath, which means he has a personality disorder characterized by a disregard for the rights of others, lack of empathy, and a propensity for aggressive and violent behavior. This personality trait compels him to derive enjoyment from acts of violence and sexual aggression. 2. Upbringing: The environment in which Alex grows up may play a role in his violent tendencies. His family life is dysfunctional, with his parents appearing to be uninvolved and unconcerned about his activities. This lack of guidance and discipline may have contributed to the development of his sociopathic behavior. 3. Influence of peers: Alex's gang, or \\"droogs,\\" as they are called in the film, share his affinity for violence and sexual aggression. The group dynamic reinforces Alex's behavior and provides him with a sense of belonging and power. 4. Dystopian society: \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is set in a dystopian future where society is marked by violence, moral decay, and a lack of concern for others. This environment desensitizes Alex and others like him, pushing them to engage in violent and sexually aggressive acts without remorse. 5. Media and culture: In the world of \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" the arts and media often glorify violence and sexual content. This glorification may contribute to Alex's desensitization and eagerness to participate in violent and sexually aggressive behavior. In summary, Alex DeLarge's inclination towards violence and sexual imagery stems from a combination of his sociopathic personality, upbringing, influence of his peers, the dystopian society he lives in, and the media and culture that surround him."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The soldiers were on the run and in danger, they entered a building to hold up but first they had to make sure it was what?

Tensions soon began to emerge between the Estates Company and Stretford Council over the provision of local services and infrastructure. In 1902, W. T.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Why was RealClearPolitics involved? - not enough information - analysts are a key indicator of Republican strength heading into midterms - analysts are a key indicator of party strength heading into midterms - analysts are a key indicator of Democratic strength heading into midterms A:","output":"RealClearPolitics was involved as it is a non-partisan political news and polling data aggregator.

The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston).

Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited...

He is first seen taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a kickboxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him.

At the train's stop, John rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river towards the Burma border. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the Thai authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter.

This research will help me understand the trends and issues that are currently relevant to the chosen topic. Step 3: Generate a context With the necessary research and information gathered, I can now generate a context that relates to social media usage. To make it specific, I will focus on mental health and well-being. Context: Studies have shown that increased social media usage is associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Many researchers believe that the constant comparison to others on social media platforms and the increased frequency of negative interactions can contribute to a decline in mental well-being. Step 4: Identify a research question or problem within the context Within the context I just generated, I need to identify a specific research question or problem that a hypothesis could potentially address. Research Question: How does limiting daily social media usage impact mental health and well-being in adults? Step 5: Develop a hypothesis based on the research question Now that a research question has been identified, I can create a hypothesis that reflects a possible answer to the question, which is subject to testing and verification. Hypothesis: By limiting daily social media usage to one hour or less, adults will experience a significant improvement in their mental health and well-being. In conclusion, the context for this task is about the relationship between increased social media usage and mental health issues in adults, and the hypothesis suggests that limiting daily social media usage could result in improved mental health and well-being."},{"instruction":"Rating is available when the video has been rented.

As CBS2’s Scott Rapoport reported, police said the a man sporting a long beard and wearing all black went up to the guard at 6:15 p.m. this past Friday to tell him about the painting. The 46-year-old guard told the man not to touch the artwork and advised him to inform the staff at the information desk, police said. As the guard turned to walk away, the man smashed a glass bottle on the back of his head and shouted, “Do your job!” according to police. “Oh, really?” said museum visitor Jonah Diaz. “Wow, that’s ridiculous.” “It’s very sad and unfortunate,” said museum visitor Carrie Pozum. “I mean, this should just be a safe place to go and enjoy the art.” The suspect apparently cut his hand on the broken bottle, leaving a trail of blood through two galleries. Police followed the trail out the building, but were unable to find the suspect. The victim was treated at a hospital for a cut to his head. “It’s just terrible that that would have happened to somebody who’s just here doing their job,” said museum visitor Jenny McArdle, The suspect is described by police as a white male, 20 to 25 years old, standing 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing about 150 pounds. Late Monday afternoon, the Met Museum released a statement reading: “The safety of our staff and visitors is our number one priority. We are grateful for the professionalism of our security team, and are working in coordination with the NYPD on this incident.

When Google first went public in August 2004 with a market cap of about 23 billion, the company was known almost exclusively for its search engine. Gmail was just a few months old, Android was still its own startup, and Chrome had yet to be invented, to say nothing of Google’s more outlandish bets, such as building self-driving cars and solving death. Google’s search business remains a money-driver, now powering Alphabet’s many other initiatives. The restructuring offers some more transparency about the company, with the performance of Google itself broken out separately from things like smart thermostat maker Nest and idea incubator Google X. Investors have rewarded this additional transparency by adding an additional 100 billion to Alphabet’s market cap since the restructuring was announced in August 2015. Back when Google first went public, Apple was worth less than half of the search company. The struggling hardware maker was still expanding its one very successful product line: The iPod. The iPhone, which now drives the lion’s share of Apple’s revenue, was three years away. A year later, investors already seem to have forgotten why they used to love Apple. Some are worried that iPhone sales will slow as the smartphone market reaches maturity, while calls for the company to come up with another revolutionary product continue unabated. Apple’s market cap is now down more than 30% from its all-time high. Apple wouldn’t pass Google in market valuation until 2008. But from there the company reached never-before-seen heights, becoming the first 700 billion company early in 2015. Will Alphabet’s valuation continue to rise, or will it face a downturn similar to Apple’s? That will depend on two key factors. First, the Google part of Alphabet, which includes Google.com, YouTube and Android, must maintain its dominance of search and online video even as a host of younger competitors vie to control users’ time on mobile. Facebook, Snapchat and others threaten not only YouTube’s control of video but Google’s broader role as the gateway to information on the Internet. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s less mature businesses, which it has lumped together as “Other Bets,” will eventually have to prove they can be developed into moneymakers. For now, investors are patient. “Other Bets” lost a whopping 3.6 billion in 2015, but the success of Google’s core business still sent the company’s shares soaring after Monday’s earnings. But as Apple’s ongoing stock collapse shows, Wall Street will only wait so long for the next big thing. Write a title for it.","output":"Alphabet Surpasses Apple in Market Capitalization as Diversified Business Continues to Thrive"},{"instruction":"By Robert Trigaux, Times Business Columnist In Print: Thursday, March 8, 2012 Fifteen years ago and still in her 20s, Clearwater native Sara Blakely had an idea for a line of pantyhose that smoothed her clothes but left legs and feet bare for open shoes. Who knew that concept would transform her into the world's youngest self-made female billionaire? Forbes magazine so anointed her Wednesday in publishing its annual list of the world's billionaires. Blakely is not only on that list but on Forbes' cover. \\"I can't hear that I am on that list without laughing,\\" Blakely said in a phone interview from New York City. \\"I can't help but think of the days when my job was to cold call people in Clearwater to try and sell them fax machines and how many of them said 'No, no, no.' \\" When Blakely sought a patent attorney in the late 1990s to help copyright her idea for a product saucily called Spanx, he scoffed, asking \\"Am I on Candid Camera?\\" \\"For the first year, everyone was telling me I was crazy,\\" Blakely said. Now everyone's telling her she's rich. Crazy rich. Blakely, now 41, is the sole owner of her private, debt-free Spanx shapewear company in Atlanta. Forbes credits Blakely's shapewear company for \\"reinventing the girdle.\\" The youngest woman to join this year's list without help from a husband or an inheritance, Blakely is now part of a tiny, elite club of American women worth 10 figures on their own. Among them: TV phenom Oprah Winfrey (2.7 billion) and current HP (and former eBay) CEO Meg Whitman (1.4 billion). On Wednesday, Spanx public relations' team was inundated with media calls for Blakely. She wrapped up a BBC interview before calling me at her hometown paper. She is scheduled to appear Thursday morning live on both CBS' This Morning and ABC's Good Morning America. An interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC's World News will be broadcast Friday, she said. Hitting 1 billion in net worth seems to be the entry fee to a new level of fame. Years before Spanx, Blakely graduated from Clearwater High School and then Florida State University in 1993. She considered going to law school but instead drove to Disney and tried out to be Goofy. She was 2 inches short of the 5-foot-8 height requirement. Then she worked seven years for Tampa office equipment firm Danka Business Systems. It was a \\"humbling experience\\" that Blakely says helped toughen her sales skills and laid a foundation for the success of Spanx. \\"I was given four ZIP codes in Clearwater and a cubicle and told to sell 20,000 worth of fax machines a month,\\" she recalled. That, plus a standup comedy hobby that she used to market the Spanx name in funny ways, would help get her business off the ground. Blakely was transferred to Atlanta — Tampa Bay's big loss, in hindsight — where the Spanx firm would later be founded. Now the Spanx line of 200 different body-shaping undergarments can be found in 35 countries and stores ranging from Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom to Saks Fifth Avenue and the Sports Authority. (There's also a line of Spanx for men.) Blakely is one of 1,226 billionaires on this year's global list. She just squeezed on to the rankings along with 73 others with a net worth of 1 billion. Blakely lives with her husband and son in Atlanta but also owns a home in La Jolla, Calif., and a Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. Blakely bought property last year on Clearwater Beach for a future home so that she can be near her mother and grandmother, as well as many childhood friends. \\"There's still a close-knit network of friends there for me, but we never talk about money,\\" she said. \\"When they see the Forbes story, they're going to say 'Oh my God.' \\" Did Blakely even realize she was a billionaire before Forbes told her? Yes, she said. \\"But Forbes putting it on paper makes it more real.\\" This is probably the start of something new. We're going to see a lot more women entrepreneurs on the Forbes billionaire lists in the coming years. Blakely wants to help nurture that trend. Her advice to young women with an entrepreneurial itch? \\"Trust your gut,\\" she said. Blakely purposely did not tell anyone about her initial legless pantyhose idea for an entire year because she did not want to have to defend it or be talked out of it. It took two years just to persuade a hosiery mill to even make an initial run of her product. That, she said, is one reason Spanx exists. \\"Don't be intimidated by what you don't know,\\" she counsels. \\"That can be your greatest strength and ensure that you do things differently from everyone else.\\" This isn't the last we've heard of Sara Blakely. Her humor-tinged biography on the Spanx website may say it best: \\"Putting her butt on the line pays off!\\" Contact Robert Trigaux at trigaux@tampabay.com. ||||| This story appears on the Mar. 26, 2012 cover of Forbes as 'American Booty'. Sara Blakely stands topless at a conference room table. It’s Monday morning at the Spanx headquarters in Atlanta, and the founder of the hosiery company has been in a product development meeting for all of five minutes before walking out abruptly. She returns a minute later in nothing but a lacy taupe bra with black pants and beige wedges and adjusts herself in a full-length mirror, worrying aloud about the metal clasps on this early prototype. Will they create lumps under her clothes? Her CEO, Laurie Ann Goldman — petite and glamorous in a leopard print shift dress — tugs on Blakely’s straps. The conference room looks like a boudoir designed by Willy Wonka: a jar of gum balls here, a loud houndstooth print there. Blakely hardly blinks in the presence of five colleagues and me as she removes the bra and tries on a second prototype. She’s been getting half-naked in public for the last decade, controlling every detail of the new category in women’s retail—shapewear—that she created from a one-product wonder sold out of her apartment. Today Spanx is to slimming undergarments what Kleenex is to tissues: a brand that stands for the category. It nets an estimated 20% on revenue just south of 250 million. In recent months four Wall Street investment banks separately valued Spanx at an average 1 billion, a sum Forbes corroborated with the help of industry analysts. Blakely owns 100% of the private company, has zero debt, has never taken outside investment and hasn’t spent a nickel on advertising. At 41 she’s the youngest woman to join this year’s World’s Billionaires list without help from a husband or an inheritance. She is part of a tiny, elite club of American women worth ten figures on their own, including Oprah Winfrey and Meg Whitman. Lots of women, from Betty Grable to Kim Kardashian, have put their butts on the line to plump their profiles and profits. Far fewer have had to overcome three phobias—fear of heights, fear of flying and stage fright—to master the art of selling. Blakely is on the road “always,” she says. She feels dizzy in tall buildings (it doesn’t help to have a Manhattan condo on the 37th floor) and often cries in midair. She’s unwilling to board a plane without her iPod, so she can play the same Mark Knopfler song, “What It Is,” at every takeoff. “I have sweaty palms, panic attacks, my heart’s racing,” says Blakely, whose Floridian roots you occasionally hear in her “Ah” for “I.” She once had to muster the courage to hawk her wares 6 to 12 times a month on home shopping channel QVC; now that Spanx is so well-known, it’s maybe once a month but for hours at a time. Blakely had early practice wrestling with anxiety when she occasionally did standup comedy. “Every time I went onstage I was so terrified I almost threw up,” she recalls. “I learned why they call it the greenroom.” Spanx started as a one-woman show. In her first year Blakely shilled her new invention from a folding table in the foyer of Neiman Marcus, with a giant before-and-after photo of her derriere in cream slacks and bikini briefs underneath in one shot (an embarrassingly obvious Maginot Line) and 30 Spanx Power Panties (et voilà! no more line) in the other. Over the last couple of years Spanx has depended less on Blakely’s face—and other body parts—to shift its shapers and stay ahead of a handful of copycats. The company is now run by a team of 125, only 16 of them men. It sells 200 products in 11,500 department stores, boutiques and online shops in 40 countries. Distributors worldwide clamor to get on the stockist list. “With international, we’re just warming up,” says Goldman. Blakely would still happily pose in nothing but Spanx on the cover of any of the nine catalogs mailed each year to 6 million shoppers, but she knows Goldman, 49, won’t go for it. “I’m game for anything,” says Blakely. “The company has to pull me back.” Goldman, who created the first business plan at Spanx over the founder’s objections that it would stunt creativity, plays the straight man to Blakely’s more impulsive act. Fueling her more impetuous side is her entrepreneurial twin: husband Jesse Itzler, 43, a former rapper from Long Island, who has backed and cofounded a few startups, including Marquis Jet, which sells fractional air-travel time. When I meet him at his midtown Manhattan office, he bounds up the stairs in a sweaty headband, his blond curls dripping. He’s come from an intense cardio workout with a Navy SEAL he hired to move in with him and Sara for a month. (This is more efficient than hiring rickshaws from his office, as he used to do, and paying the driver to be a passenger while he hauled the vehicle all the way home.) Itzler regards Blakely’s accomplishments with amazement and amusement. “She’s 50% Lucille Ball, 50% Einstein. I keep a list of Sara-isms in my phone,” he says, referring to her goofy moments. “There’s something every day.” Recent example: wearing two different shoes, one red-soled Christian Louboutin and one plain boot, and having to hobble up the escalator at Bloomingdale’s. Legend: On the way to the Screen Actors Guild Awards one year, Blakely realized in the limo she’d forgotten her jewelry at her hotel. Instead of turning back, she had her driver stop at a candy store—and accessorized her gown with stretchable candy necklaces and bracelets. Spanx fans recognize her on the street, in stores and in airports and want to show their allegiance. “Women flash her,” says Itzler. “Imagine that. She’s just really good. She’s the best, man.” *** Blakely didn't set out to invent anything, but she always had a knack for hucksterism. The daughter of a personal injury lawyer and an artist, she grew up in the beach town of Clearwater, Fla., always looking to make a buck. She’d set up a haunted house at Halloween and charge her neighbors admission. Or, tearing a page from Tom Sawyer, she’d trick her friends into doing her chores by turning weedpulling into a competition. As a teen she pulled off a rare double act: popular blonde cheerleader and debate team champion (no performance anxiety then). But tragedy eclipsed her sunny childhood. While riding a bike around her cul-de-sac, she saw a car run over her best friend, right in front of her. “I think that when you witness death at age 16, there’s a sense of urgency about life,” she says. “The thought of my mortality—I think about it a lot. I find it motivating. It can be any time that your number’s up.” That same year Blakely’s parents separated. Not long afterward, both her prom dates died in horrible circumstances. She sought solace in her father’s Wayne Dyer cassette tapes, memorizing all ten volumes of the motivational speaker’s How to Be a No-Limit Person series. Dyer preaches “self-actualization” and “eliminating your erroneous zones.” She was so moved that she marched to her principal’s office to suggest they include the cassette tapes in the Clearwater High curriculum. Her friends couldn’t run the other way fast enough. “People used to fight over who had to ride home with me at night after a party,” says Blakely. “No one wanted to be in my car—they’d be, like, ‘No! She’s going to make us listen to that motivational crap!’” Blakely started her first business in 1990, a kids’ club at the Clearwater Beach Hilton, charging 8 a child for a few hours of babysitting while moms and dads tanned. She was just out of high school, had no experience, no CPR training — and no insurance. She got away with it for three summers before trying to steal business from rival hotels’ summer programs. It was only when she went to pitch the Hilton’s general manager— age 20, in her first suit from Casual Corner—that she was busted. “He literally escorted me off the premises,” Blakely remembers. After getting a degree in legal communications at Florida State, Blakely twice took the LSAT exam for law school admission and twice scored abysmally. Frustrated, she drove from Clearwater to Orlando to audition for a job at Disney World. Two inches too short to fill the 5-foot-8 Goofy costume, she instead spent eight hours a day on a moving walkway buckling visitors into their seats at Epcot’s now closed World of Motion ride. “I think I wanted to postpone reality, having spent my whole life thinking I’d be a lawyer,” says Blakely, who as a kid loved watching her dad in court. “It didn’t work. My first day at Disney I went on break and saw Snow White dragging on a cigarette.” After three months of misery at Disney, Blakely applied for a job she’d seen advertised on a billboard. She spent the next seven years at Danka, then a 1 billion Florida-based office supply company, now part of Japanese printer giant Ricoh. It taught her the art of the cold call. “They gave me a cubicle, a phone book and a territory of four zip codes in Clearwater and said, ‘Now go sell 20,000 of fax machines a month door-to- door,’” she recalls. Blakely again found herself being escorted out of buildings. “I’d get business cards ripped up in my face because I was soliciting.” But with her easy charm, good looks and slick debating skills, she became, at age 25, Danka’s national sales trainer. *** Like many startups, Spanx began life as an answer to an irritating problem. The panty hose Blakely was forced to wear at both Disney and Danka were uncomfortable and old-fashioned. “It’s Florida, it’s hot, I was carrying fax machines,” she says. She hated the way the seamed foot stuck out of an open-toe sandal or kitten heel. But she noticed that the control-top eliminated panty lines and made her tiny body look even firmer. She’d bought a new pair of cream slacks for 78 at Arden B and was keen to wear them to a party. “I cut the feet off my pantyhose and wore them underneath,” she says. “But they rolled up my legs all night. I remember thinking, ‘I’ve got to figure out how to make this.’ I’d never worked in fashion or retail. I just needed an undergarment that didn’t exist.” Blakely, then 27, moved to Atlanta, set aside her entire 5,000 savings and spent the next two years meticulously planning the launch of her product while working nine to five at Danka. She spent seven nights straight at the Georgia Tech library researching every hosiery patent ever filed. She visited craft stores like Michaels to find the right fabrics. She sought out hosiery mills in the Yellow Pages and started cold calling, only to be told no repeatedly. Immune to rejection thanks to years selling door-to-door, she decided just to show up. At the Highland Mills hosiery factory in Charlotte, N.C., she was turned away, only to receive a call from the manager two weeks later. He had daughters, he told her, who wouldn’t let him pass up her invention. (Today the Spanx line is manufactured in 15 countries, including Thailand, Israel and Honduras; the cotton crotches are still hand-sewn in North Carolina.) To save 3,000 in legal fees she wrote her own patent from a Barnes & Noble textbook, setting aside 150 to incorporate her company, but couldn’t decide on a name. After a succession of terrible ideas she settled on Spanks, substituting an “x” at the last minute after reading that made-up names sold better. “The word ‘Spanx’ was funny,” she says. “It made people laugh. No one ever forgot it.” In the summer of 2000 she spent evenings on a friend’s computer designing her packaging. She went for cherry red and, with the help of a graphic artist, created a blonde cartoon model with a long ponytail called Sunny—Sara’s animated alter ego. Blakely flew to Dallas that fall to meet with buyers from Neiman Marcus. Current CEO Karen Katz was president of all the upscale chain’s stores at the time and remembers seeing Blakely in a conference room, pitching. “Sara’s effort was to solve an age-old problem for women in a modern way,” Katz says. She adds that Blakely’s obvious charisma and unusual backstory didn’t hurt. “We were smitten from the beginning.” With Neiman in the bag, Blakely convinced Bloomingdale’s, Saks and Bergdorf Goodman to give her a shot. Blakely was still working her day job at Danka, keeping her side business top secret, sitting up all night shoving Spanx orders into white padded envelopes from Office Depot. She was 24/7 customer service, answering phone calls from her bathtub or bed. Her then boyfriend quit his job and took care of shipping and handling. Unable to shell out for advertising, Blakely took on marketing and p.r. She tore out journalists’ bylines from magazines and called them. She took over morning staff meetings at department stores to show sales associates why Spanx shouldn’t languish in the beige hinterland of the hosiery floor but be sold alongside womenswear and shoes. If that didn’t work, she improvised, once sneaking some red Spanx packages onto a rack she bought at Target and placing them by a cash register in Neiman. “All the staff assumed someone else had approved it, until they caught me on CCTV,” she laughs. She connived her way to her biggest coup, shipping samples to Oprah Winfrey’s longtime stylist Andre Walker, who noticed the talk-show host started looking ten pounds lighter. In November 2000 Winfrey named Spanx her favorite product of the year on the annual audience scream-a-thon that was her Favorite Things Show. When Blakely got the call from Harpo Productions, she was warned to get her website ready, since orders would undoubtedly cascade after the show. Spanx didn’t have a website. “We took a color copy of the packaging and scanned it in,” Blakely says. “I ran a considerable Web business for 18 a month.” She resigned from Danka two weeks before the show aired. Spanx was profitable from day one, and raked in 4 million its first year and 10 million the next. For the next two years Blakely constantly traveled to do in-store demos and local news appearances. In 2001 she scored a coveted deal with QVC, which turned her down until it read a Forbes story (“Footless and Fancy-Free,” Apr. 2, 2001) that described Blakely as an “accidental entrepreneur” who’d reinvented the girdle. So what if Spanx took the high road (Bergdorf ) and the low (QVC) at once? Women were buying like mad. “Sara was out there shaking her butt and selling her product,” says Goldman in her office, next door to Blakely’s and furnished like an Upper East Side living room—velvet fittings, monogrammed Louis Vuitton trunks. Goldman, a ten-year veteran of Coca-Cola, where she ran the licensing division in 54 countries, came on board in 2002, first as a consultant, then as CEO. She was Spanx’s fifth employee. Her office was the kitchen in Blakely’s apartment in Decatur, but she knew that wouldn’t be the case for long. “I wanted to run Spanx like a public company from the start. I thought, Let’s get Ernst & Young to do our audits. They didn’t really do companies our size, but I said we were going to be bigger one day. We did the same with IT.” As Goldman set about professionalizing the company, Blakely found a publicity stunt she couldn’t pass up. After six auditions she was cast on Richard Branson’s 2003 reality show, Rebel Billionaire, which aired on Fox in 2004. Her lawyers (and her dad) begged her not to do it. But Blakely says she wanted to meet and learn from the Virgin mogul. Branson saw it as another sign of her p.r. savvy. “She was already reasonably successful before, and she cleverly thought the show would help,” he says. Leaving Spanx in Goldman’s hands for three months, Blakely won task after task—shocking her teammates and the crew. “I was cast as the girl who’d have the meltdown from heights on the first episode and lose her mind,” she says. Blakely followed daredevil Branson up the side of a moving hot air balloon at 8,000 feet, climbing a rope ladder the equivalent of a 17-story building. She’d be a world record holder if she’d remembered to call Guinness afterward. “Sara was the runner-up overall,” says Branson. “The only reason I didn’t give her the top prize was because she was already successful. She didn’t need a leg up.” Instead, Branson cut her a personal check for 750,000 to start a foundation. To date Blakely and Spanx have donated 17.5 million to charities primarily aimed at supporting girls and women—college scholarships in South Africa, homes for single mothers and their families (via Habitat for Humanity) and empowerment grants supporting entrepreneurship among them. “Isn't my wife delicious?” Itzler asks aloud in an Atlanta restaurant, while gripping her thigh under the table. He’s flown in from New York for one day to watch Blakely speak to a group of jobless women seeking inspiration. With six homes—two in Atlanta, an Upper West Side condo in Manhattan, a Connecticut summer house, an outpost near Blakely’s brother in La Jolla, Calif. and a new place in Clearwater—he and his wife often miss each other. One of them usually has in tow their 2-year-old son, Lazer, named after Itzler’s Brooklyn-born greatgrandfather. Blakely and Itzler met six years ago through Marquis Jet, an offshoot of NetJets. He’d come up with the idea of allowing travelers to buy time on private planes at age 27, after a few years in L.A. rapping (biggest hit: “Shake It Like a White Girl”) and writing sports jingles, including the NBA’s Knicks anthem “Go New York Go.” In 2006, when he planned a celebrity poker tournament, a sales rep suggested he invite Blakely, who by then was successful (and brave) enough to fly on private planes. Itzler had never heard of Spanx and Googled Blakely’s picture, thinking, “Yeah, she can come. Top of the list.” Each was hooked, even though both were attached to other people. They married in 2008 in Boca Grande, Fla. in front of Blakely’s early Spanx employees and Itzler’s friends from his years in the music and sports industries. “We had very successful people and, like, thugs,” he says. Blakely had a moment of panic weeks before the wedding. She sat Itzler down at a favorite Upper West Side restaurant and told him the secret only her immediate family knew: just how rich she was. “She said to me, ‘I’m not sure you really know how successful Spanx is—[and] I am.’” Blakely told him the company pulled in not a couple of million dollars a year but a couple of hundred million. Itzler started crying. “I was just so happy for her.” Itzler himself isn’t exactly poor. In 2010 he sold Marquis to Berkshire Hathaway, which owns NetJets, for an undisclosed amount. He now owns a stake in Zico, a trendy coconut water brand (Coca-Cola has 20%), as well as Voli, a low-calorie vodka, and Sheets, a caffeinated version of Listerine’s strip that dissolves on the tongue—all held through his 100 Mile Group, an incubator and marketing company. Investors in various projects include friends LeBron James and Gisele Bündchen. Blakely has strong views about her wealth. “I feel like money makes you more of who you already are,” she says from behind a mirrored desk in her plush Atlanta office, stirring a bowl of take-out soup and exhausted from a sleepless, flu-ridden night. “If you’re an asshole, you become a bigger asshole. If you’re nice, you become nicer. Money is fun to make, fun to spend and fun to give away.” Most fun: anonymously buying dinner for an entire restaurant crowd at her favorite Japanese steak house in Atlanta or bidding on travel “experiences” like VIP trips to Paris Fashion Week and Sundance at the charity auctions she and Itzler attend. Coming off its best year ever, Spanx has big plans for expansion. Goldman is pushing to double international sales, now over 15% of the total, within three years. She spends a lot of time jetting around Asia, laying the groundwork for Spanx in countries that don’t obsess about their posteriors quite as much as Westerners do. She and Blakely plan to open stand-alone shops, first in Atlanta, then slowly worldwide. They’re pushing their cheaper diffusion line, Assets, and adding new categories— swimwear, activewear, men’s underwear—as customers demand more options and competitors like Yummie Tummie, Dr. Rey Shapewear, Skweez Couture and Body Wrap (as well as Victoria’s Secret and Maidenform) flood the booming shapewear market. Spanx is often the most expensive brand on the shapewear rack, but it hasn’t hurt sales. “If you have a great product, you can charge whatever you want,” says Noah Wrubel, CEO of lingerie site BareNecessities.com. “I as a retailer have no interest in a race to the bottom. Anyone can make a cheaper product.” Blakely can afford to fund Spanx’s planned growth, but she and Goldman might, for the first time, consider a public offering or an injection of outside capital to speed things up. “We’ve been approached consistently from day one, and it was never something I entertained,” Blakely says. “Now, for the first time, I may entertain it.” She still gets teary-eyed whenever she rides up the escalator in Bloomingdale’s to see the Spanx shop that opened last spring. “I have to pinch myself,” she says, hobbling in her different shoes, greeting shop assistants and adoring customers who recognize her from years of TV appearances. “Five grand,” she says, thinking back a decade. “Good investment.” ||||| A product promising to help people look thin has given its inventor a big fat wallet. Thanks to her ingenious idea to combine insecurity, enormous underpants, and elastic sausage casings, Sara Blakely, the forty-one-year-old inventor of Spanx, is now the world's youngest female self-made billionaire. Forbes magazine's annual billionaire issue features Blakely on the cover and an interview with the entrepreneur inside. According to the publication, the fact that she made her money without the help of a husband or an inheritance puts her in an elite group of dizzyingly rich ladies that includes Oprah Winfrey and Meg Whitman. But Blakely's life wasn't always legless panty hose and dollar signs; after graduating from Florida State University in 1993, her early post collegiate career was characterized by heartbreak and ennui. Her first big adult disappointment came at the cruel white gloved hands of Mickey Mouse himself, as her dreams to play Goofy at Walt Disney World were dashed when she was told that, at 5'6\\", she was two inches too short. From there, she went on to work for a company that sounds a lot like Dunder Mifflin of The Office fame, cold calling Clearwater, Florida area businesses and attempting to sell them fax machines. She worked there for seven years. During her tenure as a fax flinger, she had an idea that would end up making her a very, very wealthy woman — the stretchy, shaping thighs and legs of nylons, but without the attached stockings. She didn't tell anyone about her billion dollar idea for a year after it first occurred to her because she didn't want to be pooh-poohed out of it by naysayers, and when she approached a patent attorney, he asked her if he was on Candid Camera. It took her two years to convince a factory to manufacture a run of her shapewear. But Blakely was undaunted. Now, for better or worse, the retooled girdle of the twenty-first century is now available in 35 countries and in 200 varieties. Blakely says that she hopes young female entrepreneurs with a big idea and a whole lot of pluck refuse to be intimidated by what they don't know. Not knowing how things work, she reasons, can lead people to do things differently. And that can pay off.

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Now, I have a new situation: Seattle produces a large amount of their electricity by burning fossil fuels due to the large presence of natural coal in the state. Montreal, on the other hand, produces a large percentage of their electricity through the use of nuclear fission thanks to the large number of nuclear power pants in that state.

That's why he never remembered his own phone number, which was in the phone book. He knew what was worth remembering. It is true that if we are going to do great things in our lives, we can not waste our time. Einstein liked to joke too.

This decision has substantial implications for the long-standing dispute between Google and various corporations concerning the use of trademarks in online advertising. The crux of the conflict lies in Google's AdWords program, which allows advertisers to bid on keywords to have their sponsored links appear on search results pages. Often, companies would purchase competitors' trademarks as keywords in an attempt to drive traffic to their own websites. This practice sparked contentious debate, as trademark owners argued that Google's advertising policy facilitated the infringement of their intellectual property rights. The opponents alleged that such infringements misled consumers and created brand confusion, which could ultimately be detrimental to the trademark owner's reputation and goodwill. Consequently, several lawsuits were filed against Google, asserting that its advertising policy violated federal trademark laws by enabling trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising. Nevertheless, the federal judge's ruling has affirmed that Google's advertising policy complies with federal trademark laws. It is important to analyze the key points and reasoning behind this decision, as it paves the way for future cases in the realm of online advertising. First, the judge highlighted that Google's keyword advertising does not cause actual confusion among consumers. The majority of users are aware of the distinction between organic search results and sponsored ads, understanding that the appearance of a competitor's ad does not denote an affiliation between the companies. This awareness reduces the likelihood of brand confusion and maintains the integrity of trademark rights. Secondly, the court recognized that trademark laws were not intended to monopolize language. By allowing advertisers to bid on trademarks as keywords, Google is promoting competition and innovation in the market. Imposing restrictions on using trademarked terms may result in unwanted consequences, such as limiting consumer choices and stifling economic growth. Lastly, the court acknowledged that Google's advertising policy provides safeguards that prevent misleading or inappropriate ads from being displayed. The company consistently reviews and removes advertisements that violate its policies and infringe on trademarks. This measure ensures a balance between freedom of expression and protection of intellectual property rights. In conclusion, Google's victory in this lawsuit is a decisive turning point for the search engine, its advertisers, and other online platforms. The federal judge's ruling has established a precedent that bolsters the legality of keyword advertising, while also taking into consideration the importance of promoting fair competition and innovation. This landmark decision serves as a crucial step in clarifying the intricate relationship between the internet and intellectual property rights, which will heavily influence future advancements in technology and law."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What's the full name of the person posing as a milkman? , can you please find it?

This transformation can be observed through the following milestones: 1. Emergence of shorter, black-and-white daily strips: During the early 1900s, newspapers began featuring shorter comic strips that appeared daily, as opposed to their lengthier, full-color predecessors that were typically published once a week. 2. Success of Mutt and Jeff: In 1907, Bud Fisher's popular comic strip, Mutt and Jeff, set a successful precedent for the daily format and humorous stories. This success encouraged other newspapers to follow suit and incorporate similar content. 3. Shift towards adventure and drama genres: In the 1920s and 1930s, comic strips in newspapers began exploring various narrative-driven genres, including adventure and drama. These genres featuring continuing stories gained popularity among readers, providing a more diverse range of content for newspapers. 4. Introduction of comic books: Thin periodicals known as comic books emerged during the 1930s. Initially, these books reprinted popular newspaper comic strips, but by the end of the decade, original content started to dominate the comic book industry. 5. Golden Age of Comic Books: The late 1930s marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books, a period characterized by the widespread popularity of superhero content. The success of Action Comics and its lead hero, Superman, in 1938 solidified the superhero genre as a prominent and defining aspect of comic book culture. In conclusion, newspapers changed their comic content over time by introducing shorter, daily comic strips, diversifying comic genres, and inspiring the invention of comic books.

Question: The city's community garden was demolished for yet another what? Options: A. wasteland B. ocean C. desert D. parking lot E. flowers A:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the options and think of the context. The question is about a city's community garden being demolished for something else. Step 2: Rule out options that don't make sense in a city context. - Option A (wasteland) is not likely in a city setting. - Option B (ocean) is impossible since oceans can't be created by demolishing a garden. - Option C (desert) is not possible since deserts are natural formations and can't be created in a city by demolishing a garden. Step 3: Among the remaining options, which are D (parking lot) and E (flowers), think about the more common reason for demolishing a garden. Option D (parking lot) seems more probable as it aligns with the urban development context in which a community garden could be replaced by something more practical. In contrast, demolishing a garden just to plant other flowers (Option E) would not be in line with common sense. Therefore, I choose Option D (parking lot) as the answer."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which region had more species go extinct? Italy had two distinct regions. Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. Hint: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's follow these steps: 1. Understand the information given: We are comparing extinction rates for two regions in Italy – Northern region with high abiotic stress and Southern region with low abiotic stress. 2. Analyze the hint given: As abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. More species are likely to become endangered or extinct in regions of higher abiotic stress. 3. Using the provided information and hint, we deduce that the Northern region, where animals are exposed to a higher level of abiotic stress, had more species go extinct compared to the Southern region. Answer: The Northern region had more species go extinct."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: If \\"The man in the blue jeans is trying to kick another man.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A man trying to kick another man.\\"? Choices: (i). yes; (ii). it is not possible to tell; (iii). no;","output":"(i). Yes The statement \\"The man in the blue jeans is trying to kick another man\\" inherently implies that there is a man who is performing an action on another man – specifically, kicking or attempting to kick. We can examine this statement in greater detail to understand the logical connections present: 1. First, there is a clear mention of \\"the man in the blue jeans,\\" which means there is at least one person involved in this scenario. This individual is described as wearing blue jeans, which pertain to the appearance and can denote that he can be easily identified as the one trying to kick. 2. Secondly, the statement highlights that this man is \\"trying to kick another man.\\" Here, the phrase \\"another man\\" implies the existence of a second individual. Thus, we have two people in this scenario. 3. Furthermore, the action being performed is \\"trying to kick.\\" This means that the man in the blue jeans is in the process of attempting to initiate a kicking action towards the second man. Considering these aspects of the statement, it reasonably and logically follows that the summary \\"A man trying to kick another man\\" is an accurate representation of the given scenario. This simplified statement still conveys the main action and the two people involved: one person attempting to kick, and another person being the target of the kick.

On useita syitä, miksi Euroopan unionin on tärkeää säilyttää houkuttelevuutensa Ukrainaa kohtaan. Ensinnäkin, se osoittaa EU:n sitoutumisen ajaa demokraattisia arvoja ja ihmisoikeuksia, sekä edistää taloudellista yhteistyötä ja vakautta alueella. Toiseksi, se voi toimia vastapainona Venäjän vaikutusvallalle alueella ja siten tukea alueellista tasapainoa ja turvallisuutta. Kolmanneksi, yhteistyön syventäminen Euroopan unionin kanssa voi auttaa Ukrainaa toteuttamaan tarvittavia uudistuksia ja parantamaan maan elintasoa. Euroopan unionilla on monia eri keinoja, joita se voi käyttää houkutellakseen Ukrainan. Yksi esimerkki ovat taloudelliset kannustimet, kuten tuet, lainat ja investoinnit, jotka voivat auttaa Ukrainan taloutta kehittymään ja integroitumaan paremmin Euroopan markkinoille. Myös kauppapolitiikka on tärkeä väline, jota EU voi käyttää parantaakseen Ukrainan taloudellisia näkymiä ja löytää uusia markkinamahdollisuuksia ukrainalaisille tuotteille ja palveluille. Lisäksi Euroopan unioni voi tarjota teknistä apua ja asiantuntijatukea Ukrainan uudistusprosessissa. Tämä voi sisältää tietotaidon jakamisen, koulutusohjelmien järjestämisen ja erilaisten yhteistyöhankkeiden toteuttamisen, jotka auttavat Ukrainaa rakentamaan tehokkaamman hallinnon ja parantamaan oikeusvaltion periaatteiden toteuttamista. Kansalaisyhteiskunnan tukeminen ja kansalaisjärjestöjen roolin vahvistaminen voi myös olla hyödyllinen tapa edistää demokratiaa ja ihmisoikeuksia Ukrainassa. Kulttuurivaihto ja opiskelijavaihto-ohjelmat ovat muita keinoja, joilla EU voi vahvistaa siteitään Ukrainaan ja lisätä molemminpuolista ymmärrystä. Tällaiset ohjelmat voivat auttaa luomaan myönteisiä käsityksiä Euroopan unionista ja sen jäsenmaista ukrainalaisten keskuudessa, mikä puolestaan voi lisätä heidän halukkuuttaan tiivistää yhteistyötä EU:n kanssa.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Normally, when you think about humans and their ability to breathe, we must consider the biological limitations of our respiratory system. Unlike fish, humans do not have gills, which are specialized organs designed to extract oxygen from water. Our lungs are designed to extract oxygen from the air, making our respiratory system ill-equipped for underwater breathing. Moreover, the human body requires a certain concentration of oxygen in order to maintain proper function. The amount of oxygen dissolved in water is significantly lower than that in air, making it impossible for humans to extract enough oxygen from water to meet their needs. In addition, the act of actually extracting the oxygen from the water would require immense amounts of energy, making it even more unsustainable for a human to attempt. There are, of course, technological solutions, such as scuba diving gear, that allow humans to breathe underwater. But these devices rely on carrying a supply of compressed air or an artificial oxygen source and cannot be considered natural or \\"without external assistance.\\" Given the limitations of the human respiratory system, the energy required to extract oxygen from water, and the low concentration of oxygen in water compared to air, the answer to the question, \\"Is it possible for humans to breathe underwater without any external assistance?\\" is no."},{"instruction":"Aishihik Lake - Aishihik Lake is a lake of Yukon Canada.

Translate to English","output":"As for the reasons for exclusion from the standard, an incomplete and unrefined specification, excessive complexity, and lack of necessary testing in real-life conditions are cited. The phrase in question refers to certain factors that may result in a particular feature, technique, or protocol being excluded from becoming a part of an officially accepted standard. An officially accepted standard is a set of rules, guidelines, and requirements that are commonly followed in various industries to ensure consistency, reliability, and compatibility. Firstly, an incomplete and unrefined specification implies that the described concept or technology has not been thoroughly defined or elaborated in terms of functionality, requirements, or specific details. This means that further work and development are required before it can be considered for inclusion in the standard. Including a poorly-defined feature within a standard may lead to confusion and inconsistencies in the implementation of the technology. Secondly, excessive complexity refers to the unnecessary complication of processes, algorithms, or systems, making them difficult to understand, implement, and maintain. Complexity itself is not always a negative aspect; however, when it is excessive, it can become a barrier to adoption and use. Complex systems can also be more prone to errors and unintended consequences, thereby potentially negatively impacting the overall effectiveness and reliability of a standard. Lastly, the lack of necessary testing in real-life conditions is a crucial factor that can result in exclusion from a standard. Testing is an essential step in the development of any technology or protocol, as it helps identify potential weaknesses, flaws, and bugs. By testing a feature in realistic scenarios and environments, developers can better understand its performance, interoperability, and validity. Skipping this vital step or not conducting extensive testing may be grounds for excluding the specific technology from the standard, as its real-world effectiveness remains unproven. Overall, these reasons illustrate the importance of thorough research, consistent design, and rigorous testing when developing new technologies or protocols that aim to become part of officially-accepted standards.

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Anteaters have long sticky tongues for extracting food."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given inputs i and A, where i is an integer and A is a list.

The source coding theorem shows that ( in the limit , as the length of a stream of independent and identically - distributed random variable ( i.i.d . ) data tends to infinity ) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate ( average number of bits per symbol ) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source , without it being virtually certain that information will be lost . However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy , with negligible probability of loss . The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word ( which is viewed as a random variable ) and of the size of the target alphabet . - Ecology (from , \\"house\\", or \\"environment\\"; -, \\"study of\\") is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes the study of interactions organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services. - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968. - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton. - The Boltzmann constant (or ), which is named after Ludwig Boltzmann, is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant divided by the Avogadro constant : - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding. - A temperature is an objective comparative measurement of hot or cold. It is measured by a thermometer. Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called \\"centigrade\\"), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K). - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humancomputer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation. - In statistical thermodynamics, entropy (usual symbol ) (Greek:, + ) is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations that a thermodynamic system can have when in a state as specified by certain macroscopic variables. Specifically, assuming that each of the microscopic configurations is equally probable, the entropy of the system is the natural logarithm of that number of configurations, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant (which provides consistency with the original thermodynamic concept of entropy discussed below, and gives entropy the dimension of energy divided by temperature). Formally, - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. - In data mining, anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. - Signal processing is an enabling technology that encompasses the fundamental theory, applications, algorithms, and implementations of processing or transferring information contained in many different physical, symbolic, or abstract formats broadly designated as \\"signals\\". It uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and linguistic representations, formalisms, and techniques for representation, modelling, analysis, synthesis, discovery, recovery, sensing, acquisition, extraction, learning, security, or forensics. - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering.

Handel, who previously served as Georgia’s secretary of state, had 52 percent of the vote to Democrat Jon Ossoff’s 48 percent when the Associated Press called the race late Tuesday night after a six-month campaign in which Republicans hammered Ossoff as an ill fit for a traditionally conservative district. Story Continued Below With her win, Handel protected Republicans’ 24-seat House majority and their hold on the 6th District in Atlanta’s northern suburbs, a longtime GOP seat that looked to be slipping from the party when Trump only carried it by 2 points in November. Democrats, spying an opening, poured millions of dollars into the special election when former Rep. Tom Price resigned to join Trump’s cabinet as the secretary of Health and Human Services. Ossoff, a former congressional aide and documentary filmmaker, captured the anti-Trump fervor coursing through the Democratic Party and raised over 23 million for his campaign. But Trump is not the only unpopular politician in the country, and Republicans once again used House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as a bogeyman in a major House race, linking Ossoff to her in TV ads, in door-to-door conversations with voters and even in the televised debates between Ossoff and Handel. \\"On April 18 I said this was going to be a very very tight race, it was going to be contentious, it was going to require all hands on deck, and that's exactly what we had,\\" Handel told cheering supporters after her win. While Handel’s victory only brings the Republican House majority back to its baseline level after the 2016 election, it denied Democrats a momentum boost toward the 2018 midterms and a victory that party activists dearly seek after five months of GOP control in Washington. The GOP has now won each House special election of 2017, after Trump selected a handful of congressmen from conservative seats for his Cabinet — though Republicans had a close call in South Carolina Tuesday night, where Republican Ralph Norman won the state’s 5th District by a surprisingly close 3-point margin. Handel’s win also comes at a critical time for congressional Republicans, who have gotten bogged down trying to pass major legislation, including on health care. \\"Democrats from coast to coast threw everything they had at this race, and Karen would not be defeated,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. Turnout soared in the special election, with Republican outside groups spending millions of dollars to drive more GOP voters to the polls this time than in the April primary. Ossoff and Handel finished first and second in the all-party primary two months ago, setting up Tuesday’s runoff — though Ossoff came just a few thousand votes short of winning the district outright in April. Ossoff held an edge in most public polling during the runoff, but Handel closed the gap just before Election Day. Handel struggled to compete with Ossoff’s money, but she presented herself as an experienced conservative in line with the district’s traditional Republican leanings. Top Republicans flocked to Georgia to aid her, including Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who helped raise 1 million for Handel at separate events, according to her campaign. Ryan, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue (a former Georgia governor) and Price himself came to the district to rally GOP voters, too.

Trump also weighed in several times on the race on Twitter, hours before Election Day: “Karen Handel’s opponent in #GA06 can’t even vote in the district he wants to represent…” adding, “…because he doesn’t even live there! He wants to raise taxes and kill healthcare. On Tuesday, #VoteKarenHandel.” Trump is not widely liked in the 6th District, where the presidential vote swung further toward Democrats in 2016 than in all but one non-Utah House seat. But while Trump’s standing in the district loosened the GOP’s hold on the seat, it did not dislodge the party. Instead, GOP outside groups focused on Pelosi’s own abysmal approval ratings to gin up opposition to Ossoff, whom they said was aligned with the San Francisco Democrat. Ossoff, for his part, tried to cast himself as a centrist, promising to be a “fresh, independent voice” for the district. But Republicans also accused him of being soft on national security and of relying on liberal, small-dollar donors from outside the district to fuel his campaign. Republicans also hammered Ossoff on his home address, as he doesn’t currently live in the district, while he said he wants to support his fiancée’s medical studies at Emory University. In one debate, Handel asked Ossoff: “Who are you going to vote for in this election?” Ossoff urges his Democratic supporters to keep working for their cause in a concession speech. \\"We showed the world that in places where no one thought it was possible you could fight, we could fight,\\" Ossoff said, adding: \\"This is not the outcome any of us were hoping for. But this is the beginning of something much bigger than us.\\" Handel also spoke about House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was shot last week during a practice for the Republican congressional baseball team, during her speech. \\"What happened on that ballfield was a terrible tragedy and we all need to continue to lift up Steve and the others who were injured that day,\\" Handel said. \\"And we need to also lift up this nation so that we can find a more civil way to deal with our disagreements.\\" Gabriel Debenedetti contributed to this report.

Handel’s supporters rejoiced with cheers and sighs of relief after the most expensive congressional race in U.S. history, costing more than 50 million. Handel said Ossoff was gracious and thanked her for a “spirited campaign” when he called her to concede. “We may have some different beliefs, but we are part of one community, the community of the 6th District,” Handel said. “My pledge is to be part of the solution: to focus on governing, to put my experience to work in helping to solve the very serious issues we’re facing in this country.” ||||| Peter Ludwinski of Sandy Springs, Ga., laughs as he waits for an election-night watch party to begin for Republican candidate for Georgia's Sixth District Congressional seat Karen Handel Tuesday, June... (Associated Press) DUNWOODY, Ga. (AP) — Republican Karen Handel won a nationally watched congressional election Tuesday in Georgia, and she thanked President Donald Trump after she avoided an upset that would have rocked Washington ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Returns showed Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, winning about 52 percent of the vote over Democrat Jon Ossoff, who won nearly 48 percent in Georgia's 6th Congressional District. \\"A special thanks to the president of the United States of America,\\" she said late Tuesday night as her supporters chanted, \\"Trump! Trump! Trump!\\" It was Handel's most public embrace of the man whose tenuous standing in this well-educated, suburban enclave made a previously safe Republican district close to begin with. Handel's margin allows Republicans a sigh of relief after what's being recognized as the most expensive House race in U.S history, with a price tag that may exceed 50 million. Yet the result in a historically conservative district still offers Republicans a warning that Trump, for better or worse, will dominate the looming campaign cycle. Georgia's outcome follows similar results in Montana, Kansas and South Carolina, where Republicans won special House races by much narrower margins than they managed as recently as November. Republicans immediately crowed over winning a seat that Democrats spent 30 million trying to flip. \\"Democrats from coast to coast threw everything they had at this race, and Karen would not be defeated,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. Democrats still must defend their current districts and win 24 GOP-held seats to regain a House majority next November. Party leaders profess encouragement from the trends, but the latest losses mean they will have to rally donors and volunteers after a tough stretch of special elections. Handel, 55, will become the first Republican woman to represent Georgia in the U.S. House, according to state party officials. Her win comes after losing bids for governor in 2010 and the Senate in 2014, and it builds on a business and political career she built after leaving an abusive home as a teen. \\"It's that fighting spirit, that perseverance and tenacity that I will take to Washington,\\" she said Tuesday night. Handel is the latest in a line of Republicans who have represented the district since 1979, beginning with Newt Gingrich, who would become House speaker. Most recently, Tom Price resigned in February to join Trump's administration. The president himself struggled here, though, edging Democrat Hillary Clinton but falling short of a majority among an affluent, well-educated electorate that typically has given Republican nominees better than 60 percent of the vote. Handel emphasized that Republican pedigree often in her campaign and again in her victory speech. She also noted throughout the campaign that she has lived in the district for 25 years, unlike Ossoff, who grew up in the district but lives in Atlanta, a few miles south of the 6th District's southern border. In victory, she commended Ossoff and pledged to work for his supporters. She noted last week's shooting of Republican Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and said politics has become too embittered. \\"My pledge is to be part of the solution, to focus on governing,\\" she said. Ossoff, taking the stage at his own party after conceding the race, told his supporters his campaign \\"is the beginning of something much bigger than us,\\" adding, \\"The fight goes on.\\" Party organizations, independent political action committees and donors from Los Angeles to Boston sent a cascade of money into a race, filling metro Atlanta's airwaves with ads and its 6th District neighborhoods with hordes of paid canvassers. Contrary to the chants at Handel's victory party, she insisted for months that voters' choice had little to do with Trump. She rarely mentioned him, despite holding a closed-door fundraiser with him earlier this spring. She pointed voters instead to her \\"proven conservative record\\" as a state and local elected official. Her protestations aside, Handel often embraced the national tenor of the race, joining a GOP chorus that lambasted Ossoff as a \\"dangerous liberal\\" who was \\"hand-picked\\" by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. She also welcomed a parade of national GOP figures to Atlanta to help her raise money, with Ryan and Vice President Mike Pence holding fundraisers following Trump's April visit. It was enough to help Handel raise more than 5 million, not a paltry sum in a congressional race, but barely a fifth of Ossoff's fundraising haul. The Republican campaign establishment, however, helped make up the difference. A super PAC backed by Ryan spent 7 million alone. On policy, she mostly echoes party leaders. She said she'd have voted for the House Republican health care bill, though she sometimes misrepresented its provisions in debates with Ossoff. She touts traditional supply side economics, going so far as to say during one debate that she does \\"not support a living wage\\" — her way of explaining her opposition to a minimum-wage increase. ___ Follow Barrow on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/BillBarrowAP. |||||","output":"Republican Karen Handel has won Georgia's special election in the US House of Representatives against Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff with 52% of the vote. The election result, seen as a significant test of public opinion regarding Republican President Donald Trump, is a blow to Democrats who had hoped for a special-election upset against Trump. The intense focus on the race in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District led it to become the most expensive House race in US history."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: Is that your girlfriend? Ah, no, that's not my girlfriend. Czech:","output":"Je to tvoje přítelkyně? Aha, ne, to není moje přítelkyně. Explanation: This sentence is asking if the person they're talking to has a girlfriend, and then saying that the girl they're talking about is not actually their girlfriend. In Czech, \\"Je to\\" means \\"is that,\\" \\"tvoje\\" means \\"your,\\" and \\"přítelkyně\\" means \\"girlfriend.\\" \\"Aha\\" is just a casual way of saying \\"oh\\" or \\"I see,\\" and \\"ne\\" means \\"no.\\" \\"To není\\" means \\"that's not,\\" and \\"moje\\" means \\"my.\\" So the whole sentence translates to: \\"Is that your girlfriend?

They meet in a special meeting called a \\"conclave.\\" To choose a new Pope, the Cardinals need to agree by at least 66.7%, which means that, out of every 100 votes, at least 67 Cardinals need to vote for the same person. This helps make sure that many of them agree on the new Pope, and it is more likely that he will be a good leader for the church."},{"instruction":"Given the question: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

These are virtually still images revealing the key elements of the film: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) the bride in deep melancholy with birds falling behind her; of a lawn with trees and a sundial with two different shadows; Pieter Breughel's Hunters in the Snow (often used as interpretation of an idealised nostalgia) the non existent 19th hole (limbo) and the Black Horse collapsing catastrophically in slow motion (id/ego battle); Justine as a bride being swept along by a river; and her being held back by her wedding dress; and finally Justine and her nephew building their magic cave before the earth crashes into Melancholia becoming one. The film continues in two parts.Part One: \\"Justine\\" is of an ideal and perfect wedding that sweeps bride Justine along and which clashes with Justines fragile world.This act begins with an clumsy, oversized wedding vehicle unable to negotiate a curve in the road.Newlyweds Justine and Michael (Alexander Skarsgård) arrive two hours late to their own reception at the family estate where Justine's sister Claire and her husband John reside. Justine happens to notice a particularly bright red star in the twilight sky which John identifies as Antares.During the course of the wedding we realise that each of the characters represent a metaphor. These metaphors are developed during the night of the wedding reception. Her brother-in-law, John, represents sacrifice (cost of the wedding) and social conformity. Her dad is hedonistic and selfish therefore unable to connect at a meaningful level with Justine. Her mother ,Gaby (honesty) is brutally; ruthlessly and pathologically honest which gets her thrown out of the wedding. However Justines sister ,Claire, who represents order urges Justine to dishonestly hide her debilitating melancholy from her bland, gormless, doting husband, Michael, (This is highlighted by his wedding speech) and anyway...","output":"Based on the intricate plot and various leitmotifs presented, a potential question could be: How do the visual leitmotifs and metaphors represented by each character contribute to the exploration of melancholy and apocalypse in the film, and how do they reflect and influence Justine's journey of self-discovery throughout her wedding reception and the impending doom brought about by the planet Melancholia?"},{"instruction":"Kendall felt bad when she lied to her dad.

The first show, “Secret Stash,” comes from Kevin Smith (who earned his geek-culture bona fides with his films “Clerks” and “Chasing Amy”) and is set in his Red Bank, N.J., comics shop, Jay and Silent Bob’s Secret Stash. AMC said in a news release that the series would capture “the world of the neighborhood comic-book store and fanboy culture” and is planned for a first-quarter 2012 premiere. The ever-talkative Mr. Smith, who will be an executive producer of the show, said in a statement that he was “ecstatic, proud, and extremely lucky to be in bed with a network I watch religiously anyway,” adding: “If they’d pushed just a little harder in the negotiations, I’d have done this show for no payment beyond early access to every episode of ‘Mad Men,’ ‘Breaking Bad’ and ‘Walking Dead.’ ” The second show, “JJK Security,” chronicles a family-owned private security company in rural Georgia. AMC said the series was inspired “by what filmmakers like the Coen Brothers, Christopher Guest and Robert Altman have done capturing quirky, larger than life characters in the scripted realm,” and will make its debut in the third quarter of 2012.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

A number of writers mentioned Bertin's eventful career, in tones that were, according to art historian Andrew Carrington Shelton, either \\"bitingly sarcastic [or] fawningly reverential\\". There were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years. Aware of Bertin's support of the July Monarchy, writers at the La Gazette de France viewed the portrait as the epitome of the \\"opportunism and cynicism\\" of the new regime. Their anonymous critic excitedly wondered \\"what bitter irony it expresses, what hardened skepticism, sarcasm and ... pronounced cynicism\\".Several critics mentioned Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century art historian Albert Boime described them as \\"powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled\\". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a \\"fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\\" Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: \\"A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature\\".The work's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited. Some saw it as an affront to Romanticism, others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness, but built a psychological profile of the sitter.

My new Pulsar RS200 seems to be getting too much heated up and the radiator fan starts after nearly 10 km of riding. Is it common? Why my new bike engine over heats at 12 km ride?","output":"Although the two questions might appear similar at first glance as they both refer to an issue with a bike's engine overheating, there are subtle differences between them. Let's analyze each question and discuss their differences in terms of the specific motorcycles, distances, and focus areas they mention. Question 1: My new Pulsar RS200 seems to be getting too much heated up and the radiator fan starts after nearly 10 km of riding. Is it common? This question refers to a specific motorcycle model (Pulsar RS200) and seeks to understand if the described scenario (the radiator fan starting after nearly 10 km of riding) is common. The focus is on the heating and radiator fan operation, potentially implying that the user seeks to learn whether this phenomenon is typical for the Pulsar RS200 model and if there could be any underlying issues with the bike itself or the cooling system. Question 2: Why does my new bike engine overheat at 12 km ride? The second question does not mention a specific motorcycle model, and the distance at which the engine overheats is slightly different (12 km). This question's focus is more on determining the potential reasons and explanation as to why the engine overheats after this distance. While there is still the issue of engine overheating, the lack of context regarding the motorcycle model makes the inquiry broader and leaves room for a variety of responses that could vary based on the type of motorcycle. In summary, the two questions address the issue of motorcycle engines overheating, but they differ regarding the problem's presentation and the specific details provided: - Question 1 highlights a specific motorcycle model (Pulsar RS200) and is focused on the radiator fan's operation, seeking to understand if the described scenario is common for that particular model. - Question 2 does not provide information about the motorcycle model, making it a broader question that could apply to any motorcycle. The focus here is on identifying possible reasons for the engine's overheating after a 12 km ride. Due to these differences, it is crucial to provide a detailed and thoughtful answer that addresses each question's unique aspects, ensuring the information provided is relevant and accurate to the individual's concerns."},{"instruction":"I juat love your works and hope that one day you will be my publisher.

You need to read the extract and create questions that can be answered from the extract. The questions should be well-formed and grammatically correct. The questions should be completely answerable from the given passage and should not require any external knowledge. Subjective questions are not allowed. Create questions that result in factoid answers. A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage. Input: A Kentucky woman, Dian Fossey is inspired by anthropologist Louis Leakey to devote her life to the study of primates. Travelling into deepest Africa, Fossey becomes fascinated with the lives and habits of the rare mountain gorillas of the Rwandan jungle. Studying them at close quarters, Fossey develops a means of communicating with the gorillas, and in doing so becomes obsessed with the apes' well-being. She becomes so preoccupied with her vocation that she loses the opportunity of a romance with the National Geographic photographer Bob Campbell.Appalled by the poaching of the gorillas for their skins, hands, and heads, Fossey complains to the Rwandan government, which dismisses her, claiming that poaching is the only means by which some of the Rwandan natives can themselves survive. She rejects this, and dedicates herself to saving the African Mountain gorilla from illegal poaching and likely extinction. To this end she forms and leads numerous anti-poaching patrols, and even burns down the poachers' villages and stages a mock execution of one of the offenders. Fossey is mysteriously murdered on December 26, 1985, in the bedroom of her cabin.

Crush Analysis Testimony Yergin was apparently planning to testify about estimated speeds of the F-250 and the Hyundai based on the amount of “crush” to the Hyundai. Although Yer-gin testified in front of the jury that there was probably a difference in speed between the two vehicles of 10 to 20 miles per hour, she never stated at any time what speeds she estimated the vehicles to be traveling. Nor did appellant’s counsel explain to the court what speeds Yergin concluded the vehicles were traveling.

The given statement mentions the movie being \\"more revealing, more emotional, and more surprising.\\" All of these adjectives indicate favorable qualities in the context of a film. When reviewers say a movie is 'more revealing,' it can mean that the plot uncovers deep truths about the characters, their motivations, or the world they inhabit. This suggests that the movie has been effective in presenting a complex and well-developed narrative. The phrase 'more emotional' implies that the film is successful in evoking feelings and stirring emotions within the viewer. This could mean that the movie has genuine, sincere moments or that the actors delivered strong performances that resonated with the audience. Emotional engagement is a vital component of a positive movie-going experience, as it allows the audience to connect with the story and its characters. Lastly, 'more surprising' implies that the movie contains unexpected twists or revelations that set it apart from typical or formulaic films. Surprising elements can make a film more engaging, refreshing, and memorable, which are all positive attributes in the eyes of a reviewer. The ability to subvert expectations and keep the audience guessing is often praised in film critiques.

A diocesan return of 1563 recorded 145 households in the parish of New Sleaford, while the Compton Census (1676) reveals that New Sleaford had a Conformist population of 576 people, no \\"Papists\\", and 6 Non-conformists. There is a widely held local tradition that St Denys' was used during the English Civil War (1642–51) as a barracks for parliamentary troops who destroyed the interior furnishings. The local historian Trollope stated that the soldiers looted the brass eagle lectern (last recorded in 1622), broke the stained glass windows and the organ, and stole valuables. Whether this damage occurred or not, repairs to the windows and roof were carried out in 1657, paid for by public subscription. Galleries were also added to the church in the 18th century: the south in 1758, west in 1772, and north in 1783–84. In 1772, Edward Evans, a ship's surgeon on HMS Egmont, donated £300 to replace the organ with one built by Samuel Green of London.For most of the 19th century, the Anglican community dominated Sleaford's civic bodies, including the Board of Guardians, who oversaw the workhouse, and the Local Board of Health. Dr Richard Yerburgh and his son, Richard, were vicars in 1809–51 and 1851–82 respectively and had family connections with the local builders Kirk and Parry; Yerburgh and Thomas Parry (one half of the firm) were on the Board of Guardians and were labelled members of a \\"family party\\" by opponents during the Board's 1870 elections (they were nonetheless re-elected).

Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. and a hint : Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... Please answer this question : Which village displayed an observable Allee effect? Answer:","output":"Village B displayed an observable Allee effect. This is because Village B had a small and declining population, which was more isolated geographically. This decline in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, reducing the gene pool and potentially leading to a reduction in fitness of the species through genetic drift and inbreeding depression. The Allee effect can be observed in such situations where a decrease in population density has negative impacts on individual fitness and overall population survival."},{"instruction":"Information: - The Province of Milan was a province in the Lombardy region, Italy.

The Boone family belonged to the Religious Society of Friends, called \\"Quakers\\", and were persecuted in England for their dissenting beliefs. Daniel's father, Squire (his first name, not a title) Boone (1696-1765) emigrated from the small town of Bradninch, Devon (near Exeter) to Pennsylvania in 1713, to join William Penn's colony of dissenters. Squire Boone's parents, George Boone III and Mary Maugridge, followed their son to Pennsylvania in 1717, and in 1720 built a log cabin at Boonecroft. In 1720, Squire Boone, who worked primarily as a weaver and a blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700-77). Sarah's family were Quakers from Wales, and had settled in 1708 in the area which became Towamencin Township of Montgomery County. In 1731, the Boones moved to Exeter Township in the Oley Valley of Berks County, near the modern city of Reading. There they built a log cabin, partially preserved today as the Daniel Boone Homestead. Daniel Boone was born there, November 2, 1734, the sixth of eleven children. The Daniel Boone Homestead is just four miles from the Mordecai Lincoln House, making the Squire Boone family neighbors of Mordecai Lincoln, the great, great grandfather of future President Abraham Lincoln. Mordecai's son, also named Abraham, married Ann Boone, a first cousin of Daniel. Daniel Boone spent his early years on what was then the edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good relations with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image. In Boone's youth, his family became a source of controversy in the local Quaker community when two of the oldest children married outside the endogamous community, in present-day Lower Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania. In 1742, Boone's parents were compelled to publicly apologize after their eldest child, Sarah, married John Willcockson, a \\"worldling\\" (non-Quaker). Because the young couple had \\"kept company\\", they were considered \\"married without benefit of clergy\\". When the Boones' oldest son Israel married a \\"worldling\\" in 1747, Squire Boone stood by him. Both men were expelled from the Quakers; Boone's wife continued to attend monthly meetings with their younger children.

Mary's happy about her work, and John is about his children.","output":"As an AI assistant, I'll break down the analysis of this sentence in a few steps: 1. Identify Sentence Structure: The sentence \\"Mary's happy about her work, and John is about his children\\" seems to be a compound sentence, which generally consists of two independent clauses combined with a coordinating conjunction ('and' in this case). 2. Analyze First Clause: \\"Mary's happy about her work\\" is a grammatically well-structured clause. It's complete with a subject (Mary), a verb (is, contracted as 's), and an object (her work). The phrase \\"happy about her work\\" is a correct adjective phrase where 'happy' is an adjective and 'about her work' is a prepositional phrase modifying the adjective. 3. Analyze Second Clause: \\"John is about his children\\" is a little ambiguous as a clause on its own, because 'about' usually functions as preposition, but without any verb preceding it in this context, it's unclear what action John is performing 'about' his children. 4. Consider Coordinating Conjunction: The 'and' combining the two parts is commonly used to link similar ideas or clauses. It can imply that the verb from the first clause pertains to the second clause as well. Therefore, 'is' from the first clause could be leaked into the second clause, resulting in \\"John is [happy] about his children,\\" where the predicate of the first clause is elided in the second for brevity. 5. Final Verdict: A linguist would likely deem this sentence as grammatically sound because it follows the grammatical rules of subjects, verbs, and objects, and effectively uses coordinating conjunction to link two clauses. The elision of 'happy' from the second clause could be seen as an acceptable stylistic choice. It assumes that the listener/reader can understand that 'is' in the second clause refers to the same state of being 'happy' from the first clause. It might cause slight ambiguity in some cases, but in the context of English language conversation, it's understood and used quite often."},{"instruction":"Thomas Edward Lawrence was born on 16 August 1888 in Tremadog, Carnarvonshire (now Gwynedd), Wales in a house named Gorphwysfa, now known as Snowdon Lodge. His Anglo-Irish father Thomas Chapman had left his wife Edith after he fell in love and had a son with Sarah Junner, a young Scotswoman who had been engaged as governess to his daughters. Sarah was the daughter of Elizabeth Junner and John Lawrence, who worked as a ship's carpenter and was a son of the household in which Elizabeth had been a servant. She was dismissed four months before Sarah was born. The chief elements of the Arab strategy, developed chiefly by Faisal and Lawrence, were firstly to avoid capturing Medina, and secondly to extend northwards through Maan and Deraa to Damascus and beyond. The Emir Faisal wanted to lead regular attacks against the Ottomans, which Lawrence persuaded him to drop. Lawrence wrote about the Bedouin as a fighting force: \\"The value of the tribes is defensive only and their real sphere is guerilla warfare. They are intelligent, and very lively, almost reckless, but too individualistic to endure commands, or fight in line, or to help each other. It would, I think, be possible to make an organized force out of them...The Hejaz war is one of dervishes against regular forces-and we are on the side of the dervishes. Our text-books do not apply to its conditions at all\\". Medina was an attractive target for the revolt as Islam's second-holiest site, and because its Ottoman garrison was weakened by disease and isolation. It became clear that it was advantageous to leave it there rather than try to capture it, while continually attacking, but not permanently breaking, the Hejaz railway south from Damascus. This prevented the Ottomans from making effective use of their troops at Medina, and forced them to dedicate many resources to defending and repairing the railway line. The movement north to Damascus and eventually Aleppo is interesting in the context of the Sykes-Picot agreement. While it is not known when Lawrence learned the details of Sykes-Picot, nor if or when he briefed Faisal on what he knew, there is good reason to think that both these things happened, and earlier rather than later. In particular, the Arab strategy of northward extension makes perfect sense given the Sykes-Picot language that spoke of an independent Arab entity in Syria, which would only be granted if the Arabs liberated the territory themselves. The French, and some of their British Liaison officers, were specifically uncomfortable about the northward movement, as it would weaken French colonial claims. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did Lawrence think of the enemy?","output":"Lawrence thought of the enemy, the Ottomans, as a regular force that the Bedouin tribes, whom he considered a guerrilla force, should rally against. He characterized the Hejaz war as a conflict \\"of dervishes against regular forces,\\" with the tribes being on the side of the dervishes. Despite the tribes' intelligence and liveliness, Lawrence noted their individualistic nature, making it difficult for them to endure commands, fight in line, or help each other. However, he believed that it would be possible to make an organized force out of them. Lawrence's strategies were focused on preventing the Ottomans from effectively using their troops at Medina and forcing them to dedicate resources to defending and repairing the railway line."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Paul Marshal Curry, 58, of Salina, Kansas, showed no emotion as he was sentenced by Orange County Superior Court Judge Patrick Donahue for the 1994 death of his wife, Linda Curry. Curry called 911 on June 9, 1994, and told authorities he had found his wife of two years in bed and not breathing. Sentenced: Paul Marshal Curry, 58, of Salina, Kansas, showed no emotion as he was given life in prison by Orange County Superior Court Judge Patrick Donahue for the 1994 death of his wife, Linda Curry. Curry killed his wife (pictured) and began collecting 547,000 of her life insurance the day after her funeral. Police say they believe Curry murdered her at the time, but they didn't have enough evidence to press charges. The day after her funeral, he began trying to collect her life insurance benefits and ultimately received 547,000, according to prosecutors. During trial, prosecutor Ebrahim Baytieh told jurors that the former nuclear power plant engineer slowly poisoned his 50-year-old wife over the course of a year before he slipped her a powerful sedative and injected her with a fatal dose of nicotine. At the time, police believed he had murdered Linda Curry but didn't have enough evidence to press charges. Curry moved to Kansas and the case went cold until 2007, when investigators discovered new evidence that shortened the window of time that Curry had to give the fatal nicotine injection. He was arrested in 2010 in Kansas. In 1993, a year before Linda Curry's death, the couple were questioned when hospital staff discovered a dose of lidocaine in Linda Curry's IV bag while she was being hospitalized for unexplained vomiting, headaches and bloody diarrhea. To the cells: During the trial the court heard that Curry (pictured being led out of court) slowly poisoned his wife over a year before giving her a fatal nicotine dose. Curry, who had a new wife and a new job when he was arrested in 2010, was found guilty of the killings in September. At the time of his wife's death he said he would have had nothing to gain from it. At the time, Paul Curry said he had nothing to gain from his wife's death. During the trial, Curry's former wife testified that in the last year of their marriage she was constantly ill and Curry suggested she apply for life insurance. When her application was rejected, he divorced her and she instantly began to feel better, according to testimony. Curry's attorney, Lisa Kopelman, argued that Linda Curry was a sickly person with digestive ailments and that she could have been taking nicotine as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. During testimony his second wife (not pictured) said she was constantly ill during the marriage and Curry had asked her to apply for life insurance.

You also give up the responsibility to monitor your child's behavior or provide food, clothing, or shelter for your child. Once you give up parental rights, you are also giving up your right to have any contact with your child, including rights to visitation or telephone contact. Sometimes, you can negotiate an arrangement where you are allowed to contact the child, but these arrangements are highly unusual and hard to enforce. They often occur only where the state has moved to terminate the parental rights, not where a parent has voluntarily sought termination. Be aware that during the termination process, you will still be responsible for the child. This includes any child support payments due. In many states, you cannot relinquish your parental rights unless someone else is available to accept them. This will ensure that the child does not become a ward of the state. Typically, if one parent wants to give up parental rights then both parents must agree. Furthermore, there should be another person waiting in the wings to adopt the child, otherwise a court is unlikely to approve of termination even where the other parent agrees. You cannot give up your parental rights simply to get out of child support payments. A court does not terminate parental rights unless it is in the best interests of the child. Family law is complicated. Many different factors will impact your case and how a judge will view it. Accordingly, you should try to secure the services of an experienced local attorney to help you with the relinquishment process. You can find an experienced family law attorney by visiting your state's bar association website, which runs a referral program. If costs are a concern, be aware that many attorneys now offer “unbundled” legal services. With “unbundled” services, the attorney agrees only to do discrete tasks for a fee. You control what work the attorney performs. For example, you can have an attorney look at an adoption contract or represent you in court while you perform all other legal tasks yourself. Summary:","output":"Relinquishing parental rights involves giving up the authority to direct a child's upbringing, including decisions on medical care, education, and religion, as well as the responsibility to monitor behaviour and provide basic needs. This also means giving up the right to any contact with the child. It is difficult to negotiate arrangements for contact after termination of parental rights, which often only occur when the state initiates the process. During termination, parents are still responsible, including paying child support. Generally, parental rights can only be relinquished if someone else is available to accept them, ensuring the child doesn't become a ward of the state. Both parents must agree for one to give up their rights, and a court must find it in the child's best interest. Family law can be complicated, so hiring an experienced local attorney is recommended, with options for \\"unbundled\\" services to manage costs."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Born in 1983 in Arizona, US, Jessica has learned to live her life with her feet. She was born without arms, and no doctors could figure out why. There were many questions at the time about whether Jessica would be able to live a \\"normal\\" life. However, Jessica ' s father said , \\"I have never shed a tear about her birth condition. \\" With the support of her parents and family, Jessica became confident in herself as an adult and continued to explore the world with her feet. As a child, Jessica studied dance in her home town. When the first performance arrived, she asked to be put in the back row. Her dance teacher told her there was no back row. Nervously, she took the stage with the other students and performed her routine. When she finished, the applause from the audience gave her encouragement and the confidence to continue dancing for 14 years. After graduating from high school, Jessica attended the University of Arizona, where she earned a bachelor' s degree in Psychology.

How do I pass an etg test for alcohol in less than 24hrs? Please tell me if those questions are the same. pick from the following. +no. +yes.","output":"First, let me explain what an EtG test is. An EtG test is a test that checks your body for a chemical called EtG, which your body makes when it breaks down alcohol. Sometimes, people get this test to make sure they haven't been drinking alcohol. Now, let's talk about speeding up your metabolism. Your metabolism is like an engine in your body that helps break down the things you eat and drink, like alcohol. To help your body process alcohol faster, you can drink lots of water, eat healthy foods, and exercise. But, it's important to know that you cannot guarantee the alcohol will leave your body super fast, especially in less than 24 hours. As for your question about the two questions being the same, the answer is +no. They are different because the first question asks about speeding up your metabolism, and the second question asks about passing the EtG test in less than 24 hours. While they are related, they focus on different aspects."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Camping 3 is a 2016 French comedy film directed by Fabien Onteniente.

Ablett displayed a love for sport at an early age, winning the state school high jump at 10 years of age. He was also awarded both club and competition best and fairest awards for Drouin at the under-11s, under-12s and under-14s levels. After citing waning interest in school, Ablett dropped out of high school at the age of 15 years to become a bricklayer's labourer. Two of Ablett's brothers played in the Victorian Football League - Kevin Ablett, who played for Hawthorn, Richmond and Geelong, and Geoff Ablett, who played for Hawthorn, Richmond and St Kilda. Ablett's eldest son, Gary Ablett Jr., has followed in his footsteps to play for Geelong. In 2007 and 2009, Ablett Jr. won the Cats' best and fairest award, emulating a feat established by his father in his first season with the Cats back in 1984; he also won the Brownlow Medal in 2009 and 2013. Another son, Nathan, was drafted in 2004 (48th pick) by Geelong under the father-son rule. Nathan initially refused to play AFL Football because of his father's experience with the media, but, with encouragement from the club, was signed ahead of the 2005 AFL Season and has since established himself in the full forward role Gary Snr made his own. On 29 September 2007, both Gary Jr. and Nathan contributed to Geelong winning its first flag in 44 years, capturing the premiership that proved elusive to Gary Snr in his 12 years at the club. Nathan retired suddenly before the 2008 season, but he and his brother Gary Jr. were members of the Gold Coast Football Club's inaugural team for the 2011 season. In addition to his sons, Ablett has a nephew, Luke Ablett, who played for the Sydney Swans and won a premiership with them in 2005.

We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued.

Answer the following question: What may be the reason that Mary 's car needed to be towed ?","output":"There could be various reasons that Mary's car needed to be towed. Some of the potential reasons are based on common car issues, and others are mere speculations based on the given information. Below are a few possibilities: 1. Mechanical failure: One of the most common reasons a car would need to be towed is due to a mechanical failure. This could include engine trouble, transmission issues, a broken timing belt, or any other problems that cause the vehicle to stop functioning properly or become unsafe to drive. 2. Flat tire or damaged wheel: A flat tire or a severely damaged wheel could prevent a car from moving and necessitate towing. In some cases, a tire can be changed on the side of the road, but if no spare is available or the damage is too extensive, towing might be necessary. 3. Electrical problems: Issues with the car's electrical system, like a dead battery or faulty alternator, can also lead to the vehicle being towed. If the car cannot be started or the battery cannot be charged while on the side of the highway, it would need to be moved to a safe location for repairs. 4. Overheating: If the car's cooling system is not functioning properly, the engine may overheat. Continuing to drive an overheating vehicle can cause severe engine damage, so towing the car to a safe location for repairs would be necessary. 5. Running out of fuel: Mary may have run out of gas while driving on the highway, which would require towing the vehicle to the nearest gas station or a safe location to refuel. 6. Accident or collision: Mary's car may have been involved in an accident or collision that caused significant damage, making it unsafe or impossible to drive. 7. Obstruction in the highway: It is also possible that there was some kind of obstruction or danger in the highway that required Mary's car to be removed. This could be due to an unexpected landslide, debris or fallen objects blocking the road, or a road closure enforced by local authorities. In such cases, towing the car to a nearby safe location would be required, even if there were no issues with the car itself. Bear in mind that these are only speculations based on the information provided. It's not possible to pinpoint the exact reason Mary's car needed to be towed without more context or information about the situation."},{"instruction":"Here is an email: We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight .

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

Zappa expressed opinions on censorship when he appeared on CNN's Crossfire TV series and debated issues with Washington Times commentator John Lofton in 1986. On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the United States Senate Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of then-senator Al Gore. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content. During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the \\"Blank Tape Tax.\\" Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship, and called their proposal for voluntary labelling of records with explicit content \\"extortion\\" of the music industry.In his prepared statement, he said: The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design.

When diapers and baby talk become just too much, adult talk is just a click away. But for some moms, the attraction of the online world becomes too strong to resist and instead of being an occasional thing, it becomes an addiction . Coleen Moore of the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery says she is seeing a growing number of young stay-at -home moms for whom blogs and social networking have become a passion, which will harm their real-world lives. Now, Internet addiction is not officially recognized as a mental disorder. But a recent survey showed 14 percent of Internet users find it hard to stay away from their computers for several days at a time, and that 8 percent use the Web to escape problems. Considering this, it is probably just a matter of time before it is. What drives a mom to the Internet is not different from what drives an alcoholic to drink: an empty place that needs filling. \\"In addiction treatment, we talk about the fact that there's a void ,\\"says Moore. \\"Whatever that void may be -- whether it's emotional, spiritual, physical--we're trying to fill it.\\" So, how can you find the void? A journal tracking when and why you go online and what you may be avoiding when you do so can be helpful in finding it out.

(AFP) - El fútbol uruguayo cerró un 2011 a toda máquina, con una victoria como visitante ante la selección de Italia y se despidió hasta febrero cuando se enfrentará a Rumania en Bucarest en un nuevo año que luce prometedor. El cierre de la actividad oficial de la selección uruguaya, conducida con éxito por Oscar W. Tabárez, no pudo ser mejor con el triunfo 1-0 ante la \\"Azzurra\\" el martes en el estadio Olímpico de Roma. Fue el broche de oro de un año que incluyó su 15to título de la Copa América y el ascenso hasta el cuarto puesto del ranking de la FIFA, el mismo lugar que alcanzó en 2010 en el Mundial de Sudáfrica. Además, ocupa el primer puesto de las eliminatorias para Brasil 2014 con siete puntos. En su última presentación por las eliminatorias, la \\"orquesta\\" tocó sin notas falsas y abatió 4-0 a Chile, un partido en el que se lució el delantero Luis Suárez con cuatro dianas. Diego Forlán fue el gran ausente ante Chile e Italia, tras sufrir un desgarro en el partido ante Paraguay por las eliminatorias en el que hizo el gol del empate 1-1 en Asunción. Forlán es el máximo goleador histórico de la selección, con 33 dianas, y ha sido su figura indiscutida en años recientes, aunque el desempeño de Suárez, artillero de 24 años del Liverpool inglés, parece asegurar un recambio generacional en la \\"Celeste\\". Las bajas de Abel Hernández (lesión) y Maximiliano Pereira (suspensión) no mellaron el desempeño de Uruguay contra Chile. Por el contrario, el equipo tuvo salidas rápidas, fue eficaz y contó con un Suárez letal en el área rival. Tabárez cuenta además con otras piezas como Edinson Cavani, Diego Pérez y Egidio Arévalo Ríos en el mediocampo, y el capitán Diego Lugano en la zaga. El martes en Roma, Tabárez tuvo que apelar a suplentes como Sebastián Fernández, quien marcó el gol del triunfo, y si bien la \\"Azzurra\\" tuvo dominio de campo y de balón, los \\"celestes\\" pudieron contenerlos y llevar aprovechar las oportunidades. \\"La Celeste no contaba con Forlán y Suárez, y los hombres de Tabárez venían de Sudamérica, probablemente aturdidos por el viaje.

(AP) – A man whose infant son was found dead in the Connecticut River admitted tossing the boy from a bridge before jumping into the water below, police said Wednesday. Tony Moreno was charged with murder in the death of 7-month-old Aaden Moreno. Moreno exchanged angry text messages with the infant's increasingly frantic mother in the minutes before he jumped Sunday near midnight, according to court filings. \\"Enjoy your new life without us,\\" Moreno wrote before texting, \\"He's dead.\\" Moreno, 21, was arraigned at Hartford Hospital, where he was treated after firefighters rescued him. His bail was set at 2 million. Moreno's public defender did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Police went to the Arrigoni Bridge in Middletown on Sunday night after Moreno's mother called 911 to report that her son had called her from the bridge with his son and said he was going to jump. After officers arrived, they saw Moreno jump and found an empty baby stroller, but did not see the infant. The body of Aaden Moreno was found Tuesday night near a bridge in East Haddam, south of where his father jumped, after an extensive search involving dive teams and helicopters. Police said Moreno confessed on Monday after initially refusing to speak with a detective. But after the officer said police needed help finding the boy to give him a proper funeral, Moreno nodded yes when asked if he had dropped his son and started to cry, according to police documents. The officer said he used a basketball analogy to ask how far the boy was thrown from the bridge's railing. \\"Tony said that it was more like a free throw distance from the railing,\\" the officer said. The boy's mother, Adrianne Oyola, 19, filed for a restraining order last month against Moreno amid a bitter custody dispute. She said in the application that Moreno \\"has told me he could make my son disappear any time of the day. He told me how he could me disappear.\\" Superior Court Judge Barry Pinkus denied the request for a permanent restraining order, saying at a hearing on June 29 that the couple had a chaotic relationship but he was not convinced there was a \\"continuous threat\\" of physical injury. Chief Court Administrator Patrick L. Carroll III said he would not comment directly on Pinkus' ruling but noted it reflects the difficult decisions that judges must make each day. He said even with a thorough assessment of the evidence, \\"it is impossible for judges to predict the future with certainty.\\" Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and other officials attended a community vigil for the baby in Middletown on Wednesday night. People lit candles outside the South Green gazebo, and left stuffed animals and balloons. The Middletown Press reports that Aaden's aunt read a letter prepared by his mother which said, \\"I lost my son, but I gained a guardian angel.\\" Mayor Daniel Drew told the gathering at South Congregational Church, \\"It's beyond our ability to express the magnitude of this loss or even to understand it.\\" Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram","output":"Title: \\"Tragic Loss: Father Admits to Throwing Infant Son Off Bridge Before Attempting Suicide in Connecticut\\""},{"instruction":"Question: Along with blues and bluegrass, what is a type of folk music traditional to Virginia?

Step 1: Understand the meaning of the word 'accessible.' \\"Accessible\\" typically refers to something that is easy to approach, understand, or use. It can be applied to various situations, such as user-friendly technology, a clear explanation, or a location that is easy to reach. Step 2: Consider the context of the phrase. If \\"accessible\\" is used to describe something that is meant to be inclusive and easy to approach, it would be considered positive. For example, \\"The park has been made accessible for people with disabilities.\\" In this case, the word is used to express a positive outcome of efforts to make the park available to everyone. However, if \\"accessible\\" is used to describe something negative that is easily attainable, it can be perceived as negative. An example would be, \\"The dangerous chemicals in the lab are too accessible, potentially causing accidents.\\" Here, the ease of access to the chemicals is seen as dangerous because it could lead to harm. Conclusion: The phrase \\"accessible\\" can be considered either positive or negative, depending on the context in which it is used. In most cases, it tends to carry a positive connotation, implying an inclusionary, user-friendly, and approachable nature. However, it is essential to consider the context and the subject it refers to before determining its positivity or negativity."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],N={key:0},j={key:1};function F(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
