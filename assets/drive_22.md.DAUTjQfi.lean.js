They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K + ) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this \\"uphill\\" process. Figure below shows how this pump works. Trace these steps from left to right in the figure Now, I have a new situation: Ben and Andy studied minerals and micro-nutrients. Ben studied more about magnesium, zinc and molybdenum, while his buddy Andy studied about sodium and potassium. Answer this question please: Which person studied less about Energy in ATP ? Answer:","output":"Both Ben and Andy focused on studying different minerals and micronutrients, with Ben studying magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum, and Andy studying sodium and potassium. It is important to note that ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is not directly related to these minerals and micronutrients, but rather serves as the energy currency in cells, including the energy needed for the sodium-potassium pump to function. The sodium-potassium pump, which is vital for maintaining an appropriate balance of ions within cells and facilitating numerous cellular processes, relies on the energy provided by ATP to move the sodium and potassium ions against their gradients. As the energy required for the sodium-potassium pump is derived from ATP, it can be assumed that Andy, who studied sodium and potassium, would have more exposure to the role of ATP in providing the necessary energy for this process. On the other hand, Ben's focus on magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum would likely involve studying their various roles and functions within biological systems, including their contributions to enzyme reactions, cellular structure, and overall health. While ATP and its role in energy transfer may be relevant to some of these topics, it is not the central focus of Ben's studies. Therefore, in comparison, it can be deduced that Ben studied less about energy in ATP compared to Andy. This is because Andy's research topic, involving sodium and potassium, would directly require an understanding of the role of ATP in the \\"uphill\\" process of moving these ions against their concentration gradients, while Ben's research focus on magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum would be less directly related to ATP's role in providing cellular energy."},{"instruction":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: zero stars Review: Wont stay put when you punch it. My two year old knocked it off my desk top. I was very disappointed. Dont waste your money. Wish that I could give it zero stars Answer: Answer:","output":"The product review provided has a negative tone. Several factors contribute to this interpretation, indicating that the reviewer is not satisfied with their purchase and would not recommend it to others. First, the title \\"zero stars\\" itself implies strong dissatisfaction as the reviewer wishes they could rate the product even lower than the minimum allowable rating. Notably, many platforms use a star-based rating system, with one star typically being the lowest score and representing a very unfavorable evaluation of a product or service. By asserting that they would like to give zero stars, the reviewer emphasizes the extent of their disappointment and frustration. Second, the review discusses specific issues with the product and highlights its failure to meet basic requirements or expectations. Particularly, the reviewer states that the item \\"won't stay put when you punch it,\\" which conveys a sense of irritation as the product does not perform its intended function. This exacerbates the negative tone when paired with the fact that a small child could easily knock it off a desktop. As a result, this outcome undermines the product's quality and its potential reliability in the eyes of the reviewer. Furthermore, the reviewer explicitly advises potential consumers against purchasing this product, stating, \\"Don't waste your money.\\" This direct warning serves to underline the negative tone of the review, as the reviewer wants to deter others from experiencing the same disappointment they did. Lastly, the general sentiment of the review consistently focuses on disappointment and frustration. Using phrases like \\"I was very disappointed\\" and \\"Wish that I could give it zero stars\\" serve to reinforce the overall negative tone of the review. Consequently, the reviewer suggests that potential buyers seek alternative products or entirely disregard this one. In summary, this product review features a distinctly negative tone, driven by the reviewer's dissatisfaction with its performance and overall experience. By detailing specific issues, explicitly discouraging others from buying the product, and wishing to give \\"zero stars,\\" the reviewer emphasizes their frustration and the magnitude of the product's drawbacks."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: The European Court of Justice has ruled that the European Commission has not been quick enough in identifying and banning potentially harmful \\"endocrine disruptor\\" chemicals.","output":"Title: European Court of Justice Says We Need to Be Faster and Better at Catching \\"Endocrine Disruptor\\" Chemicals Hi kids! Today, we have an important news story to share with you. The European Court of Justice made a big decision recently. They said that the European Commission, a group of people who make sure everyone follows the rules in Europe, isn't doing a good enough job when it comes to identifying and stopping chemicals called \\"endocrine disruptors\\". Now, you might be wondering, \\"What are endocrine disruptors?\\" Well, imagine there are tiny soldiers inside our bodies called hormones. Hormones help our body grow, give us energy, and control how we feel. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that might confuse those soldiers, causing them not to work properly. They can be found in some of our everyday items like plastic bottles or cans. The European Court of Justice says that the people in charge should be catching these harmful chemicals more quickly and making them against the rules. They think that by acting fast, they can make sure that all of us – kids, grown-ups, and animals too – will be safer and healthier. In short, the court's decision is a reminder that it's important to keep an eye out for anything that might cause harm, so that it doesn't get a chance to hurt us.

Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others...

People are comparing him to Thomas Edison, Walt Disney and Leonardo da Vinci, and saying it will be a very long time before the world sees the likes of Steve Jobs again. After all, there are other brilliant marketers, designers and business people. Many of them have studied Steve Jobs, tried to absorb his methods and his philosophy. Surely they can recreate some of his success. But nobody ever does, even when they copy his moves down. So how did he become a visionary who changed every business he touched? Actually, he has given us clues all along. The story of Steve Jobs boils down to this: Don't go with the flow. If Mr. Jobs saw something that could be made better, smarter or more beautiful, nothing else mattered. Apple has attained its current astonishing levels of influence and success because it is sensitive. It is incredibly focused. It has had amazingly few failures. And that is because Mr. Jobs didn't buy into focus groups, groupthink or decision by a committee. At its core ,Apple existed to carry out his vision. He focused on every button and every corner .He lost sleep over the cardboard of the packaging and the color1 of the power cord. He wanted to sell a smart phone that had no keyboard, when physical keys were what had made BlackBerry the most popular smart phone at the time.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.

In this case, the premise does not specify that the red helmet is for firefighting or that the bullhorn is full of water. 4. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.

Review: Frank T. Hopkins may have been charlatan, like so many others of his time and ours, who attempts to mold their personal history to their own advantage.

The claim states that hunters value sea otters for their fur. It is common knowledge that humans have hunted animals for their fur and other resources throughout history. 2. The claim also states that hunting of sea otters led to their near extinction. It is not uncommon for over-hunting to lead to population decline and even near extinction in some species. 3. Combining the two points above, it is reasonable to assume that excessive hunting of sea otters for their fur could have led to their near extinction.

Numerous types of dishes exist that could be considered tasty, and they may not necessarily include pasta as an ingredient. For instance, the dish could be a well-prepared steak, a gourmet pizza, a delicious vegan curry, or a savory piece of cake which the person could find tasty, and none of these examples necessarily have to include pasta in their composition. Even when considering a subset of meals, such as Italian cuisine where pasta is a popular component, there are still dishes not containing pasta that people may find tasty, such as risotto, polenta, or bruschetta. To determine whether there is pasta in the dish, one requires more specific details about the dish, such as a description of its texture, appearance, or a list of its ingredients. Alternatively, a direct inquiry about whether pasta is included in the dish would also provide an accurate answer. In summary, based on the statement \\"This dish is very tasty and I enjoy this dish,\\" it is impossible to tell if there is pasta in the dish.

Moscow is a very important place in a big country called Russia. People in big places like to talk about things that are important to them. But sometimes, people don't agree on everything and that can make some problems. On a day when this big talk happened, some people got very angry and started yelling and arguing with each other. This is what we call a \\"protest.\\" When people protest, they want to share their ideas about what they think is right. But not all protests are the same. Some are very calm and nice, where people just talk and share their ideas. But other protests can get scary when people get mad and start breaking things. This time, some of those angry people started pushing, shoving and yelling at each other very loudly. It was very scary for everybody who was watching. Some people were even using things like sticks and stones to show how angry they were. This isn't good because it can hurt other people and make everyone feel even more scared. The people who help keep the city safe, like the police, came to the place where everyone was arguing. They wanted to make sure that nobody would get hurt. But sometimes, when people get very angry, they don't listen to those who are trying to help. They might even fight against the police and make more trouble. This is when a protest turns violent. When protests become violent, it is a big problem because people can get hurt, and things in the city can get broken. It is important for everyone to remember that talking and sharing ideas is a good thing, but fighting and yelling is not nice. We need to make sure we listen to each other and respect each other's ideas so that everyone can be happy and feel safe together. So, in the end, the big protest in Moscow was a scary time for many people. It's important to remember to use our words to share our ideas, not get mad and create more problems for everyone. Let's hope that the people in Moscow can learn from this and find a better way to share their thoughts without anyone getting hurt."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

The Fineck device aims to address neck pain by tracking tiny movement, spotting bad habits and suggesting exercises via an accompanying app. Made from silicone and titanium , Fineck monitors a wearer's movement, balance, posture and movement thanks to sensors inside. The Mountain View California-based firm says that a high percentage of people suffer from neck pain and associated problems, probably caused by more individuals doing office jobs, which generally involve leaning over computer keyboard. The device contains sensors, several different types of instruments to monitor movement, plus a monitor to shake. It connects to an IOS app via Bluetooth so that wearers can see their bad habits and play \\"neck training\\" games. The app warns of health risks and records a user's activity to build up a customer personal health description. The necklace shakes to give smart advice, such as reminding wearers to sit up straight. The app also allows users to set goals, like many other wearables do. \\"Fineck is the first wearable device for your neck that tracks your neck activity and warn you when you are in a bad posture for too long.

Upon correcting the spacing, we get the following: \\"Specifying the size of the reservoir, the weight load on the coastal zone, and picked up materials for the registration of the coast (sand, pebbles, boulders), we come to the choice of the construction of the reservoir.\\" It seems that the sentence is related to the construction of a reservoir along a coastal area, taking into consideration various factors. In order to better understand each aspect, let's break down the sentence and discuss each element: 1. Specifying the size of the reservoir: Before constructing the reservoir, it is essential to determine its size, capacity, and physical dimensions (length, width, and depth). This information will help the engineers and experts to design a reservoir capable of meeting the water management, storage, or distribution needs of the intended region. 2. The weight load on the coastal zone: Understanding the weight load supported by the coastal zone is important, as it directly affects how the reservoir will be constructed. This weight load includes the reservoir's mass, the water it holds, and any added structures like gates and spillways. Engineers need to account for the coastal zones' existing sediments and geology to ensure that the reservoir's weight can be adequately distributed or managed without causing erosion or other stability issues. 3. Picked up materials for the registration of the coast (sand, pebbles, boulders): Gathering information about the materials found along the coast, such as sand, pebbles, and boulders, will help in the planning and execution of the reservoir construction. These materials can not only impact the stability and structural integrity of the reservoir but might also be utilized as resources during the construction process. Furthermore, the presence of these materials affects the wave action and coastal erosion, which could impact the overall success and longevity of the reservoir. 4. The choice of the construction of the reservoir: After considering all of the above factors – the size of the reservoir, the weight load on the coastal zone, and the materials found along the coast – the engineers, contractors, and decision-makers involved in the project can make informed choices about the design, construction materials, methods, and overall feasibility of the reservoir construction. This process is crucial for ensuring that the reservoir effectively serves its intended purpose while minimizing any negative impacts on the surrounding environment and coastal region. In conclusion, when constructing a coastal reservoir, it is vital to consider various factors such as the reservoir's size, the weight load on the coastal zone, and the materials found along the coast to make informed decisions about the design and construction process. These factors ultimately contribute to the success and longevity of the reservoir, as well as its ability to support the intended water management goals."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person in whose place Hugh Robertson was appointed complex manager at Rockefeller Center? The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose. Rockefeller Center was one of Nelson's primary business ventures until 1958, when he was elected Governor of New York.Public relations officials were hired to advertise the different parts of the complex, such as the gardens and the plaza.

A military source told the Yonhap news agency every part of Pyongyang \\"will be completely destroyed by ballistic missiles and high-explosives shells\\". Yonhap has close ties to South Korea's government and is publicly funded. On Friday North Korea carried out what it said was its fifth, and largest, nuclear test. The international community is considering its response. The US says it is considering its own sanctions, in addition to any imposed by the UN Security Council, Japan and South Korea. Pyongyang responded on Sunday by calling the threats of \\"meaningless sanctions... highly laughable\\". The South Korean military official told Yonhap that Pyongyang districts thought to be hiding the North's leadership would be particularly targeted in any attack. The city, the source said, \\"will be reduced to ashes and removed from the map\\". The BBC's Korea correspondent Steve Evans says the South is using the same bloodcurdling rhetoric that the North frequently uses about the South Korean government in Seoul. He says there has been rising criticism within South Korea of the government as its attempts to isolate the North have failed to deter leader Kim Jong-un's nuclear ambitions. News of South Korea's attack plan for the North is believed to have been revealed to parliament following Friday's nuclear test. Meanwhile, the US's special envoy for North Korea says Washington is considering taking unilateral action against Pyongyang. \\"North Korea continues to present a growing threat to the region, to our allies, to ourselves, and we will do everything possible to defend against that growing threat,\\" Sung Kim said. \\"In addition to sanctions in the Security Council, both the US and Japan, together with [South Korea], will be looking at any unilateral measures as well as bilateral measures as well as possible trilateral cooperation.\\" North Korea is banned by the UN from any tests of nuclear or missile technology and has been hit by five sets of UN sanctions since its first test in 2006. The North said Friday's test had been of a \\"nuclear warhead that has been standardised to be able to be mounted on strategic ballistic rockets\\".

The moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the businessman's beautiful daughter. So he proposed a bargain. The moneylender told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty bag. The girl would then have to pick one pebble from the bag. If she picked the black pebble, she would become the moneylender's wife and he would _ her father's debt. If she picked the white pebble, she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven. But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into jail. They were standing on a pebble-strewn path. As they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. The sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. No doubt she was caught in a dilemma. What would you have done if you were the girl? Careful analysis would produce three possibilities: 1.The girl should refuse to take a pebble. 2.The girl should know that there were two black pebbles in the bag and expose the money-lender as a cheat. 3.The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order to save her father from his debt and imprisonment. The above story is used with the hope that it will make us appreciate the difference between lateral and logical thinking. Read on... The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles. \\"Oh, how clumsy of me!\\" she said. \\"But never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.\\" Since the remaining pebble is black, it must be assumed that she had picked the white one.

Is the review positive or negative? The answer is:","output":"The review is negative. The review provides several clues that point towards a negative sentiment. Firstly, the reviewer describes the product as \\"rather drying\\". In most contexts, especially in beauty, personal care, and cleaning products, 'drying' has a negative connotation. It often implies that the product makes the user's skin feel dry, which is usually an undesirable effect. Next, the reviewer describes the scent of the product, stating that it \\"isn't great.\\" This is also an indicator of their dissatisfaction with the product. A 'great' smell is typically essential to a good user experience, particularly in sectors like beauty, personal care, and cleaning products. Thus, not having a satisfactory scent contributes to their negative sentiment. The reviewer then expresses disappointment because they were expecting the \\"green tea scent would come thru more\\". This demonstrates the product did not meet their expectations in terms of fragrance intensity or quality, adding to the negative sentiment. Finally, the statement \\"used it once and won't again\\" clearly expresses the reviewer's unwillingness to reuse the product, suggesting they were extremely dissatisfied with it. Therefore, given these factors, this can be concluded as a negative review. The reviewer's language and feedback do not indicate any positive feelings or satisfaction with the product, and they express disappointment and dissatisfaction in multiple ways.

Article: The revolution was over by the time Tom Ford started working in the fashion world. The expensive fashion design houses such as Channel, Yves Saint Laurent, and Christian Dior, which earned money by designing and making very expensive custom clothes, had lost many of their wealthy customers. To stay in business, they started selling more reasonably priced ready-to-wear clothing along with a wide range of accessories , that is, related products such as shoes, bags, watches. All of these products needed to blend with the clothing and with each other so that they made up a brand that everyone would recognize and wanted to buy. Though they did not use that name, each company needed a \\"master designer.\\" Born in Texas and growing up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Ford had a diverse background in the arts. Soon after completing high school, he moved to New York, where he studied art history, trained as an actor, and worked as a model. Following that, Ford completed a program in indoor design, but later decided that he was more interested in designing clothes than in decorating house. He was hired by the firm Cathy Hardwick in 1986, where he began to work as a fashion designer. His talent stood out from the rest and soon he moved to Perry Ellis, where he became design director. Then in 1990 he made an important move by taking a position with the New York branch of Gucci, the famous design house based in Milan, Italy. During his first years at Gucci, the company was going through a very difficult period. Its products were once considered highly desirable, and were worn by famous women such as Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, and Jacqueline Kennedy. However, by the early 1990s they had lost their reputation for quality. Other producers had started making cheap, widely available imitations of the brand, and the sales of Gucci's own products had dropped. Things were so bad at one point that Ford was almost fired. However, some people at the company believed in his talent, and in 1994 they hired him to work in Milan as the creative... Question: Why did the author most likely write this passage?

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: How often do people who are conditioned to prefer a calorie-dense diet probably eat high salt foods? === The answer to the above question is Available options: (1). More than once a week. (2). Most times that macaroni and cheese is served. (3). not enough information (4). Usually at lunch time.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Hope is traditionally considered by Christians as a theological virtue (a virtue associated with the grace of God, rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless. In late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that...","output":"There is no specific name of a person mentioned in the context who completed Hope relatively quickly.

In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine.

The luminosity of his nose is so great that it illuminates the team's path through inclement winter weather. Can we draw the following conclusion? Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer can guide the pack through clear weather. OPTIONS: a. Yes b. It's impossible to say c. No","output":"a. Yes Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, with his extraordinary nose that can illuminate the way through inclement weather, has exhibited excellent navigation skills when leading Santa's sleigh. While the primary purpose of his glowing red nose is to provide a guiding light through challenging weather conditions, it can be deduced that Rudolph is skilled at leading Santa's reindeer team, which implies that he would also be able to guide the pack in clear weather. In clear weather, it may not be necessary for Rudolph to use his glowing red nose, but his role as the lead reindeer would still allow him to guide the team. Not only does Rudolph possess a distinct physical advantage in the form of his glowing red nose, but he has also earned the trust and confidence of Santa and the other reindeer. This positions Rudolph as a trusted leader who can ensure the safe and efficient journey of Santa's sleigh, regardless of the specific weather conditions. Santa would not entrust Rudolph with the responsibility of leading the team if he lacked the aptitude for doing so in various types of weather, including clear conditions.

Professor Evans chides her for exhibiting a morbid interest in the rumors surrounding the ruins history. The include tales of unspeakable practices conducted there in medieval times. He reminds her that she is supposed to be avoiding any involvement with the supernatural since her mental breakdown back in Canada months earlier.At the quayside, the professor talks to Porter (Al Cliver), a colleague on his sailboat all about the ruins history in which Porter persuades him to avoid the ruins and concentrate more on the Greek ruins.

(AP) — Kansas State says it will pay a 5,000 fine after its marching band shaped itself into the rival Jayhawk mascot and what appeared to be a large phallus during a halftime show. The school said Tuesday that band director Frank Tracz (trays) will miss the Nov. 28 game against Kansas and that university officials must approval future halftime shows. The university says it decided to pay the self-imposed fine after the Big 12 Conference warned of potential sportsmanship and ethical conduct violations. The controversy erupted after Saturday's space-themed halftime show during the team's home opener against South Dakota. One formation featured the Kansas State band forming the University of Kansas mascot and a phallic looking Starship Enterprise crashing into it. Tracz has apologized for what he described as a \\"misinterpretation.\\" ||||| Kansas State officials have apologized for a marching band routine during Saturday night's season opener that involved the rival Jayhawks and appeared to be adult-oriented in nature. The Kansas State marching band's director will meet with university administrators Tuesday afternoon. The Pride of Wildcat Land marching band's halftime performance Saturday night included a routine where the band created the image of a University of Kansas Jayhawk and what the band's announcer said was the \\"starship Enterprise.\\" The Enterprise then approached the Jayhawk, which then broke up, with band members marching in different directions. Some saw something other than the starship Enterprise, claiming that the image was \\"obscene.\\" Jayhawk fans immediately voiced their complaints about the show on social media. Band leaders announced that the whole thing was a misunderstanding, and that the show was simply \\"the starship Enterprise attacking the beak of the bird.\\" But Kansas State President Kirk Schultz issued an apology following the performance. The story immediately went viral and has been picked up by People Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, London's Daily Mail and many other publications. Band members say their show has been misinterpreted, and Lawrence Journal World sports editor Tom Keegan says that is possible. \\"Maybe they're so nerdy they didn't realize how it looked (to fans)\\" Keegan said while appearing on KCTV5's Off the Bench Sunday night. Keegan also suggested that Kansas State football coach Bill Snyder would not be happy about the situation. \\"Can you imagine at Bill Snyder Family Stadium that went on?\\" Keegan said. \\"Can you imagine how livid, how embarrassed, how ashamed that Bill Snyder must be?\\" Whether Keegan's correct, and the band leaders and members are just too \\"nerdy\\" to understand how their show looked to some others, or whether they're just making excuses for a decision to make fun of their arch rivals, their show has certainly attracted worldwide attention and energized the KU-Kansas State rivalry. The meeting between leaders of the marching band and university administrators will be at 2 p.m. Tuesday. Copyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)

Options: [I] yes; [II] it is not possible to tell; [III] no;","output":"[III] no; The premise states that \\"The Las Vegas Ski and Snowboard Resort has nine long runs on 40 acres (16 hectares);\\" which clearly defines the space available at the resort. It specifies 40 acres (or 16 hectares) as the area on which the resort's operations, including the nine long runs, take place. Since the area is mentioned explicitly and seems to be limited, it does not entail the hypothesis that \\"The Las Vegas Ski and Snowboard Resort has unlimited space.\\" Furthermore, the part of the premise mentioning that \\"snowboarding is allowed only at certain times\\" restricts a certain activity of the resort, but this has nothing to do with the actual physical space the resort occupies. This restriction is more related to how the resort organizes and manages the facility for various activities at specific times or conditions. This still does not provide any support to the hypothesis of unlimited space at the resort.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave.

Suddenly the girls' horse is startled and flees; they try to chase it, but Brigitte's foot gets caught in a trap set by an Indian hunter. Ginger goes back to the camp to find the Indian woman, but the hunter arrives before Ginger returns. The girls view him as a threat until he releases Brigitte and leads them to Fort Bailey where they take refuge. Ginger claims they are the daughters of a trader who drowned, seeking passage East.

By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. In 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at Fresno State College, hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work. At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \\"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\\" She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the Feminist Art Program, a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed 25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials. Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992. Chicago is considered one of the \\"first-generation feminist artists,\\" a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneeman, and Rachel Rosenthal. They were part of the Feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art. Chicago became a teacher at the California Institute for the Arts, and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created Womanhouse, alongside Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art. With Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building in 1973. This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world. This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \\"an experimental program in female education in the arts. Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.\\" During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with geometric forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \\"feminine\\". Chicago was strongly influenced by Gerda Lerner, whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of women's history would continue to struggle independently and collectively. was chicago the leader of the feminist movement","output":"Judy Chicago is not explicitly referred to as the leader of the feminist movement in the provided article.

Fill the baking dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake.; *Place the ramekins filled with cream batter into a baking dish.Fill the garlic press with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake.;","output":"The better solution for preparing ramekins to bake creme brulee is: *Place the ramekins filled with cream batter into a baking dish. Fill the baking dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake. This method is the best approach for baking creme brulee for a few reasons: 1. Uniform heat distribution: Placing the ramekins filled with the cream batter into a baking dish allows for even heat distribution during the baking process. This ensures that the creme brulee cooks evenly and achieves its characteristic smooth and creamy texture. 2. Water bath method: Filling the baking dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the ramekins is a technique called a \\"bain-marie\\" or \\"water bath.\\" The purpose of using a water bath is to provide a gentle, indirect heat source that ensures even cooking. As water can only reach a maximum temperature of 212°F (100°C) before it turns into steam, it helps to prevent the delicate creme brulee from overheating, curdling, or cracking, which could ruin the dessert's texture. 3. Easy handling: By placing the ramekins within a baking dish, it becomes easier to transfer them in and out of the oven. Instead of individually handling each ramekin, you could simply grasp the sides of the baking dish to move all ramekins at once. Moreover, the higher walls of the baking dish can prevent any sloshing or spilling of the hot water during transportation. The second option mentioned: *Place the ramekins filled with cream batter into a baking dish. Fill the garlic press with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake. This method doesn't make sense, as the garlic press has nothing to do with the process of baking creme brulee. It seems to be an error in the description. In fact, a garlic press is a kitchen gadget used for mincing or pressing garlic cloves - it's unrelated to the process of baking or preparing ramekins for creme brulee.

A:","output":"The statement \\"If you don't change, you become extinct\\" is a quote attributed to Spencer Johnson, M.D., the renowned American author who popularized this phrase through his bestselling book \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" which was published in 1998. The book is a parable that teaches readers to adapt to change in order to succeed in various aspects of life, including business and personal relationships. Spencer Johnson, born in 1938 in South Dakota, was a well-respected author and motivational speaker. He graduated from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California, and went on to receive a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from the University of Southern California. He later got his Medical Doctor (M.D.) degree from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. Aside from \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\", Spencer Johnson also wrote numerous books that became bestsellers, including \\"The One Minute Manager\\" co-authored with Kenneth Blanchard, \\"Yes or No: The Guide to Better Decisions\\", \\"The Present: The Secret to Enjoying Your Work and Life, Now!\\", and \\"Peaks and Valleys: Making Good and Bad Times Work for You - At Work and in Life\\". Johnson's works tackled various subjects such as leadership, management, decision-making, personal growth, and finding balance in life. Returning to the quote \\"If you don't change, you become extinct\\", it speaks to the importance of embracing and adapting to change. This idea is a central theme in \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" which tells the story of four characters - Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw - who live in a maze and are in search of cheese, which serves as a metaphor for success, happiness, and the things we pursue in life. The four characters use different approaches in dealing with change as they deal with the disappearance and repositioning of the cheese. The story demonstrates that each individual has a choice regarding how to approach change. Some people might be resistant, fearful, or paralyzed in the face of change, while others may be better at anticipating, adapting, and finding new opportunities. The quote reminds readers that failure to adapt can lead to becoming irrelevant or even obsolete, as the world around us is constantly evolving. In conclusion, the statement \\"If you don't change, you become extinct\\" was written by Spencer Johnson, a widely celebrated American author, in his book \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\". The quote highlights the importance of embracing and adapting to change in order to succeed in different aspects of our lives and to avoid becoming obsolete as the world progresses."},{"instruction":"Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had an ongoing revival? , can you please find it? Agrippina (HWV 6) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel with a libretto by Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani. Composed for the 1709–10 Venice Carnevale season, the opera tells the story of Agrippina, the mother of Nero, as she plots the downfall of the Roman Emperor Claudius and the installation of her son as emperor. Grimani's libretto, considered one of the best that Handel set, is an \\"anti-heroic satirical comedy\\", full of topical political allusions. Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani's political and diplomatic rivalry with Pope Clement XI. Handel composed Agrippina at the end of a three-year sojourn in Italy. It premiered in Venice at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo on 26 December 1709. It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed. Observers praised the quality of the music—much of which, in keeping with the contemporary custom, had been borrowed and adapted from other works, including the works of other composers. Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work, Handel did not promote further stagings. There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel's operas, including Agrippina, fell out of fashion in the mid-18th century. In the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of the work have become ever more common, with innovative stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007.

As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of.

The bicoastal bad girl was busted yet again Thursday for sucker-punching a Florida psychic inside a Manhattan nightclub that had once banned the perpetually troubled former star. “I need space,” Lohan allegedly declared before slamming a fist into palm reader Tiffany Mitchell — who had reportedly offered the actress a free “reading” inside the VIP lounge at Chelsea hotspot Avenue. Hours later, LiLo was accused of lying to California cops about a June 8 crash in which her black Porsche slammed into a dump truck on the Pacific Coast Highway. The legal daily double came after the Tinseltown train wreck and her posse tried to dodge police investigating the predawn Manhattan punch-up, sources told the Daily News. The oft-arrested actress slipped out the club’s back door and into an alley leading to W. 17th St. — only to have her bruised victim identify the fleeing star to cops, sources told The News. “That’s her,” said the tourist as Lohan — sitting in the front passenger seat — tried to escape in a black Cadillac Escalade around 4 a.m. Officers moved in and blocked Lohan from zipping off. The 26-year-old “Mean Girls” star was stunned as cops slapped on the handcuffs. “Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?” she said, according to TMZ.com. Lohan, due back in court Jan. 7, was charged with misdemeanor assault as she continued to wear out her New York welcome. Santa Monica police later added three misdemeanor counts of their own: lying to an officer, obstructing an officer in the course of his duties, and reckless driving. Lohan — already jailed briefly five times — could land behind bars again. RELATED: LILO ARRESTED IN SEPTEMBER AFTER HITTING PEDESTRIAN WITH CAR A California judge will consider whether she violated probation by either the alleged West Coast lies or the East Coast assault. The probation stems from Lohan’s theft of a 2,500 necklace at a Venice Beach jewelry store. Lohan pleaded guilty in 2011 for walking out of Kamofie & Co. with the piece around her neck. Lohan, due to prison overcrowding, has typically spent mere hours in lockup — including a 2007 stay of just 84 minutes. La Lohan, star of the widely panned TV biopic “Liz & Dick,” was brought to the 10th Precinct stationhouse in her clubbing clothes: Leggings, a form-fitting green miniskirt and high heels. She used her one phone call to contact her attorney, sources said — and he wasted little time in defending his repeatedly rehabbed client. “Once again, Lindsay Lohan is a victim of someone trying to capture their 15 minutes of fame,” said Lohan lawyer Mark Jay Heller , who later insisted his his client was not smashed when she slugged Mitchell. “I can tell when I was with her this morning she was in great condition,” Heller told E! News. “She was certainly not intoxicated, certainly not under the influence of drugs.” The husband of puffy-faced victim Mitchell said Lohan launched an unprovoked attack on his wife and then tried to skip out before the NYPD arrived. Mitchell, of Palm Beach, Fla., was with hubby Wayne Stevens, 37, and another couple when a scuffle broke out at a nearby table. CONFIDENTI@AL: NEW PUBLICIST TRIES TO REHAB LINDSAY LOHAN'S IMAGE According to police sources, Mitchell, 28, moved away from the dispute in an attempt to protect herself. She instead strolled into Lohan’s line of fire, the sources said. Lohan, according to some reports, was incensed because singer Max George of boy band The Wanted was ignoring her in favor of the blond Mitchell. But her husband said Lohan lashed out for no reason, with Mitchell taking a shove from behind and then a single bop to the left side of her face. “She pushed my wife pretty hard, and I don’t know why (Lohan) pushed her,” Stevens told The News. “She comes around and told my wife, ‘I need space’ . . . and then she just punched her.” TMZ also reported Mitchell offered the free psychic consultation, but Lohan snubbed it. That’s when she walked away and called Mitchell “a f---ing Gypsy.” Mitchell’s friend stood up for the victim, allegedly prompting the actress to punch the psychic. Stevens denied that part of the TMZ account. Stevens said he called 911 as Lohan scurried from the club. The actress, whose night began at a Justin Bieber concert at Madison Square Garden, later rushed past paparazzi outside the stationhouse with a coat covering her head. Avenue had previously banned Lohan after she tweeted a salacious bit of gossip about Justin Timberlake on a night when both were at the club. Lohan’s father, Michael, in a text to Daily News Confidenti@l, said he wasn’t surprised by his daughter’s arrest — and laid the blame at ex-wife Dina’s doorstep. “Again, it’s ALL on Dina,” he wrote. “She is in a dark place,” he said of his frequent verbal sparring partner. “It’s in God’s hands and I hope he deals with her appropriately.” There was no sign of Lohan at her mother’s Merrick, L.I., home, but Dina Lohan released a statement hours after the latest public spectacle. “As a mother, you always love and pray for the best with all your children,” she said. “Our family’s bond grows deeper and stronger during the tough times.” The charges on both coasts capped the latest woes for the increasingly erratic former child star — including a September scuffle with a congressional aide and a bizarre October blowout with her mom. Lohan, who has struggled with sobriety for years, finished her latest stay at the Betty Ford Center in January 2011.

This ensures that the correction fluid is well-mixed and will cover the error effectively. Step 3: Open the Wite-Out bottle Hold the bottle securely, and carefully unscrew the cap to avoid any spills. The Wite-Out brush or applicator is usually attached to the cap. Step 4: Apply the Wite-Out Using the brush or applicator, dab a small amount of correction fluid onto the error. Try not to use too much, as this can create lumps and take longer to dry. Apply it carefully, ensuring that you completely cover the unwanted text. Step 5: Allow it to dry Wait for the Wite-Out to dry before writing or typing over it. Drying times may vary, but it typically takes a few minutes. Try not to touch the corrected area until it's completely dry, as this can smudge the Wite-Out and cause even more of a mess. Step 6: Write or type over the correction Once the Wite-Out is completely dry, you can write or type over it with the correct text. Be sure that the ink or type is aligned to match the surrounding text. Step 7: Close the Wite-Out bottle When you have finished making corrections, screw the cap back onto the Wite-Out bottle tightly to prevent it from drying out. Store the bottle in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.

Is there power in positive thinking? Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are. The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your friend who is slow to learn that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ . In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written. In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, \\"I am lovable.\\" Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation . In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts. The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic viewpoint. Call it the power of negative thinking. Question: According to the study of the Canadian researchers, _ .

They have a rich history, and many of even the smallest inhabited islands boast dozens of Byzantine churches and medieval castles. - Medieval Greek, also known as Byzantine Greek, is the stage of the Greek language between the end of Classical antiquity in the 5th-6th centuries and the end of the Middle Ages, conventionally dated to the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453. From the 7th century onwards, Greek was the only language of administration and government in the Byzantine Empire. This stage of language is thus described as Byzantine Greek. The study of the Medieval Greek language and literature is a branch of Byzantine Studies, or Byzantinology, the study of the history and culture of the Byzantine Empire. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - The Aegean Islands (transliterated: \\"Nisiá Aigaíou\\") are the group of islands in the Aegean Sea, with mainland Greece to the west and north and Turkey to the east; the island of Crete delimits the sea to the south, those of Rhodes, Karpathos and Kasos to the southeast. The ancient Greek name of the Aegean Sea, \\"Archipelago\\" (\\"archipelagos\\") was later applied to the islands it contains and is now used more generally, to refer to any island group. - The Aegean Sea is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea located between the Greek and Anatolian peninsulas, i.e., between the mainlands of Greece and Turkey. In the north, it is connected to the Marmara Sea and Black Sea by the Dardanelles and Bosphorus. The Aegean Islands are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes. - Saria Island ( Greek : ) is an island in Greece . It is a rocky , volcanic island along the northern edge of Karpathos , separated from it by a strait 100 m ( 330 ft ) wide . It is part of the Dodekanissos archipelago . Administratively , it is part of the community of Olympos . The 2011 census reported a resident population of 45 persons . It has little plant or animal life , and has a number of sharp cliffs . Although only shepherds live on Saria now , the ruins of the ancient city of Nisyros can be found here . It is also a breeding area for Eleonora 's falcons . Although the name is subject to dispute , scholars link it with the name of an ancient Greek Princess named Katherine from a line of Saria royalty . Greek legends say she was as beautiful as Helen of Troy and so they named an Island after her majesty . On the island of Saria , it is recorded history that a kingdom existed named Mikri Nisyros . - Thessaloniki is the second-largest city in Greece and the capital of Greek Macedonia, the administrative region of Central Macedonia and the Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace. Its nickname is (\\"Symprotévousa\\"), literally \\"the co-capital\\", a reference to its historical status as the (\\"Symvasilévousa\\") or \\"co-reigning\\" city of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, alongside Constantinople. - A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef). - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Karpathos is the second largest of the Greek Dodecanese islands, in the southeastern Aegean Sea. Together with the neighboring smaller Saria Island it forms the municipality of Karpathos, which is part of the Karpathos regional unit. Because of its remote location, Karpathos has preserved many peculiarities of dress, customs and dialect, the last resembling those of Crete and Cyprus. The island has also been called Carpathus in Latin, Scarpanto in Italian and Kerpe in Turkish. - Crete (\\"\\" ; Ancient Greek: , \\"Krt\\") is the largest and most populous of the Greek islands, 88th-largest island in the world and the fifth-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus, and Corsica. Crete and a number of surrounding islands and islets constitute the region of Crete, one of the 13 top-level administrative units of Greece. The capital and the largest city is Heraklion. , the region had a population of 623,065. - Cyprus , officially the Republic of Cyprus, is an island country in the Eastern Mediterranean and the third largest and third most populous island in the Mediterranean.

Answer: For some species of waders, migration success depends on the availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: An important stopover location for migratory birds, particularly for waders, is the Yellow Sea, situated between mainland China, the Korean Peninsula, and the Eastern China Sea. This crucial stopover area serves as a resting and refueling point for numerous bird species during their long migrations to and from breeding and wintering grounds, connecting the Arctic breeding grounds in Russia and Alaska to the wintering areas in Southeast Asia and Australia. The Yellow Sea's vast tidal flats and coastal wetlands provide a rich biodiversity of habitats, including mudflats, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, which support a diverse range of invertebrates and small fish. These abundant food resources are vital for the survival of millions of migratory birds that congregate here to rest, molt, and feed in preparation for the next leg of their arduous journeys. Some bird species, like the Red Knot, travel more than 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) in a single migration, dramatically highlighting the importance of such stopover locations. As one of the most significant stopover regions globally, the Yellow Sea is home to millions of birds across 600 distinct migratory bird species, including endangered species like the Spoon-billed Sandpiper, the Great Knot, and the Siberian Crane. During peak migration seasons, this area harbors an extraordinary number of spirited migratory birds that transform the landscape into a lively and bustling scene. Unfortunately, the Yellow Sea is facing severe conservation challenges due to rapid economic development and urbanization. Land reclamation activities, particularly in China and South Korea, have led to significant losses of important tidal habitat – essential for the survival of these migratory birds. The shrinking ecosystem not only affects the birds but also has serious implications for the overall health of the global environment. Efforts to conserve and protect this vital stopover location are underway. The East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership, a network of governments, international NGOs, and site managers, seeks to cooperate in conserving migratory waterbird populations and their habitats, focusing on vital stopover points like the Yellow Sea. Furthermore, both China and South Korea have designated important wetlands in the Yellow Sea as nature reserves and Ramsar Sites, offering some level of legal protection and international recognition. In summary, the Yellow Sea is an irreplaceable and crucial stopover location for migratory birds, especially waders, providing essential resources for their long journeys between breeding and wintering areas. Conserving and protecting this area is vital for preserving global biodiversity and ensuring the survival of the millions of birds that depend on these habitats."},{"instruction":"\\"dangerously collide \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived -- Available options: (I). negative (II). positive Answer:","output":"(I). negative The sentiment of the sentence \\"dangerously collide\\" would be perceived as negative.

The April fiasco in Oklahoma is under formal investigation.","output":"Title: Investigation Launched into Botched Lethal Injection in Oklahoma An autopsy funded by the inmates' lawyer has revealed that the intravenous line (IV) was improperly set, leading to a botched lethal injection and the subsequent death of Clayton Lockett after 43 minutes. The incident, which took place in April, is now under formal investigation in Oklahoma. On the day of the execution, Lockett was scheduled to receive a lethal injection as part of his death sentence. As experts meticulously followed protocol, it quickly became apparent that something was wrong when the IV, which was meant to administer the lethal injection, was not working correctly. This information has been corroborated by a recent autopsy funded by the attorney representing the inmates, bringing this incident to light and prompting a formal investigation. The tragic fiasco raises several questions and concerns about the current state of execution methods in the United States. Lethal injection, which is the standard method of execution in the country, has been under intense scrutiny and criticism over recent years due to incidents like this one - where the method fails to perform as intended, leading to prolonged and agonizing deaths for the convicted. The mishandling of Clayton Lockett's execution has brought forth numerous ethical and legal issues surrounding capital punishment and has added fuel to the ongoing debate regarding the efficiency and humanity of the lethal injection method. With this specific case now under formal investigation, it is expected that many of these questions will be addressed and improvements will be made to ensure the safety and integrity of future executions. As the investigation unfolds, more information will be collected and analyzed to determine exactly what went wrong that day in Oklahoma, and who is responsible for the errors that led to the tragic outcome. Families of the victims and the public at large are awaiting answers to help them make sense of this tragedy and determine whether the current execution procedures are adequate for delivering justice without compromising human dignity. In conclusion, the botched lethal injection of Clayton Lockett has shed light on ongoing issues and concerns within the American execution system.

These workers play a crucial role in the building of durable and high-quality infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, buildings, and more. 1. Concrete placers: These professionals are responsible for accurately placing the freshly mixed concrete at the designated construction site. They must ensure the prepared surface is ready to receive the concrete, usually by compacting and leveling the ground with appropriate machinery. They also calculate the correct amount and consistency of concrete mix needed for a particular project, often using a concrete calculator. Concrete placers must be skilled in working with different types of concrete pumps, mixers, and other equipment used in the construction process. 2. Concrete finishers: Once the concrete is placed, concrete finishers step in to give the surface its desired appearance and texture. This typically involves using specialized tools and equipment, such as trowels, floats, edgers, and screeds. Concrete finishers must have a keen eye for detail and the ability to work quickly, as the time available for finishing a concrete surface is limited by the concrete's setting time. They are responsible for creating the final surface of the structure, ensuring it is smooth, even, and appropriately finished based on the project requirements. 3. Related workers: In addition to the two main specialists who work directly with concrete placement and finishing, there are several other related roles that contribute to the overall process. Some of these roles include: - Rebar installers: These workers are responsible for placing and securing the steel reinforcement bars (rebar) within the concrete structure. The rebar adds strength and stability to the concrete, helping it withstand tension and other forces. - Formwork carpenters: They are responsible for building the temporary molds or forms that hold the concrete in place until it sets. These forms can be constructed from various materials such as wood, metal, or plastic and must be precisely built to create the desired shape and dimensions of the final concrete structure. - Concrete pump operators: These professionals operate the pumps used to transport the concrete mix from the mixer truck to the placement site. They must be skilled in operating, maintaining, and troubleshooting the pump equipment, as well as coordinating with the concrete placer to ensure the correct amount of concrete is delivered to the site. - Laborers: Construction laborers perform a variety of tasks on the job site, from mixing the concrete to cleaning and preparing the surfaces for finishing. They may also assist in setting up the formwork, placing rebar, or supporting the concrete finishers by providing necessary materials and tools. In conclusion, concrete placers, concrete finishers, and related workers are essential members of the construction team, working together to create strong, durable, and visually appealing concrete structures.

A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"Irradiating food prevents what?\\" is food spoilage. Irradiation is a process that involves exposing food to ionizing radiation, typically gamma rays or electron beams, in order to kill or weaken any existing microorganisms in the food. The primary reason for using irradiation in food is to prevent spoilage caused by these microorganisms, which include bacteria, molds, and yeasts. By eliminating or reducing the population of these organisms, the shelf life of the food is extended, thus reducing food waste and ensuring consumer safety. While irradiation does help control the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms, it does not directly prevent discoloration, dehydration, or freezing. These factors are more related to the specific storage or processing conditions of the food itself. However, by slowing the bacterial growth that can contribute to the breakdown of components within the food, irradiation may indirectly help maintain the food's overall appearance, texture, and aroma. Similarly, irradiation does not explicitly prevent bad odors, apoptosis (programmed cell death), or cancer. Bad odors often result from the decomposition of food due to microbial growth, so, by extension, irradiation may help reduce the likelihood of unpleasant smells by delaying spoilage. Apoptosis and cancer are more related to cellular processes and the human body, so they are not directly addressed by irradiating food. In conclusion, the best answer choice is 'spoilage,' as irradiating food primarily aims to prevent spoilage by killing or reducing the number of microorganisms responsible for the deterioration of the food. This process ultimately increases the shelf life, maintains food quality, and helps ensure consumer safety by controlling the growth of potentially harmful bacteria."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Bivalves feed on plankton and nonliving organic matter.

For many people, multitasking has become a way of life and even a key to success. In fact, some excellent mental aerobic exercises involve engaging the brain in two or more challenging activities at a time. Although checking e-mail while talking on a phone and reading the newspaper may be second nature for some people, many times multitasking can make us less productive, rather than more. And studies show that too much multitasking can lead to increased stress, anxiety and memory loss. In order to multitask, the brain uses an area known as the prefrontal cortex . Brain scans of volunteers performing multiple tasks together show that as they shift from task to task, this front part of the brain actually takes a moment of rest between tasks. You may have experienced a prefrontal cortex \\"moment of rest\\" yourself if you've ever dialed a phone number and suddenly forgotten who you dialed when the line is answered. What probably occurred is that between the dialing and the answering, your mind shifted to anther thought or task, and then took that \\"moment\\" to come back. Research has also shown that for many volunteers, job efficiency declines while multitasking, as compared to when they perform only one task at a time. Multitasking is easiest when at least one of the tasks is habitual, or requires little thought. Most people don't find it difficult to eat and read the newspaper at the same time.

Under the proposals, nationals in countries enjoying a 'visa waiver' system of fast-track permission to enter the UK will be hit with a charge of around £10 per visit, which the party said would more than cover the £45 million cost of 1,000 extra border guards. That is a similar sum as the US charges for its equivalent service and Labour said tourism experts did not anticipate it would have any impact on the numbers choosing to travel to Britain. Under Labour's plans, passengers who don't require a visa to enter the UK could be met with a £10 entry fee (File Photo) But Nathan Stower, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (BATA), voiced serious concerns over the proposals. 'While we welcome the desire to improve the customer experience for passengers arriving at the UK border, airlines have significant concerns about this proposal,' he said. 'Visitors from countries like the USA and Australia already pay the highest air passenger tax in the world to fly to the UK – £71 from next April – contributing billions of pounds to the Treasury. Adding yet another charge will make the UK more uncompetitive in attracting tourists, businesses and inbound investment. 'It is not clear how this proposed charge would be collected. The vast majority of visitors from those countries that are not required to obtain a visa to enter the UK, such as the USA, do not currently provide information to UK authorities ahead of their visit. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper believes changes need to be made on the UK's immigration policy. It might not just be your passport you need to show to enter the UK, but also an extra £10. 'Furthermore, if more money were to be raised from airline passengers alone, it would only fair for this to fund improvements in the border at airports and not at other ports of entry such as Calais.' Regular increases in the cost of general visas since 2010 - from £68 to £83 - had not resulted in reduced visitor numbers from countries not benefiting from waiver arrangements, aides said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the plan as part of a wider program of wider reforms she believe needs to be introduced to the UK's policy on immigration.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process, in the context of an earthquake, is the accumulation of energy in the Earth's crust due to the movement of tectonic plates. Tectonic plates are massive pieces of the Earth's lithosphere that float on the softer, more pliable asthenosphere. These plates are constantly moving, driven by the heat and convection currents in the Earth's mantle. As the plates move, they interact with each other, leading to the buildup of stress along fault lines. Fault lines are fractures in the Earth's crust where two plates meet and can either slide past each other, move apart, or collide. The stress at these points continues to build up over time, and when the forces become too great to be contained, the energy accumulated along the fault lines is suddenly released, causing the Earth's crust to rupture or give way. This leads to the subsequent movement of the Earth's plates and the generation of seismic waves, which then shake the Earth as they move through it, resulting in an earthquake."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 1672 = -124*n - 8*n + 220*n for n.","output":"Okay, to help understand this, let's say you have a treasure chest with 1672 gold coins.

Choices: - ground - finger - petri dish - water - soap The rationale to choose \\"water\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"Water. The rationale to choose \\"water\\" as the answer is that bacteria thrive in moist environments, which allows them to produce a slimy biofilm. A biofilm is a protective layer that bacteria create to attach themselves to a surface, and it often has a slimy texture. This type of environment is ideal for bacterial growth and survival, and it can help them resist various environmental stresses. In the other options: - Ground: While bacteria can be found in the soil, they are less likely to form a slimy biofilm on the ground as it is generally a more solid surface than water. - Finger: Bacteria can be present on human skin, including fingers, but the skin itself tends to be a drier environment, and the bacteria don't typically form slimy biofilms on the body. - Petri dish: Although a petri dish can contain a moist environment which promotes bacterial growth, it's not where bacteria are 'likely to be slimy' since the purpose of a petri dish is to isolate and study bacteria in controlled conditions rather than to encourage the formation of biofilms. - Soap: Soaps are designed to remove bacteria and help keep surfaces clean, which makes them less likely to host slimy bacterial colonies. Moreover, the chemical composition of soap can inhibit bacterial growth. Consequently, water is the most suitable answer, as bacteria are more likely to form slimy biofilms in moist environments, and water provides the ideal conditions for this process."},{"instruction":"Nouveau logo, nouveau style, nouvelle Lara, le renouveau des Tomb Raider?

The first one she is calling Glubber, and the second she has named Malk. To try to figure out what type of products these new materials may be used for, Nelly is performing various tests. The first test she is doing is securing one end of the material to a table and then pulling on it and letting it go. When she performs this test on some Glubber, the material quickly snaps back toward the table. Performing the same process with some Malk, the material slowly crawls along the floor as it makes its way back to the table. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which material is less resistant to changing shape? Hint: Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL: The answer to this question is:","output":"Malk is less resistant to changing shape. In the given scenario, when Nelly performs the test and releases the materials after stretching, Glubber quickly snaps back towards the table, indicating that it has a higher resistance to changing shape and greater elasticity. It is able to return to its original shape faster due to the elastic force you described. On the other hand, Malk slowly crawls along the floor on its way back to the table, implying that it is less resistant to changing shape and has lower elasticity. Its slower response to returning to its original shape demonstrates that it has less elastic force compared to Glubber."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a movie review?","output":"As an AI language model, I cannot view movies, but I can provide examples.

You can pinch the sides of the bill to force it into a triangle shape","output":"Alright little buddy, imagine your dollar bill is like a small rectangular piece of paper. Now, let's think about which option can help us make a triangle shape with it: A) Stretching the sides: It's like pulling the corners of your rectangle. But unfortunately, we can't really make the paper or dollar bill longer or shorter by doing that. B) Pinching the sides: It means folding the paper or dollar bill in a way that it takes the shape of a triangle. This is what we need to do. We can fold the bill by bringing its corners together, and it will make a triangle shape. So, option B is the best way to create a triangle in a dollar bill.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing? Possible answers: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","output":"[b]. yes; Both sentences convey the same central idea, which is that during MacDonald's retirement, he wrote/compiled a resource called the \\"Macdonald dictionary of Canterbury biographies,\\" consisting of 12,000 biographies, now held or managed by the Canterbury Museum. In Sentence 1, the term \\"compiled\\" is used, while in Sentence 2, the term \\"wrote\\" is used. Although these words have slightly different connotations, in this context, they essentially describe the same process of creating this dictionary of biographies. \\"Compiled\\" suggests that MacDonald gathered these biographies, potentially from other sources or works, whereas \\"wrote\\" implies that he authored the biographies himself. Regardless, both words indicate that MacDonald was behind the creation of this collection. Additionally, Sentence 1 uses the phrase \\"held by,\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"run by\\" to describe the relationship between the biographies collection and the Canterbury Museum. The phrases differ ever so slightly in meaning: \\"held by\\" implies that the museum possesses and stores the biographies, whereas \\"run by\\" suggests that the museum actively manages or curates the collection. Despite the nuanced difference between the two phrases, it is clear that the Canterbury Museum is responsible for the 12,000 biographies in question. In both sentences, the key elements remain consistent: MacDonald's retirement, the creation of the \\"Macdonald dictionary of Canterbury biographies,\\" the presence of 12,000 biographies, and the Canterbury Museum's involvement with the collection. Consequently, these sentences can be seen as having the same meaning."},{"instruction":"Question: The person took a ibuprofen after experiencing a headache, what happened to him next? Options: - feel relieved - cross street - learn to swim - walk - act responsibly Explain why a human would choose \\"feel relieved\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"feel relieved\\" as the answer to the question above because ibuprofen is a common over-the-counter medication that is widely used to help relieve pain, such as headaches. When taken in appropriate doses, it can effectively reduce inflammation and alleviate pain, providing a sense of relief for the person experiencing the headache. The other options presented in the question do not directly relate to the act of taking ibuprofen for a headache. These options include: - Cross street: This is an unrelated action to taking medication for a headache and does not describe the possible outcome of taking ibuprofen. - Learn to swim: This is also an unrelated action and does not explain the possible effects of taking ibuprofen for a headache. - Walk: While taking a walk can sometimes help alleviate a headache, it does not directly relate to the specific action of taking ibuprofen. - Act responsibly: This option could be interpreted in various ways and does not specifically address the outcome of taking ibuprofen for a headache. Given the context of taking ibuprofen to treat a headache, \\"feel relieved\\" is the most appropriate answer as it directly addresses the intended result of the action, which is to reduce pain and discomfort."},{"instruction":"Please check if these have the same meaning.

They both study horticulture. They've been studying ants lately for their entomology class. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student learned less about ants that manage large herds of aphids ? Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.

Now, if Joseph is in better shape, he's like a very organized Lego master who can break down and use those blocks more efficiently or quickly. Benjamin, on the other hand, might be slower at it because he's probably not as practiced or as organized as Joseph in breaking down the Lego blocks, or in this case, the food he eats.

When Maurice Edu cancelled out a Kari Arnason opener at Ibrox 56 months ago, no one foresaw the length of time that would elapse without one of Scotland's headline matches. A powder-keg head-to-head that is, according to some Ibrox legends, as intense as anything a Rangers-Celtic game conjures up. Rangers captains of the past Terry Butcher and Barry Ferguson talk of \\"hatred\\" and \\"nastiness\\" but, with the game a sell-out, Aberdeen fans are clearly relishing a return. Many in light blue have accused the Dons of \\"raising their game\\" against Rangers but the men in red prevailed just once in the last 13 games against them before the Ibrox club's 2012 financial implosion. However, those matches came before manager Derek McInnes arrived at Pittodrie to steer the club to the upper echelons of the table with Aberdeen a very different animal under the former Ibrox midfielder. Despite Walter Smith's presence, Pittodrie tended to be an unhappy hunting ground throughout his second spell in charge with the Ibrox legend winning just once in the Granite City after replacing Paul le Guen. \\"Aberdeen always have a good attitude towards games against Rangers,\\" Smith declared after a 1-0 loss in the north east in 2009. No doubt a thinly-veiled barb given they had won just twice in their previous 12 league games that season. Pittodrie has been a struggle for many Rangers teams, but in particular the ones that came up against Alex Ferguson's all-conquering side. Incredibly, during Ferguson's eight-year tenure at Aberdeen, Rangers could only muster one single victory at Pittodrie. Ferguson would lose just five times to Rangers in league games, with four of those at Ibrox. If Rangers' Pittodrie record in the late 1970s and early 80s was dreadful, Aberdeen's record at Ibrox since the early 90s has been atrocious. Brian Grant and Eoin Jess were the heroes in a 2-0 win in Govan in September 1991. It was Aberdeen's first visit to Ibrox since they lost by the same score-line four months earlier, costing them the Premier Division title. But they haven't won there since. That's 42 visits, 0 victories. And it's not just against Rangers they have struggled against at Ibrox as that figure includes a League Cup semi-final loss to Celtic and in the last four of the Scottish Cup to St Johnstone. Ferguson led Aberdeen to 17 league victories over the Ibrox club and since his departure, almost exactly 30 years ago, the Dons have beaten Rangers on 18 occasions in top flight matches, with 11 different managers. When seeking the answer to the why this fixture is so heated, one of the main reasons is simple and sporting, very few head-to-heads between the pair have been meaningless over the years. From the 1970s, this has been a heavyweight clash, with silverware often up for grabs. The list of on-pitch incidents are lengthy. Particularly those involving John McMaster and Willie Johnston and Neil Simpson and Ian Durrant. Robbie Winters being pelted with coins, Fernando Ricksen's kung-fu kick on Darren Young, Kyle Lafferty feigning a head-butt from Charlie Mulgrew. It is a game that requires vigilance and cool heads on and off the pitch. During Rangers' four-year rise to the Premiership they faced many top flight opponents along the way. Aberdeen were not one of them. And despite the headlines and goading that will continue in the build-up to this eagerly-awaited meeting, it is worth noting that it is an important league game. Both have designs on challenging Celtic for the title yet they both find themselves four points off the pace having played a game more than the champions. Regardless of the sub-plots, this may be a game neither can afford to lose even this early in the campaign with a potential 10 point deficit on the cards for the loser. A summary of the above article is?","output":"This article discusses the intense rivalry between Scottish football clubs Aberdeen and Rangers, highlighting historical matches, records, and on-pitch incidents that have fueled tensions between the two teams over the years. Both clubs have ambitious plans to challenge Celtic for the league title, but currently find themselves trailing by four points despite having played one more game than the reigning champions. The upcoming match between Aberdeen and Rangers is crucial for both teams, as the losing side could face a potential 10-point deficit early in the campaign."},{"instruction":"My family and I were visiting Las Vegas and we stopped in for some Thai food.

Article: The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

Place your camera. Place your lights. Use the rule of thirds. Make sure your shooting location is quiet before filming. Edit your video.\\" Article:","output":"Article Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Producing High-Quality Videos Creating high-quality engaging video content is an art that combines both technical skill and creative vision. It requires a balanced blend of understanding the right background, placement, lighting, composition, as well as editing proficiency. Step 1: Choose Your Background The first step in video production involves identifying a suitable background. This aspect is paramount since the background can significantly influence the mood and tone of the video. It helps to ensure that the background complements the subject or topic of your video, rather than being a distraction. This could be a solid, neutral colour for a professional look, a natural setting for more relaxed videos, or an environment relevant to the theme of your content. Choosing the right background not only improves the aesthetic appeal of the video but also increases viewer engagement. Step 2: Place Your Camera Once you have chosen the ideal background, the next step requires the strategic positioning of your camera. Camera placement can have a profound effect on viewer interpretation. It is crucial that the camera is placed at eye level to establish a relatable and genuine connection with the viewer. It’s also vital to contemplate the framing and positioning based on the type of shot you need. Always ensure you have a tripod or a property camera setup to reduce shake and provide a better viewing experience. Step 3: Light it Up Good lighting is vital to produce high-quality video content. Lighting sets the scene’s mood and greatly impacts the perception and professionalism of the video. Soft, natural lighting is often best, but in spaces where lighting is poor, using professional lighting kits can hugely enhance the video's quality. Ensure lighting is placed strategically to illuminate the subject properly without causing harsh shadows or overexposure. Step 4: Use the Rule of Thirds When composing your shot, the 'Rule of Thirds' is a useful guideline to consider. Imagine your scene divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines. Placing your subject along these lines or at their intersection can add balance and interest to your composition, making it more engaging for the viewers. Step 5: Ensure a Quiet Location for Filming This step often gets neglected in the preparation for video production, yet it is one of the most crucial aspects. Ensuring a quiet location for filming is key to capturing clear audio without disruptions. Audio quality is as important as video quality, and background noise can adversely affect the viewing experience. Step 6: Edit Your Video Lastly, after successfully shooting the video, the task is not over yet. Your raw footage requires fine-tuning and polishing through video editing. This phase can totally transform the appearance and quality of your video. Video editing allows you to adjust colour balance, add special effects, sound, and text overlays, crop out unnecessary parts, merge clips, and much more. In conclusion, the journey to producing high-quality videos may seem daunting at first glance, but with careful preparation and the right techniques, you'll be on your way to creating stunning, impactful video content. Remember to exercise creativity - this realm has no hard-set rules. What's outlined in this article are guidelines, the rest is up to your artistic interpretation and your audience's preference."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

It's like asking, \\"What number do we get when x gets very, very close to 0?\\" Second question: Again, this one is also asking for a limit when x gets closer to 0. But the expression (the math stuff inside the limit) is different from the first one. It looks more complicated, right? So, to make it simpler, we can use something called the Binomial Theorem to help! After using this, we find that the answer to this question is 45/9, which is actually equal to 5. So, are these two questions asking the same thing? The answer is: +no; Even though both questions are asking for a limit as x gets closer to 0, the expressions inside the limits are different, and their answers are different as well. I hope that helps, little buddy!"},{"instruction":"Gadget & the Gadgetinis is a Canadian–French-Italian TV series spin-off of the 1983 series \\"Inspector Gadget\\", developed by DiC Entertainment in cooperation with Haim Saban's SIP Animation and released 2001–2003.

Smart Home technology aims to simplify our daily lives by providing improved home automation and security, increased energy efficiency, and greater convenience in managing household tasks. It works by integrating various devices and appliances in the house, enabling them to communicate with each other to facilitate the automation and control systems within the house. The ultimate goal is to have a fully interconnected home that can be easily managed and accessed through a single platform or app on your smartphone or tablet. Gone are the days when the idea of a Smart Home was only possible by buying expensive, proprietary \\"in-a-box\\" solutions. These solutions often came with a hefty price tag and limited compatibility with other devices, making it challenging for homeowners to implement smart technology throughout their homes effectively. The main idea of the Smart Home has evolved beyond these “in a box” solutions, which means people are no longer limited to specific brands or devices to control and automate their homes. The focus has now shifted to improving the accessibility of “do it yourself” (DIY) solutions. DIY Smart Homes are more customizable, flexible, and affordable than most pre-packaged solutions. They allow homeowners to pick and choose the devices they want to include in their smart home ecosystem, enabling them to tailor their Smart Home according to their unique needs and preferences. These DIY solutions typically involve purchasing individual smart devices, such as lights, thermostats, cameras, door locks, and more, which are compatible with various ecosystems like Apple HomeKit, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa. The interoperability of this approach ensures a seamless and streamlined user experience, making it easy for individuals to control and manage all their devices from a single app or voice command. With the help of online resources, forums, and tutorials, homeowners can now easily learn how to set up, configure, and troubleshoot their own Smart Home system without the need for costly professional assistance. The rise of DIY solutions has promoted rapid innovation and competition in the smart home market, resulting in a broad range of choices and cost-effective options for consumers. In conclusion, the main idea of Smart Home systems has evolved considerably from expensive, pre-packaged \\"in a box\\" solutions to more accessible and affordable \\"do it yourself\\" options. This shift has made smart home technology reachable to a wider audience and allows homeowners to create customized and interconnected smart home environments that cater to their specific needs and preferences."},{"instruction":"Question: I can use this background: A firm with high fixed costs requires a large number of customers in order to have a meaningful return on investment. This is where economies of scale become important. Since each firm has large initial costs, as the firm gains market share and increases its output the fixed cost (what they initially invested) is divided among a larger number of customers. Therefore, in industries with large initial investment requirements, average total cost declines as output increases over a much larger range of output levels. Now, I have a new situation: City D's mayor wants to invite more businesses in the city. Three firms, firm A, firm B, and firm C, took advantage of this opportunity. Firm A does not require large initial costs, but firm B and firm C require large initial costs. Firm B managed to increase its market share, but firm C failed to increase its market share. Answer this question please: Which frim's average total cost would decline, firm B or firm C? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided background information and the situation in City D, Firm B's average total cost would decline. The primary reason for this conclusion is the concept of economies of scale, which come into play when a firm with high fixed costs – such as Firm B and Firm C – gains a larger market share and increases its output. As more customers are acquired and output grows, these firms can spread their large initial investment over a greater number of customers, thus reducing the average total cost. Since Firm A does not require a large initial cost, it cannot take advantage of economies of scale in the same way as Firm B and Firm C. Therefore, discussing its average total costs would not be relevant to the question. In the case of Firm B and Firm C, both have high fixed costs due to their large initial investments. However, only Firm B managed to increase its market share, while Firm C failed to do so. As a result, Firm B can leverage its increased market share to spread its fixed cost over a larger customer base, which leads to a reduction in its average total cost. On the other hand, Firm C's failure to increase its market share means that it cannot distribute its initial investment as widely among customers. This implies that its average total cost would not decline as significantly, or may even stay high, due to its inability to achieve economies of scale. In conclusion, taking the background information and the specific situation in City D into account, Firm B's average total cost is the one that would decline, as it successfully increased its market share and output, allowing it to benefit from the economies of scale. In comparison, Firm C failed to achieve the same market growth, which would prevent its average total cost from declining."},{"instruction":"Aubriella is pouring water into a 50-gallon fish tank at the rate of 1 gallon every 20 seconds.

Yes or no? Answer: A number of iodine radioisotopes are also used in medical applications. Question: where do you find iodine The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, a number of iodine radioisotopes are indeed used in medical applications. Now, let me provide you with a detailed and extensive answer to the question: Where do you find iodine? Iodine is a chemical element that plays a crucial role in various aspects of life, especially in human health. The chemical symbol for iodine is 'I', and it has an atomic number of 53. Iodine is a halogen and can be found in various sources in nature as well as in some human-made products. 1. Seawater: Iodine is naturally found in seawater, albeit in low concentrations. The sea is considered one of the most significant sources of iodine due to the vast volume of water it contains. Seawater contains around 50-60 micrograms of iodine per liter, which accounts for approximately 0.05 ppm (parts per million). 2. Marine Algae and Seaweeds: Marine organisms, such as algae and seaweeds, absorb iodine from seawater and accumulate it in their tissues. Consequently, they are considered excellent sources of iodine. Notably, brown seaweeds like kelp, kombu, and arame contain high levels of iodine, with up to 1-2% of their dry weight being iodine. 3. Soil: Iodine can also be found in the earth's crust, specifically in the soil. However, the concentration of iodine in soil varies significantly based on factors such as geographical location, altitude, and soil type. Typically, iodine content in soil ranges from 1 to 300 ppm, with higher concentrations found in coastal regions and lower concentrations in mountainous areas. 4. Iodine-Rich Foods: Some foods naturally contain iodine, primarily due to the presence of the element in the soil and water from which they are grown or harvested. Examples of iodine-rich foods include fish, shellfish, dairy products, eggs, iodized salt, and some bread. Consuming a balanced diet that includes these food sources can help people meet their recommended daily iodine intake. 5. Iodine Supplements and Fortified Products: Iodine is available in various supplements and fortified products, such as iodized salt, multivitamin tablets, and iodine-containing solutions. These products are often used to help prevent iodine deficiency in populations where iodine-rich food sources are limited, or the soil's iodine content is low. 6. Industrial Applications: Some iodine compounds, such as potassium iodide and sodium iodide, are used in industries like photography, water treatment, and the manufacturing of LCD panels. 7. Medical Applications: As mentioned earlier, several iodine radioisotopes are used in medical applications. These isotopes, such as Iodine-131 and Iodine-123, are utilized in diagnostic imaging, radioimmunotherapy, and therapeutic treatments for conditions like thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. In conclusion, iodine is an essential element that can be found in various natural and human-made sources, including seawater, marine organisms, soil, iodine-rich foods, supplements, fortified products, and certain medical and industrial applications. Regularly consuming a diet with adequate iodine is crucial for maintaining good health, as iodine plays a vital role in the proper functioning of the thyroid gland and other essential processes within the body."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work fell from favor during his later years? , can you please find it? Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his...

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In our culture, the sources of what we call a sense of \\"mastery\\" - feeling important and worthwhile - and the sources of what we call a sense of \\"pleasure\\" - finding life enjoyable - are not always the same. Women often are told \\"You can't have it all.\\" Sometimes what the speaker really is saying is: \\"You chose a career, so you can't expect to have closer relationships or a happy family life.\\" or \\"You have a wonderful husband and children--What's all this about wanting a career?\\" But women need to understand and develop both aspects of well-being, if they are to feel good about themselves. Our study shows that, for women, well-being has two dimensions. One is mastery, which includes self-esteem, a sense of control over your life, and low levels of anxiety and depression. Mastery is closely related to the \\"doing\\" side of life, to work and activity. Pleasure is the other dimensions, and it is composed of happiness, satisfaction and optimism. It is tied more closely to the \\"feeling\\" side of life. The two are independent of each other. A woman could be high in mastery and low in pleasure, and vice versa . For example, a woman who has a good job, but whose mother has just died, might be feeling very good about herself and in control of her work life, but the pleasure side could be damaged for a time. The concepts of mastery and pleasure can help us identify the sources of well-being for women, and remedy past mistakes. In the past, women were encouraged to look only at the feeling side of life as the source of all well-being. But we know that both mastery and pleasure are critical. And mastery seems to be achieved largely through work. In our study, all the groups of employed women rated significantly higher in mastery than did women who were not employed. A woman's well-being is enhanced when she takes on multiple roles. At least by middle adulthood, the women who were involved in a combination of roles-marriages, motherhood, and employment were the highest in well-being, despite warnings about stress and strain.

The key findings — based on interviews with 460 randomly selected iPhone users in the United States — are summarized in a dozen Quick Facts and ten Implications, both available here. Some of the bullet points: The full 35-page white paper — with color charts — can be downloaded as a PDF from the same Rubicon site. It’s easy reading and worth your time. For those of you who don’t make it all the way to the white paper, three charts struck me as particularly useful. The first is a bar chart showing what people do with their iPhones — daily, occasionally or never. Checking e-mail jumps out as the No. 1 thing most do every day, but it’s interesting how many fewer actually compose e-mail on the device. And it’s also interesting to see what most iPhone users never or rarely do with the device — like buy music, watch videos or read maps. One function we wish had been included in the first chart — use the iPhone to make and receive phone calls — is explored in the pie chart below. It turns out, one out of three iPhone owners carry around two phones. The RIM RIMM BlackBerry is the most popular second phone — used by nearly one in ten iPhone owners. Mace speculates that that will probably change when the iPhone gets Exchange support. But we wonder how many iPhone owners keep a simple, cheap cell phone with them either because they’re running out their contract with their original carrier or because it just works better as a phone. The third chart is the one that shows whose ox got gored when Apple entered the smartphone market. The big loser was Motorola MOT ; nearly a quarter of iPhone owners traded up from a Razr. Another big slice comes from RIM, but Mace believes that it’s Microsoft MSFT — squeezed between Apple and GOOG — that faces the biggest challenge down the road. More on that below the chart. Here’s why Mace believes Microsoft faces “severe challenges” in the smartphone market: Microsoft’s Windows Mobile is sandwiched between two big competitors, Google and Apple. Apple is crafting hardware-software systems that deliver a great user experience, while Google is giving away an operating system to the very companies that license Windows Mobile today. It’s possible for Microsoft to try to compete on both fronts, but creating a proprietary device and at the same time selling an operating system to others is extraordinarily difficult (Palm tried to do it and ended up splitting the company in two). We think Microsoft should probably decide whether it wants to compete in devices (in which case it will need to create its own phones, as it did for music players with the Zune) or compete in operating systems (in which case it will probably have to give away Windows Mobile for free). Both alternatives are very high-risk, and require business models that are outside Microsoft’s core competencies. The company’s recent purchase of Danger, which designed the TMobile Sidekick, may indicate that it intends to go the device route.

Last summer, he was studying the evolution of two different salamander species, species A and species B. Species A salamander was Gold-striped salamander while species B salamander was fire salamander. He found it interesting that they took different approaches to adapt to different habitats. Which species would be more successful in reproduction, Species A or species B? Hint: Consider the antlers of the Irish elk, (often supposed to be far too large; in deer antler size has an allometric relationship to body size). Obviously, antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resource. Their size during the last glacial period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time. As another example, camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid coloration is displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction.Stream-dwelling salamanders, such as Caucasian salamander or Gold-striped salamander have very slender, long bodies, perfectly adapted to life at the banks of fast small rivers and mountain brooks. Elongated body protects their larvae from being washed out by current. However, elongated body increases risk of desiccation and decreases dispersal ability of the salamanders; it also negatively affects their fecundity. As a result, fire salamander, less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats, is in general more successful, have a higher fecundity and broader geographic range. A:","output":"Considering the information provided, Species B (fire salamander) would be more successful in reproduction. While species A (Gold-striped salamander) has adaptations beneficial for survival in stream habitats, these adaptations also increase their risk of desiccation, decrease their dispersal ability, and negatively affect their fecundity. On the other hand, the fire salamander is less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats but has higher fecundity and a broader geographic range, which contributes to its overall reproductive success."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What is the name of God's son?\\" is in \\"Witnesses believe that a \\"little flock\\" go to heaven, but that the hope for life after death for the majority of \\"other sheep\\" involves being resurrected by God to a cleansed earth after Armageddon.

Even so, the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods, and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods.

White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance.

The first part of the sentence, \\"Michael has accomplished more in his career than Kenneth,\\" indicates a comparison between the career achievements of Michael and Kenneth and sets up an expectation that the reason for this difference will be explained. Option 1, \\"Michael worked hard every step of the way,\\" offers this explanation. It implies that Michael's sustained hard work throughout his career has contributed to him having more accomplishments than Kenneth. On the other hand, option 2, \\"Kenneth worked hard every step of the way,\\" does not provide a clear explanation for the difference in career achievements between the two. While it acknowledges that Kenneth has also put in considerable effort in his career, it does not directly relate this effort to the comparison made in the first part of the sentence. Instead, it leaves the reader wondering how Kenneth's hard work relates to the point being made. In conclusion, the sentence should end with \\"Michael has accomplished more in his career than Kenneth because Michael worked hard every step of the way.\\" This option maintains a clear connection between Michael's hard work and his greater accomplishments, providing the reader with a logical and satisfying explanation for the comparison made in the first part of the sentence."},{"instruction":"What happens next?

Barcelona face Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday. Luis Enrique's side go into the first leg of the last-16 tie at the Emirates unbeaten in 32 league and cup games and aiming for unprecedented back-to-back Champions League titles. Spain's top two teams - Barca and Real - previously negotiated their own TV deals, but have now been stopped from doing so under a new Spanish law. It means new rules will see rights to show La Liga pooled and sold collectively, bringing it more in line with the Premier League - which will see the bottom club still earn £99m next season. He added: \\"The Premier League is the best football competition. It has the most interest for fans and most revenues. They are doing things good and keeping teams in the competition where everyone being equal is of interest for everybody. \\"We have different budgets in Spain and it would be difficult for someone like [current Premier League leaders] Leicester to be top of the league. \\"Our rivals are the Premier League, they are the big adversaries. We have to do our best to increase our revenues and our financial situation to make the talent of our teams stay with us. \\"That is why I am so worried and we are working on this. We want to keep the talent at home. \\"I know our players are in touch with other clubs, it's normal. None of our players said they want to leave. Most get better economical offers, but our players are not in Barcelona for the money, they are there because of the football and the fans' commitment.\\" This summer, ex-Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola will take over at Manchester City. The Spaniard won 14 trophies in four years at the Nou Camp. City's chief executive officer Ferran Soriano and director of football Txiki Begiristain both previously worked at Barcelona. \\"I don't think City are replicating anything,\\" said Bartomeu. \\"Like a lot of clubs in the world, they have a project to make the club grow. \\"Some of their people used to be with us at Barcelona and they are bringing their experience to the club.

Real's 577m euros earnings (£439m) put Barcelona into second place with 560.8m euros (£426m), with Manchester United in third on 519.5m euros (£395m). But Bartomeu said his goal is to reach 1,000m euros (£780m) annual revenue to \\"develop our club and make it bigger\\". He said that in the next 12 months, Barcelona may decide to have \\"title rights holders\\" for the Nou Camp to help raise 420m euros (£327m) to refurbish the famous stadium and increase its 99,750 capacity. Bartomeu said there \\"may be controversy\\", but that all key decisions \\"would be voted on\\". One off-field issue which has led to speculation that Barcelona's top stars will leave Spain is problems with tax. Defender Javier Mascherano is expected to avoid jail despite admitting tax fraud, while fellow Argentina international and world player of the year Messi faces trial alongside his father in the summer over tax fraud charges. Team-mate Neymar has denied any connection with allegations of corruption and fraud surrounding his transfer to Barcelona. In a separate tax fraud case in his native Brazil, the striker has had 50m (£34.5m) of assets frozen by a court.

Barcelona won their fifth Champions League crown last season, but what would happen if they didn't qualify for the competition one season? \\"Sometimes, for the interest of football, why not give wildcards like in tennis,\\" says Bartomeu. \\"Sometimes the top players don't qualify and are given wildcards for the interest. This can happen in football. That is the decision of Uefa. \\"Sometimes, clubs have a bad season and it is a big punishment to not play in the Champions League.

Her brother, the Duke of Norfolk, was first imprisoned, then pardoned. He was imprisoned again following the Ridolfi plot in 1571 and finally executed in 1572. Norfolk's treason charges included \\"comforting and relieving of the English rebels that stirred the Rebellion in the North since they have fled out of the realm.\\" Altogether, 600 supporters of Mary were executed, while many others fled into exile.

This uncertainty stems from the complex nature of the Earth's geological processes and the limitations of current technology."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation: Jovial informal and downtoearth he could easily have passed for a businessman","output":"Jovial, informal, and down-to-earth, he could easily have passed for a businessman."},{"instruction":"Generate short a sentence that can be linguistically classified as (2).

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Some furnishings for the remodelling of the structure, which later became a palace, were bought from two main sources. First, they were transferred from Carlton House, which was King George IV's former residence. Secondly, additional furnishings were purchased in France, following the French Revolution. These acquisitions aimed to create a comfortable and visually appealing environment in line with King George IV's vision of a small, luxurious palace."},{"instruction":"Parlamentul European şi Consiliul recunosc că Fosta Republică Iugoslavă a Macedoniei, Muntenegru şi Serbia îndeplinesc toate condiţiile pentru liberalizarea vizelor.

(5) Waiver authority.--The head of the agency awarding a covered contract may waive a requirement of this section with respect to a contract in an emergency or exceptional situation, as determined by the head of the agency. Any such waiver shall be limited to the requirements that are impossible or impracticable to implement because of the emergency or exceptional situation. In any case in which the head of an agency waives a requirement under this section with respect to a contract, the agency head shall submit to Congress a report, within 30 days after the date of award of the contract, that describes the contract, the waiver, the emergency or exceptional situation that justified the waiver, and a plan for bringing the contract into compliance with the waived requirements as soon as possible or an explanation of why the waiver needs to be permanent.

(2) Comparative analysis.--Before a Federal agency enters into a covered contract, the Secretary of Defense shall perform a cost and effectiveness analysis for every category of potential activity that may be carried out by the private security contractor under the contract, comparing the cost and effectiveness that would be associated with the same activities being carried out by civilian employees of the Department of Defense or members of the Armed Forces.

Given the prompt and a response, classify the them to \\"yes\\" if response is \\"yes, and\\" type. Otherwise classify it as \\"no\\". \\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\"). 1 In short, a \\"Yes, and\\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. Note that a \\"Yes, and\\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if it agrees with the description above. There are many ways in which a response could implicitly/explicitly agree to the prompt without specifically saying 'yes, and...'. Prompt: I mean, I don't want to brag, but I know a lot about cars.

Output:","output":"Part #1: Definition of a \\"Yes, and\\" response. Usage: A \\"Yes, and\\" response should accept the information given in the prompt and then build upon it with additional information or context. The response does not have to explicitly say \\"Yes, and,\\" but it should align with the general principle. Example: Prompt: I mean, I don't want to brag, but I know a lot about cars. That's my passion; that's my love right there, and you've got a beautiful Passat. Response: Thanks! I actually got it customized last week to have some additional features. Do you have any recommendations for maintenance? Explanation: The response acknowledges the prompt by thanking the speaker, and then adds new information about the car (customization) and asks a question about maintenance, which builds on the shared topic of cars. Part #2: Definition of a \\"No\\" response. Usage: A \\"No\\" response is one that does not accept or build upon the information in the prompt. It could be a response that ignores the context, contradicts the statement, or does not add any new information on the presented topic. Example: Prompt: I mean, I don't want to brag, but I know a lot about cars. That's my passion; that's my love right there, and you've got a beautiful Passat. Response: Yeah, it's not easy to get out of here. It is hard as hell. Explanation: The response does not address the topic of cars, the speaker's passion, or the compliment about the Passat. Instead, it offers a separate statement about difficulty in getting out of a place, not building on the provided context. Thus, it is classified as a \\"No\\" response."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Babylonian astronomers had developed arithmetical techniques for calculating astronomical phenomena; Greek astronomers such as Hipparchus had produced geometric models for calculating celestial motions. Ptolemy, however, claimed to have derived his geometrical models from selected astronomical observations by his predecessors spanning more than 800 years, though astronomers have for centuries suspected that his models' parameters were adopted independently of observations. Ptolemy presented his astronomical models in convenient tables, which could be used to compute the future or past position of the planets. The Almagest also contains a star catalogue, which is a version of a catalogue created by Hipparchus. Its list of forty-eight constellations is ancestral to the modern system of constellations, but unlike the modern system they did not cover the whole sky (only the sky Hipparchus could see). Across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa in the Medieval period, it was the authoritative text on astronomy, with its author becoming an almost mythical figure, called Ptolemy, King of Alexandria. The Almagest was preserved, like most of extant Classical Greek science, in Arabic manuscripts (hence its familiar name). Because of its reputation, it was widely sought and was translated twice into Latin in the 12th century, once in Sicily and again in Spain. Ptolemy's model, like those of his predecessors, was geocentric and was almost universally accepted until the appearance of simpler heliocentric models during the scientific revolution. His Planetary Hypotheses went beyond the mathematical model of the Almagest to present a physical realization of the universe as a set of nested spheres, in which he used the epicycles of his planetary model to compute the dimensions of the universe. He estimated the Sun was at an average distance of 1,210 Earth radii, while the radius of the sphere of the fixed stars was 20,000 times the radius of the Earth. Ptolemy presented a useful tool for astronomical calculations in his Handy Tables, which tabulated all the data needed to compute the positions of the Sun, Moon and planets, the rising and setting of the stars, and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Ptolemy's Handy Tables provided the model for later astronomical tables or zijes. In the Phaseis (Risings of the Fixed Stars), Ptolemy gave a parapegma, a star calendar or almanac, based on the hands and disappearances of stars over the course of the solar year. Answer this question \\"Was he able to predict movement of the stars\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, Ptolemy was able to predict the movement of the stars.

Based on Emeric Pressburger's novel A Mouse on Sunday, Behold a Pale Horse stars Gregory Peck as a Republican war veteran Manuel Artiguez who continues waging a one-man offensive 20 years after hostilities have officially ceased. Pressburger's novel was loosely based on the last raid of real-life anarchist guerrilla Antonio Sabate who was killed in an ambush in 1959.When the young son of an old comrade in arms comes to the French border village where Artiguez is exiled, he asks the old warrior to avenge the death of his father at the hands of vengeful Nationalist police captain Vinolas played by Anthony Quinn. At first Manuel refuses, but when Manuel learns that his aged mother Pilar (Mildred Dunnock) is dying he's determined to return to Spain to bid farewell to her. Pilar dies before Manuel can embark on his journey, but with the aid of traitorous smuggler Carlos (Raymond Pelligrin) Captain Vinolas keeps up the pretence that she still lives so that he can lure Manuel back to Spain and ambush him. Although a sympathetic priest (Omar Sharif) advises Manuel that he's being tricked, Manuel determines to return at all costs. Aware of the trap that's been set for him, Manuel engages the police in a fire fight, wounding Vinolas, killing Carlos and dying himself in the process.In 1966, Behold a Pale Horse was scheduled to be telecast on a major American network, but was cancelled at the last minute, reportedly at the behest of the Spanish government.

This geographical term is often associated with the coral reefs that form in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Atolls are formed over millions of years through the process of coral reef development around underwater volcanic islands. It begins with a fringing reef, which forms close to the shore of an island. As the volcanic island sinks back into the ocean due to erosion and subsidence (the process where an island gradually lowers due to the weight of the volcanic rocks and the cooling of the Earth's crust), the corals continue to grow upward and outward to reach sunlight, thereby forming a barrier reef. The barrier reef encircles a lagoon that eventually replaces the volcanic island, which has sunk entirely beneath the water's surface. The atoll is the final stage of this process, characterized by a ring-like shape with a central lagoon and small islets or islands formed by the rim of coral reefs. In some cases, these lagoons may be connected to the open ocean through channels. Atolls are home to an array of marine life, including various species of fish, invertebrates, and other sea creatures. They provide essential habitat and feeding grounds for these organisms, and their rich biodiversity makes them vital ecosystems in our planet's oceans. The Maldives, found in the Indian Ocean, and the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu in the Pacific are well-known examples of atoll formations. Charles Darwin, the renowned naturalist, was the first to present a detailed theory on the formation of atolls and the coral reef development process during his voyage around the world aboard the HMS Beagle in the 19th century. His observations and discoveries led to a deeper understanding of the geological and ecological processes at work in creating these unique structures. In conclusion, the geographical term for a ring-shaped coral island is an atoll. These fascinating and ecologically significant formations are the result of coral reefs growing around sinking volcanic islands over millions of years, eventually creating a ring-like structure with a central lagoon and small islets. Atolls play a crucial role in supporting marine life and contribute to the incredible biodiversity found in our planet's oceans."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: when does Laura leave the cabin? at dawn The answer is:","output":"Title: Laura's Dawn Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot Overview: \\"Laura's Dawn\\" follows the story of Laura, a young woman seeking solace at a remote cabin in the woods as she grapples with the sudden and tragic loss of her sister, Anna. Her plan for a quiet and peaceful retreat takes a dark turn when she realizes there is a sinister presence lurking in the shadows. Will she overcome her fears, or will time run out before she makes the decision to leave the cabin at dawn? Act 1: The movie begins with Laura arriving at the secluded cabin, which she inherited from her late grandmother. She chose the cabin as an escape from the chaos and trauma that overwhelmed her following her sister's death. As Laura unpacks her belongings, she starts to feel a mysterious energy surrounding the cabin. She dismisses the feeling, attributing it to her emotional state and exhaustion. Laura begins exploring the wooded area around the cabin, discovering an old, abandoned church and a small cemetery at the edge of the forest. The church seems to be brimming with the same energy she felt earlier. Inside, she finds a ledger, which contains a journal entry from her grandmother. The entry reveals that on the night of her sister's funeral, Laura's grandmother held a séance in the cabin seeking contact with the spirit world. Act 2: As night falls, Laura begins to experience strange occurrences in the cabin. The air grows cold, and objects start to move on their own. She begins to feel increasingly isolated and paranoid. Haunted by the thought of her sister's death, Laura spends sleepless nights pondering what she could have done to save her. One night, during a violent storm, Laura is besieged by terrifying visions of her sister's last moments. Entrenched in her desperation and grief, Laura turns to the church and the same séance that her grandmother performed in search of answers.

She begins to believe that her sister's spirit, ridden with guilt and remorse, may be communicating with her. Act 3: As her sanity hangs by a thread, Laura meets Tom, a kind-hearted and inquisitive neighbor. Tom offers his friendship and support, and the two bond over their shared experiences of loss. He explains that he faced similar struggles after losing his wife and found solace in a group therapy in the nearby town. He encourages Laura to attend the session to share her pain and let go of her anguish. The night before the group therapy meeting, Laura's experiences escalate, culminating in a terrifying encounter with a dark and malevolent spirit. The evil spirit reveals itself as the orchestrator of not only her sister's misfortune but also of the destructive and sinister occurrences in her life. Laura decides to leave the cabin and confront the evil spirit head-on, recognizing that she cannot face this dark presence alone. As dawn approaches, she leaves the cabin, determined to return to the church and find a way to banish the malevolent presence that has plagued her life and seek redemption for her sister. Conclusion: In the end, Laura, along with Tom, confront and vanquish the evil spirit, restoring peace and safety to the cabin and the surrounding woods. Having discovered the extent of the spirit's manipulations, Laura embraces the healing power of forgiveness as she comes to terms with her sister's death.

At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev.

All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds.

Options: - patrol boat - submarine - corvette - destroyer - frigate Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"A battleship can be sunk by an unseen torpedo fired by a submarine. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Among the given options, a battleship is a much larger and more heavily armed warship compared to patrol boats, corvettes, destroyers, and frigates. 2. Patrol boats are relatively small naval vessels, primarily designed for coastal defense and maritime law enforcement. Their main purpose is not to engage in direct combat with larger battleships. Thus, a patrol boat is unlikely to sink a battleship with a torpedo. 3. Corvette is a small, lightly armed warship typically used for escort and patrol duties. Although they carry torpedoes, they are not designed specifically for stealth engagements and are more easily detected than a submarine. 4. Destroyers are fast, maneuverable, and long-endurance warships that are primarily used for escorting larger ships and fleet defense. While they are equipped with torpedoes, they primarily rely on their array of anti-ship, anti-aircraft, and anti-submarine weaponry. 5. Frigates are similar to destroyers but are generally smaller and focused on anti-submarine warfare. They are equipped with torpedoes, but, like destroyers, they operate primarily at the surface. 6. Submarines are specifically designed for stealth and are capable of staying hidden underwater, making them ideal for launching surprise torpedo attacks on enemy ships, including battleships. Among the options, a submarine has the greatest probability of launching an unseen torpedo attack that could sink a battleship. Modern submarines are well-equipped with sophisticated torpedoes and other weapons, making them a formidable opponent to surface warships. In conclusion, considering the relative size, firepower, and stealth capabilities of the provided options, a submarine is the most likely candidate for sinking a battleship with an unseen torpedo attack."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: It was May 5.

As a crew member of the salvage ship USS Hoist, where he is assigned to the galley, he is inspired by the bravery of one of the divers, Master Chief Petty Officer Leslie William \\"Billy\\" Sunday (De Niro). He is determined to overcome racism and become the first black American Navy diver, even proclaiming that he will become a master diver. He eventually is selected to attend Diving and Salvage School in Bayonne, New Jersey, where he arrives as a boatswain's mate second class. He finds that Master Chief Sunday is the leading chief petty officer and head instructor, who is under orders from the school's eccentric, bigoted commanding officer to ensure that Brashear fails. Brashear struggles to overcome his educational shortcomings, a result of his leaving school in the 7th grade in order to work on his family's failing farm. He receives educational assistance from his future wife, a medical student who works part-time in the Harlem (New York City) Public Library. Brashear proves himself as a diver by rescuing a fellow student whose dive buddy abandons him during a salvage evaluation. Unfortunately, due to the racism of the commanding officer (Hal Holbrook), the student who fled in the face of danger is awarded a medal for Brashear's heroic actions. Likewise, during an underwater assembling task where each student has to assemble a flange underwater using a bag of tools, Brashear's bag is cut open. Brashear nevertheless finishes the assembly and graduates from diving school, earning the quiet and suppressed admiration of Master Chief Sunday and his fellow divers. Master Chief Sunday is later demoted to senior chief by the commanding officer for standing up for Brashear and allowing him to pass. The paths and careers of Brashear and Sunday sharply diverge.

Ashkelon, Israel (CNN) -- Malka Davidovich's Sunday started as her days normally do. She went to work. A nurse, Davidovich arrived at the Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon, Israel, where she was told her son, an Israeli soldier, was in the emergency room. \\"The truth is, I didn't even know he was in Gaza,\\" she said. \\"So I ran to the emergency room and found him among a few other soldiers who were also wounded and had just arrived. To my joy, he was conscious, and he spoke to me, and my heart just kept going boom, boom, boom,\\" said Davidovich. Caught in the violence, it's the hardest question in OPTIONS: - Ashkelon - Barzilai Medical Center - CNN - Davidovich - Gaza - Hamas - Israel - Israeli - Malka Davidovich","output":"Caught in the violence, it's the hardest question in Israel. The small Middle Eastern nation has been plagued by conflicts, with the city of Ashkelon being no exception. Despite the dangers present, resilient individuals like Malka Davidovich continue to care for the injured in places like the Barzilai Medical Center, which serves as a sanctuary for both soldiers and civilians caught in the crossfire. As reported by CNN, the situation in Gaza has escalated, leading to even more injuries and casualties. Due to the deep-rooted struggle between Israel and Hamas, an Islamist political and militant group that has established a stronghold in the Gaza Strip, peace remains elusive for the people living in these conflict-ridden regions. Each day seems to bring more destruction and heartbreak, forcing the residents to adapt to a life under siege. Though the risks are ever-present, Israeli nurse Malka Davidovich carries on with her daily routine, heading to work at the Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon, unaware of her son's involvement in the Gaza conflict. Davidovich represents the countless individuals who dedicate their lives to helping others, even as they themselves grapple with anxiety over the wellbeing of their loved ones. When she is faced with the realization that her son is one of the wounded soldiers in the emergency room, the immense relief experienced by Davidovich highlights the deep bond between a mother and her child, and reveals the human side of the seemingly endless turmoil. For Davidovich and many others living in Israel, the question of how to create a future devoid of violence and fear remains a challenging one. While geopolitical negotiations often fail to make substantial progress, people must continuously grapple with their individual understanding of how to live and function in their own communities. In this narrative, the journalist skillfully weaves together the personal struggle of a mother working in a local medical center with the broader implications of the ongoing violence in the region. By focusing on the story of Malka Davidovich, the narrative serves to remind readers that there are real people, with real families, living through these catastrophic events. The complexities of war and politics often overshadow the lived experiences of ordinary citizens, making it even more crucial for these human stories to be brought to light. Ultimately, it is through a better understanding of those who are most affected by these conflicts that potential tangible solutions might emerge, paving the way for lasting peace and prosperity in the region."},{"instruction":"Manowar is an American heavy metal band from Auburn, New York. Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly sword and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology and Greco-Roman mythology). The band is also known for a loud and bombastic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that \\"these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... By 1983, the band left Liberty Records and struck a deal with Megaforce Records in the US and Music for Nations in Europe--signing the contract in their own blood. The signing was a cover story in the 1983 July-August issue No. 47 of Kerrang!. When Manowar returned home, they immediately went into a recording studio to produce what, in the intentions of the group, would have been a simple EP, but came out instead, due to the quantity and quality of the tracks made in that period, as the band's second album, Into Glory Ride. An EP was actually published in 1983 with the title Defender containing, as its main track, the eponymous song, which included more work by Orson Welles. The atmosphere of the album evoked classical heroic fantasy and mythology, and served as a predecessor to Viking metal. It contained several innovative features, both in style and sound, and led to a huge increase in the number of fans of the group, particularly in the United Kingdom, where the band planned a long tour that was ultimately canceled. The song \\"Defender\\" was later re-recorded and included in the Fighting the World album of 1987. To apologize for the failure of their UK tour, Manowar decided to dedicate their next album to the United Kingdom. The album, Hail to England, was recorded and mixed in just six days and was released in early 1984. Its promotional tour, \\"Spectacle of Might\\", had a large number of dates in England. The tour saw Manowar initially as support band for Mercyful Fate, but soon the group led by DeMaio was put in the headline slot. Manowar soon returned to work in the recording studio. After leaving Music for Nations, the quartet released Sign of the Hammer ten months after their previous album. The new record presented stark changes in rhythm, with very technical tracks characterized by a slow pace, like the epic \\"Mountains\\", and quick ones, as the eponymous \\"Sign of the Hammer\\". Its success enabled band to embark on a two-year world tour, after which they took 1986 off. Following further disagreements with their new label, the group changed record label to Atlantic Records in 1987. Via Atlantic, they released Fighting the World, which enjoyed more extensive distribution and increased the band's prominence in the international heavy metal scene. Album art was designed by Ken Kelly. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: did they release any music during this time?","output":"Yes, they released music during this time. The quote from the article is: \\"When Manowar returned home, they immediately went into a recording studio to produce what, in the intentions of the group, would have been a simple EP, but came out instead, due to the quantity and quality of the tracks made in that period, as the band's second album, Into Glory Ride.\\" Additionally, the article mentions the release of other albums, such as Hail to England, Sign of the Hammer, and Fighting the World."},{"instruction":"Here are some concepts: classroom, portrait, teacher What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"The concept of a classroom, a portrait, and a teacher can be brought together in a comprehensive manner. A classroom is a place where learning takes place, usually within a school setting. It's a specific location where teaching and learning are organized, and where interactions between teacher and students occur. Classrooms can look very different depending on the grade level, subjects taught, and teaching philosophy used. They are often set up with desks and chairs, chalkboards or whiteboards, computers, and other tools to aid in teaching and learning. Classrooms serve as the backdrop for all the academic action and dynamic exchange of knowledge going on in a school, around which revolves the process of education transformation. A portrait, on the other hand, is an artistic representation of a person, in which the face and expression are predominant. The intent of a portrait is to display the likeness, personality, and even the mood of the person portrayed. Portraits can be done in various mediums such as painting, photography, or digital art. They serve as a way to preserve memories, celebrate individuality, and understand the story behind the subject's eyes. A portrait helps to capture and convey an individual's character and spirit through visual means. A teacher is an individual who guides and instructs students. Teachers share knowledge and provide instruction in various subjects, from science and math to history and art. They plan lessons, assess understanding through tests and quizzes, and continually adapt their teaching methods to meet their students’ needs. Teachers are not just sources of information, but also mentors, inspirations, and guides who foster critical thinking, ignite curiosity, and nurture a lifelong love of learning in their students. Now, considering these three concepts together, it creates an interesting context. We could talk, for example, about a teacher in a classroom unveiling a portrait. The teacher could use this portrait as a teaching tool, sparking discussions about art, history, culture, or other topics. The portrait could hang in the classroom, an inspirational figure that drives learning or a piece of decoration that fuels imagination. The teacher, as the facilitator of learning, would guide students in interpreting the portrait, stirring a critical and creative thinking process. This interplay, with teachers leveraging portraits within classroom settings, presents an exciting way of merging these three concepts. Or perhaps, the portrait itself might be one of the teacher - a visual testament to the individual behind the knowledge and guidance, creating a personal connection with students. It's the teacher's job, using the classroom and tools like portraits, to make learning engaging, dynamic, and meaningful for every student."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you're given the beginning and the middle of a three-part story.

Article: Ever thought of moving to a new country? How about starting a new country? Patri Friedman is planning to do just that. He left Google years ago to set up the Seasteading Institute. And his dream is to build seasteads-----floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean. So, what will life on a seastead be like? Probably a bit like life on a cruise liner , but much larger, with shops, gyms, swimming pools, schools and other areas. In fact, the early seasteads may actually be specially-rebuilt cruise liners. But as science advances, Friedman believes they'll become more like floating cities, with several hundred people. Seasteading raises a lot of questions. First of all, how will the new countries make money? The Seasteading Institute has suggested several money-making ideas, including ocean-based theme parks, casinos and fish farming. There's also the questions of safety. With storms, typhoons and pirates , the high seas are a dangerous place. However, the Institute says that it can stand bad weather and prevent crimes with its well-designed systems. So, is this just a day dream? Well, maybe not. One of the people behind the project is Peter Thiel. He founded PayPal and was one of the first investors in Facebook. So far, he's donated 500,000 to the project. And Friedman isn't wasting any time. He recently announced the creation of the Poseidon Award. This will be given to the first seastead with fifty people. Friedman is hoping to hand out the award in 2015. Question: Which of the following can be the best titles of this passage? Options: A: Seasteading: a new idea of living B: Seasteading: a wild way of farming C: Peter Thiel: a man behind the project D: Patri Friedman: a crazy day dreamer The answer is:","output":"A: Seasteading: a new idea of living. This title encapsulates the overarching idea presented in the article. The main concept discussed was the concept of seasteading, which is creating floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean as a new way of living. It is focused on the vision of Patri Friedman, the founder of the Seasteading Institute, who dreams of establishing seasteads as bustling microcosms of life with accommodations like shops, gyms, swimming pools, and schools. The title also connects to other aspects touched on in the article like the issues of finance, safety and infrastructure of these new sea-based communities. Option B: \\"Seasteading: a wild way of farming\\" misrepresents the main theme of the article. While fish farming was mentioned as a potential source of income for these floating utopias, it was not the key focus of the article and doesn't capture the main idea of creating an entirely new societal structure on the ocean. Option C: \\"Peter Thiel: a man behind the project\\", while not necessarily incorrect, is too narrow. Peter Thiel's role as a financial supporter of the Seasteading Institute and its projects is important, but the text mostly emphasizes on the ideas and goals of Patri Friedman, the founder. The article provides more coverage to the broader concept of seasteading rather than just focusing on Peter Thiel's involvement. Option D: \\"Patri Friedman: a crazy day dreamer\\" although it includes Patri Friedman, it negatively characterizes him and the seasteading idea as a crazy day dream, which undermines the serious planning, investment, and consideration for safety and logistics detailed throughout the article. Thus, it doesn't convey the full scope of the article's content. Hence, by covering the main theme and content of the article without reducing or misrepresenting any of it, Option A: \\"Seasteading: a new idea of living\\" can stand as the most appropriate title for this passage."},{"instruction":"Question: What was the average age of American Idols viewers in its first season?

It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475 BC221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the \\"Analects\\" was considered merely a \\"commentary\\" on the Five Classics, but the status of the \\"Analects\\" grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. - The years of \\"Genroku\\" are generally considered to be the Golden Age of the Edo period. The previous hundred years of peace and seclusion in Japan had created relative economic stability. The arts and architecture flourished. There were unanticipated consequences when the shogunate debased the quality of coins as a strategy for financing the appearance of continuing \\"Genroku\\" affluence. This strategic miscalculation caused abrupt inflation. Then, in an effort to solve the ensuing crisis, the \\"bakufu\\" introduced what were called the Kyh Reforms. - The Actors' Analects (, \\"Yakusha Rongo\\") is a collection of 17th and early 18th century writings on the practice and aesthetics of acting in Japan's kabuki theatre form, compiled during or around the Genroku era (1688-1704). Though not providing much direct information about the origins or history of the development of kabuki in prior periods, the works collected were written at a time when many of the standards of kabuki were being established and formalized; the work thus reflects the philosophies and aesthetics of one of kabuki's most formative periods. One of the earliest extant versions was originally published in 1776, as a set of woodblock printed books in four volumes. It is unclear whether the Analects were printed as a collection before this time, but references to the \\"seven writings\\" indicate that the works were considered together as a group, even if they were not published in such a fashion, since their creation in the early 18th century. - Yoshizawa Ayame I ( ) ( 1673 - 15 July 1729 ) was an early Kabuki actor , and the most celebrated onnagata ( specialist in female roles ) of his time . His thoughts on acting , and on onnagata acting in particular , are recorded in Ayamegusa ( , \`\` The Words of Ayame '' ) , one section of the famous treatise on Kabuki acting , Yakusha Rongo ( , \`\` The Actors ' Analects '' ) . A.C. Scott wrote that \`\` Yoshizawa Ayame I was regarded as the greatest onnagata or female impersonator of his time and was an artist of ability , who developed the unique technique which was to be a model for the actors of the future . His ideas and secrets were written down in a book called ' Ayamegusa ' , which was afterwards regarded as the Bible of the female impersonator . '' Ayame is famous for advocating that onnagata behave as women in all their interactions , both onstage and off . In Ayamegusa , he is quoted as saying that \`\` if ( an actor ) does not live his normal life as if he was a woman , it will not be possible for him to be called a skillful onnagata . '' Following his own advice , Ayame cultivated his femininity throughout his offstage life , and was often treated as a woman by his fellow actors . His mentor , Arashi San'emon , and others are said to have praised him on many occasions for his devotion to his art. - Yoshizawa Ayame () is a stage name taken on by a series of Kabuki actors in Japan.

Etty had planned for a burial in York Minster, but neglected to cover the necessary costs in his will. With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 \\"It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\".Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87. While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style.

Would \\"Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including papermaking , the nautical steering rudder , the use of negative numbers in mathematics , the raised-relief map , the hydraulic -powered armillary sphere for astronomy , and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum .\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"The Han Dynasty, which lasted from 202 BCE to 220 CE, was a defining period in Chinese history. Although various sources have different interpretations, generally it is recognized that there were four or five main social classes in the Han Dynasty, namely, the scholar-officials, the landowners, the farmers, the artisans and craftsmen, and the merchants. Some sources merge artisans, craftsmen, and merchants as a single class. 1. Scholar-officials: Occupying the highest social class, these individuals were responsible for administering the government and passing on Confucian teachings. They were highly respected and influential, as they were educated and knowledgeable in classical texts and various areas of governance. 2. Landowners: Wealthy families who owned large estates were the second highest class. They often employed the lower-class farmers to work on their lands, paid taxes to the government, and enjoyed a comfortable life with significant political and social influence. 3. Farmers: This class constituted a majority of the population and was crucial to the Han Dynasty's agrarian society. Farmers were responsible for providing food through cultivation, paying taxes, and often serving in the military when required. Although their social status was relatively low, they were generally respected due to their crucial role in the food supply. 4. Artisans and craftsmen: This category comprised skilled laborers who produced various goods, including pottery, textiles, and tools. While their skills were valued and important, artisans and craftsmen were often self-employed, and their income was unstable compared to farmers who had a more consistent role in society. 5. Merchants: Despite their contribution to the economy through trade and commercial activities, merchants were considered the lowest class due to their perceived pursuit of wealth above all else. Confucian values emphasized hard work, loyalty, and ethics, whereas merchants were seen as exploiting others for profit. Concerning your statement on \\"Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including papermaking, the nautical steering rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy, and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum.\\" - This statement is accurate and relevant in discussing the scientific and technological achievements of the Han Dynasty. It provides a glimpse into Han society's advancements and innovation, illustrating the period's impact on Chinese history. However, it does not directly address the original question about social classes. To relate the statement to the question, you could discuss how developments in science and technology may have affected social classes by improving agricultural productivity, enhancing the knowledge and power of scholar-officials, and expanding commercial possibilities for merchants."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"In which state is the ZIP code 10021?\\" is in \\"New York is the most important source of political fundraising in the United States, as four of the top five ZIP codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the Passion, it is essential to outline the key events narrated in the four Gospels–Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John–which chronicle Jesus' final moments. Although the Gospels differ in some details and emphasis, they collectively present a poignant portrayal of the Passion of Jesus Christ. 1. The Last Supper: Before the suffering and crucifixion, Jesus shared a final meal with His disciples, now known as the Last Supper. This gathering is significant in Christianity as it is when Jesus instituted the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, symbolized by the breaking of bread and sharing of wine, which represent His body and blood. 2. The Agony in the Garden: After the Last Supper, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. He was in deep distress, aware of the impending betrayal and the suffering to come. During this time, Jesus prayed to God, asking for strength to endure the painful ordeal. 3. The Betrayal by Judas and Arrest: One of Jesus' disciples, Judas Iscariot, had agreed to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Led by temple guards and Roman soldiers, Judas identified Jesus with a traitorous kiss, leading to His arrest. 4. The Trials: Jesus was subjected to a series of trials that started with a preliminary hearing before the Sanhedrin (the Jewish supreme council) and the high priest. He was then presented to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea. Pilate initially found no guilt in Jesus and sent Him to Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee. Unsuccessful in eliciting a confession, Antipas subsequently returned Jesus to Pilate, who eventually yielded to the crowd's demand to crucify Jesus in place of the criminal Barabbas. 5. The Scourging and Crowning with Thorns: Before crucifixion, Jesus was brutally beaten and scourged by Roman soldiers in an act of severe physical torture. In a cruel mockery of His claim to be the \\"King of the Jews,\\" the soldiers adorned Jesus with a purple robe and a crown made of thorns, causing unbearable pain and humiliation. 6. The Crucifixion and Death: Carrying the heavy wooden cross, Jesus was led to Golgotha (also known as the Place of the Skull) to be nailed to the cross alongside two criminals. Jesus endured unimaginable pain and suffering on the cross for several hours before He ultimately surrendered His spirit to God and passed away. 7. The Burial: After His death, Jesus' body was taken down from the cross, wrapped in a burial shroud, and placed in a tomb donated by a wealthy follower, Joseph of Arimathea. The Passion is central to Christian belief because it exemplifies Jesus' ultimate act of self-sacrifice for the spiritual redemption of humanity. This event, along with Jesus' subsequent resurrection, forms the basis of Christian faith and salvation. The Passion is observed and commemorated by Christians around the world, particularly during Holy Week–the final week of Lent–culminating in the solemn observance of Good Friday, the day on which Jesus was crucified."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Arabic.

Horse measuring sticks can be found at equestrian supply stores (tack shops), farm supply stores and from various online retailers.","output":"Step 1: Approach the horse calmly. Before starting the measurement, it's necessary to approach the horse in a calm and non-threatening manner. This helps ensure the horse remains calm and cooperative during the measurement process. Step 2: Position the horse on a flat, level surface. To obtain an accurate measurement, the horse should be standing on a flat and level surface. Make sure all four hooves are on the ground and the horse is standing upright with its head in a natural position. Step 3: Locate the horse's withers. The withers is the ridge between the horse's shoulder blades. This is the point where the height of a horse is traditionally measured. Step 4: Place the measuring stick or tape against the horse. If using a horse measuring stick, position it vertically next to the withers, making sure the stick is perpendicular to the ground. If using a measuring tape, hold one end on the ground and extend the tape vertically, keeping it parallel with the horse's withers. Step 5: Take the measurement. Slide the leveling arm or marker on the measuring stick down to rest on the withers. If using a measuring tape, manually hold the tape in place at the highest point of the withers. Record the measurement in hand units, where one hand is equal to four inches (10 cm). Most measuring sticks will have hand units marked on them. If using a measuring tape, divide the total inches by four to convert to hands. Step 6: Double-check the measurement. To ensure the accuracy of the measurement, repeat the process at least once more. Compare the two measurements and make sure they are consistent. Step 7: Record the horse's height. Document the horse's height in hands and inches (or centimeters) for future reference, either in a logbook or in your preferred digital format.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Before leaves fall from trees in autumn, they have potential energy. Why do they have the potential to fall?. Choices: - mechanical energy - kinetic energy - radioactive energy - potential energy A: Answer:","output":"The type of energy possessed by autumn leaves before they fall is potential energy. Leaves on trees hold potential energy because of their position relative to the ground. This energy comes from the work done by the tree in growing and maintaining the leaves throughout their life cycle. Due to the force of gravity acting upon them, the leaves have the potential to be converted into kinetic energy when they fall. Potential energy is the energy held by an object based on its position or condition. In the case of leaves, their position in a tree, elevated from the ground, bestows upon them this type of energy. As the leaves detach from the tree, the force of gravity causes them to accelerate toward the ground, increasing their kinetic energy. This results in the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy. To reiterate, the correct option in the provided answers is potential energy. Other types of energy listed, such as mechanical, kinetic, and radioactive energy, are not applicable to the specific case of leaves before they fall. Mechanical energy refers to the sum of potential and kinetic energy in a mechanical system, both of which would be involved in the falling process; however, the question specifically refers to the energy possessed by the leaves before falling. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and is not present in the leaves while they are still attached to the tree.

Later, a different pair of thugs appear in the Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious, and take Lebowski's rug. When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange delivery of the ransom, Walter suggests they give the kidnappers a ringer instead, namely a briefcase filled with dirty underwear laundry. The kidnappers grab the ringer and leave. Later that night, the Dude's car is stolen, with the real ransom briefcase still inside. Jeffrey Lebowski's daughter Maude (Julianne Moore) contacts the Dude and reveals she took the rug, explaining that Bunny is one of Jackie Treehorn's porn stars.

President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

Movie title: The World Unseen Context: Set in South Africa in the year 1952 during the Apartheid era, a story of true love against all odds takes place.The story opens as Amina (Sheetal Sheth), a young Indian woman, is outside of her cafe on a ladder. A crash is heard as someone runs over their flower pot outside. Amina is the exact opposite of what a woman is supposed to be, wearing trousers, a button down shirt, and a worn hat, with her hair down and unkempt. She owns her own cafe, serves blacks and whites in the same area, and stands up to men of all sorts; In short, Amina is by no means typical. She runs her cafe with Jacob (David Dennis), an older black man who is very timid, and very quick to follow the rules. But when two policemen come to threaten the cafe for serving blacks along with whites, he bravely shields Madeleine (Grethe Fox), the white postmistress, from their unrestrained violent behavior. Madeleine thanks Jacob, and the first romance is kindled.Meanwhile, Miriam (Lisa Ray), is a typical Indian housewife having recently emigrated from India. She performs her duty of caring for her two children, and one on the way, while also taking dismissive comments and abusive tendencies from men, including her husband Omar (Parvin Dabas). They live with Farah (Natalie Becker), a housewife who is really a steamy temptress, and her husband, the dolt, Sadru (Rajesh Gopie) in Cape Town. One day, the men allow Miriam and Farah to go to a cafe. Both women dress in their traditional clothing, and find themselves at the Location Cafe. Amina's cafe. A waitress spills a tray of something, and Miriam bends over to help her pick it up, but the waitress is quickly excused by Amina, who also kneels to pick up.

The cafe is unique because Amina serves blacks and whites in the same area, defying the racially segregated norms of the time. Amina is a young Indian woman who dresses and behaves differently from the traditional expectations placed upon women in that era, wearing trousers and a button-down shirt. She is a strong, independent business owner who stands up to men of all sorts and is unafraid to break societal norms. Amina runs the cafe with the help of Jacob, an older black man who is initially timid and rule-abiding but later shows courage in the face of police harassment. The cafe becomes a place where various relationships and connections form, including a romance between Madeleine, a white postmistress, and Jacob, as well as a profound connection between Amina and Miriam, a traditional Indian housewife who has recently emigrated from India. Miriam, who is married to an abusive husband named Omar, becomes intrigued by Amina's confidence and independence, as it is vastly different from the life Miriam has known. As the story unfolds, the lives of these complex characters become increasingly intertwined and impacted, ultimately leading towards the exploration of love and bravery in a time of intense racial and societal restrictions."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes.

Goalkeepers are really important because they help their team win by keeping the other team from scoring points. Manuel Neuer is really good at what he does!

If he were writing today, he might add 'divided by a common technology--- e-mail'\\". Two completely different styles of e-mail have formed on either side of the Atlantic-Euromail and Amerimail. Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a \\"Hi\\" and end with a \\"Bye\\". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an \\"xoxo\\" are disturbingly high. We Americans are unwilling to dive into the meat of an e-mail. We feel we have to first inform recipients about our vacation on the island which was really excellent except the jellyfish were biting and the kids caught a cold, so we had to skip the whale watching trip, then about that investors ' meeting in New York. Amerimail is a bundle of contradictions, casual and yet direct, respectful yet over proud. In other words, Amerimail is America. Euromail is stiff and cold often beginning with a formal \\"Dear Mr. X\\" and ending with a simple \\"Sincerely\\". You won't find any mention of kids or the weather or jellyfish in Euromail. It's all business. It's also slow. Your correspondent might take days even weeks to answer a message. Euromail is exactly like the Europeans themselves. Recently about 100 managers were asked on both sides of the Atlantic whether they noticed differences in e-mail styles. Most said yes. Here are a few of their observations: \\"Americans tend to write (e-mail) exactly as they speak.\\" \\"Why don't you just call me instead of writing five e-mails back and forth?\\" \\"Europeans are less interested in checking e-mail\\". \\"In general, Americans are much more responsive to e-mail--they respond faster and provide more information.\\" So which is better, Euromail or Amerimail? I realized it's not popular these days to suggest we have anything to learn from Europeans, but I'm fed up with an inbox filled with casual, barely meaningful e-mails from friends and colleagues. If the alternative is a few earnestly written, carefully... Question: What are characteristics of Amerimail? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Informal and chatty\\"? A:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"Informal and chatty\\". Amerimail, which represents the American style of e-mail communication, is indeed characterized by its informal and chatty nature. It typically begins with a friendly \\"Hi\\" and ends with a casual \\"Bye.\\" It is not uncommon for Amerimail to contain emojis, such as smiley faces or \\"xoxo.\\" In addition to its informality, Amerimail often includes personal anecdotes or stories before getting into the main subject of the e-mail. This can include updates about vacations, family life, or other personal matters, as Americans hesitate to jump straight into the main topic without sharing these details. While being informal, Amerimail can be considered direct in the sense that it gets to the point, even though it may be buried under personal information. At the same time, it can also be seen as respectful by fostering a more personal connection with the recipient and demonstrating a willingness to share personal experiences. In a nutshell, Amerimail embodies the American culture with its blend of casualness and directness, demonstrating a mix of informality, openness, and friendliness in e-mail communication."},{"instruction":"In this task, a passage will be given and the goal is to generate a question about temporal relations based on that passage.

Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both, as well as unkind to the children. Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan to get rid of Michel forever. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him.

Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface. Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained. Nicole sees in the paper that the police have found the corpse. However, when Christina goes to the morgue, she learns it is not actually Michel's body.

The charting and conquest of this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).Albrecht Dürer was an avid student of exotic animals, and drew many sketches based on his visits to European zoos. Dürer visited 's-Hertogenbosch during Bosch's lifetime, and it is likely the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.Attempts to find sources for the work in literature from the period have not been successful. Art historian Erwin Panofsky wrote in 1953 that, \\"In spite of all the ingenious, erudite and in part extremely useful research devoted to the task of \\"decoding Jerome Bosch\\", I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed. We have bored a few holes through the door of the locked room; but somehow we do not seem to have discovered the key.\\" The humanist Desiderius Erasmus has been suggested as a possible influence; the writer lived in 's-Hertogenbosch in the 1480s, and it is likely he knew Bosch. Glum remarked on the triptych's similarity of tone with Erasmus's view that theologians \\"explain (to suit themselves) the most difficult mysteries ... is it a possible proposition: God the Father hates the Son?

Where would you be unable to read a newspaper? Options: - porch - school - jail - rug - library","output":"To find the best answer to the question, we'll analyze each option step-by-step: 1. Porch: A porch is an area outside a house or a building that is covered and usually attached to an entrance. People usually relax or perform other outdoor activities on porches. There are no particular restrictions on reading a newspaper on a porch. So, you would be able to read a newspaper here. 2. School: A school is an educational institution with specific rules and regulations. However, there are no general restrictions on reading newspapers in a school, as long as you follow any guidelines set by the school. So, you would be able to read a newspaper here. 3. Jail: A jail is a confinement facility where individuals are held under custody. In such a place, the availability of newspapers might be limited and at the discretion of prison authorities. Thus, you might be unable to read a newspaper in jail due to restrictions. 4. Rug: A rug is a textile floor covering, and it is not a place, unlike the other options. Therefore, this option does not apply to the question. 5. Library: A library is an institution where you can borrow or access a vast collection of books, newspapers, maps, and other resources for reading and learning purposes. In most libraries, you are allowed to read newspapers without any restrictions. So, you would be able to read a newspaper here.

Alice and her friends get a strange assignment from their totally cool teacher, Mr. Everett. It was like playing the game of \\"Life,\\" but you had to act it out. So Pamela is pregnant, Elizabeth buys a car and Alice gets married. Well, of course, Pamela wasn't really pregnant, but she walked around with a pillow under her shirt to get people's reactions.

Andy Dolan. PUBLISHED:. 17:02 EST, 26 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:23 EST, 27 December 2013. An inmate walked out of a notorious open prison dubbed ‘Holiday Bay’ because he wanted to avoid the ‘temptation of illegal drugs’, a court heard. Graeme Shepherd, 41, browsed in a village post office and strolled around the village of Hollesley for three hours before being arrested in the grounds of a church. His barrister told a court he had taken ‘positive action’ to escape Hollesley Bay prison in the hope of being sent back to a closed jail, after an earlier formal request for a transfer had been turned down by the open jail. Graeme Shepherd fled Hollesley Bay jail (pictured) as he claimed he wanted to avoid the 'temptation of illegal drugs' Alan Wheetman, defending, said the request to be moved from the category D jail at Hollesley, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, was refused because Shepherd had refused to name prisoners involved in the supply of drugs. Mr Wheetman told Ipswich Crown Court on Tuesday: ‘He realised that in order to get away from Hollesley Bay he would have to take some positive action. 'He realised that anyone who escaped would be transferred back to closed conditions. ‘He has found it difficult in an open prison because of the temptation of illegal drugs. He says there is an awful lot of drugs in Hollesley Bay.’ Lee Chapman (pictured) previously claimed drugs were readily available at the prison as well as mobile phones. Mr Wheetman said Shepherd had been free of drugs since 2009 and had undergone regular voluntary testing in prison. Prosecutor Hugh Vass said Shepherd was found missing by a prison officer carrying out a morning roll call on December 11. Shepherd, who is serving an indefinite sentence for robbery, was located in the grounds of All Saints Church, Hollesley, by a policeman later that day. Mr Vass said: ‘He said he didn’t want to go back to drug taking and had done it for his own safety.’ Shepherd admitted escaping from lawful custody on December 11 and was ordered to serve an additional four months on top of his original sentence by Judge Rupert Overbury. Hollesley Bay prison has long been nicknamed Holiday Bay because of its relaxed atmosphere and sea views. A serving prisoner claimed in November last year that drugs and phones were easily available at the prison and that women had stayed overnight at the jail. The claims were made at Ipswich Crown Court by a barrister representing Lee Chapman, 34, before the defendant was sentenced for carrying out six burglaries while on the run from the jail - where he was serving a life sentence for arson with intent to endanger life, and burglary. Prison bosses strenuously denied the claim that women were permitted to sleep at the jail and said the possession of drugs or phones by inmates was treated as a criminal offence. Another inmate William Barlow, 30, who also went on the run because he did not like the jail’s ‘lax attitude’ to drugs was jailed for four weeks last October. Ipswich Crown Court heard how the defendant wanted to escape the jail as he is trying not to take illegal drugs. Ipswich Crown Court head how former drug user Barlow hoped to get caught and transferred to another prison even though he only had two weeks left to serve of a three and a half year sentence for burglary. He claimed he had to get away because other inmates were putting pressure on him to bring Class A drugs into the jail. In October, bank raider Kevin Smith, 29, went on the run from the prison just ten days after he had arrived. He had been transferred to the jail just two months into a five year term for conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to steal a motor vehicle.

The equation is: 0 = -77*a + 40*a - 185 1. First, we combine the 'a' terms: -77*a + 40*a = (-77 + 40) * a = -37*a So now, our equation looks like this: 0 = -37*a - 185 2. Now we want to isolate 'a', so we'll move 185 to the other side of the equation by adding 185 to both sides: 0 + 185 = -37*a 185 = -37*a 3.

Mary Chapin Carpenter (born February 21, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter. Carpenter spent several years singing in Washington, D.C. clubs before signing in the late 1980s with Columbia Records, who marketed her as a country singer. Carpenter's first album, 1987's Hometown Girl, did not produce any singles, although 1989's State of the Heart and 1990's Shooting Straight in the Dark each produced four Top 20 hits on the Billboard country singles charts. Carpenter's most successful album to date remains 1992's Carpenter's first album, \\"Hometown Girl\\" was produced by John Jennings and was released in 1987. Though songs from Hometown Girl got play on public and college radio stations, it was not until Columbia began promoting Carpenter as a \\"country\\" artist that she found a wider audience. For a long time, Carpenter was ambivalent about this pigeonholing, saying she preferred the term \\"singer-songwriter\\" or \\"slash rocker\\" (as in country/folk/rock). She told Rolling Stone in 1991, \\"I've never approached music from a categorization process, so to be a casualty of it is real disconcerting to me\\". Some music critics argue that Carpenter's style covers a range of influences even broader than those from \\"country\\" and \\"folk\\". Time critic Richard Corliss described the songs in her album A Place in the World as \\"reminiscent of early Beatles or rollicking Motown\\", and one reviewer of Time* Sex* Love* noted the \\"wash of Beach Boys-style harmonies ... backwards guitar loops\\" and use of a sitar on one track, all elements not commonly found on a country or folk album. After 1989's State of the Heart, Carpenter released Shooting Straight in the Dark in 1990, which yielded her biggest single up to that point, the Grammy Award-winning \\"Down at the Twist and Shout\\". Two years later, Carpenter released the album that, to date, has been her biggest popular success, Come On Come On (1992). The album went quadruple platinum, remaining on the Country Top 100 list for more than 97 weeks, and eventually spawned seven charting singles. Come On Come On was also critically acclaimed; The New York Times's Karen Schoemer wrote that Carpenter had \\"risen through the country ranks without flash or bravado: no big hair, sequined gowns, teary performances.... Enriched with Ms. Carpenter's subtlety, Come On Come On grows stronger and prettier with every listen.\\" The songs of Come On Come On had the qualities that would come to identify her work: humorous, fast-paced country-rock songs with themes of perseverance, desire, and independence, alternating with slow, introspective ballads that speak to social or relational issues. \\"Passionate Kisses\\", a cover of fellow singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams's 1988 song, was the album's third single. Carpenter's version peaked on the U.S. Country chart at No. 4, and was the first of Carpenter's songs to cross over to mainstream pop and adult contemporary charts, charting at No. 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at No. 11 on Adult Contemporary. The sixth single on Come On Come On, \\"He Thinks He'll Keep Her\\", was Carpenter's biggest hit off the album, charting at No. 2 on Billboard's Country chart and at No. 1 on Radio & Records's Country chart. Written by Carpenter and Don Schlitz, the fast-paced song follows a 36-year-old homemaker who leaves her husband, and was inspired by a 1970s series of Geritol commercials in which a man boasts of his wife's seemingly limitless energy and her many accomplishments, then concludes by saying, \\"My wife ...

Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the alternative to creating an Arab political federation?","output":"While the idea of a unified Arab state or political federation was appealing to many Arab leaders during the 1960s and 1970s, there were viable alternatives that were pursued and considered. These alternatives aimed at fostering cooperation, solidarity, and unity among Arab nations without dissolving their individual sovereignties. 1. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements: Instead of a full-fledged political federation, countries could establish bilateral and multilateral agreements to promote economic, political, and military cooperation. These agreements would allow for the coordination of policies and joint projects, while maintaining each country's sovereignty and political independence. 2. Economic integration: An alternative to a political federation could be the establishment of an economic union or a common market among Arab countries. By liberalizing trade and investment between these nations, they would promote economic growth, regional development, and economic interdependence. This approach was partially realized with the creation of the Arab League, founded in 1945, which aimed to strengthen the economic and political ties among its members. 3. Regional organizations and alliances: Instead of forming a single Arab political federation, nations could also join or establish regional organizations or alliances—such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), founded in 1981, which serves as a platform for political, economic, and strategic cooperation among its six member countries in the Arabian Gulf region. These regional entities can address shared challenges and promote mutual interests without abolishing national borders and sovereignties. 4. Cultural and educational initiatives: Another alternative to a political federation would be the promotion of cultural, linguistic, and educational ties among Arab countries. This could entail the establishment of joint educational programs, research centers, and cultural initiatives that focus on the shared history, language, and cultural values of the Arab world. 5. Non-aggression pacts and conflict resolution mechanisms: In lieu of a full political federation, Arab countries could establish non-aggression pacts and invest in conflict resolution mechanisms to prevent and resolve regional disputes. This approach would promote regional stability and ensure that tensions and clashes are addressed through diplomatic means rather than military confrontation. In conclusion, while the political federation of Arab states has not been achieved, several alternatives have been pursued or considered to foster collaboration and achieve shared goals. These alternatives emphasize economic integration, regional alliances, cooperation agreements, cultural initiatives, and non-aggression pacts, which each serve to better unify the Arab world without infringing on its individual sovereignties."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: The Waterman eatType restaurant; The Waterman food Chinese; The Waterman priceRange high; The Waterman customer rating 1 out of 5; The Waterman area city centre; The Waterman familyFriendly yes","output":"The Waterman is a high-priced, family-friendly Chinese restaurant located in the heart of the city centre, offering a fine dine-in experience with a diverse eatType menu to cater to various palates; however, it has recently earned a disappointing 1 out of 5 customer rating, indicating that it may need to step up its game by improving its food quality, service, and ambiance to become a more sought-after establishment for dining enthusiasts and families alike."},{"instruction":"Explain simply why 1872 is the correct answer to: Passage: Established in 1872, the Cape of Good Hope SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) in Cape Town is the founding society of the SPCA movement in South Africa and is the oldest animal welfare organisation in the country.

Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \\"gold medal\\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area.It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogorou, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi. He was originally trying to find evidence to prove her innocence because of her strong resemblance to his wife, but the more investigation he does, the more...

Though Toyota’s 17 plants in Japan escaped the disaster relatively unscathed, factory lines are working at only half volume here and at 40 percent overseas, as vital suppliers in Japan’s worst-hit areas struggle to restart operations. Toyota had indicated this week that its Japanese operations would remain at half-speed through at least June 3, but was unwilling to speculate beyond that. And it had said on Tuesday that it would cut production at its North American plants by 75 percent in the next six weeks to conserve its limited supply of parts made in Japan. The two other main Japanese automakers, Nissan and Honda, are also operating at only about half of normal production volumes in Japan. At a briefing for reporters here on Friday, Akio Toyoda, president and chief executive of Toyota, said he expected to ramp up production gradually in Japan, starting in July, as more parts makers came back on line. Toyota will raise production at its overseas plants a month later, in August, to allow for the parts to arrive from Japan, Mr. Toyoda said. Production at home and overseas will return to predisaster levels at all factory lines and across all vehicle models by November or December, Mr. Toyoda said. “The damage has been so widespread in this unprecedented calamity that its economic effect is being felt throughout Japan and in every industry,” Mr. Toyoda said. He added that the automaker had dispatched employees to help recovery work at some of its most vital parts makers. The severe disruptions come as a painful blow to Toyota just as it had appeared set to shake off the effects of a sharp slowdown in sales after the global economic crisis, as well as its handling of a spate of recalls. The reduced production also highlights a downside to Toyota’s insistence on making almost half of its cars in Japan and shipping them overseas. Also, its celebrated just-in-time production system, which reduces parts inventories to a minimum, may have made the disruptions worse. The automaker estimates that it faces shortages of about 150 critical parts, down from about 500 immediately after the March 11 quake. Atsushi Niimi, executive vice president in charge of production, said that Toyota had switched suppliers in some cases to speed the recovery. He said it had been a bitter revelation to Toyota that its cars, even those produced overseas, still relied so heavily on Japanese parts. “We need to procure more parts overseas, and we also urge our suppliers to make more forays outside Japan,” Mr. Niimi said. He added that Toyota would diversify its supplier base over all to make its supply chain more resilient. “It’s something we don’t want to think about, “ he said, “but it is something we cannot avoid if we are to continue to do business in a quake-prone country.” Mr. Toyoda, the company chief, said continuing aftershocks made the outlook uncertain. He declined to comment on the effect of the disruptions on the company’s earnings. “We just had an aftershock yesterday,” he said. “As these continue, the rapid recovery we’ve seen can come undone. The future is impossible to predict.” Another concern is the severe energy shortage brought by the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, 140 miles north of Tokyo, as well as damage to other power plants in the region. To avert a power supply collapse, the Japanese government initially instructed companies to reduce their energy use by as much as 25 percent. But frantic efforts by utilities to increase power generation at plants outside the worst-hit zones, as well as a public drive to conserve energy, has eased the energy shortfall, allowing the government to lower its directive to 15 percent. Mr. Niimi, the executive vice president for production, said that Toyota was discussing energy-saving measures with other automakers, like shutting production lines during the week and running them on weekends, when more electricity is available. Still, Mr. Toyoda said, the company was committed to keeping production — and jobs — in Japan. “Above all, we all love Japan,” he said. “As we face a national crisis, each company must do its part.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. Due to the supply chain disruptions caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Toyota announced that it would not achieve full production until the end of the year. The company's plants in Japan are operating at half volume, and its overseas plants are at 40% capacity. 2. Toyota's Japanese operations will remain at half-speed through at least June 3, with production ramping up gradually starting in July as more parts suppliers restart operations.

He was influential in the inner circle of Sisebut, Visigothic king of Hispania. Like Leander, he played a prominent role in the Councils of Toledo and Seville. Isidore was the first Christian writer to try to compile a summa of universal knowledge, in his most important work, the Etymologiae (taking its title from the method he uncritically used in the transcription of his era's knowledge). It is also known by classicists as the Origines (the standard abbreviation being Orig). This encyclopedia -- the first such Christian epitome--formed a huge compilation of 448 chapters in 20 volumes. In it, as Isidore entered his own terse digest of Roman handbooks, miscellanies and compendia, he continued the trend towards abridgements and summaries that had characterised Roman learning in Late Antiquity. In the process, many fragments of classical learning are preserved which otherwise would have been hopelessly lost; \\"in fact, in the majority of his works, including the Origines, he contributes little more than the mortar which connects excerpts from other authors, as if he was aware of his deficiencies and had more confidence in the stilus maiorum than his own\\" his translator Katherine Nell MacFarlane remarks; Some of these fragments were lost in the first place because Isidore's work was so highly regarded--Braulio called it quecunque fere sciri debentur, \\"practically everything that it is necessary to know\\"-- that it superseded the use of many individual works of the classics themselves, which were not recopied and have therefore been lost: \\"all secular knowledge that was of use to the Christian scholar had been winnowed out and contained in one handy volume; the scholar need search no further\\". The fame of this work imparted a new impetus to encyclopedic writing, which bore abundant fruit in the subsequent centuries of the Middle Ages. It was the most popular compendium in medieval libraries. It was printed in at least ten editions between 1470 and 1530, showing Isidore's continued popularity in the Renaissance. Until the 12th century brought translations from Arabic sources, Isidore transmitted what western Europeans remembered of the works of Aristotle and other Greeks, although he understood only a limited amount of Greek. The Etymologiae was much copied, particularly into medieval bestiaries.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What were the fruit subsequent too?","output":"The \\"fruit\\" that the text is talking about is the result or the consequence of something that happened before. Here it says, \\"The fame of this work imparted a new impetus to encyclopedic writing, which bore abundant fruit in the subsequent centuries of the Middle Ages.\\" This means that Saint Isidore of Seville's famous work, the Etymologiae, inspired a lot of other people to write encyclopedias during the Middle Ages.

To provide a more detailed and long response, including the key information, the answer could be restructured as follows: The name of William Paley's book that claims divine beneficial design is \\"Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Collected from the Appearances of Nature,\\" often referred to simply as \\"Natural Theology.\\" Published in 1802, the book presents a comprehensive argument for the existence of God based on the evidence of order, purpose, and design visible in the natural world. Paley's ideas were influential in British natural philosophy and theology of his time. In \\"Natural Theology,\\" Paley employs a teleological argument, which means that he argues from the design or purpose in nature to the existence of a Designer, who is God. The book is famous for its \\"watchmaker analogy,\\" where Paley suggests that just as a watch, with its intricate and purposeful mechanism, implies the existence of an intelligent watchmaker, the complex structures and processes observed in the natural world imply the existence of a divine Creator. Paley's work considers multiple examples of intricate mechanisms in nature, such as the structure of the eye, as evidence for the notion of divine design. He believed that adaptation in living organisms could be explained by the Creator acting through natural laws, specifically designing each species with a particular purpose and function within the natural order. This way of thinking was later challenged by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, which proposed that adaptation and the appearance of design in nature could be a result of natural processes rather than a conscious Designer. In conclusion, the book in question is \\"Natural Theology\\" by William Paley, which advocates for the existence of a divine Creator responsible for the beneficial design observed in nature. This work and its ideas have played an important role in the historical development of science and religion debates."},{"instruction":"The Federal Trade Commission is going after spyware, bits of computer code that install themselves on the computers of Internet users to track or disrupt their online activities.

Question: suppose a person runs a mile in less than five minutes happens, how will it affect the liver having to work HARDER. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"When a person runs a mile in less than five minutes, the body undergoes a significant increase in metabolic activity, demanding more energy and oxygen. As a result, various organs, including the liver, will have to work harder to support this intense activity. The liver plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis and performing various metabolic functions. Below are the possible effects on the liver and the influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the production of bile. 1. Liver filters blood from the digestive tract: Increased blood flow and cardiovascular activity during running will lead to more blood being filtered by the liver, resulting in the liver working harder to process and detoxify the blood. Effect: More 2. Liver produces bile: Bile is essential for digestion and absorption of dietary fats. As the liver works harder due to increased metabolic demands, the production of bile may be slightly affected. However, since the primary energy source during running is carbohydrates and not fats, the increased demand for bile production may not be significant. Effect: No effect or slight increase 3. Liver produces proteins for blood plasma: During intense physical activity, the liver boosts the production of essential proteins required for blood plasma, including albumin and clotting factors. Consequently, the result is an increase in the production of these proteins. Effect: More 4. Liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage: While running, the body immediately utilizes the stored glycogen in the muscles and liver, demanding the liver to convert more glucose into glycogen in response to the energy requirement. Thus, the liver will have to work harder to maintain the energy homeostasis. Effect: More 5. Liver converts ammonia to urea: When a person runs a mile in less than five minutes, the liver will have to work harder to remove excess ammonia, a byproduct of protein metabolism, from the blood. This process, in turn, causes the liver to convert ammonia to urea, which is excreted in the urine, so there will be an increase in ammonia-to-urea conversion. Effect: More 6. Liver regulates blood clotting: With intense exercise, there is an increased need for blood clotting factors. The liver, in response to this requirement, will have to work harder to produce and regulate blood clotting factors during physical activity. Effect: More In conclusion, running a mile in less than five minutes places a higher metabolic demand on the body, causing the liver to work harder in several aspects. However, regarding the production of bile (the second effect mentioned), the intensity of the physical activity may have little or no significant effect primarily because carbohydrates, not fats, are the main energy source during such exercises."},{"instruction":"Title: Poor movie, poor sound, poor direction Product review: I agree with Jack Wasson below - it's too bad the film-makers used the title of the truly excellent Collins-LaPierre book because this movie is just sub-par.

Forbes reports that at least fifty rock stars have incomes between two million and six million dollars per year. \\"It doesn't make sense,\\" says Johnny Mathis, one of the older music millionaires, who made a million dollars a year when he was popular in 1950s. \\"Performers aren't worth this kind of money. In fact, nobody is.\\" But the rock stars' admirers seem to disagree. Those who love rock music spend about two billion dollars a year for records. They pay 150 million to see rock stars in person. Luck is a key word for explaining the success of many. In 1972 one of the luckiest was Kon Mclean, who wrote and sang \\"American Pie\\". Mclean writes his own music, so he earns an additional two cents on every single record of the song. Neil Young who performs in torn blue jeans, sometimes sings to an audience of 10,000, each of whom has paid five dollars for a ticket. After paying expenses, Young leaves with about 18,000 in his blue jeans at the end of an evening. How do the rock stars use their money? What do they do when the money starts pouring in like water? Most of the young stars simply show the money around. England's Elton John gave someone a 38,000 Rolls car and bought himself 5,000 pairs of eyeglasses, then lighted up and spelt :E-L-T-O-N. He also bought himself two cars, \\"one for each foot\\". Many rock stars live like Grace Slick and Jefferson Airplane. Those performers return from a tour, pay their bills, and buy new toys.

Usually, you fill the sprayer's bucket with your chosen paint. You then attach the sprayer pump to the bucket. Sprayers usually come with different nozzles depending on which part of the fence you're painting, so choose the correct nozzle to begin. Unless you're only painting a small portion of the fence, choose the largest nozzle first. As you continue painting and need to get into cracks and crevices, use smaller, more precise nozzles as needed. Remember to use an oil-based fence that is safe for wood and exterior use and choose a day that is not very windy. Use horizontal strokes for horizontal panels and vertical strokes for vertical ones. Allow the primer to dry before proceeding. Drying times vary, so refer to the instructions on the can of primer for precise drying times. Keep your nozzle about six to eight inches away from the fence. Use a steady back and forth motion to spray your fence. For horizontal panels, move up and down. For verticals ones, move back and forth. After spraying down one panel, go over your work at a perpendicular line of about 90 degrees. This leaves a crisscross pattern on your fence that eliminates streaks. Make sure not to make arcs at the ends of each stroke. This will spray paint in unwanted places. After your paint dries, examine your fence. Decide whether or not a second coat is necessary. If you chose a quality paint, you can probably get by with a single coat.

In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused.

The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other. There are four different train systems in the Chunnel. The Eurostar is a high speed passenger service that connects London, Paris, Brussels, and Lille. The Eurotunnel shuttle is a rail ferry service. These shuttles carry cars. These are railcars that allow drivers to drive their vehicles on and off. There are also two Eurotunnel goods service trains. Now you know more about the Chunnel.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album.

The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". - A film score (also sometimes called background score, background music, movie soundtrack, film music or incidental music) is original music written specifically to accompany a film. The score forms part of the film's soundtrack, which also usually includes dialogue and sound effects, and comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question. Scores are written by one or more composers, under the guidance of, or in collaboration with, the film's director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians most often comprising an orchestra or band, instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists and recorded by a sound engineer. - Marko Tapani \\"Marco\\" Hietala (born 14 January 1966) is a Finnish heavy metal vocalist, bass guitarist and songwriter. Internationally, he is most known as the current bass guitarist, male vocalist and secondary composer to Tuomas Holopainen, of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is also the vocalist and bassist as well as composer and lyricist for the heavy metal band Tarot. - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\". - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. - Erno \\"Emppu\\" Matti Juhani Vuorinen (born 24 June 1978) is a Finnish guitarist, most famous for being a founding member and occasional songwriter of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is the oldest of five children, having a twin brother and three younger sisters.

A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - Angels Fall First is the debut studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. The original 500-copies limited edition features seven tracks, two of which are not on the regular edition. This edition is highly sought after by collectors and in 2012 a copy was sold for 1137.23 on eBay. The album was released in the US by Century Media in March 2001. - The tarot (first known as trionfi and later as tarocchi, tarock, and others) is a pack of playing cards, used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play games such as Italian tarocchini and French tarot. In the late 18th century, it began to be used for divination in the form of tarotology/cartomancy. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - Sami Vänskä (born 26 September 1976) is the former bassist of Finnish symphonic power metal band Nightwish. - Jukka Antero \\"Julius\\" Nevalainen (born 21 April 1978, Kitee, Finland) is the drummer in the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish and the Finnish progressive metal band Sethian. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - Tuomas Lauri Johannes Holopainen (born 25 December 1976) is a Finnish songwriter, multi-instrumentalist musician (but mainly keyboardist) and record producer, best known as the founder, leader, keyboardist and songwriter of symphonic metal band Nightwish. He has also studied jazz and classical styles, but prefers to be influenced by harmonic film music. - A choir (also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the Medieval era to the present, and/or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.

Sentence:","output":"The given data, \\"10 Hygiea, apoapsis, 523951582.33968 (kilometres),\\" provides significant information about the astronomical characteristics of the minor planet 10 Hygiea, specifically regarding its apoapsis distance. 10 Hygiea is a large asteroid located in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It holds the distinction of being the fourth-largest asteroid in terms of volume and mass and the fifth-largest in terms of mean diameter. 10 Hygiea was discovered by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on April 12, 1849, and was named after Hygieia, the Greek goddess of health. The term \\"apoapsis\\" refers to the point in an object's orbit around a celestial body where it is furthest away from that body. In the context of Hygiea's orbit around the Sun, the apoapsis represents the point where the asteroid is the farthest away from the Sun in its elliptical orbit. The apoapsis is also called \\"aphelion\\" when referring to an object's orbit around the Sun. The given data, 523951582.33968 (kilometres), is the apoapsis distance of 10 Hygiea from the Sun. This means that at the farthest point in its orbit, 10 Hygiea is approximately 523,951,582.33968 kilometres away from the Sun. For reference, that is roughly 3.5 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun, as the average Earth-Sun distance is about 149,597,870.7 kilometres (denoted as 1 Astronomical Unit, or 1 AU). 10 Hygiea's orbit has significant eccentricity, causing its distance from the Sun to vary substantially between its apoapsis and periapsis (the closest point to the Sun) throughout its orbital period. This relatively large apoapsis distance, combined with additional factors such as the asteroid's size, composition, and rotation rate, impacts the study of 10 Hygiea's formation and evolution, as well as its interactions with other celestial bodies within the solar system. In conclusion, the given data, 10 Hygiea, apoapsis, 523951582.33968 (kilometres), presents a key piece of information about the orbit of the minor planet 10 Hygiea around the Sun, specifically highlighting its substantial distance at the farthest point in its elliptical orbit. This information contributes to a broader understanding of the dynamics, history, and evolution of this significant asteroid, which plays an essential role in the study of our solar system."},{"instruction":"Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the partner of the person who wounded a hostage? Jim Street, a former U.S. Navy SEAL and hot-shot cop from the Los Angeles Police Department and his SWAT team are sent to stop a gang of robbers who have taken over a bank. His high-tempered partner and close friend Brian Gamble disobeys an order to hold their position and engages the bank robbers, accidentally wounding a hostage in the process.

Question: What position did Eziquiel Carrerra play for the Blue Jays? Passage 1:Nehru's foreign policy was the inspiration of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which India was a co-founder. Nehru maintained friendly relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union, and encouraged the People's Republic of China to join the global community of nations. In 1956, when the Suez Canal Company was seized by the Egyptian government, an international conference voted 18–4 to take action against Egypt. India was one of the four backers of Egypt, along with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the USSR. India had opposed the partition of Palestine and the 1956 invasion of the Sinai by Israel, the United Kingdom and France, but did not oppose the Chinese direct control over Tibet, and the suppression of a pro-democracy movement in Hungary by the Soviet Union. Although Nehru disavowed nuclear ambitions for India, Canada and France aided India in the development of nuclear power stations for electricity. India also negotiated an agreement in 1960 with Pakistan on the just use of the waters of seven rivers shared by the countries. Nehru had visited Pakistan in 1953, but owing to political turmoil in Pakistan, no headway was made on the Kashmir dispute. Passage 2:It returned to racing in the 1961 season for the 12 Hours of Sebring, driven by Giancarlo Baghetti, Mairesse, Ginther and Wolfgang von Trips, finishing second overall behind teammates Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien. At the Targa Florio it was team's sole front-engine entry, with Mairesse and Pedro Rodríguez driving. They retired after one of the drivers crashed during practice. 0780TR returned to the factory for repairs and modification of its nose to TRI/61 style. This was completed in time for the car to be run by the factory-supported North American Racing Team in the 1961 1000 km Nürburgring. Driven by Pedro Rodríguez and his younger brother Ricardo, the car finished second behind the Maserati Tipo 61 of Lloyd Casner and Masten Gregory. The Rodriguez brothers had to pit late in the race after destroying a front wheel, eliminating any chance of a win. The car then was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans, driven by Mairesse and Mike Parkes. After a poor start, they finished second, again behind Hill and Gendebien. They ran third for much of the race, achieving second when the Rodríguez brothers' 250 TRI61 retired with broken pistons with two hours to go. In the season-ending Pescara 4 Hours 0780TR was driven to victory by Scuderia Ferrari's Lorenzo Bandini and Giorgio Scarlatti, despite an oil leak that saw Bandini fall back to 27th. From this position, he regained second place with his rapid pace and won when the leading Camoradi Maserati Tipo 61 retired. Passage 3:The Blue Jays opened the scoring in the third inning with five runs. Ezequiel Carrera walked with one out, moved to second on a wild pitch, then scored on Josh Donaldson's double. Back-to-back singles by Edwin Encarnacion and Jose Bautista made it 2–0. After Russell Martin walked to load the bases, Troy Tulowitzki cleared them with a triple. Rangers' starter Cole Hamels threw 42 pitches that inning, the most pitches in an inning he had ever thrown. Next inning, Melvin Upton Jr.'s leadoff home run made it 6–0. Rangers' shortstop Elvis Andrus's throwing error to first allowed Devon Travis to reach. He moved to second on a passed ball, then scored on Josh Donaldson's single to make it 7–0 and knock Hamels out of the game. The Rangers bullpen tossed 4 scoreless innings, but after back-to-back singles to lead off the ninth off Jake Diekman, Bautista hit a three-run home run amid boos from the Rangers crowd, giving the Blue Jays a 10–0 lead. Blue Jays' starter Marco Estrada went a strong 8 innings having given up only four hits and one earned run (in the ninth when Andrus hit a leadoff triple and scored on Shin-Soo Choo's groundout) on 98 pitches.

The premise states that \\"Nitrates can play a larger role in visibility problems in some portions of the West than in the East.\\" This implies that in certain specific regions of the West, nitrates could be more significant factors in visibility issues than they are in the East. However, this does not necessarily mean that the entirety of the West is more affected by nitrate visibility problems as compared to the entirety of the East. There could be regions in both the West and the East that are not significantly affected by nitrates, or the impact of nitrates could be different from one region to another, even within the same geographical area. Taking into account the options provided: I. Yes This option suggests that the hypothesis \\"The west is more affected by nitrate visibility problems than the east\\" is true. While the premise indicates that nitrates play a larger role in visibility problems in some areas of the West as opposed to the East, it is not fully conclusive to confirm that the entire West is more affected by nitrate visibility issues than the entire East. In order to definitively support this hypothesis, additional information and context are necessary, such as specific data comparing the nitrate levels and their impact on visibility across the West and East regions. II. It is not possible to tell This option perhaps provides the most accurate response based on the given information. The premise indicates that in some portions of the West, nitrates can play a larger role in visibility problems compared to the East. However, it does not definitively confirm that the overall West is more affected by nitrate visibility issues than the entirety of the East. Without more specific information and context regarding the prevalence and impact of nitrates on visibility across both regions, it is not possible to conclusively confirm or debunk the hypothesis. III. No This option suggests that the hypothesis \\"The west is more affected by nitrate visibility problems than the east.\\" is false. However, based on the premise, it is not possible to make a definitive determination on the falsity of the hypothesis. While the premise highlights specific regions in the West where nitrates may play a larger role in visibility problems, it does not provide conclusive evidence against the hypothesis. To deny the hypothesis, additional data proving the equal or higher impacts of nitrates on visibility in the East would be required. In conclusion, based on the given premise, it is not possible to definitively confirm or reject the hypothesis \\"The west is more affected by nitrate visibility problems than the east.\\" Further information related to both the West and East regions, including data comparing the levels and impacts of nitrates on visibility, is required to provide a more definitive answer.

The scientists are foiled by an extremely dense layer of material at the boundary between the two. To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole. The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the very existence of Earth. The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly. Sorenson discovers that there was a huge reservoir of hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more powerful.

Chief Blount captured Chief Hancock, and the settlers executed him in 1712. In 1713 the Southern Tuscarora lost their Fort Neoheroka, located in Greene County. About 950 people were killed or captured and sold into slavery in the Caribbean or New England by Colonel Moore and his South Carolina troops. His forces were made up of 33 white men and more than 900 Native American allies, mostly Yamasee and Cherokee, historic competitors to the Tuscarora. At this point, the majority of the surviving Southern Tuscarora began migrating to New York to escape the settlers in North Carolina. Their leader declared that those remaining in the South after 1722 were no longer members of the tribe. They joined the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy, and were accepted as the sixth nation. The remaining Tuscarora signed a treaty with the settlers in June 1718. It granted them a tract of land on the Roanoke River in what is now Bertie County. This was the area already occupied by Tom Blount, and was specified as 56,000 acres ; Tom Blount was recognized by the Legislature of North Carolina as King Tom Blount. The remaining Southern Tuscarora were removed from their homes on the Pamlico River and forced to Bertie. In 1722 the colony chartered Bertie County. Over the next several decades, the remaining Tuscarora lands continually diminished as the tribe sold off land in deals which speculators designed to take advantage of them.

Answer:","output":"Henry King Stanford was born on April 22, 1916, to an esteemed family that greatly valued higher education. He had a passion for learning and pursued academics rigorously throughout his life. Stanford earned his A.B. from Emory University, followed by an M.Sc. from the University of Denver and a Ph.D. from the prestigious New York University. These early accomplishments set the stage for him to become a respected academic leader and educator in the United States. Stanford began his professional career as an educator and administrator, embodying the spirit of serving the students and staff. He rapidly gained recognition for his strong leadership skills and his unwavering devotion to the betterment of the academic world. As a result, in 1948, Stanford was appointed the 3rd President of Georgia Southwestern College (now part of the University of Georgia), where he served distinctively for the next two years, until 1950. Fueled by his ardor for education, Stanford secured the position of the 19th president of the University of Miami in 1962. During his time there, he led the institution through a transformative period marked by expansion, improvement in academic standards, and emphasis on research and innovation. His presidential tenure at the University of Miami lasted until 1981, leaving a lasting mark on the institution's identity and vision. After stepping down from the prestigious role, Stanford was entrusted with the interim presidency of yet another renowned institution, the University of Georgia. He served diligently and honorably from 1986 to 1987, helping to drive the university forward and manage its affairs efficiently. During his lifetime, Stanford successfully demonstrated the capacity for visionary leadership, garnering respect from both the academic and administrative fields. He earned the admiration of his successors, Charles Boynton Knapp at the University of Georgia and Edward T. Foote II at the University of Miami, who presumably continued to build on the foundations he established. Sadly, on January 1, 2009, Henry King Stanford passed away. His contributions to American higher education and his tireless commitment to academic excellence have left an indelible mark in history. Through his life's work, he has created a legacy that inspires the leaders of today and the generations to come."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given an input list A.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: The concept of love is a multifaceted and complex emotion, which elicits various physiological, emotional, and cognitive responses in individuals. Human emotions, particularly love, do not abide by a simple set of rules or universal timelines, rendering it difficult to predict or pinpoint a specific moment when someone falls in love. From a biological standpoint, love can be understood partially by examining the role of hormones and neurotransmitters, such as oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin, which contribute to feelings of attachment, pleasure, and happiness. However, the interactions and levels of these chemicals can vary drastically between individuals and situations, making it impossible to provide a definitive answer. Furthermore, the experience of falling in love entails an intricate combination of psychological and emotional factors. For instance, personal upbringing, attachment styles, communication skills, and relationship expectations all play a role in shaping one's experience of love. Thus, the process of falling in love might happen relatively quickly for one person, while it could take a longer time for another. Cultural and social factors are also at play when it comes to love. Different societies have distinctive outlooks on relationships, which inevitably impact an individual's perception and understanding of love. In some societies, people may believe in love at first sight, while in others, love can be seen as something earned through an ongoing companionship and commitment. In essence, the multifaceted nature of love, compounded by individual, biological, and cultural variations, implies that it is not possible to tell the exact moment a person falls in love. Love is a subjective and fluid experience, and people may not discern a particular moment when they start loving someone; it could be a gradual process or a sudden realization. Regardless, it becomes evident that there is no single answer that accurately captures this complex phenomenon."},{"instruction":"News article: Las Vegas weddings down nearly 40% since 2004 Monday, August 31, 2015, 3:42 PM Goin' to the chapel?

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process in the respiratory system, which allows the cells of the lung to hold the air, involves multiple components and stages. To provide a detailed description, I will break down the process into specific steps and components involved. 1. Inhalation: The process begins with inhalation, where we breathe in the air containing oxygen and other gases. When we inhale, our diaphragm, a muscle at the base of the chest cavity, contracts and moves downward, expanding the chest cavity. The intercostal muscles, located between the ribs, also contract, raising the rib cage and increasing the volume of the chest cavity further. This decrease in pressure within the thoracic cavity causes the lungs to expand and fill with air. 2. Air entry into the respiratory tract: The inhaled air enters the body through the nose and/or mouth. The nasal cavity is lined with tiny hairs called cilia and a mucus membrane, which help filter out dust, allergens, and other particles before the air continues down the respiratory tract. 3. Air passes through the pharynx and larynx: After passing through the nasal cavity or the oral cavity, the air proceeds down the pharynx (throat) and then the larynx (voice box). The epiglottis, a flap of tissue at the base of the tongue, closes over the trachea (windpipe) during swallowing, preventing food or liquid from entering the lungs. 4. Air travels down the trachea and bronchi: The inhaled air continues down the trachea, which is composed of cartilaginous rings that provide structural support and keep the airway open. The trachea then divides into two main branches, called bronchi, which enter the left and right lungs. 5. Air distribution into the bronchioles and alveoli: Inside the lungs, the bronchi further divide into smaller tubes called bronchioles. These small, branching tubes culminate in tiny air sacs known as alveoli. The alveoli are surrounded by a dense network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. 6. Gas exchange occurs: This is the critical point where the inhaled air finally reaches the alveoli and the oxygen molecules diffuse across the thin walls of the alveoli into the capillaries. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses from the blood in the capillaries back into the alveoli. This process is called gas exchange, and it's the primary goal of respiratory system. 7. Oxygen transportation: Once the oxygen molecules have entered the bloodstream, they bind to hemoglobin in red blood cells. These oxygen-rich blood cells are then transported through the pulmonary veins to the left side of the heart, which pumps the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. In summary, the first step in allowing the cells of the lung to hold the air and perform gas exchange begins with inhalation and the resultant decrease in pressure within the thoracic cavity, leading to the expansion of the lungs and the intake of air through the respiratory tract. The process continues through various stages, ultimately achieving the efficient extraction of oxygen from the inhaled air and its transportation through the bloodstream to the body's cells."},{"instruction":"The pawn was hand carved, it was a fine what? - scheme - elephant - chess game - north carolina - chess set The best answer is Answer:","output":"chess set"},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: United States, language, English language; English language, spokenIn, Great Britain; United States, capital, Washington, D.C.; A Fortress of Grey Ice, country, United States.

This conclusion can be reached by analyzing the details and context of the phrase. 1. The word \\"slowly\\" suggests that the individual's pace was measured and unhurried. This could indicate that they found the task challenging or required more time to complete the sawing than they might if it were easy. They might have needed to maintain a slower pace to ensure accuracy, or they might have encountered some resistance, making quick progress difficult. 2. The word \\"doggedly\\" conveys a sense of determination and persistence because doggedness is an unwavering, tenacious approach towards a task. This implies that the subject was putting in effort and was committed to completing the sawing despite any challenges they faced. If the activity were easy, the use of \\"doggedly\\" might not have been necessary. 3. The phrase \\"he went on sawing to and fro\\" shows that the subject continued performing the task even though it may have been arduous. The fact that they pressed on might represent their resilience and commitment to accomplishing the goal, further reinforcing the idea that sawing was difficult. However, it is essential to consider the context and any additional information when drawing conclusions. While our analysis of the phrase indicates that \\"It was difficult to keep sawing,\\" other factors or a larger context might reveal that the difficulty was not due to the act of sawing itself but rather due to external factors like fatigue, unfavorable conditions, or time constraints.

This year his hometown suffered from snowstorms for nearly a month. The heavy snow stopped cars and trains, broke the electricity tower and turned tap water to ice. Every day Long Chuan had to walk several kilometers to carry drinking water. \\"I couldn't ride a bike and it took me 3 hours to walk to school. I can't remember how many times I slipped on the hard ice, \\" said Long Chuan. Long is not alone. This year millions of people in central and southern China had a freezing winter without enough water and electricity. The biggest snowstorms in 50 years killed more than 100 people. They also cost the country 111.1 billion yuan. Experts say a special type of climate condition , La Nina, caused the storms. During a La Nina, the water in the Pacific Ocean near the equator becomes colder than usual. It changes the weather around the world. Besides China, Canada, the US and Middle Eastern countries also met with heavy snowstorms this winter. The special climate caused the recent flooding in Australia, too. However, experts say that people have destroyed the environment . Global warming may be causing these terrible weather events to happen more and more often.

The story shared in the passage demonstrates the hardships faced by those affected by these extreme weather events. Long Chuan's struggle with traveling long distances for basic necessities, lack of water, and electricity, and the danger of slipping on ice portrays the difficulties faced by millions during this trying time. Along with China, other countries such as Canada, the US, and Middle Eastern countries also experienced heavy snowstorms this winter. The flooding in Australia is also mentioned as another example of extreme weather caused by this climate condition. La Nina is explained as a climate condition during which the water in the Pacific Ocean near the equator becomes colder than usual, leading to weather changes across the globe. The passage then highlights the role of environmental destruction and global warming in causing these disastrous weather events to happen more frequently. Through this information, the passage urges people to take responsibility for their impact on the environment and understand the consequences of their actions. Instead of offering simple solutions like wearing more clothes (A), stopping bike rides on hard ice (B), or only saving water and electricity (D), the passage emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment (C) in order to prevent such severe and widespread weather-related disasters in the future.

Therefore, Sentence B contradicts the logical course of action necessary for treating an injury, making it the choice that goes against common sense."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Introduction Blenheim Palace is one of the Europe's largest and greatest palaces. It was built between 1705 and 1722 as a reward of the British government to John Churchill, 1stDuke of Marlborough, for defeating King Louis XIV's army at Blenheim, a small Bavarian village on the Danube River. The palace was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh, which displayed strength and arm glory. It is the largest non-royal building in England and is now listed by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Winston Churchill In 1874, the palace was the birthplace of the duke's most famous _ . Winston Churchill, who was to become the UK's Prime Minister (some would say Britain's greatest 20th-century politician ) and Nobel prize winner for literature. It is also in Blenheim that Winston got married to Clementine Hozier in 1908. A lasting exhibition is devoted to the man's life, work and writings. Winston and his wife are buried in Bladon Church within the palace. Opening Hours & Admission Blenheim is still the home of the 11th Duke of Marlborough and is therefore not open all year round (although the park is). The palace opens its doors to visitors from 12 February to 11 December. Entry to the palace, park and gardens cost PS11.50 during the low season and PS13 during the peak season (Easter weekend and from 28 May to 11 September), or PS6/PS8 for the park and gardens only. The park is open all-year round from 9am to 4:45pm (last entry). Admission is PS2.50 for adults and PS1.50 for children. Note that numerous discounts exist for seniors, students, children and groups. Please refer to the official website for more details. Question: Why can not people visit Blenheim Palace all the year round? Answer: The answer is:","output":"People cannot visit Blenheim Palace all year round because it is still the home of the 11th Duke of Marlborough and is therefore not open for visitors throughout the entire year."},{"instruction":"The UDF leader -- chairman of parliament's economic committee -- noted that Bulgaria covers about 60% of its energy needs with current outputs of electricity.

Of the below sentences, which one does *not* make sense?

Explanation: In Sentence A, it is reasonable for someone to put roast beef in a fridge, as roast beef is a type of food that can spoil if left unrefrigerated, so storing it in the fridge will keep it fresh for consumption later. In Sentence B, the idea of putting an entire horse in a fridge is absurd and unrealistic for several reasons. First, a horse is a large animal that wouldn't physically fit into a typical refrigerator. Second, it's highly unlikely that someone would be eating a whole horse later, as this is not a common food item or quantity for human consumption. Additionally, even if an individual were to consume horse meat, it would typically be prepared and stored as smaller cuts of meat, not as a whole, intact animal.

Which bird is also known as the 'Adjutant Bird'?","output":"The bird commonly known as the 'Adjutant Bird' is the Greater Adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius), which is a large stork endemic to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It got its name “adjutant” from its upright and disciplined posture, which resembles a high-ranking military officer called an adjutant. This fascinating bird has a distinct appearance and is currently listed as an endangered species by the IUCN Red List. The Greater Adjutant is among the heaviest of flying birds, weighing between 12 to 20 pounds (5.5 to 9 kilograms) and boasting an impressive wingspan that ranges from 8.2 to 9.2 feet (250 to 280 centimeters). It has a massive dark gray to blackish bill, a dark gray head covered with sparse grayish hair-like feathers, a pale iris, a reddish pouch hanging from the neck, and black legs. The body is covered in white and dark gray feathers, while its folded wings display a combination of black, gray, and white feathers. Greater Adjutants are usually found in wetlands, marshes, swamps, and sometimes along riverbanks and in large dumpsites. They prefer feeding on a variety of food, from fish and amphibians to small rodents, birds, reptiles, and carrion. These solitary birds have shown a high level of adaptability by adjusting their diet depending on the availability of local food sources. An important aspect of the Greater Adjutant's life is its breeding behavior. They are colonial breeders, meaning they form nesting colonies with other storks during the breeding season. These nesting colonies are usually found in large trees. The female Greater Adjutant lays 2 to 4 wide, chalky-white eggs in a large nest made of sticks. Both parents share incubation duties for about 28 to 35 days; they tend the chicks until they fledge at around 150 days. Unfortunately, the Greater Adjutant has faced a sharp decline in population due to habitat loss, poaching, and other anthropogenic factors. Wetland destruction, pollution, and conversion of land for agriculture have resulted in a reduced availability of suitable nesting and feeding sites. Additionally, the loss of nesting trees and increased human disturbance in nesting areas have made breeding more challenging. Consequently, conservation efforts are crucial in order to protect and conserve this unique and endangered species. In recent years, some initiatives have been taken to raise awareness and conserve the remaining population of Greater Adjutants. These include habitat protection, nest monitoring, and community engagement programs. For instance, the conservation efforts by local communities in Assam, India, have helped stabilize the population and create a positive environment for these extraordinary birds. Through continued efforts and cooperation between governments, conservation organizations, and local communities, it is hoped that the Greater Adjutant will have a chance to rebound and thrive in its natural habitat."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end? The planned audition for the new movie did not take place. The +Audition was cancelled.; +Movie was cancelled.;","output":"The planned audition for the new movie did not take place. The audition was cancelled due to a myriad of contributing factors that ultimately led to the decision to suspend the production of the movie temporarily. Subsequently, this also meant that the original movie was cancelled, ushering in a period of uncertainty and disappointment for all those involved in the project. The primary reason for the cancellation of the audition was budgetary constraints. The production company faced financial challenges that prevented them from proceeding with the initial plans for the movie. Inadequate funding often puts a strain on the entire production process, right from pre-production, which involves conceptualizing, writing, and eventual casting. Consequently, the producers were left with little choice but to put a halt to the auditions. Moreover, the cancellation of the movie was brought on by a combination of issues involving the script and disagreements among the creative team. Revisions to the script were abundant and persistent, making it difficult to move forward with the casting process. The writers and director had differing visions for the narrative and character development, causing delays and tensions within the production team. Sadly, these unresolved disagreements led to the decision to cancel the project. Casting, which plays a crucial role in shaping the overall film, was another factor that contributed to the cancellation of the movie. It had been proving difficult to find suitable actors who could bring the desired depth and nuanced performances required for the various roles. The lack of progress in casting ultimately rendered the audition process redundant since the pool of talent was insufficient to populate the major roles. Competition within the film industry also contributed to the decision to cancel the movie. With several other productions in the pipeline targeting the same demographic or exploring similar themes, the production company grew increasingly wary of entering a saturated market. As a result, the producers began to reassess the viability of the project and eventually made the difficult decision to cancel the movie, consequently cancelling the auditions as well. Lastly, external circumstances such as the global COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted many industries, including film production. Adhering to safety mandates and ensuring the health and welfare of cast and crew members has led to many movie projects being postponed or cancelled altogether. In the case of this particular project, such unforeseen global events added to the aforementioned challenges and ultimately contributed to the cancellation of the movie and its associated audition. In conclusion, the planned audition for the new movie did not take place due to several factors that led to not only the cancellation of the audition but also the movie itself. Financial difficulties, creative disagreements, casting challenges, market competition, and unforeseen global events cumulatively forced the difficult decision to halt the production and disappoint the involved parties. The film industry is complex and ever-changing, and these setbacks serve to remind all those who work in it to persevere and adapt in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to German: My last point concerns the 'Information for patients' section.

Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine. Now, I have a new situation: Rob is an auto mechanic. He was checking the radiators of his car and truck. He put antifreeze into the car radiator, but didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather. Answer this question please: Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck?

Without antifreeze, the boiling point of the water in the truck radiator would be lower (100 °C) compared to the car radiator that has antifreeze (boiling point of 129 °C with a 50 percent antifreeze solution).

I had high expectations going into my visit to The Riverside Resort, nestled along the beautiful banks of the Blue River. The photos and glowing reviews online painted a picture of an idyllic paradise where time slows down and relaxation is paramount. However, upon setting foot in this establishment, my dream destination quickly revealed itself as a nightmare. To begin with, the reservation process was an absolute debacle. I booked my stay directly through the resort's website, hoping to alleviate any potential issues. Unfortunately, when I arrived, the front desk staff informed me that my room was no longer available due to \\"unforeseen circumstances.\\" The situation was poorly handled, it took the staff over an hour to find an alternative for me, and even then, it was a downgrade from what I initially booked. The disorganization did not stop there, as the staff seemed disjointed and unprofessional. It was apparent that they lacked proper training and communication skills, leading to confusion and misinformation about resort amenities, tours, and reservations. Once I got to my room, I hoped that the surrounding environment would make up for the initial inconvenience. Sadly, this was not the case. The room was outdated and unclean, with weary-looking furniture, chipped paint on the walls, and an uncomfortable musty smell that perpetuated throughout my stay. The supposedly picturesque view of the Blue River was obscured by unkempt foliage and construction equipment, which was not only an eyesore but also contributed to the incessant noise. A redeeming factor could have been the resort's restaurant, but disappointingly, that too fell drastically short of expectations. Overpriced and underwhelming, the food options were limited, and the quality left much to be desired. Wait times were abhorrent as well, with a 45-minute wait for a simple appetizer. To add to the misery, the staff seemed overwhelmed, resulting in neglectful service, forgotten orders, and overall disappointing dining experiences. The resort advertised a range of recreational activities and facilities, which could have salvaged my trip. Regrettably, these proved to be another letdown. The pool was uninviting and poorly maintained, with murky water and an unsettling collection of debris floating about. The gym was sorely lacking basic equipment and poorly ventilated, creating an unbearable atmosphere for any attempt to exercise. Despite being situated in an ideal location for exploring the natural wonders of the area, I found that the organization of tours and activities was abysmal. Some of the advertised day-trips were mysteriously unavailable upon booking inquiries, while others were so painfully disorganized and overcrowded that they quickly lost their appeal. In summary, my stay at The Riverside Resort was an utter disappointment, marred by unprofessionalism, subpar facilities, and missed expectations. I regret not researching further before investing my time and money in this establishment, and I strongly urge others to do so. Save yourself the heartache and look elsewhere for a memorable and enjoyable escape."},{"instruction":"In this task, you will be given a food review and a question about the reviewer's sentiment toward one aspect of the food in Persian.

The siblings were struck just before noon as they walked along the sidewalk of Seventh Avenue, between West 42nd and 43rd streets, police officials said. Elsman was pronounced dead at the scene. Her sister was taken to an area hospital, cops said. Less than an hour before the horrific crash, Elsman had posted a video on Instagram showing her standing atop the red staircase above the TKTS booth in Duffy Square, where she had visited one year ago. The sisters had been on vacation with their mother and one of Alyssa’s friends, Alyssa’s devastated boyfriend, Trevor West, told The Post. West said he knew something was wrong when Elsman didn’t respond to a text message he had sent her. “She would always text me back as quick as she could, and when I didn’t hear from her or her friend I knew something horrible happened,” West said. “I knew something was wrong.” West, who had started dating Elsman six months ago, said she was “everything” to him. “She motivated me, loved me, gave me everything I needed that I couldn’t give myself. And now that she’s gone, I don’t know how I’m going to fill that void,” West said. “I don’t know how I’m going to function without her ever again.” Elsman had told him she was enjoying her trip to the Big Apple, West recalled. But she also said she had started feeling sick while walking around Thursday morning. “She felt better in Times Square,” West said. “Then I didn’t hear from her.” Rojas was bent on committing murder and wanted cops to kill him, police sources told The Post. Of the 22 people injured in the crash, four were in critical condition as of Thursday night and three were in serious condition, authorities said. Elsman attended Portage Central High School and worked as a “carhop,” or roller-skating server, at a Sonic Drive-In, according to her Facebook page. She had been scheduled to return to Michigan on Tuesday. A witness, El Marvin, recalled seeing a young woman apparently dead on the ground. “I saw a girl, young . . . She was on the ground,” said Marvin, 38. “Her forehead was busted. Blood everywhere. She was gone. A police officer took his handkerchief and put it over her face. He was crying.” Another witness, Julio Sanchez River, 20, was delivering food in the area at the time and ducked inside a building when he saw Rojas’ car barreling toward him. “There were clothes and shoes everywhere,” he said. “I saw a bunch of people in the aftermath that got injured. It was a pretty scary sight. It was really gruesome.” Meanwhile, Mayor Bill de Blasio visited victims’ families at Bellevue Hospital on Thursday afternoon. “You are going to have to be strong now,” de Blasio was overheard telling relatives outside the pediatric ward.

(May 18) AP Emergency workers work at the scene after multiple people were injured when a vehicle struck numerous pedestrians May 18, 2017, in Times Square in New York City. (Photo: GARY HE, EPA) Staff and students at Portage Central High School are grieving the loss of a 2016 graduate who died today when a vehicle careened into a crowd in New York City's Times Square, killing the girl and injuring her sister and 21 others. Alyssa Elsman, 18, was a kind, compassionate student known around the school for selling delicious muffins she baked in a cooking class, principal Eric Alburtus said. \\"We're all kind of a mess,\\" he said late this afternoon as the community absorbed the shocking news. Related: A man who appeared to be intoxicated steered his car onto a sidewalk in Times Square around midday, killing Elsman and injuring 22 others including Alyssa's 13-year-old sister Ava. Ava attends Portage Central Middle School. The driver, 26-year-old Richard Rojas, was tackled by pedestrians and taken into custody. Alburtus was in a meeting when a news alert popped up on his phone about the crash. Later, about 2 p.m., he received calls from friends of the Elsman family who told him Alyssa had died. \\"Alyssa was wonderful young lady,\\" he said. \\"When you first got to know her, you would perceive that she was shy or quiet. The more you got to know her, the more you would realize she was funny, and thoughtful, and compassionate to other people.\\" Alburtus met with teachers this afternoon to tell them the news. The school is bringing in grief counselors Friday for students. “Our deepest sympathies go out to the Elsman family,” Portage Public Schools Superintendent Mark Bielang said in a statement. “It is the most devastating kind of sad when a wonderful person in our community is lost so young, and under such heartbreaking circumstances.” People from as far away as Belgium and Guatemala flooded Elsman's Facebook page with messages of condolence. The page says she worked as a carhop at a Sonic restaurant. Portage resident Olivia Lemke, 18, said her family moved next door to the Elsmans on Calico Avenue in Portage about a decade ago. She said the Elsmans, who no longer live next door, took an annual trip to New York City, and she guesses that’s why the sisters were in Times Square. Lemke recalled meeting Elsman on the playground of nearby Lake Center Elementary School. They became fast friends, lasting through when both graduated from Portage Central High School last year. “They were together a lot,” Olivia’s mother, Kristen Lemke, said. “If one wasn’t (at one house), the other was (at the other house). They spent a lot of time together.” Olivia Lemke described Elsman as a “wallflower.” She said Elsman had a tight-knit friend group of about four people along with many friendly acquaintances. “She was a good person and a family person,” Kristen Lemke said. “She took care of her brother and sister a lot and she was always there.” “I went to her for everything — literally,” Olivia Lemke added. “She was honest.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

He says he was just being the showman he is. “Many of those comments are made as an entertainer because I did The Apprentice and it was one of the top shows on television,” he told Greta Van Susteren on Thursday night. “Some comments are made as an entertainer and as everybody said, as an entertainer is a much different ball game.” Story Continued Below Trump who is leading in Republican polls has said comments that would have buried many other candidates. A Rolling Stone story Wednesday illustrates a scene where Trump watches Fiorina come onto the TV screen. “’Look at that face!' he cries. 'Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!' The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. 'I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not s'posed ta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?'” On Thursday night, he reiterated what he told CNN earlier — that the face comments were actually about her persona. “We’re really talking about not a physical thing, we’re talking about the persona. This is a women that gets tremendous publicity,” he said. “I don’t know why…her past doesn’t go along with the publicity she’s getting.” But it didn’t take long before he was back on his favorite punching bag: Jeb Bush. “When somebody knocks me like Jeb Bush or anybody else, I at least decide that I think it’s appropriate to fight back.” Van Susteren pointed out this wasn’t his first time saying controversial comments about women. Trump responded that he was leading with women, and many other groups. “I’d like to say that nobody understands and nobody wants to do more for women,” Trump said, a favorite line of his. “My wife was talking to me and she said you cherish women you really have to talk about it a little bit more.” Trump also addressed his spat with Dr. Ben Carson. Earlier Thursday he said Carson, who is the first person to successfully separate twins conjoined at the back of the head, was an “OK doctor.” Trump backtracked a bit, saying he’s sure some people will disagree with his views. “I’m sure he’s a good doctor, I think that he’s overrated as a doctor,” Trump said.

Having lots of enjoyable sex may put them at a greater risk for heart complications. The study, published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior, looked at 2,204 people between the ages 57 to 85. The people were interviewed again five years later, in an effort to understand how sex impacts people’s health later in life. The report authors found that men who reported having at least weekly sex were more likely to report experiencing heart problems when they were interviewed again a few years later compared to men who were not sexually active. “Older men who found sex with their partner extremely pleasurable or satisfying had higher risk of cardiovascular events than men who did not feel so,” said study author Hui Liu, an associate professor of sociology at Michigan State University in a statement. Women, however, did not experience any increase in heart health problems with more sexual activity. In fact, women who reported feeling highly satisfied with their sex life had a lower risk of high blood pressure years later compared to women who didn’t hold the same level of satisfaction. Before older men give up on a healthy sexual relationship, it’s important to point out that the study only found a link between heart problems and sex, and it’s not definitive. More studies are needed to gain a clearer understanding of the benefits and risks of sex later in life, and whether the amount of sexual activity matters as people age. Liu recommends men have conversations with their physicians about their health and sexuality. Why might men have a higher risk for heart issues? While sex is shown to have health benefits, including better heart health, overdoing it late in life could be problematic, the study authors suggest. Overall, older men tend to have more sexual complications compared to younger men, and Liu argues that the exertion to reach orgasm could be causing heart stress. It’s also possible that medications men take to improve their sexual performance, like testosterone therapy, could be playing a role. However the researchers did not look at this connection in the study. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1.

A hand suddenly reaches out and grabs Larry.After the opening credits, we see another two-story house having some construction. Among the workers are an exterminator and a man named Arkin (Josh Stewart). The family living in the house is Michael (Michael Reilly Burke), his wife Victoria (Andrea Roth), their teenage daughter Jill (Madeline Zima), and their little girl Hannah (Karley Scott Collins). Michael asks for Arkin to finish putting bars on the windows today.While outside, Arkin smokes a cigarette while putting up the remaining bars. After he finishes, Michael pays Arkin for his work and throws in a little extra for Arkin's daughter Cindy. Michael tells him to cherish his daughter, since they get all weird once they hit their teens. Arkin thanks him and drives off.Later, at home Arkin and his wife Lisa go to the kitchen, where she asks him for the money. It turns out that Lisa owes money to loan sharks, and the deadline is tonight. She's planning on running away with Cindy since she can't pay them, but Arkin promises to get the money for her debt by midnight. Arkin calls Roy (Robert Wisdom) and wants to see him immediately. They meet at a sleazy strip club and talk inside Roy's car. Arkin is an ex-convict and Roy helped him out while in prison. Arkin has been repaying Roy by picking locks and stealing things for him. Arkin tells Roy that he's been casing the house he's been working on. Michael is a jewel broker, and has a valuable jewel hidden in a safe. The family is out...

It's an excellent way to help our moms and dads around the house. In this article, we will learn three simple steps to care for your bed. Let's make our beds the comfiest and coziest place to rest! 1. Flip or Rotate the Mattress First, ask your mom or dad for help with this step. A mattress is the soft, squishy part of the bed that we sleep on. We need to flip (turn it over) or rotate (spin it around) the mattress to make it stay nice and comfy! Imagine you have a yummy sandwich. After eating half of it, you might flip it over to have a taste of the other side. That's just like flipping a mattress! It helps to wear out both sides evenly and makes for a comfy night's sleep. And if you just spin it around like a fun game, that's rotating! This is helpful because sometimes we sleep in one spot for many nights, and rotating it helps the mattress wear out evenly too. 2. Apply a Mattress Protector Next, we need a superhero to protect our mattress! Just kidding, we don't need a superhero. We need a mattress protector – a special cover that goes on top of the mattress. It's easy-peasy to put it on – just ask your mom or dad for help. A mattress protector is very important because it keeps our mattress clean from dirt, spills, and dust. Think about it like a shield that keeps our mattress safe and cozy. Putting on a mattress protector helps us sleep better and makes our mattress last longer too. 3. Make the Bed Now that our mattress is flipped and protected, it's time to make the bed! Gather your bed sheets, pillows, and comforter. Start by laying the bedsheet over the mattress. Pretend you're tucking in your teddy bear for bedtime – make sure it's snug and not crinkly. Next, let's fluff those pillows! Give the pillows some fun little shakes and pats, so they become extra-plump and soft. Then, place them nicely at the head of the bed. Lastly, let's cover the bed with your comforter. Spread it out like a big hug over the bed, and make sure it's smooth and covers the whole mattress. That's it! You've learned how to care for your bed in three easy steps: flipping or rotating the mattress, applying a mattress protector, and making the bed. Practice these steps with mom and dad, and soon, you'll be the best little helper in the house! Sweet dreams, kiddo!"},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: – Is French designer Balenciaga making fun of its wealthy clients, or does it just know a thing or two about brand loyalty? Whatever the case, the Sun reports the fashion house is selling a mock white paper shopping bag for £876, which works out to roughly 1,110, and it's so popular it's sold out on Colette. It looks just like the free paper bags Balenciaga gives patrons their purchases in, only this one is made from calfskin and costs just a touch more. Time calls it Balenciaga's \\"latest effort to troll the fashion world\\" after it released a 2,145 version of one of those cheap blue IKEA shopping bags in April. In a one-up over the freebie paper bag, the new version does boast plenty of zippers and pockets inside. If you've got 1,110 burning a hole in your pocket and you want to walk around town looking perpetually like you've just shopped at Balenciaga, this bag's for you. (Some people are getting heel surgery to fit into designer shoes.)","output":"Title: Balenciaga's Mock Paper Shopping Bag: A Statement on Brand Loyalty or Just Another Fashion Troll? Introduction: French designer, Balenciaga, has always been at the forefront of high fashion and luxury goods. However, their recent release of the mock white paper shopping bag for a staggering £876 (around 1,110) has raised questions on whether the brand is making a social statement or just poking fun at its customers. The Mock Paper Shopping Bag: Initially spotted on the popular French retailer's website, Colette, this Balenciaga bag is currently sold out. At first glance, the bag looks strikingly similar to the free paper bags given to customers at Balenciaga shopping outlets. The major difference lies in the materials used - the mock paper bag is made from calfskin. Additionally, the bag also features numerous pockets and zippers, unlike the original free paper bag. A Trend of Trolling Fashion: Balenciaga's penchant for quirky designs and sharp wit is seen in their past releases, like the 2,145 IKEA-inspired blue shopping bag. Time magazine calls this design fad Balenciaga's \\"latest effort to troll the fashion world.\\" Is this a statement on brand loyalty? The mock paper shopping bag could be seen as an exploration of brand loyalty. Its popularity shows that the power of a brand name like Balenciaga still remains strong, whether it's a luxurious item or simply a replica of a disposable paper bag. Or, are they mocking their wealthy clients? While tapping into brand loyalty, it is also possible that Balenciaga is making fun of its wealthy clients by selling a high-priced version of a free shopping bag. The decision to charge such a hefty price for a bag that seemingly comes with Balenciaga's approval may leave some wondering if it's a tongue-in-cheek response. Conclusion: Balenciaga's mock paper shopping bag provokes a range of questions regarding its intent, but the extreme popularity and quick sell-out of the product indicate that the designer's target audience seems to be embracing the irony. Whether this is a statement on the fashion world's obsession with brands or an elaborate joke by the designer, seeking to make a statement through innovative design, Balenciaga has certainly captured the attention and wallets of fashion enthusiasts."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I can use this background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns.

Options: - ordering dog food online - avoid eye contact - feel guilty - fall asleep - blush Reasoning process:","output":"To determine the common sign that someone is lying, we need to assess each option and find the one most strongly associated with deception. 1. Ordering dog food online: This action is unrelated to lying as it is an everyday task performed by pet owners to provide for their pets. There is no direct connection between lying and this task. 2. Avoiding eye contact: When someone is lying, they might avoid making eye contact as they feel uncomfortable or guilty. This is because eye contact is associated with sincerity, and avoiding it can be a sign that the person is trying to hide something. 3. Feeling guilty: While some people may feel guilty when they lie, this internal feeling is not easily observable as an external sign. Moreover, not everyone may experience guilt when lying. 4. Falling asleep: Sleep is a natural bodily function and unrelated to lying. Falling asleep doesn't indicate deception, and there is no evidence connecting sleep with dishonesty. 5. Blushing: Blushing could be associated with various emotions, such as embarrassment, shyness, or nervousness. It is not a reliable indicator of lying, as an individual can blush for reasons unrelated to deception. Based on the reasoning above, the most common sign that someone is lying from the given options is \\"avoiding eye contact.\\" This is because it is an observable behavior that has a stronger connection to deception compared to the other options listed."},{"instruction":"Coming off their bye week, the Texans were at home for a Week 11 interconference duel with the New Orleans Saints.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What is the most probable reason that the kids were photographed smiling while displaying their Obama dolls ?","output":"Based on the preceding passage, the most probable reason that the kids were photographed smiling while displaying their Obama dolls is that the dolls were distributed at a rally for President Obama, and the children were positioned as symbols of the younger generation's enthusiasm and support for the political leader. It is made evident from the context that the setting is a political rally event for President Obama. The kids were given Obama dolls as gifts by another rally attendee, which can be perceived as an attempt to include them in the event's atmosphere and encourage their participation. These dolls most likely represent President Obama, possibly created as part of his official merchandise or campaign promotional items. By giving the children Obama dolls, the event organizers or other attendees aimed to create snapshots that depict a positive and supportive image of the campaign. These photographs, which show the kids smiling with the Obama dolls, could be later used in promotional materials, social media, or news coverage to communicate enthusiasm towards the leader from various age groups, including the younger generation. The fact that Gary and the narrator rolled their eyes while the kids were being photographed holding the dolls shows that they might have been skeptical or simply not amused by the gesture.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Options are: A). Remove valve stem cap, attach air nozzle, turn on and inflate, don't replace cap.. B). Remove valve stem cap, attach air nozzle, turn on and inflate, replace cap..","output":"B). Remove valve stem cap, attach air nozzle, turn on and inflate, replace cap. This solution is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it covers all the necessary steps in a logical order to properly inflate a car tire, ensuring safety and correct tire pressure. Let's analyze the steps in detail: 1. Remove valve stem cap: The valve stem cap is an essential component that keeps dirt and moisture away from the valve stem. Removing the cap allows you to access the valve itself, where you will need to attach the air nozzle in order to inflate the tire. 2. Attach air nozzle: Connecting the air nozzle to the valve stem is a crucial step as it is through this connection that the air will flow into the tire. The connection should be secure and tight to avoid any air leakage. There are different types of air nozzles available, and most tire inflators use the Schrader valve, which is standard for car tires. 3. Turn on and inflate: Once the air nozzle is securely connected, turning on the inflation mechanism allows the air to flow into the tire. You should always check the recommended tire pressure for your car, which can usually be found on a placard inside the driver's door, in the owner's manual, or on the tire sidewall. It's essential to keep a close eye on the tire pressure gauge (found on the air pump or a separate handheld gauge) while inflating to ensure that you don't overinflate or underinflate the tire. 4. Replace cap: After reaching the desired tire pressure and disconnecting the air nozzle, it's essential to replace the valve stem cap. The cap essentially functions as a secondary seal, helping to minimize air leakage from the valve stem and protect the valve from elements like dirt, moisture, and debris. A missing or damaged cap can lead to a slow air leak, causing your tire to lose pressure over time. This could affect your fuel efficiency, handling, and overall safety of the car. By following these steps in solution B, you can safely and efficiently inflate your car tire to the recommended pressure, ensuring optimal performance and safety on the road. Replacing the valve stem cap is a crucial aspect of inflating car tires, making option B the more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning."},{"instruction":"Q: Integral proteins penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the what? A:","output":"A: Integral proteins penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer, which forms the basis for the structure of cell membranes. The lipid bilayer is composed of two layers of phospholipid molecules, each with a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a hydrophobic (water-repelling) tail. These phospholipid molecules arrange themselves in a manner that the hydrophilic heads face the aqueous environments inside and outside the cell, while the hydrophobic tails form the inner core of the membrane, away from the water. Integral proteins, also known as integral membrane proteins, possess hydrophobic regions that interact with the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer. They can be subdivided into two categories: transmembrane proteins and lipid-anchored proteins. Transmembrane proteins span the entire length of the membrane and usually have one or more hydrophobic regions that traverse the lipid bilayer. Lipid-anchored proteins, on the other hand, do not pass through the entire membrane; instead, they are attached to the membrane via a lipid molecule embedded within the hydrophobic core. One of the primary roles of integral proteins is to act as transporters, channels, or carriers for molecules and ions that cannot pass through the lipid bilayer due to their size, charge, or polarity. In addition to their role in transport, integral proteins also serve various essential functions, such as cell adhesion, cell signaling, and enzymatic activity. Moreover, integral proteins lend specificity to different cell types and can act as receptors for hormones, growth factors, and other signaling molecules that regulate cellular functions. The interaction between these integral membrane proteins and other cellular components is crucial for maintaining the proper functioning of cells and the organism as a whole."},{"instruction":"... the philosophical seeker incessantly returns to the remembrance of the glimpse, uses it to work continuously at the transformation of his self and never lets go of the vision.

It is the most abundant and widespread lead ore mineral and has been mined for its lead content for thousands of years. Galena is a lead sulfide mineral (PbS) that commonly occurs in hydrothermal veins, contact metamorphic environments, and in association with various other sulfide minerals. Galena's chemical composition is mainly composed of lead (86.6%) and sulfur (13.4%). Due to its high density, it is often found in large deposits and is easily recognizable by its metallic luster, cuboctahedral crystal structure, and its grey or silver color. Galena is a very dense and brittle mineral, which can be easily cleaved along three perfect cleavage planes, producing cubes or other shapes. The extraction and processing of lead from galena ore involve a combination of several steps. The process typically begins with the mining of the ore, which is followed by crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the mineral particles. After that, the ground ore is subjected to a froth flotation process to separate the lead sulfide from other associated minerals, such as zinc, iron, and copper sulfides. In the froth flotation process, the crushed and ground ore is mixed with water and various chemicals to create a slurry. Air is then introduced into the slurry, forming bubbles that rise to the surface carrying the hydrophobic lead sulfide particles. The froth on the surface, rich in lead sulfide, is collected and separated from the remaining gangue (unwanted minerals) in the slurry. This froth concentrate undergoes further purification and refining processes to extract the lead metal. After the froth flotation, the lead sulfide concentrate is roasted in a furnace, converting the lead sulfide to lead oxide (PbO). This step also helps remove any remaining sulfur as sulfur dioxide (SO2), which can be later used in the production of sulfuric acid. The lead oxide is then reduced to metallic lead (Pb) through a process known as smelting. This involves mixing the lead oxide with other materials, such as limestone or silica, and heating it above 1,000 °C in an oxygen-rich environment. Metallic lead separates from the mixture during this process and sinks to the bottom of the furnace, from where it can be collected and further refined. One of the final steps in lead production is refining, which involves removing any remaining impurities or non-lead components from the extracted lead. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as electrolysis, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical processes, depending on the specific composition of the initial lead metal. The pure lead is then cast into ingots or other forms and used for various industrial and manufacturing applications. Despite its widespread use, lead is highly toxic to humans, animals, and the environment. Prolonged exposure to lead can result in a variety of health issues, including neurological disorders, developmental issues in children, and other systemic problems. As a result, there have been increased efforts in recent years to minimize lead exposure and find alternative materials for various applications. Some countries have implemented strict regulations on the use of lead, including bans on lead-based paints and reduction of lead in gasoline."},{"instruction":"even after pearson died in 1936, fisher continued his attack on him, which made the atmosphere in university college a very difficult one with pearson 's son egon pearson also holding a chair there.

Logan finds the woman, Beth Green (Taylor Schilling), but has difficulty explaining why he is there. She assumes he wants to apply for a job, and her grandmother, Ellie (Blythe Danner) hires him. At first, Beth is irritated by Logan's presence, but she begins to warm to him as Logan's calm presence, willingness to work, and competence in repairing machinery are demonstrated. Logan develops a supportive relationship with Beth's son, Ben, who is without positive male influence since the death of Beth's brother, Drake. Beth's former husband, Sheriff Deputy Keith Claytonâthe son of the town's judgeâis immediately suspicious of Logan. He is brusque and overbearing with the former Marine. He discourages Ben from playing the violin around him, leading to Ben to practicing in his tree house. When Ben returns bloodied from a charity baseball game, Beth and Keith have an argument, and Keith threatens to use his connections to take full custody of Ben. Beth is anxious over Keith's short temper, and is fearful of losing her son to him. On the anniversary of Drake's death, Beth becomes...

Question: Who do police accuse of the robbery? Title: The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner Movie plot: \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\" begins with Colin Smith (Tom Courtenay) running, alone, along a bleak country road somewhere in rural England. In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Next, we see Colin in handcuffs with a group of other similarly encumbered young men. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, what we would today term a medium security prison for young juvenile offenders. It is overseen by \\"The Governor\\" (Michael Redgrave), who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of The Governor's rehabilitation program is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, able to easily outrun Ruxton's reigning long distance runner. As The Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile marathon against a nearby public school, Ranley, and its privileged students from upper class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation program.As the Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed wire fences, we learn in a series of flashbacks how Colin came to be incarcerated. We see his difficult, economically strained family life in a lower-class workers' complex in industrial Nottingham. Without a job, Colin indulges in petty crimes in the company of his best friend, Mike (James Bolam).

Depending upon your situation, the tightness of your pants may be making your erection worse. Try discreetly loosening your pants. Sit down behind a table or desk and unbuckle your belt. If needed, unbutton and partially unzip your pants to give your erection more \\"breathing room\\" with less pressure. Be conscious of where you are. Don't be obvious. You don't want to be mistaken for some sort of pervert. If you have a bit of privacy, applying a cold pack to your crotch (outside your clothing) can soothe discomfort and encourage your erection to dissipate as well. If you've ever been in a cold swimming pool or outside on a cold day in shorts, you know that the penis and testes tend to retract towards the warmth of your body. While taking a cold shower is often considered the way to \\"cool off\\" raging sexual desires, a warm bath can actually provide a soothing, comfortable environment that may bring your erection to a faster conclusion. Light exercise, like walking on a treadmill or simple aerobics, can also help provide distraction and a shift in blood distribution. These alternatives are often used as initial efforts to end a possible case of priapism, in which the pooled blood becomes trapped in the shaft of the penis. If you have an erection that lasts for more than four hours for any reason, seek medical attention immediately. If not treated quickly, priapism can lead to permanent damage, including but not limited to erectile dysfunction. This may not be easy to do with an erection, but urinating can sometimes make an erection go away. Urination causes pleasant, relaxing feelings in your groin, which can make an erection feel less \\"tight\\" or \\"urgent.\\" Waking up in the morning with an erection is common for men of all ages. It can occur with or without the prompting of sexually-arousing dreams. Despite the degree of difficulty in hitting your target while you have an erection, urinating can often help bring it to a conclusion quickly. When it comes down to it, the most effective way to end an erection is to bring it to its natural conclusion. Barring a medical condition, ejaculation almost invariably causes an erection to end. Discreetly excuse yourself from the situation and find a private area: a bathroom, a bedroom, or anywhere else you feel sure that you won't disturb anyone. Do your business, clean up, and return to the situation relieved and ready to go. Avoid masturbating in public. If you do find yourself in a public place with an erection, find somewhere relatively private to do your thing. A lockable bathroom stall will do in a pinch, as long as you aren't loud or obvious about what you're doing. Public masturbation is illegal in many places, and you might disturb people if you aren't careful.","output":"Tight pants can make an erection worse, so loosening them, finding privacy, and trying different methods like cold packs, exercise, or urination can help make the erection go away."},{"instruction":"Given the below context: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

However, to make the table stable, you should look for casters that have locks or brakes on them. When you need the table to be stable, you can simply lock the wheels, and it won't move anymore.

Movie plot title: Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter Movie plot: When his village is plagued by mysterious deaths marked by highly accelerated aging, Dr. Marcus calls in his army friend, Captain Kronos. Kronos and his companion, the hunchback Hieronymus Grost, are professional vampire hunters. Grost explains to the initially sceptical Marcus that the dead women are victims of a vampire who drains not blood but youth, and that there are \\"as many species of vampire as there are beasts of prey.\\" The discovery of another victim confirms Grost's explanation. Along the way, Kronos and Grost take in a local barefoot girl, Carla, who had been sentenced to the stocks for dancing on the Sabbath. She repays them by helping them hunt the vampire; she later becomes Kronos' lover. Grost and Kronos conduct a mystical test that indicates the presence of vampires. Their findings are contradicted by an eyewitness who claims to have seen \\"someone old, very old\\", whereas a youth-draining vampire should appear youthful. Marcus visits the family of his late friend, Lord Hagen Durward, and speaks with Durward's son, Paul (Shane Briant), and his beautiful sister Sara (Lois Daine). He must leave before speaking with the bed-ridden Lady Durward. While riding through the woods, Marcus encounters a cloaked figure that leaves him shaken, and he finds blood on his lips. At a tavern, Kronos defeats thugs led by Kerro, who were hired by Lady Durward's coachman to murder him. Kronos, Grost, Marcus and Carla set up a network of alarm bells in the woods to announce the passage of vampires. Meanwhile, a large bat attacks and kills a young woman. Marcus realises that he has become a vampire and begs Kronos to kill him. After various methods (including impalement with a stake and hanging) fail, Kronos accidentally pierces Marcus's chest with a cross of steel that Marcus had been wearing round his neck. Having thus determined the vampireâs weakness, Kronos and Grost obtain an iron cross from a cemetery. They are accosted by angry villagers who believe that they murdered Dr. Marcus.

Although offering some feedback for improvement, the review is quite vague and requires more elaboration for it to be helpful for both the developers and potential users. The review's brevity is a notable concern. It does not provide essential information about the context, product, or specific issues encountered. For instance, it is unclear which product or application this feedback applies to. It would have been helpful for the reviewer to include the name and, possibly, the version of the product for the developers to pinpoint the problem and address it more effectively. Moreover, the review lacks a clear description of the issues encountered, which can hinder understanding the problems leading to this \\"unstable\\" experience. Adding specific examples, such as crashes, slowdowns, or unusual behaviors, could significantly improve the review's usefulness. Furthermore, mentioning the user's device type, operating system, and version could help developers verify if these issues are platform-specific or more widespread. Another point to consider when rating this review is its tone. While not overtly negative, it is oddly curt and demanding. A more constructive and polite tone would make it easier for developers to appreciate the feedback and act on it promptly. Even though the review's brevity and lack of specificity are significant drawbacks, it does bring to light one potential issue: instability. Since stability is critical for any product's user experience, the developers should take this concern seriously. In conclusion, a rating of 2 is appropriate for this review, as it reveals limited information but still offers some input for improvement. To increase the rating, the reviewer should have provided more context, specific examples, and delivered the feedback in a more constructive manner."},{"instruction":"If I tell you that Smaller rocks come from the interaction of bedrock with wind over long periods of time, and ask you the question \\"smaller rocks come from the interaction of bedrock with what over long periods of time\\", is the correct answer \\"volcanoes\\"?

Warner Bros. Records was established on March 19, 1958, as the recorded-music division of the American film studio Warner Bros.. For most of its early existence it was one of a group of labels owned and operated by larger parent corporations. The sequence of companies that controlled Warner Bros. and its allied labels evolved through a convoluted series of corporate mergers and acquisitions from the early 1960s to the early 2000s. Over this period, Warner Bros. Records grew from a struggling minor player in the music industry to become one of the top recording labels in the world. In 2003, these music assets were divested by their then owner Time Warner and purchased by a private equity group. This independent company traded as the Warner Music Group before being bought by Access Industries in 2011.

Possible A: shed, garage, cutting grass, lawn, neighbor's house Why is \\"neighbor's house\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"The answer \\"neighbor's house\\" is aligned with human common sense for several reasons. Firstly, let's analyze the context of the question. You mentioned that you can hear the lawnmower from across the street. This would imply that the sound is emanating from a location outside your own property, which subsequently suggests that the source of the noise is most likely from a nearby neighbor. Now let's take a closer look at the other possible answers: 1. Shed: This option may imply that the lawnmower is placed inside a shed across the street. While it is possible that the sound is coming from a shed, lawnmowers typically generate noise when activated. Therefore, it is unlikely that the lawnmower would be running while inside a storage facility like a shed. Furthermore, when a lawnmower is running inside a shed, the loudness of the noise may be reduced when it reaches you across the street, making it less probable that this is where the sound comes from. 2. Garage: Similar to the \\"shed\\" option, this answer suggests that the lawnmower is positioned inside a garage across the street. As previously mentioned, lawnmowers generally produce noise when they are in use. Consequently, if the lawnmower is being operated within a garage, the sound will likely be muffled or contained as it will face obstruction before reaching your ears across the street. 3. Cutting grass: In this option, the implied answer is that the lawnmower is in use, actively cutting grass. However, it does not specify where exactly the grass is being cut. Although this may seem like a plausible answer at first, it is less precise in terms of identifying the source's exact location. 4. Lawn: This response suggests that the lawnmower is merely situated on the lawn area of a property across the street. However, this does not necessarily explain the sound you are hearing. Lawnmowers can be placed on a lawn without being activated, and in such cases, would not make any noise. Hence, this answer lacks clarity in terms of providing a suitable explanation for the noise you are hearing. Comparatively, the answer \\"neighbor's house\\" considers the context of the question by acknowledging that the sound you hear is coming from a lawnmower across the street. Human common sense would indicate that the likeliest scenario would be a neighbor using their lawnmower to maintain the yard or cut grass, actively engaging the machine and generating noise. This answer covers both the location and the reason behind the noise, making it an appropriate response that aligns with human common sense."},{"instruction":"Question: Article: Street art is very popular around the world. You can find it on buildings, street signs and trash cans from Tokyo to Paris, from Moscow to Cape Town. Street art has become a global culture and even art museums are collecting the works of street artists. People have different opinions about street art. Some think it is bad, but others think it is a very beautiful new culture. Street art began in New York in the 1960s. This style of drawing and writing became know as graffiti. Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. One well-known New York street artist is Swoon. She cuts paper pictures of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start as street artist. She studied art but, later, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. Nowadays the Internet has a big influence on street art. Artists can show their pictures to people around the world.

This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime. Which area, Texas or Seattle, will have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire? Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. A:","output":"Based on the provided hint, Texas is likely to have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire compared to Seattle. This is due to the fact that it is currently daytime in Texas, which typically leads to higher temperatures, lower humidity, and increased wind speeds.

Here is a hypothesis: The Beyazet Camii on the east side of the square dates back to the 16th century. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. This conclusion is based on the information provided in the premise and can be explained in detail as follows. The premise states two main points about the Beyazet Camii: 1. It is located on the east side of the square. 2. It was built in the early 16th century by Sultan Beyazet II, son of Mehmet the Conqueror. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: The hypothesis states that the Beyazet Camii on the east side of the square dates back to the 16th century. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes apparent that both statements convey similar information. The hypothesis simply condenses the information found in the premise without altering or contradicting anything. More specifically, the premise tells us that the Beyazet Camii is on the east side of the square, and the hypothesis reaffirms this by mentioning \\"the east side of the square.\\" Additionally, the premise states that the mosque was built in the early 16th century, and the hypothesis corresponds to this by asserting that it \\"dates back to the 16th century.\\" While the hypothesis doesn't mention the builder of the mosque or his relation to Mehmet the Conqueror, it does not deny or contradict this information either. In summary, the hypothesis is aligned with the premise in terms of both location and time of construction. Thus, if the premise is true, it logically follows that the hypothesis is true as well. Consequently, we can conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"My daughter was away at college preparing for her final exams and nursing boards.

I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred.

The increased bombing is the latest evidence the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan is significantly intensifying since U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new military strategy for the country in August. Coalition planes dropped 1,186 weapons on Afghanistan during the first three months of 2018, according to figures released by U.S. Air Forces Central Command. The previous record (1,083) was set during the height of the war in 2011. The U.S. has not released 2001 to 2003 airstrike data. Those figures do not include activity by the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which has stepped up its aerial bombardment since gaining the ability to conduct airstrikes two years ago. The AAF carries out between 4 to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. If recent trends are any indication, 2018 is likely to get even more violent. Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources.

Mandelson's advice comes as political parties continue to engage in discussions aimed at forming a strong, stable government. In his statement, Mandelson emphasized the importance of the Labour party preparing for potential coalition negotiations which may involve the Liberal Democrats. By demanding Clegg's resignation at this stage, it is suggested that Labour could jeopardize its chances of successfully securing a positive outcome in any negotiations. Furthermore, the Labour peer argued that it is still too early for the party to contemplate entering a deal with the Scottish National Party (SNP). As political discourse surrounding the formation of a new government continues to unfold, Mandelson urges caution and strategic thinking from his fellow party members. His comments serve as a reminder that political parties must navigate multiple perspectives and agendas when attempting to forge new alliances. By focusing on internal discourse and readiness for negotiations, Mandelson advocates for a patient approach that values long-term success over immediate gratification. In conclusion, Lord Mandelson's advice aims to strengthen the Labour party's position by encouraging its members to be prepared for coalition negotiations and to be mindful of the importance of ally relations.

It can be tough to approach new people at school or work, especially if you’re naturally shy. Try to relax, remind yourself that everyone gets nervous, and take a step out of your comfort zone. For example, instead of eating lunch alone, look for someone you’ve never met and say, “Hey there! Is this seat taken?” Later on, they’ll probably notice you when you pass them in the hallway and say hello. If you’re nervous, remember that everyone has insecurities and gets shy, even if they seem totally confident on the outside. When you meet someone or have a conversation, smile naturally and look them in the eye. Try not to fake a smile and, if you have to, think of something that cracks you up without fail. When making eye contact, don’t stare without blinking, but look at the person directly to show you’re paying attention to them. Whether you’re having lunch with someone new or at a work meeting, try to think of thoughtful questions that show you’re engaged in the moment. When the person responds, try to pay attention to them instead of just thinking of something interesting to say. For example, if you’re at a new school, ask the person sitting next to you, “What do you do for fun? Are you in any clubs or do you play a sport?” Instead of asking another unrelated question after they respond, say something like, “Oh cool! I’ve never played hockey, but it’s fun to watch. Do lots of people go to games and show school spirit?” Once they respond, try mentioning an activity that you are interested in to build the conversation. From your music taste to snowboarding, an interest or hobby can make you more noticeable. However, you don't want to just adopt the interests of your crush or a popular person to get them to notice you. Figure out what you enjoy and do it. If you love a music genre, listen to as many tracks and artists as you can and learn about its evolution. Developing an interest or hobby can help you spark conversations and get noticed by like-minded people. If you already have an interesting hobby, you can use it to start conversations as well. Joining a club or sports team is another great way to meet new people and make deeper connections. Since everyone involved already has that activity in common, it can be a little easier to form relationships with your teammates. Running for student government is another great way to get recognized by your peers. If your workplace has a company team, join it or support it. For example, if there’s a company softball team but you’re not the best athlete, go to the game, cheer for your team, and bring a cooler with refreshments. Whether it’s a school dance or a company cocktail hour, do your best to attend social events. You have to put yourself out there if you want people to notice you. If you stay home, you could be passing up a good time or networking opportunity. If you’re an introvert, try to use it to your advantage at social events. Listen and observe while all the extroverts talk. Then, when the opportunity presents itself, you could say to someone, “I heard you mention Roald Dahl earlier. He’s my favorite author!” Whether the person is your crush or an executive at work, they’ll notice that you paid attention to them and sparked a meaningful conversation.","output":"So, it's important to talk to new people every day, even if you're shy. Try smiling, looking in their eyes, and asking questions about what they like to do for fun. Join clubs and teams to meet more friends, and go to social events so people can notice you. Remember, it's okay to be a little nervous because everyone feels that way sometimes. Just be yourself and try to have fun when talking to others!"},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a context, a question, three options, and an answer.

Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Kentucky Supreme Court was created by a 1975 constitutional amendment and is the state supreme court of the U.S. state of Kentucky. Prior to that the Kentucky Court of Appeals was the only appellate court in Kentucky. The Kentucky Court of Appeals is now Kentucky's intermediate appellate court. - The Kentucky House of Representatives is the lower house of the Kentucky General Assembly. It is composed of 100 Representatives elected from single-member districts throughout the Commonwealth. Not more than two counties can be joined to form a House district, except when necessary to preserve the principle of equal representation. Representatives are elected to two-year terms with no term limits. The Kentucky House of Representatives convenes at the State Capitol in Frankfort. - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. - The Kentucky General Assembly, also called the Kentucky Legislature, is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Kentucky. - An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court, court of appeals (American English), appeal court (British English), court of second instance or second instance court, is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal. In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court. Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules. - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States. Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia, in 1792 Kentucky became the 15th state to join the Union. Kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States. - James Clark ( January 16 , 1779 -- August 27 , 1839 ) was a 19th - century American politician who served in all three branches of Kentucky 's government and in the U.S. House of Representatives . His political career began in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1807 . In 1810 , he was appointed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , where he served for two years before resigning to pursue a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives . He served two terms in that body , resigning in 1816 . Clark accepted an appointment to the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817 . It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred . In 1822 , he struck down a debt relief law in the case of Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts . His decision was unpopular with the legislature , who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it . An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two - thirds majority . The following year , the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark 's ruling . In retaliation , the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views . This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court - New Court controversy . In 1825 , Clark was chosen to fill the congressional seat vacated by Henry Clay 's elevation to Secretary of State . He served until 1831 , but did not seek re-election that year . He became active in organizing the Whig Party in Kentucky and was rewarded for his efforts by being chosen as the party 's nominee for governor in 1836 . He won the election and laid out an ambitious platform to the legislature , which acted on only part of it . Clark 's most significant accomplishment as governor was securing the creation of a state board of education and the establishment of public schools in every county in the state . Clark died in office in 1839 . His estate , Holly Rood , was listed on the National Register of Historic... - The Kentucky Court of Appeals is the lower of Kentucky's two appellate courts, under the Kentucky Supreme Court. Prior to a 1975 amendment to the Kentucky Constitution the Kentucky Court of Appeals was the only appellate court in Kentucky. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).

In the design world, repetition is the intentional reuse of elements, patterns, or motifs to create structure, unity, and consistency. Whether it be in fashion, architecture, graphic design, or any other form of creative output, applying the concept of repetition can contribute to a more cohesive and aesthetically pleasing result. A system of shapes refers to the deliberate use of geometric shapes and forms to create a particular design or pattern. This can be seen in numerous instances, from logos and brand identities to intricate patterns found within textile and jewelry design. Integrating repetition and a system of shapes can lead to a wide range of benefits in the designing process: 1. Creating visual consistency: When elements are repeated within a design, it allows the viewer's eye to easily recognize and follow the pattern, making it more comprehensible and engaging. 2. Establishing a sense of unity: Repetition helps bring together separate components of a design, allowing them to function as a single coherent entity. This is particularly crucial in instances where various types of media and elements need to be integrated within a single design. 3. Enhancing brand identity: When a company consistently uses specific shapes and motifs, it helps to create a more recognizable identity. This can be seen in the Coca-Cola logo or Apple's distinct apple icon, which have become synonymous with their respective brands. 4. Adding visual interest: Repetition can also add interest and depth to a design when used creatively, especially if it comprises an intricate pattern or a dynamic arrangement of shapes. 5. Communicating hierarchy or emphasis: By repeating specific shapes or elements, a designer can draw attention to certain aspects of a design or create a sense of importance within the composition. 6. Encouraging rhythm and movement: The use of repetition and shapes in a design can also create a sense of rhythm, guiding the viewer's eye throughout the composition, highlighting key features, and creating a sense of flow. Overall, the use of repetition and a system of shapes is an essential concept that can elevate a design by making it more cohesive, balanced, and visually interesting. When applied effectively, this concept can contribute to enhanced communication, memorability, and aesthetic appeal in various design disciplines."},{"instruction":"Michael Ovitz, who had a brief but extremely lucrative career as president of Walt Disney Co. in the mid 1990s, might emerge as the latest embodiment of corporate spending run amok.

With Donald J. Trump as their presumptive presidential nominee, however, the issue is fraught with risk for Republicans. Any attempt to repeal the regulation could exacerbate an already palpable split between Mr. Trump’s blue-collar supporters and the party’s establishment donors and politicians. Paul Porter, a truck driver from Ava, Mo., who is a member of the Teamsters union and a supporter of Mr. Trump, said he already received time and a half after eight hours of work, but strongly favored the new overtime regulation. “I have friends who are managers who get taken advantage of terribly,” he said. The administration, for its part, expressed confidence it was holding the better political hand. “I welcome a debate in Congress about wages in this country,” Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor, said. “It crystallizes the difference between this president and the leadership in Congress.” Federal employment law provides two ways for most salaried workers to become eligible for overtime. The first is through a so-called duties test that essentially determines whether or not they are bona fide executives, administrators or professionals, which has historically meant spending most of their time exercising some decision-making authority. If not, they are supposed to be eligible for overtime pay. That method is open to interpretation. The second is more of a hard-and-fast standard, setting a salary level to determine eligibility for overtime, regardless of duties. So even for employees who are legitimately managers, if their salary is below the cutoff, they must be paid overtime. Certain categories of workers, like teachers, doctors and outside sales representatives, continue to be exempt from the regulation, though academics primarily engaged in research are not. The overtime rule dates back to the passage of the 1938 law that established a federal minimum wage. The cutoff has been raised several times over the years. In 2004, the Bush administration also made it easier to exempt workers above the cutoff under the duties test. Proponents like Mr. Eisenbrey urged the administration to raise the cutoff to about 51,000, which, in inflation-adjusted dollars, is roughly where it stood in 1975, when the Ford administration undertook the last major expansion of overtime eligibility. In addition to increasing the basic ceiling, which will be set to match the pay of full-time salaried workers earning at the 40th percentile of salaries in the country’s lowest-income region, currently the South, the new regulation will be updated every three years to keep pace with changes in pay. The Labor Department calculates that 4.2 million workers will become newly eligible for overtime. Other estimates put the number of newly eligible workers substantially higher. In addition, according to the department, nearly nine million more workers who should already be eligible for overtime under the current duties test will be protected against being denied overtime illegally. The most heated debate concerns the fate of those workers who are relatively far from the new cutoff. Critics argue that employers will simply lower the base wage for a majority of affected workers who work overtime, so that their overall pay, including overtime pay, will remain the same. A projection by the consulting firm Oxford Economics, prepared for the National Retail Federation, predicted that a “disproportionate number of workers” who became eligible for overtime and worked more than 40 hours would “see their hourly rates decreased by an equal amount, leaving their total annual earnings unchanged.” By contrast, Daniel Hamermesh, a labor economist at the Institute for the Study of Labor, predicted that base wages would fall somewhat over time, but that the higher overtime payments would more than offset any loss in regular salary levels. The regulation, which President Obama directed the Labor Department to work on in 2014 and which the department first proposed last July, provoked a deluge of comments from the public — nearly 300,000 in all. Many opponents argued that the new salary level would unfairly affect lower-wage regions of the country. The department decreased its proposed cutoff of 50,440 in response. It also changed its proposed annual indexing to once every three years, and decided against revisiting the 2004 changes to the duties test. Groups representing colleges and universities, local governments, and smaller nonprofits also expressed concerns about the cost of the new regulation. Elward Edd, an official at the Hopi Tribal Housing Authority in Arizona, which has a backlog of more than 500 homes to repair, said the burden of the new regulation would force him to scale back hiring to one construction crew from two. Mr. Edd said he was not certain the new regulation would apply to his tribe, but planned to follow it until obtaining clarity. Labor Department officials said it would not. Many critics argued that the need to closely monitor hours would impinge on workers’ freedom by preventing them from working as long as they like, and could damage an employee’s status and sense of self-worth. But at least some of the likely beneficiaries of the new overtime rule took issue with the prediction of looming morale problems. “That is so out of touch,” said Erin Clark, a postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis University who spends about 60 hours a week doing research on neurons and makes 46,344 after having earned a Ph.D. from Harvard. When the regulation goes into effect, Dr. Clark added, “it will at least feel like you’re out there in the job market with everyone else, on some sort of playing field, as opposed to this weird vestigial training position.” Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.

The Obama administration introduced a new rule that raises the salary threshold under which workers qualify for overtime pay from 23,660 to 47,476 annually. This move is expected to benefit around 4.2 million workers who were previously not eligible for overtime. Opponents of the measure argue that it could cost billions of dollars and negatively impact the morale of salaried employees by requiring them to account for every hour of their workdays.

They’ve proved far less generous to the gig economy grunts who pack boxes in fulfillment centers, drive people from A to B or deliver food—typically working them hard for minimum wages and few or no benefits. In recent months that strategy has started to reach its limits. Companies from Handy to Instacart have battled lawsuits alleging contractors should be considered employees and receive more compensation. Tesla and Amazon workers have reportedly passed out from exhaustion. Uber drivers have been sleeping in their cars. Chieh Huang has chosen to do things differently. Huang is chief executive officer of Boxed, a New York e-commerce company with ambitions of becoming the next Costco Wholesale Corp. Boxed sells a narrow assortment of staples–toilet paper, pet food, toothpaste–and relies on several hundred full-time employees toiling in four fulfillment centers to sort, pack and ship the products to customers around the U.S. Huang treats those workers exactly the same as his engineers. Not only do all full-time Boxed employees get shares in the company—a rarity in the startup world—and unlimited parental leave, Huang also pays for weddings and college tuition for workers' children, unique policies that cost tens of thousands of dollars per beneficiary. By comparison, a ping pong table costs a few hundred bucks. In Huang’s words, the \\"people who move atoms\\" are just as important as those who \\"move bits and bytes.\\" Huang, 35, is an easygoing and approachable boss, as comfortable presenting quarterly results to the board as he is joking around with workers packing boxes. The son of Chinese immigrants who worked menial jobs for lousy money, he always vowed to treat employees well if he started a business. That said, Huang knows he’s bucking conventional wisdom. When he laid out his benefits plan to investors, he says, some “were like: ‘what the hell are you doing?'” Spending money on perks and an outsize focus on warehouse workers' well-being could delay Boxed's path to profitability and prove a hard sell on Wall Street once the company files to go public. Chieh Huang Photographer: Misha Friedman/Bloomberg Huang’s benevolence shouldn’t be mistaken solely for altruism, however. Turnover among warehouse workers tends to be high—according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, about a fifth of people working in the warehousing, transportation and utilities industries quit their jobs last year. That’s the highest turnover rate in a decade and probably will become more acute as the U.S. approaches full employment. Once you take into account recruiting and training, it can cost as much as 28,000 to replace one of these workers, says Bowling Green State University professor Hokey Min. Besides offering generous benefits, Huang has also set out to create a worker-friendly culture. Dressed down in a nondescript T-shirt and jeans, he visits the fulfillment centers to say hello, ask for comments and thank workers for doing the work. During a recent visit to a facility in Union, New Jersey, Huang exchanged a bro hug with one worker, cleaned up some trash and lugged a pallet to a recycling location. One day Barbara Ward, recently promoted to box packer and still getting used to her new job, had room left in a package and asked the guy stuffing boxes at the next station for advice. Only later did she realize it was Huang. \\"You could be working next to him forever,” says Ward, 56, “and you would have no idea who he is.\\" Persuading workers to stick around tends to make them more engaged and productive. And while difficult to quantify, there's a strong correlation between a positive company culture and the bottom line. \\"I've seen businesses crumble because of bad culture,\\" says Hadley Harris, a partner at Eniac Ventures, which has participated in Boxed funding rounds. \\"Finding new people is hard and having turnover in your employees is one of the worst drags on a business.\\" Huang designed the benefits to help the workers he deemed most in need. Boxed warehouse employees tend to hail from less privileged backgrounds and be in their 30s, 40s and 50s–ages when people typically start thinking about settling down and starting a family. Hence the offer to pay for weddings and tuition. So far the retention strategy seems to be working. Only 25 employees have quit since Boxed’s founding in 2013, 15 from the fulfillment centers. Veronica Mena, 33, started last year, plans to go back to school part-time and wants to manage a facility. A mother of three, she intends to take advantage of the tuition perk once her kids are old enough. Huang says he’s able to afford such generous employee packages because Boxed operations are so efficient. Company software figures out how to pack products into the minimal number of boxes—ideally one—which cuts down on shipping costs. Because the company sells in bulk, the average consumer orders more than 100 worth of stuff at a time, much larger than a typical e-tailer selling similar items. Boxed is growing quickly; revenue doubled last year to more than 100 million and is expected to do the same in 2017. But to keep pace with growing demand, the company is starting to automate its fulfillment centers—a move almost guaranteed to spook Boxed's army of pickers, packers and shippers. So far, Huang has managed to automate significant parts of the Union facility, without firing anyone; displaced workers were retrained to use the new technology or given a new job in customer service, say. All the same, Huang was forced to hold multiple meetings to make clear there would be no layoffs. While Boxed kept its word, Mena says a few people still left preemptively. Meanwhile back at Boxed’s headquarters in lower Manhattan, Huang has had to justify the policies to his higher-skilled staff. They tend to skew younger and probably won’t take advantage of the wedding and tuition subsidies for years. Moreover, Huang has eschewed the office perks found at most tech startups. (There’s no ping pong table.) His answer to employees who feel they don’t benefit: “If you’re in this company, it’s not about you. It’s actually about us, and the best thing that can happen for us in the long-term is for Boxed to be a success.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The article discusses the contrasting approach of Chieh Huang, CEO of New York e-commerce company Boxed, towards his employees compared to other tech entrepreneurs.

Huang's benefits plan is designed to help workers from less privileged backgrounds and retain them as employees for the long term. The impact of a positive company culture on the bottom line is also highlighted, as a stronger company culture leads to more engaged and productive workers, thereby reducing costs associated with employee turnover. Boxed has managed to grow rapidly, doubling its revenue last year to over 100 million, and its efficient operations have allowed it to offer generous employee packages. However, Boxed is facing challenges as it tries to automate its fulfillment centers to keep up with demand, as automation could potentially threaten the job security of the company's employees. Despite this, Boxed has retrained displaced workers and given them new roles in the company, minimizing the impact of automation on the workforce."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Habitat destruction has played a key role in extinctions, especially in relation to tropical forest destruction. Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\" Two continents had different histories. Asia was inhabited by many humans which destroyed most natural habitats through their activities. America was protective towards its environment and therefore thrived. Which continent destroyed habitats by overconsumption? A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided, Asia is the continent that destroyed habitats through their activities, including overconsumption."},{"instruction":"The Texas church where a gunman opened fire during Sunday services, killing 26 and injuring 20, may not reopen. Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby. Also Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs. He refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \\"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \\"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.'' A motive for the carnage remains unclear, but the younger Kelley appears to have targeted the church because it was attended by his wife's family. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two residents as he was leaving the church. Question: How does Michael Kelly feel about the church? Options: A. Neutral B.

Porky and a rival neighbor both plan to win the agricultural farm prize, Porky with his garden and the neighbor with his chickens. Porky carefully plans a box of seeds, one by one while the man is busy mixing a bunch of bottles of items together. Porky goes to retrieve something as the man feeds the brand new mixture into the feeding bin for his chickens. But when they try it out, they spit the food out in disgust and seek food elsewhere.

If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation. Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body. It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients. First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday. Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood. Blood has a very short shelf life.

We will address each of the given options in detail: (A) Water conservation: Wetlands play a vital role in water conservation as they act as natural sponges by absorbing, storing, and slowly releasing surface water, rain, snowmelt, and floodwaters. This helps to regulate the water cycle and maintain water quality by filtering out pollutants, sediment, and nutrients. (B) Global ecosystems: Wetlands support a large number of plant and animal species, many of which are rare or endangered. They are considered biological hotspots, contributing to global biodiversity. They also play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, which helps to mitigate climate change. (C) Desert ecosystems: Although wetlands are inherently different from desert ecosystems, they can still provide essential functions within arid environments. For instance, desert wetlands, such as oases, can support the survival of plant and animal species that cannot survive in the surrounding arid land. (D) Terrestrial ecosystems: Wetlands are a unique and essential part of terrestrial ecosystems. They play a vital role in maintaining soil quality, preventing erosion, and providing habitats for a variety of plant and animal species. (E) Important habitats: Wetlands serve as critical habitats for numerous varieties of fish, birds, mammals, and invertebrates. They often provide breeding, nesting, and feeding grounds for a diverse range of species, including migratory birds. (F) The environment: Apart from playing a crucial role in water conservation, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, wetlands also help to reduce the impacts of natural disasters such as floods and storms. They act as buffers, absorbing wave energy during storms, thereby preventing erosion and reducing the severity of floods. (G) Food and shelter: Wetlands support economically important activities, such as fishing and agriculture. The plants and animals that live in wetlands often provide essential food and resources for human consumption. Wetlands also serve as important recreational spaces, offering opportunities for activities such as bird-watching and ecotourism. (H) Forest ecosystems: While wetlands are not typically classified as forest ecosystems, many forests contain wetland areas within their boundaries. These wetlands help to regulate the flow of water and nutrients within these ecosystems, contributing to the overall health and stability of the forest. In summary, wetlands are extremely important for water conservation, the global environment, economically and ecologically valuable habitats both within terrestrial and forest ecosystems, while also providing food, shelter, and recreational opportunities for humans and wildlife."},{"instruction":"In the English language, the capitalized form of God continues to represent a distinction between monotheistic \\"God\\" and \\"gods\\" in polytheism.

Moving on to the body of their review, they are highly critical of the content of the video, saying \\"This is by far the worst video the WWF has ever produced.\\" They've compared the product negatively to other videos produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), implying they have a basis for their judgment and they see this one as the absolute worst. They further mention that the video has nothing to do with wrestling. Given that the WWF is a wrestling federation, this would suggest that the product did not meet the customer's expectations in terms of the content. They validate their statement by saying that watching the video is like having their teeth pulled, which is a common expression that suggests an experience was extremely unpleasant or painful. The customer's dissatisfaction extends to the point of recommending the video only as a sleep aid for insomniacs, a sardonic remark suggesting that the video is boring and uninteresting, unable to hold an audience's attention. This in itself indicates that not only did the product fail on a content level according to this customer, but also on something as fundamental as being engaging to its viewers. Thus, taking into account all these factors, it's evident that the customer was highly dissatisfied with the video produced by the WWF. Their review is filled with strong negative language, criticism of the product’s content, and sarcastic remarks about its entertainment value, all of which conclusively suggest dissatisfaction."},{"instruction":"Please add spaces between words: Startpage»Staminatraining»NordicWalking","output":"Sure, here you go: Start page » Stamina training » Nordic Walking"},{"instruction":"Who's missing?

He ended up in the solar system in search of water. He identified three planets, planet A, planet B and planet C. Little did he know that less than a hundred years ago people used to call planet A as Earth, planet B as Venus, and planet C as Mercury. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which planet would have lower pressure on the surface, planet A or planet B? Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, planet A, which used to be called Earth, would have lower pressure on its surface compared to planet B, which used to be known as Venus. The explanation for this lies in the composition and thickness of each planet's atmosphere. Planet A (Earth) has a relatively thinner atmosphere with clouds mainly composed of water vapor. The atmospheric pressure at Earth's surface is largely influenced by the weight of the air column above it. Earth's atmosphere consists of various gases, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases, as well as water vapor. On the other hand, planet B (Venus) has an incredibly thick atmosphere, consisting of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and significant amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid. Due to the density and composition of its atmosphere, the pressure on the surface of Venus is 90 times greater than that on the surface of Earth. This heightened pressure is a direct result of the crushing weight of Venus's atmosphere. The thick atmosphere of Venus also causes a strong greenhouse effect, contributing to its extremely high surface temperatures of 465°C (860°F), which is even hotter than planet C (Mercury), despite being farther from the Sun. In summary, planet A (Earth) would have lower pressure on its surface compared to planet B (Venus) due to the significant differences in their atmospheric compositions and densities."},{"instruction":"Facts: - issue: james russell edward russell diana russell russell margaret russell john russell francis russell william - title: duke of bedford - other titles: 1st baron russell 3rd baron russell of thornhaugh 1st baron howland marquess of tavistock 5th earl of bedford 5th - caption: '' william russell , 1st duke of bedford '' - successor: wriothesley russell , 2nd duke - death date: 7 september 1700 -lrb- aged 85 -rrb- - parents: francis russell , 4th earl of bedford catharine brydges - spouse: anne carr , countess of bedford - tenure: 11 may 1694 -- 7 september 1700 - birth date: august 1616 - name: the duke of bedford - image size: 180px - image: william russell , 1st duke of bedford.jpeg Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of william russell , 1st duke of bedford .

Kvitøya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvitøya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the Bratvaag took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the \\"inaccessible island\\".Two of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andrée's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words \\"Andrée's Polar Expedition, 1896\\". Presented with this hook, the Bratvaag's captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andrée's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.The Bratvaag left the island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations, with the intent of coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on 5 September in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had. After photographing the area, they searched for and found Frænkel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his logbook, and maps.

One of the key aspects of your alien characters should be how they look. To make your aliens seem convincing and interesting, you should try to be as detailed about their physical characteristics as you can. Because you are writing fiction, you have the ability to create as many strange and interesting details about your alien characters as you like. Avoid using familiar images or descriptions of aliens and use your imagination. Think about how the aliens walk and move their bodies. You should also think about how their bodies are proportioned. They do not necessarily need to walk on two legs and have limbs like humans. They may have physical characteristics that have evolved due to their world or environment. For example, maybe your aliens have antennas on their heads because they can feel shifts in the wind in their world, allowing them to hunt for food more effectively. You should also think about whether there are different genders in the alien world and how the bodies of different genders appear. You do not have to be limited by male or female genders. Maybe the alien race has a third gender that is asexual or a combination of male and female genders. Avoid creating the alien characters in the shadow of humans and get creative with language, thinking beyond English or other languages found on Earth. You may decide to create an alien language that may then be translated with the help of a computerized device or an implant in the human brain. Your alien race may also communicate in other ways besides language or words. Maybe they use their antennas to send messages to each other or have the ability to communicate through telepathy. Perhaps they use a system of body movements to communicate. The humans in your story may also be key characters in the narrative, so you should create humans that are just as interesting as the aliens. Your main character may be a human with a special ability or a unique characteristic. Creating nuanced humans in your story will make it that much stronger. For example, maybe your main character is a human who has been gifted with the ability to read minds. This human is then able to access the conversations of the alien overlords, who have enslaved the human race. This ability could allow the human to save the humans from the aliens and become the hero of the story. Once you have sketched out your characters, you should identify the central conflict. Doing this will give the story an end goal and frame the narrative for the reader. It will also allow you to use your characters to build tension in the story. The central conflict may be between your alien characters or between an alien character and a human character. For example, maybe the central conflict of your story is that aliens have taken over the human world because their planet is no longer habitable. This alien invasion may then result in a human hero who tries to fight the aliens with a special ability and help from other humans in his community. Or, maybe the central conflict is that humans have enslaved aliens who have crash landed on their planet. The humans may then try to hide the aliens and experiment on them. This may then result in one alien who tries to oppose his human captors.","output":"In creating convincing and interesting alien characters, focus on their unique physical characteristics, communication methods, and the central conflict with humans, while infusing creativity and stepping beyond familiar tropes."},{"instruction":"You are given a new situation: Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B. and a hint : When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Please answer this question : In which reactants the particles would move slower, reactant A or reactant B? Answer:","output":"In this situation, Rob is working with two different reactants – reactant A, which is warmed, and reactant B, which is cooled. The hint provided states that at higher temperatures, the particles of reactants have more energy, causing them to move faster. This increased energy leads to more collisions among particles and reactions with greater force. The example of food spoilage further illustrates this concept, as chemical reactions responsible for spoilage occur more quickly at higher temperatures, which is why we store food in cooler environments to slow down the rate of spoilage. Based on the information provided, in reactant A, the particles would be moving faster due to the warmer temperature. Conversely, in reactant B, where the reactants are cooler, the particles would have less energy and, as a result, move slower. Therefore, the particles in reactant B would move slower compared to those in reactant A. This slower movement would lead to a slower rate of reaction in reactant B, as there would be fewer collisions among particles and less force upon collision. This knowledge could help Rob devise a technique to control chemical reactions by manipulating the temperature of the reactants involved."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

The soldiers bid goodbye to their families and loved ones, as they know they must embark on a secret mission with many unknowns. Their plane touches down in the Kingdom of Swaziland, a small landlocked nation in Southern Africa. The purpose of their mission remains unclear, but each soldier is promised a hefty paycheck and a new identity when they complete their task. Their training camp is set in a remote desert location, and the soldiers begin a grueling physical and mental training regimen under the ruthless command of Colonel Blackwood, a highly decorated military veteran with years of experience training the best of the best.

Whispers circulate about the company's involvement in illegal and unethical businesses, and the reason behind their involvement in Swaziland remains a mystery.

After the success of his production of Death of a Salesman, Caden unexpectedly receives a MacArthur Fellowship, which gives him the financial means to pursue his artistic interests. He is determined to use it to create an artistic piece of brutal realism and honesty, something into which he can pour his whole self. Gathering an ensemble cast into an enormous warehouse in Manhattan's Theater District, he directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing them to live out their constructed lives. As the mockup inside the warehouse grows increasingly mimetic of the city outside, Caden continues to look for solutions to his personal crises. He is traumatized as he discovers Adele has become a celebrated painter in Berlin and Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend Maria. After a disastrous fling with Hazel (the woman who works in the box office), he marries Claire, an actress in his cast, and has a daughter with her. Their relationship ultimately fails, and he continues his awkward relationship with Hazel, who is by now married with children and working as his assistant. Meanwhile, an unknown condition is systematically shutting down his autonomic functions one by one. As the years rapidly pass, the continually expanding warehouse is isolated from the deterioration of the city outside. Caden buries himself ever deeper into his magnum opus, blurring the line between reality and the world of the play by populating the cast and crew with doppelgÃ¤ngers. For instance, Sammy Barnathan is cast in the role of Caden in the play after Sammy reveals that he has been obsessively following Caden for 20 years, while Sammy's lookalike is cast as Sammy.

Recovering his courage, Striker attempts to regain the love of his life from the war, Elaine (Julie Hagerty), now a stewardess. In order to win her love, Striker overcomes his fear and buys a ticket on a flight she is serving on, from Los Angeles to Chicago. However, during the flight, Elaine rebuffs his attempts.After dinner is served, many of the passengers fall ill, and Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) quickly realizes that one of the meal options gave the passengers food poisoning. The stewards discover that the pilot crew, including Captain Oveur (Peter Graves) and Roger Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), have all come down with food poisoning, leaving no one aboard to fly the plane. Elaine is instructed by the Chicago control tower supervisor Steve McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) to activate the plane's autopilot a large blow-up doll named \\"Otto\\" which will get them to Chicago but will not be able to land the plane. Elaine realizes that Striker is their only chance, and he is convinced to fly the plane, though he still feels his trauma will prevent him from safely landing the plane.McCroskey, after hearing Striker's name on the radio, sends for Striker's former commander, Rex Kramer (Robert Stack) to help talk him down. As the plane nears Chicago, Striker neglects to check the oil temperature which damages one of the engines while a bad thunderstorm reduces visibility, making the landing even more difficult. Thanks to Kramer's endless stream of advice, Striker is able to overcome his fears and safely land the plane with only minor injuries to some passengers.

The first two-time Medal of Honor recipient was Thomas Custer (brother of George Armstrong Custer) for two separate actions that took place several days apart during the American Civil War. Is it true that can you get more than one medal of honor?","output":"Yes, it is true that some individuals have been awarded the Medal of Honor more than once. The Medal of Honor is the highest award bestowed by the United States military to recognize valor, bravery, and self-sacrifice in combat situations. While this is a rare occurrence, 19 men in history have been the recipients of the Medal of Honor twice for their exceptional actions and courage under fire. These double recipients primarily come from the American Civil War and the Indian Wars. Though not a typical occurrence, the awarding of multiple Medals of Honor reflects the distinction of these individuals in their dedication, heroism, and service during critical times in American history. To further understand, let's delve into a few examples: 1. Thomas W. Custer: Thomas Ward Custer, the younger brother of the famous George Armstrong Custer, was the first person to receive two Medals of Honor. Both awards were granted for his actions during the American Civil War. The first was for his gallant conduct at the Battle of Namozine Church on April 3, 1865, and the second for capturing a Confederate flag at the Battle of Sailor's Creek just three days later on April 6, 1865. Tragically, Thomas Custer perished during the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876, alongside his brother George. 2. Frank Baldwin: Frank Dwight Baldwin is another example of a double Medal of Honor recipient. He served in the United States Army during the American Civil War and the Indian Wars. Baldwin's first Medal of Honor was awarded for his actions during the Battle of Peachtree Creek on July 20, 1864, where he captured two Confederate officers. His second Medal of Honor was earned on November 8, 1874, during a battle in McClellan's Creek, Texas, when he defended a supply train from Native American attacks. 3. John J. Kelly: John Joseph Kelly holds the distinction of being the last living double Medal of Honor recipient before his passing in 1957. He received both Medals of Honor for his actions during the same battle in World War I. Serving as a U.S. Marine during the Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge in October 1918, he captured an enemy machine-gun position and later rescued a wounded soldier while under heavy fire. These examples provide evidence that it is indeed possible to be awarded the Medal of Honor more than once. However, this distinction is reserved for extraordinary deeds demonstrating the utmost bravery, selflessness, and gallantry in the most dire of circumstances. These individuals, their actions, and their legacies continue to serve as a powerful testament to the selflessness and courage exhibited by members of the United States military."},{"instruction":"Review: I sincerely hope that at least the first season of Cosby is released on DVD someday.

It may be done in a brewery by a commercial brewer, at home by a homebrewer, or by a variety of traditional methods such as communally by the indigenous peoples in Brazil when making cauim. Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that emerging civilizations including ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia brewed beer. Since the nineteenth century the brewing industry has been part of most western economies. - Russian River Brewing Company is a brewery and brewpub in downtown Santa Rosa , California . The company makes strong India pale ales and sour beers . - An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called \\"alcohol\\"), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism. - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - A brewery or brewing company is a business that makes and sells beer. The place at which beer is commercially made is either called a brewery or a beerhouse, where distinct sets of brewing equipment are called plant. The commercial brewing of beer has taken place since at least 2500 BC; in ancient Mesopotamia, brewers derived social sanction and divine protection from the goddess Ninkasi. Brewing was initially a cottage industry, with production taking place at home; by the ninth century monasteries and farms would produce beer on a larger scale, selling the excess; and by the eleventh and twelfth centuries larger, dedicated breweries with eight to ten workers were being built. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

Or are the sellers hoaxing? Question 2: Does cannabis oil made from indica plant really cure cancer? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these questions, I will carry out a comprehensive research on the subject matter. I'll start by clarifying what cannabis oil is, then I'll analyze the studies conducted on the potential of cannabis oil in curing cancer. Step 1: Defining Cannabis Oil - Cannabis oil is a substance extracted from the cannabis plant by steam distillation. It is a type of cannabinoid, and it's thought to have a wide variety of health benefits. Step 2: Understanding Cancer - Cancer is not a single disease but a collection of related diseases. It is a complex and potentially fatal disease that is primarily caused through environmental factors that mutate genes encoding important cell-regulatory proteins. Step 3: Using Cannabis Oil for Cancer Treatment - As an AI, I don't have opinions, but I can provide information from research. Currently, there is no concrete scientific evidence to suggest that cannabis oil or any other form of cannabis can cure cancer. Some studies have suggested that certain cannabinoids may slow growth and reduce spread of some forms of cancer, but these studies are preliminary. Now, to the question about indica plant-derived cannabis oil: Step 4: Understanding Cannabis Indica - Cannabis Indica is a subspecies of Cannabis sativa, and it's thought to have originated from the Hindu Kush region near Afghanistan. Like all types of cannabis, it contains multiple cannabinoids. Step 5: Indica Cannabis Oil and Cancer - The existing research on cannabis and cancer does not differentiate between Indica, Sativa, or hybrid strains. Therefore, claims that Indica cannabis oil specifically can cure cancer are not currently supported by scientific evidence. Conclusion: In answering the question, \\"Would the answer to these two questions be the same?\\" - Yes, the answer is the same for both. According to the current medical and scientific consensus, while cannabis and its derivatives may show promise in helping to manage symptoms and side effects of cancer and cancer treatment, there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that it can cure cancer. It's important for anyone considering such treatments to discuss them with their healthcare provider to make an informed decision."},{"instruction":"The cost of purchasing two commodities is 827.

Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"Let's denote the cost of the first commodity as \\"x\\" and the cost of the second commodity as \\"y.\\" According to the problem statement, we know two facts: 1. The total cost of purchasing both commodities is 827. x + y = 827 2. The cost of the first commodity exceeds the other by 127. x = y + 127 Now we can solve the system of equations to find the value of x and y. Method: Substitution Since x = y + 127 from the second equation, we can substitute x with (y + 127) in the first equation, so we'll have: (y + 127) + y = 827 Combine the terms on the left side: 2y + 127 = 827 Now, we will isolate variable y by subtracting 127 from both sides: 2y = 700 Finally, we'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for y: y = 350 The cost of the second commodity is 350. Now we'll find the cost of the first commodity using the second equation: x = y + 127 x = 350 + 127 x = 477 So, the purchase price of the first commodity is 477."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice question: Same meaning?

Here are possible answers to this question: - bowling alley - city - military base - fashion show - football game I believe the correct choice is \\"bowling alley\\", here's why: A:","output":"Bowling Alley You are correct, the term \\"gutters\\" in the context of preventing a ball from becoming runway refers to a bowling alley. Gutters are the two long channels or depressions on either side of the lane in a bowling alley, extending from the front down to where the pins are set. When a ball is bowled, the gutters are meant to catch and return it to the ball return mechanism if it veers off course. Here's a brief explanation of why the other options are not the correct choice in this context: - City: Gutters in a city generally refer to the stormwater drainage systems on the sides of streets. These gutters do not prevent a ball from becoming runway but instead help channel away rainwater and melted snow. - Military Base: Gutters have no significant association with preventing balls from becoming runway on a military base. A military base has different types of infrastructure for various purposes, such as housing, transportation, and storage, but bowling is typically not a significant part of this infrastructure. - Fashion Show: In the context of a fashion show, a runway refers to the stage or walkway upon which models display clothing and accessories. Gutters have no relevance in a fashion show scenario, as these events do not involve any physical activity or sports equipment. - Football Game: In a football game, the term \\"runway\\" could refer to the distance a player runs when carrying the ball. However, gutters are not part of a football field and do not play any role in preventing a ball from becoming runway in football. In summary, a bowling alley is the correct choice because gutters are integral components of the bowling lane system and serve to catch and return a ball that veers off course, thereby preventing it from becoming runway."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: The Chechens will gradually bleed the Russian garrison--one car bomb, one mine, one mortar at a time--until the Russians withdraw in frustration.

However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \\"Bollywood.\\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollyhood--more than 800 films a year. The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery, and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \\"masala\\" film. (\\"Masala\\" is an Indian word for a mixture of spices.) Another big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script even finished. The director and writers can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script by hand instead of taking time to type it. Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million U.S. dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million U.S. dollars for a Hollywood film--thirty times as much! Question: What is the main topic of the reading? Yes or no, is the answer \\"the differences between two movie industries\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the main topic of the reading is \\"the differences between two movie industries.\\" The article discusses various aspects of the Bollywood and Hollywood film industries, including the number of movies produced, the length and style of films, production methods, and the budget of the movies. By highlighting these differences, the article aims to show that Mumbai is the real movie capital, as opposed to the popular belief that it is Hollywood."},{"instruction":"Ano, vyřešil.

First, we'll need to get those b's together. To do this, we add those numbers next to the b's (called coefficients) together. So, let's add -45214 and 44913: -45214 + 44913 _______ -301 Now we have the equation: -4515 = -301*b Next, we need to find out what magical number (b) do we multiply -301 with to get -4515. To do this, we'll divide -4515 by -301: -4515 ÷ -301 = 15 So, the magical number (b) we were looking for is 15. That means, if we replace 'b' with 15 in the equation, it will be a true statement!

With an estimated 1.5 million global participants and 100,000 new learners joining every year, kiteboarding is in the process of becoming an integral part of the Olympic competition. The sport offers various categories to cater to all levels of riders, including wave, freestyle, slalom, speed, and course racing. In this article, we will delve into the soaring world of kiteboarding, its categories, and its impact as an Olympic sport. Kiteboarding: A Brief Overview: Kiteboarding, also known as kitesurfing, is an exhilarating water sport that involves the user riding on a modified surfboard or kiteboard while being pulled by a large, controllable kite. The sport cultivates a perfect unison between the wind and water, allowing riders to showcase their skills and execute jaw-dropping aerial maneuvers. Due to its increasing popularity, the sport has also fostered a strong sense of community among its practitioners. Kiteboarding Categories: The diverse world of kiteboarding comprises five distinct categories, providing riders with multiple avenues to sharpen their skills and test their limits: 1. Wave: Wave kiteboarding has the rider using a surfboard or a specialized kiteboard to ride and maneuver on waves. This discipline demands excellent kite control, as well as the ability to read and predict wave patterns. 2. Freestyle: This category is arguably the most popular among kiteboarders. Freestyle kiteboarding showcases the rider's ability to perform impressive aerial tricks and stunts, such as handle passes, rotations, and inverted loops. 3. Slalom: In slalom kiteboarding, riders race through a course consisting of a series of buoys laid out in the water. The objective is to navigate the course as quickly as possible while demonstrating precise kite control and technical prowess. 4. Speed: The speed category highlights the swiftest and most agile riders in the kiteboarding community. Riders engage in time trials, attempting to achieve the fastest speeds possible over a set distance. 5. Course Racing: Course racing embodies a blend of speed and strategy, in which riders must complete a predefined course with multiple laps and buoy turns. Maintaining a balance between speed, kite control, and tactical decision-making is crucial in this category. Kiteboarding as an Olympic Sport: The decision to include kiteboarding in the 2016 Olympic lineup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil signified a milestone moment in the evolution of the sport. As kiteboarding makes its Olympic debut, it brings a fresh, youthful dynamic to the games; simultaneously, it paves the way for further growth and development in the sport. The inclusion of kiteboarding in the Olympics is expected to attract new learners in droves, exponentially expanding its global following every year. Conclusion: Kiteboarding has carved a niche for itself among adrenaline junkies and water sports enthusiasts across the world. As it prepares to take center stage at the 2016 Rio Olympic games, the sport continues to traverse new heights and break boundaries.

New household inventions, in particular, are aimed at addressing specific problems or challenges that people face in their everyday lives. By finding innovative solutions to these issues, inventors can contribute significantly to the betterment of society. A) To earn more money and gain awards: Although financial incentives and recognition can be motivating factors for some individuals, they are generally secondary to the essential desire to develop inventions that can make a positive difference in people's lives. In many cases, the primary satisfaction for inventors lies in the knowledge that their ideas are being used to improve the overall quality of life for many people. B) To be recorded by some special companies: While being recognized by specialized companies or organizations may contribute to an inventor's reputation, this in itself is not the primary motivation for creating new household inventions. The main focus remains on problem-solving and enhancement of living conditions.

Even though it was just pretend and not real, it was a surprising and exciting moment for the people who enjoy watching 'Scandal.' They didn't know what was going to happen, and that's what makes storytelling fun – you never know what's around the corner! So, remember, when you hear that Lena Dunham got \\"whacked\\" on 'Scandal,' it just means that something very surprising happened to her character, and it made the story more exciting for everyone who was watching. And that's the fun of TV shows – you never know what surprises are waiting for you!"},{"instruction":"In 2008 who became the first British female jockey to ride one hundred winners in a calendar year?

Several reasons contribute to this assessment: 1. The reviewer mentions that the screenplay \\"lags badly in the middle,\\" which implies that the pacing and the story's progression are not up to their expectations. This kind of pacing issue often prevents the audience from fully immersing themselves in the film. 2. The movie's genre appears to be a mix of comedy, drama, and action. However, the reviewer critiques these elements by stating that the comedy is \\"not-very-funny,\\" and the dramatics are \\"unconvincing.\\" This indicates that the film's content might not have resonated with the reviewer or that the execution was insufficient to bring out desired reactions. 3. The reference to the \\"last-minute action strongly reminiscent of 'Run Lola Run'\\" suggests that the reviewer found this aspect to lack originality. Drawing a comparison to another well-known film may lead readers to believe that the movie under review did not offer a unique or fresh approach to its action sequences. In conclusion, the reviewer's negative opinion is conveyed through their critique of the film's pacing, the lack of effectiveness in its genre elements, and the absence of originality in certain aspects. Even though the review begins with the word \\"interesting,\\" it is followed by criticisms that primarily suggest disappointment or dissatisfaction."},{"instruction":"Next question: in prokaryotes the lac operon contains gene(s) for?","output":"As an AI, I will now search my knowledge base to provide the correct information. The lac operon is a region of DNA found in prokaryotes, specifically in some bacteria like Escherichia coli, that control the expression of genes responsible for lactose metabolism. These genes are only active when lactose is present in the environment. The lac operon contains three main genes: Step 1: Identify the genes in the lac operon - lacZ - lacY - lacA Step 2: Describe the function of each gene 1. lacZ: This gene codes for the enzyme beta-galactosidase, which is involved in the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose. 2. lacY: This gene codes for the protein lactose permease, which is a membrane protein that facilitates the transport of lactose into the cell. 3. lacA: This gene codes for the enzyme thiogalactoside transacetylase, which is involved in detoxifying certain compounds that can be formed during lactose metabolism. However, its specific role in lactose metabolism is not well understood. In conclusion, the lac operon in prokaryotes contains genes for beta-galactosidase (lacZ), lactose permease (lacY), and thiogalactoside transacetylase (lacA).

Option (i): Mash one ripe banana in a bowl until large chunks are formed. Stir in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of sugar or 2-3 tablespoons (29.6-44.4 ml) of oats. Outcome: This option will result in an exfoliating scrub with a chunky texture due to the large banana chunks combined with the sugar or oats. The large banana chunks may not mix evenly with the other ingredients, potentially causing an inconsistent exfoliating experience. Option (ii): Mash one ripe banana in a bowl until it's almost liquid. Stir in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of sugar or 2-3 tablespoons (29.6-44.4 ml) of oats. Outcome: This option will result in a smoother exfoliating scrub, as the banana is mashed to an almost liquid state. This consistency allows for a better integration of the sugar or oats, providing a more homogenous mixture which is easier to apply to the skin. Considering the outcomes, Option (ii) makes more sense for creating a banana exfoliating scrub.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When I think about raw chicken, the first thing that comes to mind is the potential risk of foodborne illnesses. According to health guidelines, raw or undercooked meats are usually not recommended for consumption due to the presence of bacteria and parasites. One of the most common bacteria found in raw chicken is Salmonella, which can lead to food poisoning. Symptoms of salmonellosis include abdominal cramps, diarrhea, fever, and vomiting, which can range from mild to severe and may sometimes even be fatal, especially in vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Another harmful pathogen often found in raw chicken is Campylobacter, which can lead to campylobacteriosis. This infection has symptoms similar to those of salmonellosis but can also potentially lead to more severe complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome in rare cases. Cross-contamination is also a concern when dealing with raw chicken. It can easily transfer harmful bacteria to other foods, cooking utensils, or surfaces if not handled properly, which increases the risk of spreading foodborne illnesses. To avoid these risks, most health experts advise to cook chicken to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C), which effectively kills any harmful bacteria present. It's also essential to handle and store raw chicken hygienically to minimize the risk of contamination and to wash hands and kitchenware thoroughly after handling. Taking all these factors into account, the answer to the question, \\"Is it safe to eat raw chicken?\\" is \\"no.\\" It is not safe due to the high likelihood of contracting foodborne illnesses from harmful pathogens and the potential for cross-contamination."},{"instruction":"Twenty-one per cent say the last time they were physically active was at school, college and university.

The village is a melting pot of different cultures and backgrounds, but its inhabitants have managed to maintain peace and unity over the years. Among them are Maturette, a fierce and wise elderly woman with a mysterious past, and Dega, a charismatic yet hotheaded young leader, passionate about protecting his people and fighting for their rights. As the conflict in the region intensifies, government soldiers start to close in on the village under suspicion that it is harboring rebels. Maturette, sensing the impending danger, holds a secret meeting with the village council and proposes a risky plan to protect their people. But before they can put the plan in motion, the village is raided by a squad of soldiers led by Captain Alaric, a ruthless and determined man on a mission to capture rebel leaders. Maturette and Dega are taken captive, along with several other villagers. The captives are transported to a heavily guarded military prison far from their home. Realizing the importance of their role as leaders, Maturette and Dega forge a bond and are determined to escape and return to their village to save their people from military oppression. As they languish behind bars, they come to learn the extent of the government's oppressive regime and the atrocities it has committed against innocent civilians. They form a plan to unite fellow prisoners from different backgrounds who have suffered at the hands of the soldiers. The diverse group includes a skilled medic, a talented engineer, a cunning thief, and a former rebel fighter. Under Maturette's guidance and with Dega's bravery, they orchestrate an elaborate escape plan using the skills and strengths of their newly found allies. Meanwhile, Captain Alaric is haunted by the atrocities he has committed and the people he has betrayed, and he begins to question the true nature of his mission. Through a series of tense and thrilling action sequences, the united prisoners manage to overcome deadly obstacles, dodge close calls, and eventually break free from the prison. In their flight, they are pursued relentlessly by Captain Alaric and his troops. Back in their village, Maturette and Dega's absence has weighed heavily on the community. Inspired by their captured leaders, the villagers form a resistance to protect their homes at all costs. As the battle between the villagers and the soldiers grows more intense, Maturette, Dega, and their allies make a valiant return in a breathtaking and emotional final confrontation. In the climax of the story, Captain Alaric, disillusioned by the government's actions, has a change of heart and helps Maturette and Dega secure victory for their village. The film ends with a scene of newfound hope for the future and the promise of peace returning to the region. \\"Prisoners of Liberation\\" is a gripping, high-stakes tale that explores themes of unity, sacrifice, and the power of perseverance in the face of adversity.

This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.

Which scientist read less about aphid honeydew? A:","output":"A: It is not explicitly stated which scientist, Pam or Ellie, read less about aphid honeydew. However, based on the given information, we can make an educated guess. Pam is studying ants that farm aphids, which involves understanding the mutualistic relationship between ants and aphids, including the production and consumption of honeydew. This means Pam is more likely to have read extensively about aphid honeydew and its role in the interactions between ants and aphids. On the other hand, Ellie is studying leafcutter ants. Leafcutter ants are primarily known for their behavior of cutting and collecting leaves to cultivate a fungus in their nests, which serves as their primary food source. While Ellie might have come across information about aphid honeydew during her research on ants in general, her focus on leafcutter ants suggests that she would have read comparatively less about aphid honeydew than Pam. Therefore, based on the given information, it is more likely that Ellie read less about aphid honeydew compared to Pam, who is directly studying ants that farm aphids."},{"instruction":"It would be difficult to overestimate the potential dangers of the Remote Procedure Call ( RPC ) vulnerability .

Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. Mark was studying the effect of Sun's radiations on Earth. To that end, he studied Sun's radiations, which he labeled as rad A. Then he studied Earth's radiations, which he labeled as rad B. He also learned that longer wavelength radiations would produce heat. Which radiation have shorter wavelengths, rad A or rad B? The answer is:","output":"Rad A has shorter wavelengths. To understand why, let's first consider the mechanism behind solar radiation and Earth radiation. Solar radiation, or sunlight, is the energy that Earth receives from the Sun. This energy is primarily in the form of electromagnetic waves, including ultraviolet (UV), visible light, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. When the Sun's radiation reaches Earth, some of it is absorbed by the planet's surface, atmosphere, and oceans, while a portion is reflected back into space. The absorbed radiation warms up the Earth's surface, causing it to emit radiation in the form of heat or longer-wavelength infrared (IR) radiation. This emitted radiation, also known as Earth's radiation (rad B in our scenario), has a longer wavelength compared to the incoming solar radiation (rad A), and we cannot see it with the naked eye. Now, let's focus on the difference between shorter and longer wavelength radiations. Shorter wavelength radiations have higher energy levels compared to longer wavelength radiations, which have lower energy levels. When Mark studied the effects of the Sun's radiations on Earth, he discovered that longer wavelength radiations produce heat. This means that the Earth's radiations (rad B) are responsible for the heat, and they have longer wavelengths compared to the Sun's radiations (rad A). So, among the two types of radiations Mark studied – Sun's radiations (rad A) and Earth's radiations (rad B) – rad A has shorter wavelengths. Ultimately, the shorter wavelength solar radiation from the Sun is vital for providing the energy needed to sustain life on Earth, while the longer wavelength Earth radiation contributes to maintaining our planet's thermal balance."},{"instruction":"All I needed to do was to turn the door knob and the door would open up for me .

The film portrays a naive young woman (Giulietta Masina) bought from her mother by a brutish strongman (Anthony Quinn) who takes her with him on the road. Fellini has called La Strada \\"a complete catalogue of my entire mythological world, a dangerous representation of my identity that was undertaken with no precedent whatsoever.\\" In later years, Fellini explained that from \\"a sentimental point of view,\\" he was \\"most attached\\" to La Strada: \\"Above all, because I feel that it is my most representative film, the one that is the most autobiographical; for both personal and sentimental reasons, because it is the film that I had the greatest trouble in realizing and that gave me the most difficulty when it came time to find a producer.\\" Of all the imaginary beings he had brought to the screen, Fellini felt closest to the three principals of La Strada, \\"especially Zampano.\\" Anthony Quinn found working for Fellini invaluable: \\"He drove me mercilessly, making me do scene after scene over and over again until he got what he wanted. I learned more about film acting in three months with Fellini than I'd learned in all the movies I'd made before then.\\" Long afterwards, in 1990, Quinn sent a note to the director and his co-star: \\"The two of you are the highest point in my life -- Antonio.\\" Critic Roger Ebert, in his book The Great Movies, has described the current critical consensus as holding that La Strada was the high point of Fellini's career and that, after this film, \\"his work ran wild through the jungles of Freudian, Christian, sexual and autobiographical excess\\". (Ebert, himself, disagrees, seeing La Strada as \\"part of a process of discovery that led to the masterpieces La Dolce Vita (1960), 8 1/2 (1963) and Amarcord (1974)\\".) The years since its initial release have solidified the high estimation of La Strada. It holds a 97% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 31 reviewers who, on average, scored it 8.7 on a scale of 10. Its numerous appearances on lists of best films include the 1992 Directors' poll of the British Film Institute (4th best), the New York Times \\"Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\\", and the \\"Greatest Films\\" list of They Shoot Pictures, Don't They (# 67) - a website that statistically calculates the most well-received movies. In 1995, the Catholic Church's Pontifical Commission for Social Communications issued a list of 45 films representing a \\"...cross section of outstanding films, chosen by a committee of twelve international movie scholars.\\" This has come to be known as the Vatican film list, and includes La Strada as one of 15 films in the sub-category labeled Art.

A:","output":"Yes, Barbarea and Conradina do indeed originate from different countries, as they are both distinct genera of plants that are native to different regions. Barbarea, also known as winter cress or yellow rocket, belongs to the Brassicaceae family. It is a genus of flowering plants native to Eurasia and parts of North Africa. There are approximately 30 different species of Barbarea, with some species distributed across Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. Some common varieties of Barbarea found in these regions are Barbarea vulgaris (common winter cress), Barbarea verna (early winter cress or American cress), and Barbarea orthoceras (American winter cress). Conradina, on the other hand, belongs to the Lamiaceae family, and is a genus of flowering plants native to southeastern United States, particularly in regions like Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. Conradina is commonly known as false rosemary or scrub mint due to its resemblance to rosemary and its characteristic minty fragrance. There are currently six recognized species within the Conradina genus, including Conradina canescens (false rosemary), Conradina brevifolia (short-leaved rosemary), and Conradina grandiflora (large-flowered rosemary). In summary, Barbarea and Conradina are two distinct genera of plants originating from different countries. Barbarea is native to regions in Eurasia and parts of North Africa, while Conradina is endemic to the southeastern United States.

In this scenario, the supposed perturbation would be \\"indirectly impacting a step of the process.\\" Here's a more detailed explanation: When bacteria enter the body, they can cause an infection by multiplying rapidly and attacking various cells in the body. The severity of their impact on the body varies depending on the type of bacteria, the strength of the individual's immune system, and other environmental factors. The process you've described outlines the general sequence of events that follow when an infection affects the body: 1. Bacteria enters the body through various means such as ingestion, inhalation, or open wounds. 2. Bloodstream: Bacteria enter the host's bloodstream, which facilitates their travel throughout the body. 3. Cells in the body are attacked: Bacteria produce toxins or directly invade tissue, leading to cell damage. 4. Cells are killed: As infected cells die, the body's immune system attempts to clear dead cells and fight off the remaining invaders. 5. Different kinds of sickness are formed: As damage occurs at the cellular level, symptoms of illness or disease emerge depending on the affected area of the body. If there were fewer bacteria present in the environment, it would mean that individuals would have a lower probability of encountering harmful bacteria. With the reduced likelihood of bacterial infections, there would be fewer cases of cells being attacked and damaged by these bacterial pathogens. Consequently, less sickness and disease related to bacterial infections would develop. In this situation, the perturbation does not directly impact a step of the process since the steps themselves would remain unchanged. Instead, it indirectly impacts the process by influencing the likelihood of certain steps occurring based on the reduced presence of bacteria in the environment. By limiting the number of potential bacterial encounters, the probability of each step in the infection process would be lowered, ultimately leading to a decreased likelihood of cell damage and sickness."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: How many times Irmgard Moller stabbed in the chest If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\".

The name Aston Pigott probably evolved from East Tun or Town and from the name of the Picot family of Norman descent . In 1180 Ralph Fitz Picot was granted lands by the Corbets , and it was Ralph 's descendants , notably Robert Pigot in 1255 followed by Howel Pigot who established the modern village name . Mains water arrived in 1947 and mains electricity in 1948 . - Shropshire (or ; alternatively Salop; abbreviated, in print only, Shrops; demonym Salopian ) is a county located between West Midlands in England and Wales. It borders Powys and Wrexham in Wales to the west and north-west, Cheshire to the north, Staffordshire to the east, Worcestershire to the south-east and Herefordshire to the south. Shropshire Council was created in 2009, a unitary authority taking over from the previous county council and five district councils. The borough of Telford and Wrekin has been a separate unitary authority since 1998 but continues to be included in the ceremonial county. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. - The name Rea Brook can refer to either of two brooks (a local term for a small river) in Shropshire, England. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Worthen is a village in Shropshire, England approximately 13 miles west of Shrewsbury. The village forms part of the Worthen with Shelve civil parish, which includes the hamlet of Little Worthen immediately to the north-east and the villages of Brockton and Pennerley, in addition to several smaller settlements. It sits in the Rea Brook valley. To the south are the Stiperstones and the Bromlow Callow, known for the small clump of trees on top. To the north is Long Mountain. - The Stiperstones is a distinctive hill in the county of Shropshire, England. It is a quartzite ridge formed some 480 million years ago. During the last Ice Age the summit stood out above the glaciers and was subject to constant freezing and thawing which shattered the quartzite into a mass of jumbled scree surrounding several residual rocky tors. At above sea level it is the second-highest hill in the county, surpassed only by Brown Clee Hill. Stiperstones' summit ridge is crowned by several rugged, jagged outcrops of rock silhouetted against the sky. What is the relationship between 'aston pigott' and 'shropshire'?

The Reds, without Barcelona target Philippe Coutinho due to a back injury, fell behind to Stefano Okaka's header. Sadio Mane equalised with a clinical finish only for Abdoulaye Doucoure to restore the lead from close range. Roberto Firmino's penalty made it 2-2 before Mohamed Salah thought he had won it only for Britos to bundle in. In Jurgen Klopp's 100th competitive game as Reds boss, Liverpool wasted a string of chances before Uruguay defender Britos headed over the line from point blank range following a ricochet. Watford keeper Heurelho Gomes, who conceded the penalty after hauling down Salah, denied Alberto Moreno with a fingertip save. Joel Matip also hit the bar and Dejan Lovren forced another good save as the Reds dominated the closing stages until Watford's late leveller. The six-goal thriller came on the back of Friday's opening match of the 2017-18 campaign which produced seven goals as Arsenal beat Leicester 4-3. It was a case of new season but same old Liverpool on the opening Saturday of the campaign. As good as Liverpool were at going forward, their defensive frailties - all too evident last season - came back to haunt them. Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk has been linked with a move to Anfield and Liverpool's performance at Watford will only serve to increase Klopp's urgency to strengthen his defence. Liverpool were behind after failing to defend the first corner of the match, unmarked Italian striker Okaka allowed to power home Jose Holebas' delivery. Media playback is not supported on this device In the space of 161 first-half seconds, the Reds went from outstanding at one end of the pitch to atrocious at the other. They equalised with a sumptuous finish by Mane, the Senegal forward collecting a lovely flick by Emre Can before scoring from an angle. It was Liverpool's first serious attack of the game yet moments later they were trailing again after more awful defending. The Reds' defence made a hash of trying to clear Tom Cleverley's low ball across the box and Doucoure slotted home from five yards - his second goal since joining Watford from Rennes in 2016. A clumsy foul by Gomes on Salah allowed Firmino to make it 2-2 from the spot before the Brazilian turned provider with a delicious lob which enabled Salah, a £34m signing from Roma, to put his side ahead on his league debut. It should have been the winner yet Liverpool's defence failed to deal with another Holebas corner, allowing Britos to score three minutes into added time. Klopp said Watford's dramatic equaliser should not have counted because he believed it to be offside. Britos was stood immediately in front of keeper Simon Mignolet when substitute and new signing Richarlison put the ball across goal. \\"It's obvious because the linesman is on the line. He needs to see it,\\" said Klopp. \\"I cannot change it. We would have had defensive areas we need to work on if we'd won 3-2. We were the better team, we should have won.\\" Watford boss Marco Silva said he had not seen whether his side's equaliser was offside. Silva's side were minutes away from losing a seventh successive Premier League match before Britos had the final say in the former Hull City manager's first league game in charge of the Hornets. Seven of the side that started against Liverpool were part of the team that was crushed 5-0 at home to Manchester City on the final day of last season. Yet the Hornets produced an encouraging performance under their new Portuguese boss which suggests they could finish higher up the table than last season's 17th-placed finish. Midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah was the only one of Silva's six summer signings to start - club record £18.5m buy Andre Gray beginning life on the bench and coming on in the second half. Watford manager Marco Silva said: \\"I think it's a fair result. We had a very good first half, a good intensity like I wanted. \\"I didn't like the first 25 minutes of the second half. We expected a good reaction from Liverpool but we needed to be better. We made mistakes. But we reacted well. \\"Our fans pushed our players on. We had some small injuries.

The university’s failure to promptly investigate and discipline the young man jeopardized the safety of women across campus, violating federal anti-discrimination law, alleges the suit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Instead of triggering an investigation into one student’s disturbing allegations that the man she had once dated strangled and raped her after she began losing consciousness in 2011, an academic adviser suggested she drive to the beach to take care of her mental health, the suit says. A campus counselor disapproved of the shoulder-baring sweater the young woman wore to a counseling session, the complaint adds, asking if she put herself in risky situations to appear “sexually available.” Residence hall staff to whom she later reported her concerns promised to tell the male student that assaulting women was “not okay,” the suit says. The plaintiff, a different student identified in the complaint as “Ms. Doe,” said the man violently assaulted her in 2014 when she refused to engage in oral sex – an allegation that was confirmed by a Stanford investigation later that year, the complaint says. “Women will not have an equal opportunity to succeed academically until the epidemic of sexual violence on campus ends,” said Rebecca Peterson-Fisher, an attorney for Equal Rights Advocates, a San Francisco-based civil rights organization that filed the complaint. “Institutions like Stanford need to be held accountable for their failure to recognize the severity of these crimes and to comply with Title IX” of the Civil Rights Act. Already under close scrutiny — and federal investigation — for its handling of its sexual assault problem, Stanford issued a statement Monday saying that it felt “deep sympathy” for the plaintiff in the case and that it was cooperating with a federal Office for Civil Rights investigation into the matter. “Sexual assault and sexual misconduct is abhorrent and antithetical to the values of our campus — we take these matters very seriously and have zero tolerance for such violence,” the Stanford statement said. Stanford did not acknowledge mishandling the case, which was reported by the Huffington Post and Palo Alto Weekly last January. In its statement, the administration suggested that its hands had been tied because one or more of the victims did not wish to pursue a formal investigation. “Without the cooperation of victims,” the statement said, “regrettably the university is very limited in what it can do.” But the complaint argues that the first victim — who repeatedly raised the incident with various campus employees — initially was discouraged from making a formal complaint after the 2011 incident, and that campus officials failed to connect the dots when other women came forward with complaints about the same man — who was referred to in the suit only as “Mr. X.” In 2012, when the same woman again raised the issue after hearing rumors that the man might have assaulted other female students, the suit says, a professional residence hall staffer promised her in an email that staffers would give him a stern talking-to. In the email, according to the suit, the staffer wrote that officials would convey that the physical and sexual assaults “were not okay and that he has a very serious problem with anger.” In February 2014, the plaintiff said in the complaint, the man — whom she had previously dated — twisted her arm behind her back and told her to go kill herself after she refused to have sexual contact with him. A third woman reported in June 2014 that the man became “violently angry” when she refused to have sex with him, “threw a table at her and punched her in the face while holding a shampoo bottle, splitting her lip.” The woman, a Stanford student, took a leave of absence from school after the incident, according to the suit. The complaint mentions a fourth case involving another female Stanford student but does not provide details. In July 2014, Stanford found the student responsible for “serious sexual misconduct” and banned him from campus, the suit says — but by then, he had already graduated. The complaint says that Stanford failed to enforce the ban and the no-contact orders and that the man continued to contact the plaintiff — and even returned to campus. The plaintiff, now a graduate student at Stanford, said she spotted the man dining with another young woman at an on-campus restaurant in February. “Alarmed and traumatized, Ms. Doe sought assistance from Stanford public safety officers,” the complaint says. “The officers told her that there was no official record of the ban and they could neither arrest Mr. X nor remove him from campus.” Stanford law Professor Michele Dauber, an advocate for sexual assault victims, said cases like this one show how important it is for campuses to conduct timely investigations and remove perpetrators from campus before they can harm others. “We have to send a clear and unambiguous message to perpetrators,” Dauber said, “that this kind of conduct is serious and it’s not tolerated.” ||||| Suit claims male student violently assaulted several women, but the university discouraged them from filing complaints and questioned one woman’s clothes Stanford University ignored complaints about sexual assault, dismissed victims with disturbing allegations and failed to discipline a “known predator”, according to a federal lawsuit, allowing the student to violently attack multiple women. The complaint alleges that an unnamed male student strangled one victim and told her “no one will notice when you die” before raping her and that he repeatedly told another woman to “kill herself” after sexually assaulting her. Despite having knowledge of the man’s attacks against multiple students – which occurred between 2010 and 2014 – Stanford officials did little to punish the perpetrator and protect other women, the lawsuit claimed. On the contrary, university officials allegedly discouraged victims from filing complaints, in one case questioning whether a victim’s clothing put her at risk for assault. The shocking accusations paint a picture of a system that endangers students and come at a time of increased scrutiny of the sexual violence, harassment and discrimination that survivors’ advocates say are rampant on US college campuses. Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin declined to comment on the specifics of the case, citing privacy laws, but issued a lengthy statement defending the university’s record. “We have sympathy for the plaintiff in this case, but we will be vigorously defending the lawsuit as we believe that Stanford has acted with appropriate diligence and compassion,” she wrote, adding: “Stanford’s top priority is always the well-being and safety of all of our students.” After Brock Turner: did the Stanford sexual assault case change anything? Read more The suit, filed this week by advocacy group Equal Rights Advocates, raises serious concerns about support for victims who speak up at Stanford, which received international attention this year surrounding the assault case of former university swimmer Brock Turner. The complaint was filed on behalf of a current Stanford graduate student who began attending the prestigious university as an undergraduate in 2011 and is listed as Jane Doe in the court filings. The perpetrator, known as Mr X in the lawsuit, repeatedly attacked a different female student, named as Ms A, in 2010 and 2011, according to the complaint. He physically assaulted her by “knocking her down, dragging her, and kicking her” and in one attack “began strangling her nearly to the point of unconsciousness, preventing her from screaming, breathing, or moving”, the suit said. According to the complaint, after Mr X raped Ms A and “whispered into her ear” that no one would notice her death, she went to a counselor who was dismissive of the situation. The counselor pointed out that the woman was “wearing a sweater that exposed part of one shoulder and asked her to consider whether she placed herself in potentially risky situations because she wanted to appear sexually available”, the lawyers wrote. After disclosing the abuse to others at Stanford, one official “described the difficulty of proceeding with criminal or administrative action” while an academic adviser suggested she try and improve her mental health by “renting a car and going to a beach”, according to the suit. Later, after a dean gave the woman the impression that pursuing a case would be difficult and provide minimal protections, the complaint said, she agreed to a “no-contact directive”, which Mr X later violated. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stanford saw protests during its summer graduation ceremony over the case of former university swimmer Brock Turner, who attacked an unconscious woman. Photograph: Gabrielle Lurie/AFP/Getty Images The suit alleges that Stanford’s failure to investigate and address Ms A’s complaints paved the way for Mr X to physically and sexually assault Jane Doe, who began casually dating him in 2013. One time when Doe refused to have sex with Mr X, he forced himself upon her, called her a slut, told her to “kill herself” and pinned her arm behind her back, which injured her, the suit said. Administrators eventually told her they viewed her story as a “‘he said, she said’ situation” and that “Mr X’s actions toward her did not qualify as prohibited sexual behavior”. Soon after, a third student formally reported that Mr X had thrown a table at her and punched her after she refused to have sex with him, the suit said. Stanford officials allegedly told that woman that the university wanted to resolve the complaints quickly “because Mr X might lose his job if he did not promptly receive his degrees”. After the university determined Mr X had engaged in a “pattern of violent behavior when women refused his demands for sexual acts”, officials issued no-contact directives and banned him from campus for 10 years. Still, Mr X graduated and was awarded two bachelor’s degrees while Doe was placed on academic probation after struggling to keep up with school work due to the stress and trauma of the assault and aftermath, according to the suit. “The allegations in this case are really disturbing and show the importance of promptly and thoroughly investigating,” said Michele Landis Dauber, a Stanford law professor who has been outspoken about the university’s handling of sexual assault. “The key here is that we have to hold perpetrators accountable, and if we don’t, we’re really endangering campus safety.” The accusations were originally reported in a Huffington Post story earlier this year. The statement from Stanford spokeswoman’s appeared to raise questions about the victims’ participation, saying: “Without the cooperation of victims, regrettably the university is very limited in what it can do.” The complaint, however, outlines in the detail how the women, including the first victim, spoke up about their assaults to numerous officials and were repeatedly persuaded not to file complains. “Women will not have an equal opportunity to succeed academically until the epidemic of sexual violence on campus ends,” Rebecca Peterson-Fisher, senior staff attorney with Equal Rights Advocates, said in a statement. “Institutions like Stanford need to be held accountable for their failure to recognize the severity of these crimes.” ||||| Stanford student says university let sex predator graduate A student at Stanford University filed a federal lawsuit this week accusing the institution of failing to protect women from a violent sexual predator who was allowed to graduate despite several reported assaults on female undergraduates. The civil rights suit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, comes only months after the sensational case of former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner who was released from jail after serving half of a six-month sentence for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman on campus. In the latest case, the 6-foot-6, 200-pound assailant, identified only as Mr. X, allegedly attempted to rape the plaintiff in February 2014 after she refused to perform oral sex, then physically assaulted and verbally abused her. The victim, identified as Jane Doe, had ended a relationship with Mr. X prior to the alleged assault. She later discovered that two other students had reported being sexually assaulted, battered or threatened by the same assailant between 2011 and 2014, according to the lawsuit.

The university also banned him from campus for 10 years, according to the suit. He was nevertheless allowed to obtain a bachelor’s and a master’s degree, and Stanford did nothing when he violated the various orders, including the non-contact directive, the lawsuit said. The suit claims that Stanford violated Doe’s right to equal access to educational opportunities under Title IX by allowing “a hostile educational environment on campus.” “Women will not have an equal opportunity to succeed academically until the epidemic of sexual violence on campus ends,” said Rebecca Peterson-Fisher, the lead attorney for Equal Rights Advocates, one of three law firms representing Jane Doe in the action. “Institutions like Stanford need to be held accountable for their failure to recognize the severity of these crimes and to comply with Title IX.” Stanford issued a statement this week saying the institution has “zero tolerance” for such “abhorrent and antithetical” behavior, but “without the cooperation of victims, regrettably the university is very limited in what it can do.” “We have acted in this case and in all matters to protect our students,” said the statement, which did not explain what the comment about a lack of cooperation meant. The alleged sexual assaults come amid scrutiny over the prevalence of sexual assaults on college campuses around the country, highlighted by the Turner case. The 21-year-old former swimmer has moved back to his home state of Ohio, where he registered as a sex offender. But it was the words of his 23-year-old victim at his sentencing hearing that resonated across the country. She talked about the “two lives ruined” by Turner who “dragged me through this hell” during the Jan. 18, 2015 attack outside the Kappa Alpha fraternity.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE A lawsuit has accused Stanford University of systematic negligence for failing to stop an alleged sexual predator accused of assaulting numerous women during his time at the university. The complaint, filed Monday, alleged college staff failed to connect the dots accusing the male student, identified only as \\"Mr. X,\\" of sexual assaulting four female students over the course of four years. In many cases, staff implied the alleged victims were themselves to blame, according to the lawsuit, even suggesting that one of them should take a drive to the beach to \\"deal with her rape.\\" After years of warnings, Stanford did eventually find Mr. X responsible for several charges of sexual assault, the lawsuit said, banning him from campus and imposing no-contact orders, according to the suit. But the university still awarded him both his bachelor's and master's degrees. Stanford University's campus is seen from atop Hoover Tower in May 2014. Beck Diefenbach / REUTERS \\"By acting with deliberate indifference to that notice, Stanford subjected the women to sexual violence and deprived those women ... of equal access to educational opportunities,\\" according to the suit, filed by advocacy group Equal Rights Advocates (ERA) on behalf of one of the alleged victims at the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. In a statement to NBC News, the ERA added: \\"Institutions like Stanford need to be held accountable for their failure to recognize the severity of these crimes and to comply with Title IX.\\" Stanford said in a statement that sexual assault and misconduct were \\"abhorrent and antithetical to the values of our campus,\\" but suggested it was not able to act because one or more of the victims did not want to pursue formal charges. \\"Without the cooperation of victims, regrettably the university is very limited in what it can do,\\" the statement said. \\"Nonetheless, we provide support to sexual assault survivors and will investigate and adjudicate cases if survivors later change their mind.\\" The statement added: \\"We cannot comment on specific facts of this lawsuit due to privacy laws. We have sympathy for the plaintiff in this case, but we will be vigorously defending the lawsuit as we believe that Stanford has acted with appropriate diligence and compassion within the constraints of privacy laws. We will be filing a response in court shortly.\\" Stanford was the focus of international attention earlier this year after former college swimmer Brock Turner was given six months behind bars after being convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault. He was released after serving three months. Stanford University saw protests at its commencement ceremony in June over the Brock Turner case. Elijah Nouvelage / REUTERS The plaintiff in Monday's suit, identified only as \\"Ms. Doe,\\" started dating Mr. X around Nov. 2013, unaware that he had a history of alleged sexual assault, according to the complaint. It added that after ending the relationship months later, Ms. Doe was sexually assaulted by Mr. X after refusing his demands for oral sex. She had no idea he was first accused of sexual assault in Sept. 2010, when he was alleged to have repeatedly sexually assaulted another female student, identified as \\"Ms. A,\\" over the course of several months. The complaint said this culminated in Mr. X strangling Ms. A \\"nearly to the point of unconsciousness\\" before whispering \\"no one will notice when you die\\" and raping her. Ms. A told several university officials about the allegations, one of whom noted she was wearing a sweater that revealed part of her shoulder and asked her to consider whether she \\"placed herself in potentially risky situations because she wanted to appear sexually available,\\" according to the lawsuit. According to the complaint, another suggested she take steps to \\"deal with her rape and improve her mental health, such as renting a car and going to a beach.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"Stanford University is facing a federal lawsuit claiming that the institution failed to act on reports of sexual assault.

More accurately known as conscription, this mandatory enlistment for military service was an effort to replenish and boost the strength of the Union Army, which faced significant losses throughout the conflict. The Civil War began on April 12, 1861, as tensions between the North and South over issues like slavery and states' rights reached a boiling point. By 1862, it was clear that the war wouldn't end quickly, and the Union needed more troops to replace those lost in battle or through desertion. In response, the United States Congress passed the Militia Act of 1862, which allowed for the enlistment of African-American soldiers and included a provision for states to draft men if enlistment quotas were not met by volunteering efforts. However, this wasn't yet a nationwide draft. The first nationwide draft, called the Enrollment Act, was enacted on March 3, 1863. Also referred to as the Civil War Military Draft Act, this legislation called for all able-bodied men between the ages of 20 and 45, including immigrants seeking U.S. citizenship, to be eligible for conscription. However, this draft was not without controversy. The Enrollment Act allowed wealthier Americans to avoid service by hiring substitutes or paying a 300 fee to the government, which led to widespread resentment among the working and middle classes who were disproportionately affected. This anger culminated in the New York City Draft Riots in July 1863, resulting in the deaths of over 100 people, numerous injuries, and property damage. Despite the initial strife and discontent, the draft helped bolster the Union Army's ranks and ultimately played a role in the North's victory over the South. After the war, conscription was discontinued, but it would be reintroduced during World War I. In summary, the first national draft used in the United States was instituted on March 3, 1863, during the Civil War under President Abraham Lincoln's administration. It aimed to address the urgent need for more troops in the Union Army and eventually contributed to the Union's success."},{"instruction":"How do you do this: Once you have applied frosting to your window, what should be your next step?","output":"Once you have applied frosting to your window, here is the step-by-step process for the next steps: Step 1: Smooth out the frosting After applying the frosting, it's important to smooth it out for an even and desired appearance. You can use a squeegee, a plastic scraper, or an old credit card to gently smooth out air bubbles and ensure the frosting is evenly distributed across the window. Reason: A smoother application will result in a more professional and visually appealing finish.

What are the names of the parents that the North Korean propaganda song, \\"We Will Follow Only You\\", is dedicated to? A:","output":"The North Korean propaganda song, \\"We Will Follow Only You,\\" is not known to be dedicated to any particular set of parents, as it is not framed within the context of a familial relationship per se. However, in the broader context of North Korean propaganda, the song is largely interpreted as an expression of utmost devotion and loyalty to the North Korean leaders, who are often symbolically referred to as the 'parent figures' of the nation. In this sense, the song can be seen as being 'dedicated' to the North Korean leaders who have reigned since the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Here are the leaders who have held the position of the supreme leadership in North Korea: 1. Kim Il-sung: He was the founding leader of North Korea, ruling from its establishment in 1948 until his death in 1994. Often referred to as the \\"Great Leader,\\" Kim Il-sung is the most likely figure to whom this song is symbolically 'dedicated,' considering that most of North Korea's personality cult and propaganda machinery was established and solidified under his reign. 2. Kim Jong-il: Succeeding his father, Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il was the leader of North Korea from 1994 until his own death in 2011. He was often referred to as the \\"Dear Leader\\" and was also a target of considerable veneration within North Korean society. 3. Kim Jong-un: The current leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, took over after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in 2011. Like his predecessors, he has also been the subject of an intense personality cult and propaganda drive. In conclusion, while it’s inaccurate to say that the song \\"We Will Follow Only You\\" is dedicated to the 'parents' in the typical sense of the term, within the framework of North Korean society and symbolic order, it can be considered as a dedication to Kim Il-sung and the subsequent leaders of North Korea, who are portrayed and perceived as the 'parental figures' of the nation."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

These properties can be different from the wood produced earlier in the tree's life. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the tree's life may be softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than the wood produced earlier. In other trees, the opposite may occur, with the wood becoming harder, denser, stronger, and less even-textured towards the end of the tree's life.

However, in a smaller tree, the sapwood may be superior in these properties compared to the heartwood. The variations in wood properties near the end of a tree's life can be attributed to multiple factors, such as environmental conditions, local climate, and the tree's overall growth rate and health.

A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit. - An application domain is a mechanism (similar to a process in an operating system) used within the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) to isolate executed software applications from one another so that they do not affect each other. Each application domain has its own virtual address space which scopes the resources for the application domain using that address space. - A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files. Such programs are sometimes known as \\"notepad\\" software, following the Microsoft Notepad. - Emacs and its derivatives are a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as \\"the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor\\". Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s and continues actively . - A scripting or script language is a programming language that supports scripts, programs written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted (rather than compiled). Primitives are usually the elementary tasks or API calls, and the language allows them to be combined into more complex programs. Environments that can be automated through scripting include software applications, web pages within a web browser, the shells of operating systems (OS), embedded systems, as well as numerous games. A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an application, this is also known as an extension language. Scripting languages are also sometimes referred to as very high-level programming languages, as they operate at a high level of abstraction, or as control languages, particularly for job control languages on mainframes. - In computing, executable code or an executable file or executable program, sometimes simply an executable or binary, causes a computer \\"to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions,\\" as opposed to a data file that must be parsed by a program to be meaningful. These \\"instructions\\" are traditionally machine code instructions for a physical CPU. However, in a more general sense, a file containing instructions (such as bytecode) for a \\"software\\" interpreter may also be considered executable; even a scripting language source file may therefore be considered executable in this sense. The exact interpretation depends upon the use; while the term often refers only to machine code files, in the context of protection against computer viruses all files which cause potentially hazardous instruction execution, including scripts, are lumped together for convenience. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. - Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. - A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms. - XEmacs is a graphical- and console-based text editor which runs on almost any Unix-like operating system as well as Microsoft Windows. XEmacs is a fork, based on a version of GNU Emacs from the late 1980s. Any user can download, use, and modify XEmacs as free software available under the GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version. - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology. - Emacs Lisp is a dialect of the Lisp programming language used as a scripting language by Emacs (a text editor family most commonly associated with GNU Emacs and XEmacs). It is used for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in C (as is the Lisp interpreter itself). Emacs Lisp is also referred to as Elisp, although there is also an older, unrelated Lisp dialect with that name. - GNU Emacs is the most popular and most ported Emacs text editor. It was created by GNU Project founder Richard Stallman. In common with other varieties of Emacs, GNU Emacs is extensible using a Turing complete programming language. GNU Emacs has been called \\"the most powerful text editor available today.\\" With proper support from the underlying system, GNU Emacs is able to display files in multiple character sets, and has been able to simultaneously display most human languages since at least 1999. Throughout its history, GNU Emacs has been a central component of the GNU project, and a flagship of the free software movement. GNU Emacs is sometimes abbreviated as GNUMACS, especially to differentiate it from other EMACS variants. The tag line for GNU Emacs is \\"the extensible self-documenting text editor\\". - In computer programming , apel ( the initialism represents \`\` A Portable Emacs Library '' ) provides support for writing portable code in Emacs Lisp .

Make sure you have a sweater in case it gets cold, a good, comfy chair, some dark chocolate (brain power!), a bottle of water, and whatever else you may need. That way, you'll have few interruptions. Research also shows that you should study in more than one place. It sounds a little funny, but your brain makes associations with your environment. So, the more associations it has, the more likely you are to retain the information. Locate all the comfy chairs and study in them all! Although it's inevitable sometimes, cramming isn't the way to go. In fact, taking breaks is good for your brain and will help you retain more. Try to study in 20-50 minute intervals, taking five or ten minutes in between. If you're on top of things, it's best to study over a full week. Several sessions will cement the knowledge in your head and by the end you'll be able to notice how much better you know the content, allowing you to relax and be confident. Easier said than done? Remember - you have all of the answers in your head already! The only challenge is getting them out! Your first instinct is nearly always correct. Don't go back and change answers. If you are really not sure, skip it and come back later. Always read the questions given on a test. Skimming over them might tell you the opposite of what you need to do. If you're uncertain about the wording of a test question, go and ask the teacher what it means. As long as you don't flat out ask for the answer to a question, just what they meant by the question; they will usually answer. You need sleep in order to stay focused, and without it, you will have a hard time staying on task and may forget what you just learned. That's part of the reason why cramming is so evil! Sleep is wonderful. Sleep deprivation can lead to accidents, dumbs you down, and can actually cause health problems.

Now, let's analyze the two towns in the new situation. Bend town has cooler air at night, while Bank town experiences warmer nights due to its location on a south-facing hill. Given the information from the background article and the situation, we can conclude that, in general, Bank town experiences a higher air temperature, especially during nighttime. This is because it is situated on a south-facing hill, causing it to receive more sunlight and heat during the day, subsequently leading to warmer nights compared to Bend town. It is important to note, however, that this conclusion is based on the limited information provided about the towns' geographical characteristics and weather patterns.

That compares to losses of £1.4m in April, and £932,000 in March. However Action Fraud said it was too early to conclude that the increase was a direct result of the introduction of new pension freedoms in April. That is because victims may report the losses many months after they were actually defrauded. \\"With regards to the recent pension reforms, and the effect that this will have on pension liberation fraud, it is at this stage difficult to draw any conclusions,\\" said a spokesperson for Action Fraud. The pensions minister, Baroness Ros Altmann, agreed with that analysis. She said she was \\"not convinced\\" that the pensions freedoms have led to a rise in fraud. \\"People are a lot more aware of it, and are starting to report it. It can take a long time for people to realise they've lost their money,\\" she told BBC Radio Five Live. Pension liberation fraudsters typically contact those with pension pots, and persuade them they can release the money - for a fee. However they usually do not make it clear that by doing so, the victims can be subject to large tax bills. Anyone under the age of 55 is liable for tax on their liberated pension at a rate of up to 55%. Following the pension reforms, which came in at the beginning of April, those over 55 are liable for income tax on 75% of their savings. Anyone whose income exceeds £150,000 in one year- including the amount taken out of their pension pot - could have to pay up to 45% in tax. The losses reflect the amount the victims owe in tax, plus the fee they have paid to the fraudsters. The figures show that, on average, victims lost £60,500 - in some cases more than half their pension. However, even though the amount of fraud has increased, the number of cases being reported has actually fallen. There were 78 cases of reported fraud in both May and April, down from 82 in March, and 240 in February. Project Bloom has been set up by the government to try and combat such pension fraud. Further tips on how to avoid being scammed are available on the Serious Fraud Office website, as well as elsewhere.

Passage: This is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games, both summer and winter, since the modern Olympics began in 1896. Since then, summer games have usually -- but not always -- celebrated a four-year period known as an Olympiad. There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 24 cities, and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities. In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Tokyo / Helsinki (summer) and Sapporo / Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) in 1940; and London (summer) and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy (winter) in 1944. The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens. However, in 1949, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games. Four cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games: Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics, Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics, Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics, and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics.

It is the biggest lake in Britain. It is over thirty kilometres long and in places nearly 300 meters deep. It is cold and dark and not many people went there until after 1930. Then a road was made around the lake. Holiday makers began to use the road, and this was when the stories began. Someone said that he had seen a monster in the lake. He said it was twelve meters long. It had a long neck and a small head. Then someone else said he had seen it. Others said the same thing and in 1933 a London doctor took a photo. It looked like a monster with a long neck and a thick body but the photo was not dear. The newspapers printed the picture and called it the Loch Ness monster, or \\"Nessie\\". Then the argument began. Some people, however, were certain there was something living in the lake. Others said there was nothing there. In 1961, a lot of people joined together to make a real effort to see and photograph the monster if there was one! Several times people thought they saw something but after ten years there was still no real proof. Later underwater television cameras were used, but no one found any real proof. However, they did find something interesting: a huge underwater cave. It was big enough to be home of a monster, but of course, this was not a proof. In 1975, however, some American scientists formed a search group. They used an underwater camera. It took pictures every seventy seconds. Some of the pictures seemed to show a red-brown creature. Its body was about four meters long and had a very ugly head on the end of a four meter neck. Many people then began to believe in the monster. But even today we can not be certain.

These include: a). Overeating to the point where she becomes ill and must be hospitalized for gastric complications. This implies that Kate may eat beyond her limit, which can strain her digestive system, leading to health issues, such as gastritis, or even severe conditions that require hospitalization. b). Developing a habit of overeating, which could eventually lead to weight gain or obesity. Consuming more food than the body expends in energy regularly can lead to an accumulation of excess fats, contributing to overweight. c). The development of an eating disorder such as bulimia, where a person indulges in episodes of overeating followed by attempts to avoid gaining weight often through self-induced vomiting or the use of laxatives (binge-purge cycles). Over time, this can severely affect both physical and mental health. d). Developing an aversion to eating and becoming too thin. In this scenario, Kate may become worried about the effects of overeating, leading to an extreme reaction where she reduces her food intake excessively, potentially leading to malnourishment or anorexia.

You can’t move on until you’ve accepted that you and your former partner are no longer together and that the relationship isn’t coming back. Don’t call, text, email, or otherwise contact or talk to your ex. It will only make it harder for you to get yourself together and move on. There may be a time when you and your former partner can be friends, but that time is definitely not now. Absolutely under no circumstances visit their Facebook page. Unfriend them and stay away. Also stay away from his or her close friends. It may be difficult if you have mutual friends, but for the time being, stick close to your own friends. You’ll avoid getting pulled back into any drama and hearing about what your ex is up to. Go through and get rid of any mementos, photos, or other reminders of your former relationship. You can’t move on if you’re still clinging to remnants of the relationship, and you definitely won’t move on if you still attach sentiment to them. Hanging out in places the two of you used to go will make it harder for you to move on. You may be able to begin going back to them eventually, but for now, stay away. Recognize the feelings that you still have about the person and/or relationship, whether it’s anger, sadness, disappointment, longing, or resentment. Don’t try to hide from the feelings. Instead, allow yourself to feel them fully; so if you need to wallow, then wallow. Accept your feelings so that then you can begin to move on. Think critically about why the relationship ended, including mistakes you made as well as mistakes your ex-partner may have made. Use what you've learned from the mistakes each of you made to begin building strategies to avoid similar missteps in the future. Using healthy outlets will not only help you deal with your feelings but also improve your own well-being at the same time. Beating yourself up or becoming self-destructive will make the situation infinitely worse and make the process of moving on much longer and harder. Let your friends and family be your resource--talk to them and let them be there for you. Going running, hitting the gym (hello, punching bag!), taking a hike, joining a yoga class...all excellent options. Write--but don’t send--an angry letter. Let all your ugliest feelings out and let yourself have some catharsis. But do not send the letter. It will make your situation worse rather than better and stop you from moving on. Look for a strong role model you can look up to as well as take inspiration from. Perhaps a friend or character or public figure who got back up better than ever after getting knocked down. The more you can take inspiration from people who have stumbled and caught themselves, the easier it will be to envision yourself doing the same. It’s harder to pine for an ex when you’re seeking new partners. But make sure to keep your feelings about your ex and the relationship out of your new dating scene. Avoid bringing up or grumbling about your ex with a date--don’t let the old relationship taint your new ones. Summary:","output":"To get over a breakup, stop contacting your ex, stay away from their social media, focus on your own friends, get rid of reminders, avoid places you went together, accept your feelings, learn from mistakes, use healthy ways to cope, talk to friends and family, write but don't send angry letters, find role models, and be careful when dating new people."},{"instruction":"Briefly summarize this sentence: tiger woods took a two-shot lead at the ford championship at doral on saturday , thanks in part to a lucky break at the last hole .","output":"Tiger Woods was winning by two points in a golf game on Saturday at a place called Doral.

But NHS trusts all have to pay in full, and will face a £300m increase in rates over the next five years. University Hospitals Birmingham Trust, the worst hit, is appealing against a rate rise of more than £2m this year. A spokesman for the trust, which operates the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, said: \\"The trust believes there is an anomaly in how NHS trusts are treated for business rates when compared to other organisations such as universities, charitable care facilities and private hospitals. \\"NHS Trusts receive no additional funding to offset business rates costs. \\"We are therefore, alongside other NHS trusts, part of a long-running challenge to seek a similar level of charitable relief on business rates, similar to non-profit organisations.\\" Research using Freedom of Information Act requests by CVS, a property valuation company, suggests that about 27% of private hospitals receive business rates relief. Local authorities reported that 123 out of 457 private hospitals were charities, allowing them the 80% rates reduction. No information was provided for a further 169 private hospitals in England and Wales. CVS calculates that the 626 private hospitals would have been expected to pay a total of £241.4m between them. But accounting for the institutions that are known to receive the discount for charities, the company expects them to save £51.9m. Nuffield Health, whose income makes it Britain's third largest charity, is expected to pay just £3.2m over the next five years, saving £12.7m because of its charitable status, according to the CVS analysis. Mark Rigby, chief executive of CVS, said: \\"It is iniquitous that NHS hospitals pay normal business rates but 26.9% of private hospitals, using charitable status, receive an 80% discount.\\" While the government has announced plans to reform business rates, Mr Rigby said \\"this must include all reliefs and the current inequalities that exist within the system\\". Dozens of NHS hospitals wrote to local authorities last year to try to claim the reduced business rates, but the Local Government Association rejected the claim, as they are not charities in law. The revaluation of business rates, which came into effect in April, has increased NHS hospitals' tax bill by 19% to £366m a year. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"A study has revealed that over one in four private hospitals in the UK are designated as charities, enabling them to receive an 80% rebate on business rates. In contrast, National Health Service (NHS) trusts are required to pay the full amount and will experience a £300m increase in rates across the next five years.

Herodotus, Xenophon and Strabo all assert that the Bithyni and Thyni settled together in what would be known as Bithynia and Thynia. According to Herodotus, the Bithynian Thracians originally lived along the Strymon river, and were known as Strymonians. - Paphlagonia was an ancient area on the Black Sea coast of north central Anatolia, situated between Bithynia to the west and Pontus to the east, and separated from Phrygia (later, Galatia) by a prolongation to the east of the Bithynian Olympus. According to Strabo, the river Parthenius formed the western limit of the region, and it was bounded on the east by the Halys river. The name \\"Paphlagonia\\" is derived in the legends from Paphlagon, a son of Phineus. (Eustath. ad Horn. II. ii. 851, ad Dion. Per. 787; Steph. B. t.v.; Const. Porph. de Them. i. 7.) - The Seljuk Empire or Great Seljuk Empire (also spelled Seljuq) was a medieval Turko-Persian Sunni Muslim empire, originating from the Qynyq branch of Oghuz Turks. The Seljuk Empire controlled a vast area stretching from the Hindu Kush to eastern Anatolia and from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf. From their homelands near the Aral sea, the Seljuks advanced first into Khorasan and then into mainland Persia before eventually conquering eastern Anatolia. - Bithynia (Greek \\"Bithynia\\") was an ancient region, kingdom and Roman province in the northwest of Asia Minor, adjoining the Propontis, the Thracian Bosporus and the Euxine Sea. It bordered on Mysia to the south-west, Paphlagonia to the north-east along the Pontic coast, and Phrygia to the south-east towards the interior of Asia Minor. Bithynia was an independent kingdom from 4th century BC. Its capital Nicomedia was rebuilt on the site of ancient Astacus in 264 BC by Nicomedes I of Bithynia. Bithynia fell to the Roman Republic in 74 BC, and became united with the Pontus region as the province of Bithynia et Pontus, in the 7th century incorporated into the Byzantine Opsikion theme. It became a border region to the Seljuk Empire in the 13th century, and was eventually conquered by the Ottoman Turks in the 1330s. - Ziaelas ( Greek : ; lived c. 265 BC -- 228 BC , reigned c. 254 BC -- 228 BC ) , third king of Bithynia , was a son of Nicomedes I and Ditizele . After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'ziaelas of bithynia' exhibits the relationship of 'father'. Find the answer from the choices below. Choices: - assert - nicomedes i of bithynia - persian gulf - pontus Answer:","output":"From the information given, Ziaelas of Bithynia exhibits the relationship of 'father' with Nicomedes I of Bithynia. This is evident where in the text it is indicated that Ziaelas, who served as the third king of Bithynia, was a son of Nicomedes I. Therefore, Nicomedes I stands as the paternal figure in relation to Ziaelas of Bithynia. Nicomedes I of Bithynia was a significant figure in the region's history. He was responsible for rebuilding the city of Astacus, renaming it Nicomedia in 264 BC, highlighting his impact on the development of the region. Bithynia itself was an ancient region, kingdom, and eventually, a Roman province situated in the northwest of Asia Minor, neighboring several other influence-wielding regions such as Mysia, Paphlagonia, and Phrygia. The Bithyni were a Thracian tribe who, along with the Thyni, migrated to this region from Strymon river. They settled together in what would later be known as Bithynia and Thynia. Up to the 4th century BC, Bithynia remained an independent kingdom before falling under the Roman Republic in 74 BC. The region eventually got incorporated into other empires over centuries to follow, such as Byzantine and the great Seljuk Empire - a medieval Turko-Persian Sunni Muslim empire with extensive geographical control. However, by the 13th-century Bithynia became a border region to the Seljuk Empire and was finally taken over by the Ottoman Turks in the 1330s. However, returning to the original query, the relationship between Ziaelas of Bithynia and Nicomedes I of Bithynia stands as that of father and son, affirming that Nicomedes I of Bithynia is indeed the entity Ziaelas of Bithynia exhibits the relationship of 'father.' The other options presented such as 'assert', 'Persian Gulf', and 'Pontus', while relevant in the text provided, do not bear a direct relationship with Ziaelas of Bithynia in the context of a 'father' figure."},{"instruction":"In September, 1998, an invitation was sent by that committee to Dr. Chopra and others to appear before the committee, and a notice of meeting was issued for October 1, 1998.

Can we draw the following conclusion? The meeting was held October 1 1998. Options: -Yes; -It's impossible to say; -No;","output":"-No; Based on the information provided, it is clear that the meeting which was scheduled for October 1, 1998, was actually cancelled. Hence, we can't conclude that the meeting was held on October 1, 1998. The scientists, including Dr. Chopra, expressed their apprehensions about the potential negative impacts on their careers if they testified before the committee. The exact reasons behind these concerns are not specified in the context, but they could potentially include fear of retaliation, worry about being perceived negatively by peers or superiors, or concerns that their statements might be misconstrued or used against them in some way. This decision to cancel the meeting indicates that the hosting committee was respectful of these concerns, or that the scientists themselves had enough influence or control over the meeting to ensure its cancellation. It is also implied that these were not inconsequential meetings; the fact that attending could have serious career implications suggests that the information exchanged or decisions made in these meetings could have a significant impact. Interestingly, the implication that scientists felt the need to avoid these meetings suggests a potentially hostile or high-stakes environment, or a disconnect between the goals and perspectives of the scientists and those of the committee. In summary, based on the details shared about the cancelation of the meeting, it can be firmly concluded that the meeting that was supposed to be held on October 1, 1998, did not take place. The concerns of the scientists about the potential impact on their careers took precedence over the scheduled meeting. The meeting's cancellation exemplifies the responsive action taken considering these concerns. Therefore, the conclusion that the meeting was held on October 1, 1998, cannot be drawn from this information."},{"instruction":"Short general knowledge question: what movies has selena gomez starred in?","output":"Selena Gomez, an American actress and singer, has appeared in numerous films throughout her career.

He scratched at an imaginary itch on his right hand (just below his thumb) to take his mind off the man in the lab coat who sat across from him at the beaten, scarred, wood table. It didn't work. And whoever this man in the lab coat was, he was insistent about paperwork. He had three inches clipped onto a weathered clipboard which he flipped through with precision. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" asked the boy's captor in a calm, sensitive tenor. The boy, Kurt, continued to scratch the imaginary itch, which had leapt magically from his right hand to the left. Eventually the falseness of the itch would be deduced, and the lab coated man would disappear out of the cell and return with... God knows what. He had seen torture hundreds-if not thousands-of times on TV, and he was glumly certain that there would be no commercial breaks for him. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" The question was repeated without urgency, like a forgetful waiter. The itch now leaped with the dexterity of a trained flea onto the boy's leg, and the dutiful fingers followed. He watched as the man in the lab coat, without name tag or company insignia, studied his stack of papers attached to the clipboard. Several yellow forms near the top half inch were labeled 27B. The man frowned and wrote a note on the top page. \\"Note: Find out who isn't duplicating 27B in Pink.\\" \\"I'm sorry,\\" he said, \\"I wasn't listening.

Sentence 2: An infant girl just a week old inherited the Scottish crown when the king died. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Both sentences essentially convey the same information, but they are structured differently and use slightly different wording. In the first sentence, it is mentioned that the king dies a few days after some event, with the focus being on the king's death as the primary subject. The result of this death is the week-old baby girl's inheritance of the Scottish crown. The first sentence presents the information in a way that highlights the timeline of events. In the second sentence, however, the focus is placed directly on the infant girl as the subject, and the sentence describes her inheriting the Scottish crown. The fact that the king dies in order to set the stage for this inheritance is presented in a subordinate clause – \\"when the king died.\\" The second sentence expresses the same information as the first but restructures it to emphasize the baby girl's inheritance. In summary, while the two sentences are structured differently and have distinct points of emphasis, the second sentence is indeed entailed by the first sentence, as they both communicate the same core information: the king dies, and as a consequence, a week-old baby girl inherits the Scottish crown."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Three men are walking down a road.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Three men walking.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

What is this text about?","output":"The given text provides a brief insight into an incentive clause, specifically for a baseball player named Jim Brower, who is a part of the San Francisco Giants, a professional baseball team. The text discusses a common occurrence in such contracts where performance incentives are included as part of multiyear deals for relievers, like Brower. An incentive clause is a provision that is included in contracts in various professional sports, including baseball, where players can receive additional financial benefits based on their performance or by achieving specific objectives. These incentives encourage the players to deliver exceptional individual performance, which can also benefit the team collectively. In the case of Jim Brower, the text suggests that he has a list of incentives in his multiyear contract with the Giants. These incentives might include achieving a certain number of strikeouts, saves, appearances in games, and other statistical milestones that are relevant to a reliever's role in baseball. Relievers are generally pitchers who enter a game after the starting pitcher has been replaced, and they play a crucial role in maintaining a team's lead or closing the gap when they are trailing. As such, it is important for them to perform well to contribute to the team's overall success. The San Francisco Giants, like any other professional sports team, aim to assemble a highly competitive and capable group of players. By including incentives in the contracts of their relievers, such as Jim Brower, the team motivates players to excel in their designated roles and continuously improve their performance. Consequently, the players have a higher probability of reaching individual milestones and successfully meeting their targets, which in turn benefits the team as a whole. The text, therefore, highlights the importance of incentive clauses in sports contracts, particularly in the context of the San Francisco Giants and their reliever Jim Brower. Incorporating such clauses can significantly improve an athlete's performance and motivation, making them strive for both personal and team success. Incentive clauses are an essential tool for the management of sports teams to ensure a higher level of commitment, dedication, and competitiveness among their players, ultimately resulting in optimized performances on the field."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: Excellent!!

He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Unemployment has increased substantially since the African National Congress came to power in 1994, going from 15.6% in 1995 to 30.3% in 2001. In the second quarter of 2010, the jobless rate increased to 25.3%, and the number of people with work fell by 61,000 to 12.7 million. The biggest decline in employment was recorded in the manufacturing industry, which shed 53,000 workers. Agriculture lost 32,000 jobs, employment in the construction industry fell by 15,000. In the third quarter of 2010, 29.80% of blacks were officially unemployed, compared with 22.30% of coloureds, 8.60 of Asians and 5.10% of whites. A:","output":"Q: How many more percentage points did black unemployment increase compared to white unemployment between 1995 and 2001? A: Using 15.6% as a baseline statistic in 1995, the total unemployment increased to 30.3% in 2001. For blacks, the unemployment in the third quarter of 2010 was 29.80%, and for whites, it was 5.10%. The increase for blacks was (29.80 - 15.6) = 14.2 percentage points, and for whites, it was (5.10 - 15.6) = -10.5 percentage points. The difference between these increases is (14.2 - (-10.5)) = 24.7 percentage points. Q: How many jobs were lost in the manufacturing, agriculture, and construction industries combined in the second quarter of 2010? A: The manufacturing industry lost 53,000 workers, agriculture lost 32,000 jobs, and employment in the construction industry fell by 15,000. The total jobs lost in these industries are (53,000 + 32,000 + 15,000) = 100,000 jobs. Q: What was the total percentage of unemployed Asians, coloureds, and whites in the third quarter of 2010? A: The unemployment percentage of Asians was 8.60%, coloureds was 22.30%, and whites was 5.10%. The total percentage of unemployed Asians, coloureds, and whites in the third quarter of 2010 is (8.60 + 22.30 + 5.10) = 36%.

Bourne reads Ross's articles and arranges a meeting with him at London Waterloo station. Bourne realizes that the CIA is following Ross and helps him evade capture for a while, but when Ross panics and ignores Bourne's instructions, Blackbriar assassin Paz (Ãdgar RamÃ­rez) shoots him dead, in the middle of a busy station, on orders of Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Vosen's team, reluctantly assisted by Landy, analyzes Ross's notes and identifies his source as Neal Daniels (Colin Stinton), a CIA Station chief involved with Treadstone and Blackbriar. Bourne makes his way to Daniels's office in Madrid but finds it empty. He incapacitates gunmen sent by Vosen and Landy. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), a former Treadstone operative who shares a history with Bourne, tells him that Daniels has fled to Tangier and aids his escape from an arriving CIA unit. Parsons learns that Blackbriar \\"asset\\" Desh Bouksani (Joey Ansah) has been tasked with killing Daniels.

Going through the television channels, Alexandria skipped the romance series but watched the fantasy one because the","output":"characters were exciting and magical. Once upon a time, in the land of Make-Believe, Alexandria found herself in a world full of magic, mystery, and adventure. As she watched the fantasy show, she saw these amazing creatures like kind dragons, friendly unicorns, talking animals, and even little fairies that sparkled with every giggle they made. One day, Alexandria decided to join the characters on their big adventure to find a hidden treasure. The leader of the group was a wise old wizard with a long white beard, who carried a magical staff that could do all sorts of wonderful things. He said that the treasure they were looking for was hidden in a mysterious place called the Enchanted Forest. The Enchanted Forest was a place that no one in the land of Make-Believe had ever been to, because it was protected by a thick wall of thorny bushes that could not be cut or burned. But the wizard told them that with the help of his magical staff and their own special gifts, they could find a way through the thorns! So the group set off on their journey, walking for many days and nights through the magical land. They faced various challenges along the way, like crossing a river filled with singing mermaids, climbing a mountain guarded by a giant, and even tricking a grumpy troll who blocked their path. But each time, the group used their unique skills and the wizard's magic to overcome these obstacles. Finally, after all their hard work, they arrived at the Enchanted Forest. The thorny bushes were just as they had heard - tall, thick, and impossible to pass. But the wizard stepped forward and waved his magical staff. A bright light shone from the staff, and the thorns began to untangle themselves, creating a path for the group to enter. As they journeyed through the Enchanted Forest, they discovered all sorts of magical creatures living there. They met elves building tiny treehouses, giant butterflies carrying them across a stream, and even a wise old tree who told them stories of the forest's history. But sadly, no one had ever heard of the hidden treasure they were searching for. Feeling a little disappointed, they continued on, until they finally stumbled upon a cave hidden deep within the forest. Alexandria and her friends looked at each other and smiled, knowing that they must have finally found the treasure! They braced themselves for whatever challenges the cave might hold, and entered. Inside the cave, they found the most beautiful sight they had ever seen. The walls were lined with twinkling crystals, reflecting rainbows of light that filled the entire cave. And right in the center was the treasure they had been seeking - a magical box full of endless wishes! Everyone was so happy and proud of their journey, and they each took a turn making a wish with the magical treasure. Alexandria wished to always have adventures like this one, together with her friends in the magical land of Make-Believe. And so, their adventure came to a happy end. The group returned to their home, and the wizard used his magical staff to protect the treasure so that it would remain safe for future adventurers. They shared their exciting tale with the rest of the land and went down in history as the brave heroes who discovered the treasure in the Enchanted Forest. And as for Alexandria, she kept watching the fantasy television show, excited to see what new adventures awaited her and her friends in the land of Make-Believe."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Take a deep breath. Avoid making threats. Grab a notepad. Copy down the number. Write down the day and time. Give a coworker a handwritten note. Listen to the caller.","output":"Title: Remaining Calm and Prepared During Stressful Phone Calls: A Step-By-Step Guide Introduction Stressful or unexpected phone calls can be daunting, making it essential to find ways to remain calm, organized, and level-headed. No matter the reason behind the call, following a practical approach can help handle the situation better and efficiently respond to the caller. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to navigate these challenging situations and ensure a positive outcome. Step 1: Take a Deep Breath The first step is to remain calm by taking a deep breath before responding. It is crucial to handle stressful situations without panicking or becoming overly emotional. Taking a deep breath can help you stay relaxed and focused on the task at hand. It will also help you gather your thoughts and make better decisions during the call. Step 2: Avoid Making Threats As tensions rise during difficult phone calls, the temptation to make threats can be challenging to resist. However, making threats is never the solution. It might escalate the situation, lead to possible legal issues, and prevent reaching a resolution. It is crucial to maintain a professional and courteous demeanor throughout the call and focus on addressing the issue at hand. Step 3: Grab a Notepad A necessary yet often overlooked step is keeping a notepad and pen nearby. Writing notes during a phone call will assist you in remembering important details and help you track the progress of the conversation. Moreover, having these notes will come in handy if there is any follow-up communication. Step 4: Copy Down the Number Jot down the caller's phone number on your notepad. This information will be useful if you need to call them back or report the call to authorities. It's essential to have a record of all incoming calls, so having the number handy ensures you can reference it later if necessary. Step 5: Write Down the Day and Time Document the day and time of the call. By doing so, you can accurately track the details of the conversation for future reference. These records may be important if the call is related to an ongoing issue, and keeping track of the call history could benefit you in the long run. Additionally, having a record of the timeline can provide context when reviewing communications. Step 6: Give a Coworker a Handwritten Note If the situation requires support from colleagues or higher-ups, prepare a handwritten note summarizing the call to share with them. Keep the note concise, but make sure to include relevant information such as the caller's name, number, and main concerns. Passing along this information to your coworkers can help achieve a quick and effective solution. This procedure also fosters a collaborative work environment where employees can support each other during challenging moments. Step 7: Listen to the Caller Lastly, give your full attention to the caller, intently listen to their concerns, and avoid interrupting them. Practice active listening skills by acknowledging what the caller is saying, asking clarifying questions, and repeating pertinent information to ensure you understand their perspective. Listening and empathizing with the caller is key to addressing the issue and achieving a positive outcome. Conclusion Handling difficult or stressful phone calls is challenging, but following these simple steps can make all the difference. By practicing effective communication, remaining calm, and keeping detailed notes, you will be better prepared to manage any unexpected situation that arises during a phone call."},{"instruction":"How similar are these two sentences, on a scale from 0-5 (0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\")? Two robots share a kiss. A male and female robot are kissing.","output":"I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as a 4 on a scale of 0-5, where 0 stands for \\"not similar\\" and 5 stands for \\"very similar.\\" Both sentences describe the interaction between two robots that involve a kiss. They convey nearly the same information and are similar in their core message. However, there are a few subtle differences between the two sentences that prevent them from being exactly identical: 1. Sentence 1 mentions \\"Two robots share a kiss,\\" which does not provide any explicit information about the robots' gender or whether they represent a specific gender. Sentence 2, on the other hand, specifies the genders of the robots by mentioning, \\"A male and female robot are kissing.\\" The difference in detail might lead the reader to visualize different situations or attach different meanings to each sentence. However, this addition of extra detail about genders is not significant enough to make them dissimilar. 2. The structure of both sentences differs slightly. Sentence 1 is more concise, describing a single, shared action between the robots in the form of \\"share a kiss.\\" In contrast, Sentence 2 uses a subject-verb-object structure, implying a distinct action between the male and female robot, \\"are kissing.\\" However, this syntactic change does not drastically change the overall meaning of the two sentences. Overall, the meaning of these sentences is quite similar, but the slight differences in context and structure prevent them from being a perfect match, which is why I rate their similarity as 4."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion - What might be the first step of the process?

From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world.

The ballet instructor, a seasoned professional with years of experience both as a performer and educator, understands the intricacies and nuances of this traveling toe move, known as a bourrée in the ballet world. As the woman glides across the floor with a series of small, quick steps en pointe, or on her toes, the ballet instructor notices that she exhibits an elegant fluidity in her upper body. Her arms are gracefully extended, her fingers gently curved, creating an arch known as port de bras. He sees that the woman's shoulders are aligned with her hips, an essential element to maintain balance and control during the bourrée. However, the ballet instructor also notes a few areas in need of improvement. He observes that the woman's supporting leg must remain more engaged and stable to maintain her balance, while her Achilles tendons need to be stretched to achieve a fully pointed toe position. Her core muscles could be engaged more actively to provide additional support to her lower back throughout the demanding move. Once the woman has completed her demonstration of the traveling toe move, the ballet instructor provides his constructive feedback. He begins by commending her fluidity and the graceful lines she creates with her upper body. Encouraging her to continue developing this natural grace, he points out the specific areas and techniques that need refining. He offers advice on how to improve her foundational strength and balance, such as core exercises, resistance training, and alignment work. He suggests incorporating various stretches and mobility exercises to achieve a more extensive toe point and recommends practicing slow, controlled movements to strengthen and stabilize her supporting leg during the bourrée. Not only does the ballet instructor address these technical aspects of the traveling toe move, but he also emphasizes the importance of musicality and artistic expression. He advises the woman to be mindful of the musical phrasing and accents, using them to her advantage in perfecting her performance quality. Spending time on understanding intent, emotion, and storytelling is crucial when bringing a ballet piece to life, creating a connection with the audience and breathing life into every step. By providing comprehensive, thoughtful feedback and guidance, the ballet instructor supports the woman in honing her ballet skills and refining the traveling toe move technique. He highlights the need for consistent practice, dedication, and patience, ensuring that she keeps pushing her boundaries and perfecting her craft, regardless of her current proficiency level. The woman, in turn, appreciates the constructive feedback and remains committed to overcoming the challenges presented by ballet, working to embody grace, strength, and artistry in every move she masters."},{"instruction":"Question: The answer to the question: Who tries to get information from the paleontologist? is inside the article: In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift.

In the given context, the question asks how adverse weather conditions might affect the waiting time in line for passengers. The potential answers provided are A: more, B: less, and C: no effect. Between these choices, the most accurate answer is A: more. During bad weather conditions, flights may be delayed, canceled, or rescheduled. These changes can result in increased wait times at various stages of the travel process for passengers, including getting in line for check-in, boarding passes, security checkpoints, and boarding. These increased wait times can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, flight delays and cancellations can lead to confusion among passengers, as they try to understand the changes in their itineraries, seek information from airline representatives, or make alternative travel arrangements. This additional activity can cause congestion around the check-in and boarding pass kiosks and lead to longer lines for passengers. Secondly, when flights are delayed, passengers have to spend more time at the airport, waiting for updates and eventually boarding their flights. This can result in larger crowds at boarding gates and longer queues while boarding the aircraft. Additionally, airlines may have to handle multiple flights at the same time due to weather-related changes, leading to an increased workload for staff and longer wait times for passengers. Thirdly, in response to the weather conditions, airline and airport staff may implement additional safety and security measures, such as inspections of planes and airport facilities. These processes can take time and can further increase the waiting time for passengers. In conclusion, adverse weather conditions can significantly affect the waiting time for passengers at various stages of the travel process, often leading to increased wait times in line. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: more."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - Tetsuo: The Iron Man (: \\"Tetsuo\\") is a 1989 Japanese cyberpunk horror film written, produced, edited, and directed by cult-film director Shinya Tsukamoto, and produced by Japan Home Video.

Missouri River: The Missouri River is the longest river in the United States, with a total length of approximately 2,341 miles (3,767 kilometers). It originates in the Rocky Mountains in western Montana, near the Yellowstone National Park. This river plays a significant role in the nation's history, as it was a principal part of the westward expansion of the United States. It served as a route for Native American tribes, explorers, fur trappers, traders, and settlers. The Missouri River flows through seven states: Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri, before joining the Mississippi River near St. Louis. Along the course of the river, several major cities are situated, such as Bismarck, Pierre, Sioux City, Omaha, and Kansas City. Aside from its historical importance, the Missouri River is also a vital source of water supply, hydroelectric power, and irrigation for the agricultural areas in the region. Efforts are being made to conserve and protect the river, as it is a crucial natural resource for local ecosystems and wildlife. 2. Mississippi River: The Mississippi River is the second longest river in the United States and one of the most famous rivers in the world. Its length is approximately 2,320 miles (3,730 kilometers), slightly shorter than the Missouri River. It flows from Lake Itasca in Minnesota and traverses through ten states; namely, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. This river also played an essential role in the history of the United States as a major transportation and trade route. The Mississippi River ends its course by emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. Along its journey, it passes through key cities such as Minneapolis, St. Paul, Quad Cities, St. Louis, Memphis, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. The river is well-known for its cultural and historical importance, particularly in American literature and arts – reflected in works such as Mark Twain's \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\\" Mississippi River is highly important for commercial navigation, flood control, agriculture, and the regional ecosystem. It is home to a wide variety of aquatic and terrestrial species, and many wildlife refuges are scattered along its length. There are ongoing efforts to maintain its health and protect it from pollutants, sedimentation, and habitat destruction to maintain ecological balance and continued future utility. In summary, the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers are the two longest rivers in the United States, both vital and historically significant. They continue to have substantial economic, cultural, and ecological influence on the regions they pass through."},{"instruction":"Q:- Coal is pulverized into fine powder - The coal is mixed with hot air - The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler - The coal and hot air burn over a fire - Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler - The water turns into steam - The steam presses against turbines - The turbines spin - Electricity is produced.

Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","output":"To determine if the statement \\"People have gathered near a train\\" is true based on the given sentence \\"People gathered to look at trains,\\" we need to analyze the context and wording of both sentences. 1. In the given sentence, the subject is \\"people\\" and the verb is \\"gathered.\\" This indicates a group of individuals coming together. The word \\"to\\" shows purpose, and that purpose is \\"to look at trains.\\" 2. In the second sentence, the subject and verb are the same, referring to people who have gathered. The preposition \\"near\\" indicates proximity to a specific location. The focus is on a single \\"train.\\" 3. Going back to the first sentence, we can deduce that people gather with the intention of looking at trains, so they must be in close proximity to where the trains are. Now, let's compare the two sentences. The main difference between the two is the first sentence refers to \\"trains\\" (plural), while the second sentence is focused on a singular \\"train.\\" We know that, in any train-related environment, there are chances of multiple trains being present. Since the first sentence does mention that people gathered to look at trains, we can be sure that people are in close proximity to the trains. However, the second sentence suggests a gathering near a single train, which isn't explicitly stated in the original sentence. There is a possibility that people have gathered near one specific train to look at the other trains around it, but we cannot be certain based on the information provided.

We have: 168 * n - 6020 = -453 * n + 19 * n First, we need to combine the terms with \\"n\\" on the right side of the equation. So: -453 * n + 19 * n = (-453 + 19) * n = -434 * n Now, our equation looks like this: 168 * n - 6020 = -434 * n Now, we want to get all the \\"n\\" terms on one side and numbers on the other side. To do that, let's add 434 * n to both sides: 168 * n + 434 * n = -434 * n + 434 * n - 6020 Now, add the \\"n\\" terms on the left side: (168 + 434) * n = -6020 602 * n = -6020 Now, to find the value of \\"n\\", we need to divide both sides of the equation by 602: 602 * n / 602 = -6020 / 602 n = -10 So, the value of \\"n\\" in this equation is -10."},{"instruction":"Question: There are three times as many misses as hits in an MLB game. If the number of misses is 50, how many hits and misses are made in the game? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's analyze the given information: There are three times as many misses as hits in the MLB game, and the number of misses is 50. Let M be the number of misses and H be the number of hits. From the given information, we can write the following equation: M = 3H Since we know the number of misses (M) is 50, we can substitute that value into the equation: 50 = 3H Now, we can solve for the number of hits (H) in the game: H = 50 / 3 However, it is not possible for there to be a fraction of a hit in a game. Hence, we can round up or down to get a whole number, but this will not give us an exact relationship. In this case, we can consider the closest whole numbers, keeping in mind there are three times as many misses as hits. If H = 16, then M = 3 × 16 = 48, which is close to 50 but not exact. Again, real-world baseball games don't follow such specific relationships, so we can only provide a close approximation. With the given information, the game would have approximately 16 hits and 48 misses, totaling 64 hits and misses combined."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Forty countries sent representatives to Belgrade for the Saturday (April 18th) event, including Kenya, whose runners dominated the race.\\" to Turkish?","output":"Kırk ülke, Cumartesi (18 Nisan) etkinliği için Belgrad'a temsilciler gönderdi, aralarında yarışı galip gelen koşucularıyla Kenya da bulunuyordu."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you get an English sentence and a corresponding Spanish translation of the English sentence.

Problem is, \\"everything at a restaurant is 10 times more decadent than what you make at home,\\" says Adam Roberts, author of Secrets of The Best Chefs. So even the healthy-seeming fare can pack surprisingly high calorie counts. But that doesn't mean you have to eat at home every night (as if!). We grilled chefs and dietitians about the trends and dishes that can doom your stay-slim efforts. Commit these simple tips to memory and you'll never again fear a restaurant meal. 1. Don't OD on olive oil You feel oh-so-virtuous dipping your bread in olive oil, but dunking can be a waistline wrecker. \\"It's still all fat and it's calorie dense, and bread soaks it up like a sponge,\\" says Wendy Bazilian, author of The SuperFoods Rx Diet. Dip and devour two slices and you'll be at around 380 calories, or 75 percent to 90 percent of what most women should have for the whole meal. Butter is easier to keep track of (a thumbnail-size pat is about 45 calories), but it contains saturated fat. Solution: Go with heart-healthy extra-virgin olive oil, but add balsamic vinegar to cut fat and calories and boost flavor, says Keri Gans, a registered dietitian and author of The Small Change Diet. Drizzle it on with a fork. 2. Beware 'small' plates When tapas made their way to the States, they became super-sized—and, often, super-fried: An order of patatas bravas (fried potatoes with spicy mayo) weighs in at around 500 calories. Even lighter-seeming pesto shrimp and avocado crostini can run 640 calories per order. \\"Plus, with tapas, most people don't feel full because they're not sitting down to an actual meal,\\" Gans says. \\"Psychologically, they don't fill you up as much.\\" Ditto the little plates at Mediterranean or Korean restaurants. They're all calorie bombs. Solution: Look for the word grilled. And when ordering two appetizers instead of an entrée, make sure one is protein and one is veggies, so you feel satisfied and don't splurge on a third (less wholesome) mini dish. __________________________________________________ More From Health.com: 25 Diet-Busting Foods You Should Never Eat What Health Pros Order at Restaurants 27 Mistakes Healthy People Make 3. Don't trust the chef You care about calories. We care about calories. That chef in the kitchen? Not so much. \\"When I'm developing a menu, I think about what tastes good,\\" says Missy Robbins, executive chef at A Voce restaurants in New York City. That's not to say she and other chefs use only high-cal, flavor-adding ingredients like cream and butter—they also use broths and herbs. But \\"the default method to make food taste better is to add more fat and salt,\\" Roberts says. Solution: Before ordering, ask, \\"Is there cream or butter in this dish?\\" Don't trust the menu description, because it rarely mentions the full prep. 4. Ask for plain veggies Steamed veggies will never be a total disaster. (You're getting fiber and antioxidants, after all!) Still, top chefs often finish them in a sauté pan with a slick of butter or oil to amp up flavor, says chef Jonathan Rollo of Greenleaf Gourmet Chopshop, in Beverly Hills. The latest craze with veggies and salads is to toss them with bacon or bacon drippings... without mentioning it on the menu. Solution: Order everything using the code word for un-fooled-around-with: dry. That way you can control your calorie count. And keep in mind that vegetables with a soft interior—eggplant and mushrooms—absorb more fat than root vegetables like sweet potatoes and parsnips. 5. Don't fall for looks Gorgeously plated meals may look fabulous, but they can make you underestimate how much food is in front of you. A large serving suddenly looks teensy on a huge platter or piled up high. Starters like that Tex-Mex guilt trip known as Seven-Layer Bean Dip or desserts such as cobbler served in a Mason jar make it hard to figure out how much you're actually eating. Solution: Do a proper-portion check. Lean protein should be no bigger than your smartphone; a serving of carbs should be the size of your fist, much smaller than the average pasta entrée. \\"Even if it doesn't say so on the menu, most restaurants will do any pasta entrée as an appetizer,\\" Robbins says. 6. Say yes to steak Red meat tends to get a bad rap, but when you order a lean cut, such as a filet or sirloin, it contains about the same calories as oily fish like tuna and salmon—especially when you consider portion size. \\"A lot of times, you'll be served an 8-ounce portion of salmon and a 5-ounce portion of beef,\\" says Jackie Newgent, registered dietitian and author of 1,000 Low-Calorie Recipes. \\"Calorie-wise, the beef is better.\\" Of course, the whole equation changes when either is served with even a little butter, oil, or sauce. Solution: Ask the waiter to serve yours without. Better yet, request a side order of grilled lemon or lime for extra flavor. 7. Watch the salad You know, of course, that cobb and Caesar salads can be fat traps. But mixed green salads can also do damage. One with goat cheese, pears, and candied walnuts, for instance, can set you back 500 calories. Solution: Do as Victoria Beckham used to do when she dined at hotspot Angelini Osteria in Los Angeles: custom-create. \\"She would suggest her own salad and order it with dressing on the side,\\" says Ori Menashe, the restaurant's former chef and the current chef-owner of Bestia in Los Angeles. He and other chefs say you don't have to be an A-lister to make special orders—especially if you're just trying to have a healthier meal out. This story originally appeared on Health.com. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article highlights seven common mistakes that people make while dining out, which can negatively impact their healthy eating efforts. Here are the most important parts of the article: 1. Don't overdo olive oil: Despite being a healthier alternative to butter, dipping bread in olive oil can still add up calories. Mixing it with balsamic vinegar can cut fat and calories. 2. Beware of 'small' plates: Tapas and other small plates can often have misleading calorie counts. Look for grilled dishes and balance protein with vegetables. 3. Don't trust the chef: Chefs might prioritize taste over calorie count, so it's essential to ask about ingredients, particularly cream and butter, in a dish. 4. Order plain vegetables: Asking for \\"dry\\" vegetables ensures they aren't cooked in extra butter or oil. Opt for root vegetables like sweet potatoes and parsnips that absorb less fat. 5. Be mindful of portions: visually appealing presentations can deceive portion sizes. Gauge proper portion sizes and consider ordering pasta dishes as appetizers. 6. Choose lean cuts of red meat: Lean cuts of beef, such as filet or sirloin, can have similar calorie counts to oily fish like tuna and salmon when considering portion size. 7. Watch the salad: Customizing your salad and ordering dressing on the side can help avoid the hidden calorie traps in pre-set mixed salads."},{"instruction":"Trivia question: What is the title of the comic opera by Edward German set in the court of Queen Elizabeth I?

In this story, Benjamin moved the watermelon after Isabella left the room, which means Isabella did not witness the watermelon being moved. Therefore, the scenario resembles scenario 3: an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. The question is: Where does Benjamin think that Isabella searches for the watermelon?

He was a Republican member of the House of Representatives from California's 52nd, 45th and 42nd districts from 1981 to 2009. Hunter was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during the 108th and 109th Congress. Hunter sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States for 2008, but his campaign failed to attract significant voters or delegates in early primary and caucus states, and he dropped out after the Nevada Republican caucuses. Context: In 1980, Hunter was recruited to run for Congress in what was then the 42nd District against 18-year incumbent Democrat Lionel Van Deerlin. Hunter was initially an underdog in a district where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 2 to 1. However, his attacks on Van Deerlin's record on national defense gained traction in a district dominated by military bases and personnel. Van Deerlin did not respond quickly enough, and Hunter narrowly defeated him. He was one of many Republicans swept into office from historically Democratic districts as a result of the \\"Reagan revolution\\"; Van Deerlin had been the district's only congressman since its creation in 1963. After the 1980 census, many of the more Democratic areas were cut out of Hunter's district, and he was reelected 13 more times with no substantive opposition. His district was renumbered as the 45th District in 1983 and the 52nd in 1993. In the 2006 general election, he defeated Navy veteran/minister John Rinaldi, a Democrat, and Michael Benoit, a Libertarian. Hunter was re-elected with 65 percent of the vote, a 33-point margin over Rinaldi. On March 20, 2007, Hunter announced that, as part of his presidential bid, he would not seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 2008. After his son, Duncan D. Hunter, announced his candidacy for his father's seat, the younger Hunter was recalled by the United States Marine Corps to serve in the Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan. During Duncan D. Hunter's active service, his wife, Margaret Hunter, campaigned on his behalf. On June 3, 2008 Duncan D. Hunter won 72% of the Republican Primary vote and became the Republican nominee to replace his father representing the 52nd District. Question: Had he ever lose a contest?. Whats the answer?","output":"Duncan Lee Hunter never lost a congressional election during his time in the House of Representatives, as described in the background information provided. After being elected in 1980, he served a total of 14 consecutive terms, with his district being renumbered twice. He won re-elections with little to no substantive opposition. However, he did lose a contest when he sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States in 2008. His presidential campaign failed to gain significant support from voters or delegates in early primary and caucus states. As a result, he dropped out of the race after the Nevada Republican caucuses. Despite his loss in the presidential race, his political career in Congress was notably stable and successful. After deciding not to seek re-election in 2008, his son, Duncan D. Hunter, ran for and won his father's seat to represent California's 52nd District in the House of Representatives."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: A text is given in Marathi.
