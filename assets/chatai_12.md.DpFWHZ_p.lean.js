Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the nickname given to the largest of the four sister ships that completed a record eastbound crossing?  With government subsidies promised, initially at 385,000 a year, and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the Collins Line. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for Harper's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly: \\"If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the...

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This movie had potential and I was willing to give it a try but there are so many timeline problems that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow being treated like such an idiot. Rise to Power is set in the late sixties. Carlito's Way is set in the mid to late seventies. For this movie to be realistic, it would have to be set in the fifties, if not the late forties. Rise to Power has no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no sign of Kleinfeld, no sign of Rolando that Carlito supposedly ran with in his \\"hey-day\\". None of the primary characters in the original film were in this movie. We're supposed to believe that Carlito met all these people in the span of a few years. Rise to Power ends with Carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film. Also, the pre-quel creates the Rocco and Earl characters - what's supposed to happen with them since they are clearly not in Carlito's Way? It's also hard to understand how Carlito could have the relationship with the Italians he has in the original film watching the events of Rise to Power. Where are the Taglialucci's in this film? There is probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison. It's like trying to put a square plug into a round hole. It is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks by making an average gangster film and throwing a character called Carlito Brigante into the story. The film had some good moments but I think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to Carlito's Way. If you feel determined to see this movie, the only advice I can give is to not think of the movie as a linear pre-quel. Think of it like the spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood's man with no name, in other words two movies that have the same character but aren't necessarily connected with each other.

In Springberry, Alabama, 1946, young Dewey Cox accidentally cuts his brother Nate in half with a machete. The trauma causes Dewey to lose his sense of smell. Dewey meets a blues guitarist, who discovers Dewey is a natural musician. In 1953, after a successful talent show performance, 14-year-old Dewey leaves Springberry with his 12-year-old girlfriend Edith; they soon marry and have a baby. Working at an all-African American nightclub, Dewey replaces singer Bobby Shad onstage and impresses Hasidic Jewish record executive L'Chaim. While recording a rockabilly rendition of \\"That's Amore,\\" Dewey is berated by an executive. A desperate Dewey performs \\"Walk Hard,\\" a song inspired by a speech he gave Edith, which restores the executive's belief in Judaism and rockets Dewey to superstardom. The song becomes a hit within 35 minutes, and Dewey becomes caught up in the rock-and-roll lifestyle. Dewey is introduced to marijuana by his drummer Sam, and becomes unfaithful to Edith. Dewey's father informs him that his mother has died while dancing to Dewey's song, and blames Dewey's music for her death. Distraught, Dewey finds Sam using cocaine and partakes, resulting in a cocaine-fueled punk rock performance. Choirgirl Darlene Madison enters Dewey's life, and he produces several hit records amid their courtship laden with sexual tension. He weds Darlene while still married to Edith, which leads to both women leaving him, and purchases drugs from an undercover cop. After he serves time in prison and in rehab, Darlene returns.

How do you do this: I can't remember what the name is but is there a plant that smells like pineapples?","output":"Yes, there is indeed a plant that smells like pineapples, it's called the Pineapple Sage (Salvia elegans). This is a sub-tropical plant native to Mexico and Guatemala. The name pineapple sage comes from the fact that its bright green leaves emit a fragrance that closely resembles that of pineapples when lightly touched or bruised.  Here's a bit more about the plant: Appearance: Pineapple sage is a perennial plant, meaning it can live for more than two years. It commonly grows up to 4 feet tall and spreads to about 3 feet wide. It has vibrant green, lance-shaped leaves that are about 3 to 4 inches long. From late summer through autumn, it develops scarlet colored hummingbird-attracting flowers which grow in whorls on slender, terminal spikes. Each individual tubular flower is about 1 inch long. Growing Conditions: This plant is known for its hardiness and can be grown in a variety of climates, however, it thrives best in hardiness zones 8 to 11. It typically prefers full sun exposure but can tolerate partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil with average fertility. Cultivation: Pineapple sage grows best in a rich, loamy soil that is well-drained. It requires ample water, especially during the growing season but is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The plant can be propagated with cuttings or by division. It's generally free from serious insect and disease problems and is easy to cultivate, making it a popular choice for beginner gardeners. Uses: Pineapple sage is often used in landscaping. Its bright red flowers add a pop of color to garden borders and beds. It is also popular in kitchen gardens due to its sweet pineapple-scented leaves that can be used in a variety of culinary applications including fruit salads, drinks, jellies, and garnishes. Some people even use it to make a soothing herbal tea.  In Summary, the pineapple sage is the plant you're referring to. It's a hardy plant that brings both visual appeal to gardens and also offers culinary benefits.

Eric, being an experienced optometrist, was trained to handle various procedures related to the eyes, including inserting contact lenses, diagnosing eye diseases, and providing appropriate treatments for patients with vision problems. His steady hands, exceptional knowledge of the eye's anatomy, and understanding of proper hygiene allowed him to perform such tasks confidently and efficiently. Aaron, on the other hand, was an expert in a completely unrelated field. As a software developer, his skills revolved around coding, troubleshooting, and building complex algorithms for various applications. While he excelled in managing and maintaining software projects, his abilities did not extend towards handling medical procedures, especially those as delicate as inserting foreign objects into the eye. Furthermore, the two friends had differing levels of comfort when it came to touching their own eyes. Eric, being accustomed to the direct contact with the human eye, could put things in the eye without flinching, thanks to years of practice and desensitization. Aaron, while incredibly talented in his own domain, felt squeamish at the mere thought of touching his eyes, which made it difficult for him to perform any eye-related actions. It is important to consider personal preferences and limitations when comparing the abilities of two individuals. In this case, Eric's experience as an optometrist and his comfort level with handling eye-related tasks allowed him to put things in the eye easily, whereas Aaron, due to his lack of expertise in this area and a general discomfort for such actions, couldn't perform the same task. In conclusion, Eric could put things in the eye but not Aaron because their professional expertise and individual predispositions made them suitable for their respective fields and tasks, highlighting the importance of understanding the diverse skillsets and capabilities humans possess. The value of their individual strengths should not be underestimated simply because they cannot perform specific tasks outside their domains, as each of them contributes uniquely and significantly to their fields of expertise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paul and Audrey Safranek, a married couple in Omaha with financial problems, meet Dave and Carol Johnson, who have downsized. While the inventors advocate that downsizing is environmentally friendly through the reduction of waste, Dave argues that its benefits extend far beyond that and improve one's life through the increase in value of their money. Exploring the possibilities of downsizing, Paul and Audrey agree to undergo the process and move to Leisureland, New Mexico, one of the most popular communities for small individuals. After undergoing downsizing, Paul receives a call from Audrey, saying that she was unable to go through with the procedure and, by opting out at the last minute, will be leaving him. One year later, Paul finalizes the divorce with Audrey, and settles in to his new apartment (a downsizing of its own from the mansion he was to originally share with Audrey). Although Paul had anticipated a life of relative ease, the divorce left him without Audrey's share of their assets. In addition, Paul's share of the asset shrank further still due to divorce settlement negotiations.

Background: Parliament-Funkadelic (abbreviated as P-Funk) is an American funk music collective of rotating musicians headed by George Clinton, primarily consisting of the individual bands Parliament and Funkadelic, both active since the 1960s. Their distinctive funk style drew on psychedelic culture, outlandish fashion, science-fiction, and surreal humor; it would have an influential effect on subsequent funk, post-punk, hip-hop, and post-disco artists of the 1980s and 1990s, while their collective mythology would help pioneer Afrofuturism. The collective's origins date back to the doo-wop group the Parliaments, formed by Clinton in the late 1950s in Plainfield, New Jersey. Under the influence of late-1960s artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and Frank Zappa, Clinton later relocated to Detroit and began the sister groups Parliament and Funkadelic, with the former playing an eclectic and more commercial form of funk, and the latter incorporating more influence from psychedelic rock. Context: In the early 1980s George Clinton continued to record while battling with financial problems and well-publicized drug problems. The remaining members of Parliament-Funkadelic recorded the 1982 hit album Computer Games, which was released as a George Clinton solo album. Included on this release was the much-sampled #1 hit single \\"Atomic Dog\\". The following year, Clinton formed the P-Funk All Stars, who went on to record Urban Dancefloor Guerillas in 1983. The P-Funk All Stars included many of the same members as the late-1970s version of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective, and was so named because of various legal issues concerning use of the names Parliament and Funkadelic after 1980. The name P-Funk All Stars is still in use to the current day, and group has included a mix of former Parliament-Funkadelic members as well as guests and new musicians.  As the 1980s continued, P-Funk did not meet with great commercial success as the band continued to produce albums under the name of George Clinton as solo artist. P-Funk retired from touring from 1984 until 1989, except for extremely sporadic performances and TV appearances. It was at this time that Hip hop music began to extensively sample P-Funk music, so remnants of the music were still heard regularly, now among fans of Hip hop. By 1993, most of the Parliament and Funkadelic back catalog had been reissued. The same year saw the return of a reconstituted P-Funk All Stars, with the re-release of Urban Dancefloor Guerrillas under the title Hydraulic Funk, and a new hip hop influenced album Dope Dogs. In 1994, the group toured with the Lollapalooza festival and appeared in the film PCU.  The 1996 album T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M. (The Awesome Power of a Fully Operational Mothership), released under the name George Clinton & the P-Funk All Stars, served as a reunion album featuring contributions from the band's most noteworthy songwriters from the earlier eras, such as Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, and Junie Morrison. It would be ten years before another album would be released. In the intervening time, successive tours would slowly restore some of the broken ties between the original band members, together with an accumulation of new talent. On July 23, 1999, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, including noteworthy former members Bootsy and Catfish Collins and Bernie Worrell, performed on stage at Woodstock '99. The collective continued to tour sporadically in to the 2000s, with participation from some of the children and grandchildren of the original members. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are some interesting aspects about this article. One is that Parliament-Funkadelic has a unique music style that blends funk, psychedelic culture, science-fiction, and surreal humor, which greatly influenced various music genres like hip-hop, post-punk, and post-disco. Additionally, their collective mythology contributed to the development of Afrofuturism. Another interesting point is the way George Clinton managed to keep the P-Funk All Stars going despite his financial and drug-related issues. Also, how P-Funk's music continued to be popular and relevant through sampling in the hip-hop community during their inactive period. The reconstitution of the P-Funk All Stars in the 1990s, with a mix of old and new members, and their participation in events like Woodstock '99 and Lollapalooza festival also add to the fascinating story of this musical collective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The meats, such as hamburgs, chicken breast, and steaks have been undercooked. I have had better luck with broiling. Answer:","output":"The given review, with the title \\"George Foreman Grill Review,\\" describing the user's experience with the grill, would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. The review presents certain concerns and negative aspects of the grill that could influence my decision. Below, I will detail the reasons for my conclusion based on the given review. 1. Unsatisfactory cooking results: The reviewer mentions that their experience with the grill has not been particularly successful, as the meats they cooked - hamburgs, chicken breast, and steaks - have been undercooked. This suggests that the product may have difficulty cooking food thoroughly, which is its primary function, and it might not deliver the expected results. 2. Inefficient cooking method: The dissatisfaction with the grill's cooking capabilities leads the reviewer to compare it with broiling. They state that they have had better luck with broiling, implying that the grill may not be as effective or efficient as alternative cooking methods. This comparison strengthens the perception that the grill does not perform its function as it should, potentially leading to subpar results and disappointment. 3. Lack of positive aspects mentioned: While the review does not directly emphasize any positive aspects of the grill, it could be inferred that the reviewer did not find any significant advantages to using the product. This lack of praise for the grill, combined with the negative experiences they shared, increases the likelihood that the review would discourage potential buyers from making the purchase. 4. Trust in the reviewer's opinion: It should be noted that a single review does not necessarily represent the consensus of all users, and individual experiences may differ. Nevertheless, as a potential buyer, it is essential to take into account the experiences of others as they provide a deeper understanding of potential issues that may not be evident in product specifications or promotional materials. By considering multiple reviews that highlight similar issues, the confidence in the reviewer's opinion increases and may further influence my decision to avoid purchasing the product. In conclusion, the negative experiences shared by the reviewer, along with the expressed preference for alternative cooking methods and the lack of any notable positive aspects, decrease the chances of me buying the product. However, it is important to consider multiple reviews before making a final decision, as individual experiences may vary significantly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Animals make thousands of proteins--they're the main ingredients  in skin, hair, milk, and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good animals for making protein drugs.  Researchers have already made cows, sheep, and goats that pump out protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. \\"Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories.\\" says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland.  Lillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA--the code that tells cells how to make proteins--so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis.  The scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs.  These special chickens can pass on their drug-laying abilities to their chicks. So far, the Scottish researchers have kept five generations of drug-producing chickens. But the scientists need to improve these chickens. The chickens don't make enough drugs to treat people yet. Once the researchers perfect their technique, you might eventually take your medicine from chicken eggs. Question: What is the best title of the passage? Options: A: Animals and Protein Drugs.

I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

Although many sports lawyers also are registered as agents, the two may perform different functions, since a sports agent primarily is concerned with maximizing a player's brand and monetary gain.  In many states, agents are largely unregulated-even if they are required to register as an agent. Pick from: (a). In other states, sponsorships are eliminated for personal athletes. If you have decided to operate a sporting and athletic game, you must first achieve a qualifying goal.. (b). For example, many states require that athletes travel to and from work. Those delousing these jobs must have permission.. (c). This lack of regulation could increase the chance that the agent takes advantage of you. In contrast, attorneys are bound by the state bar's code of ethics and stringent professional responsibility rules.. (d). Many sports associations-such as the american society of sports attorneys-will specify which attorney to choose. Review the list of contests and companies you admire and which athletic court publishes the sports law.. Answer:","output":"(c). This lack of regulation could increase the chance that the agent takes advantage of you. In contrast, attorneys are bound by the state bar's code of ethics and stringent professional responsibility rules. Therefore, it is essential to determine if you need an attorney, who can provide legal services, or an agent, who can focus on maximizing your brand and revenue. Once you have decided which professional best suits your needs, the next step is to conduct thorough research to find the right individual for the job. When searching for a sports law attorney, consider the following steps: 1. Identify your specific legal needs: Begin by outlining your specific sports-related legal requirements. This could include contract negotiation, endorsement deals, dispute resolution, intellectual property rights, or issues related to doping, eligibility, and disciplinary actions. 2. Seek recommendations from trusted sources: Ask for referrals from friends, family, teammates, coaches, or other individuals involved in your sport who may have worked with a sports lawyer in the past. They can give you firsthand insights into their experiences and the quality of the attorney's services. 3. Research the attorney's credentials and experience: Look for attorneys with experience in sports law and a strong track record of representing clients in matters similar to your own. Consult online legal directories and the website of your state bar association to verify the attorney's licensure and any disciplinary records. 4. Evaluate their communication skills and responsiveness: An attorney's ability to effectively communicate and be available when needed is crucial to successfully handling your legal concerns. During initial consultations, pay attention to how well they listen and respond to your questions, as well as their willingness to discuss your case in-depth. 5. Discuss fees and billing structure: Before making your final decision, confirm the attorney's fee structure, including hourly rates, flat fees, or contingency fees. Get a written retainer agreement outlining the cost of services to avoid any misunderstandings or surprise charges later. 6. Check for reputable professional affiliations: Membership in respected organizations like the American Bar Association (ABA) or the Sports Lawyers Association (SLA) can indicate that the attorney is committed to staying current with industry trends and maintaining high ethical standards. 7. Trust your instincts: Finally, it's important to feel comfortable with the attorney you select. Trust your instincts and choose a professional with whom you can build a strong working relationship. Remember that you may be working closely with this individual for an extended period, and open communication and trust will be key to a successful partnership. By following these steps, you will be better equipped to find an experienced and competent sports law attorney who can effectively represent your interests and help you navigate the complex world of sports law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What happens when you take a shower after going for a run? Possible A: feeling refreshed, becoming tired, restlessness, leg cramps, sweating  Why is \\"feeling refreshed\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Feeling refreshed\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because taking a shower after a run helps to wash away sweat, cool the body down, and relax the muscles, leading to an overall sense of rejuvenation and cleanliness. It's a natural response for humans to feel refreshed after a shower, especially after physical activity like running, as the water and cleansing process not only provide physical benefits but also mental satisfaction. Other reasons why \\"feeling refreshed\\" makes sense are: 1. Improved circulation: During a shower, the combination of warm water and gentle water pressure can help stimulate blood flow, which can aid in reducing muscle stiffness and soreness after running. 2. Reduced inflammation: Warm or cold showers can help decrease inflammation in the muscles and joints, which is a common side effect of intense exercise, leading to a more refreshing and comfortable feeling after the shower. 3. Mental relaxation: Showers are known for their calming effect on the mind. The soothing sound of water and the sensation of being cleansed can help reduce stress and anxiety levels, complementing the endorphin release from exercise and contributing to a more refreshed state. 4. Enhanced hygiene: Running, especially outdoors, can expose the body to dirt, bacteria, and environmental elements. A shower immediately after running can effectively wash away these contaminants, leaving you feeling clean and refreshed. So, while the other possible answers may occur in specific situations or for specific individuals, \\"feeling refreshed\\" is the answer that most aligns with human common sense because it captures the typical reaction people have when taking a shower after engaging in physical activity like running."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Instead, the Speed Boosters was the earlier name of the teams that later became known as PLDT Home TVolution Power Attackers (women's) and the PLDT Home Telpad-Air Force Turbo Boosters (men's). The paragraph suggests that the teams owned by PLDT had undergone a name change, transitioning from PLDT myDSL Speed Boosters to their respective new team names.

Both of his parents, and several aunts and uncles, played the piano. From an early age Timmons studied music with an uncle, Robert Habershaw, who also taught McCoy Tyner. Timmons moved to New York in 1954. He played with Kenny Dorham in 1956, making his recording debut with the trumpeter in a live set in May of that year. He went on to play and record with Chet Baker in 1956-57 (bassist Scott LaFaro was part of this band for a time), Sonny Stitt in 1957, and Maynard Ferguson in 1957-58. He also recorded as a sideman with hornmen Curtis Fuller, Hank Mobley, and Lee Morgan, all for Blue Note Records in 1957.  Timmons became best known as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, including for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that \\"He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky - he could play a lot of things, and I thought it was the element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor.\\" By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959.  Timmons was also known as a composer during this period: The Encyclopedia of Jazz states that his compositions \\"Moanin'\\" (from the 1958 album of the same title), \\"This Here\\", and \\"Dat Dere\\" \\"helped generate the gospel-tinged 'soul jazz' style of [the] late '50s and early '60s.\\" The first was written when Timmons was first with Blakey; the others were composed when he was with Adderley. \\"This Here\\" (sometimes \\"Dis Here\\") was a surprise commercial success for Adderley: recorded in concert in 1959, it was released as part of The Cannonball Adderley Quintet in San Francisco album while the band was still on tour, and they discovered its popularity only when they arrived back in New York and found crowds outside the Village Gate, where they were due to play.  Timmons was reported to be dissatisfied with the money he had received from \\"This Here\\", and was enticed in February 1960 into leaving Adderley and returning to Blakey's band by the offer of more pay. Timmons then appeared on further well-known albums with the drummer, including A Night in Tunisia, The Freedom Rider and The Witch Doctor. His own recording debut as sole leader was This Here Is Bobby Timmons in 1960, which contained his first versions of his best-known compositions. In the same year, he played on recordings led by Nat Adderley, Arnett Cobb, and Johnny Griffin, among others; on the first of these, Work Song, Timmons did not appear on all of the tracks, because he had been drinking heavily.

He was the Ambassador to 1975, but back home in 1898, in New Jerusalem, Utah, they all thought he was Ambassador to France. When he disappeared, Mama and I came back through the triple-bolted door that led from our apt in 1975 to our horsebarn in 1898. We returned to the dusty streets of New Jerusalem, and I had to keep on reminding myself that I was supposed to have been in France, and 'polly-voo' for my chums, and tell whoppers about the Eiffel Tower and the fancy bread and the snails and frogs we'd eaten. I was born in New Jerusalem, and raised there till I was ten. Then, one summer's day, my Pa sat me on his knee and told me we'd be going away for a while, that he had a new job. 'But what about the store?' I said, scandalised. My Pa's wonderful store, the only General Store in town not run by the Saints, was my second home. I'd spent my whole life crawling and then walking on the dusty wooden floors, checking stock and unpacking crates with waybills from exotic places like Salt Lake City and even San Francisco.

He'd blown into town on the weekly Zephyr Speedball, and skinny Tommy Benson had hauled his three huge steamer trunks to the cowboy hotel. He'd tipped Tommy two dollars, in Wells-Fargo notes, and later, in the empty lot behind the smithy, all the kids in New Jerusalem had gathered 'round Tommy to goggle at the small fortune in queer, never-seen bills.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

They both touch upon happiness and its role and significance in life, but they tackle the subject from different perspectives and intend to seek out different kinds of information. The first question, \\"What is the main thing to get happy in life?\\" asks for potential factors or elements that might contribute to happiness in life. These can be tangible things, such as financial stability, or less concrete constructs, like love, friendship, or meaningful work. The focus is on the causes of happiness and the variables that might impact it. For example, someone may point to a loving family as their main source of happiness in life, while another person might place career fulfillment or life purpose at the top of their list.  The second question, \\"Is being happy the biggest thing in life?\\" is more philosophical and subjective. This question seems to ask if the ultimate goal or principle measure of a successful or worthwhile life is happiness. It invites contemplation about the role of happiness in the broader context of life's purpose and goals. Some people might argue that while happiness is important, it is not the ultimate goal or 'biggest thing' in life, proposing instead that things like personal growth, accomplishment, or contributing to the betterment of society are more important.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.  Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air - Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming - This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle - The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun - It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans - Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere - The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains - This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose planting more trees happens, how will it affect LESS bad effects of pollution.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Planting more trees can have a significant positive effect on reducing the negative impacts of pollution. This perturbation influences the process described in several ways, both directly and indirectly. 1. Carbon sequestration: Trees absorb carbon dioxide and store it in their biomass (trunks, branches, roots, and leaves) as they grow. This process is called carbon sequestration. By removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, trees help reduce the greenhouse gas effect and mitigate global warming. This addresses the concern about the increased levels of carbon dioxide released into the air and its subsequent impact on the Earth's temperature. 2. Air quality improvement: In addition to absorbing carbon dioxide, trees also absorb a variety of other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. These pollutants are trapped and absorbed by the tree's leaves, which then helps improve air quality. This can lead to a reduction in the harmful gases that contribute to the formation of acid rain. 3. Ozone layer protection: While trees do not directly address the depletion of the ozone layer caused by methane gas and CFCs, increasing the number of trees can have some indirect effects. For example, forests can help reduce the need for air conditioning by providing shade and having a cooling effect on surrounding areas. This reduces the energy consumption of buildings, which in turn lowers the emissions from power generation that contribute to air pollution that can harm the ozone layer. 4. Habitat support: Planting more trees helps restore and expand natural habitats for various species, including those that are sensitive to air pollution, such as certain insects, birds, and mammals. As a result, ecosystems can become more resilient to the effects of pollution. 5. Soil protection and water quality: In the context of acid rain, trees help protect soil and water quality. Tree roots hold soil together, preventing soil erosion caused by acidic precipitation. Moreover, the increased vegetation can act as a natural buffer that helps neutralize acidic water, thereby minimizing the harmful effects of acid rain on aquatic ecosystems. In conclusion, planting more trees has multiple direct and indirect effects on the processes related to air pollution. Increasing tree coverage helps to address the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, improve air quality, reduce the need for air conditioning, support habitat conservation, and protect soil and water from the damages of acid rain. While it may not have a direct impact on repairing the ozone layer, the collective benefits of planting more trees can contribute to a healthier environment and a reduction in the harmful effects of pollution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mr Grainger was shot through the windscreen of a stolen Audi in a car park. He had been under surveillance as part of Operation Shire, set up to target an organised crime gang believed to be conspiring to commit armed robberies. The firearms officer was giving evidence at Liverpool Crown Court from behind a curtain to protect his anonymity. He said when he took aim at the parked car and shouted \\"armed police show me your hands\\" at the occupants of the Audi, two people in the front of the vehicle, Mr Grainger and David Totton, put their hands up. Q9 said Mr Grainger then lowered his right hand in a \\"sudden and deliberate movement\\". The officer told the inquiry he was \\"sure to the point of certainty\\" at that moment in time he had a firearm and believed he had no other option but to shoot Mr Grainger. Jason Beer QC, prosecuting, asked him why he did not wait to see what was in Mr Grainger's hand, to which he replied: \\"That would have put the oncoming team in extreme danger of being fired upon.\\" The inquiry heard Q9 did not make a detailed statement until six days after the shooting when all officers were taken to the same room containing a flip chart with details of the operation.

Your body starts to fight the illness. Thats why you want to eat right and get plenty of sleep. You need a strong immune system to fight off illness. Plants dont have an immune system. That does not mean they do not get sick. Plants are affected by disease just like us. Typically, their first line of defense is the death of part of the plant. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants also produce special chemicals to fight disease. For example, willow trees produce a chemical to kill the bacteria. The same compound is used in many acne products. You can see a picture of a willow tree in Figure Plants may be smarter than we think. No, they cannot talk to each other. They may be able to send messages, though.  Do you have any questions?","output":"It's interesting to learn how plants protect themselves against diseases and communicate with each other. Just as humans have evolved with immune systems, plants have also developed various methods and mechanisms to combat diseases and pests. To elaborate further, here are some additional strategies that plants use to defend themselves: 1. Physical Barriers: Plant cells are equipped with a rigid cell wall that serves as a barrier against invasion by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The outer layer, known as the cuticle, also provides a shield against pest attacks and disease-causing pathogens. 2. Chemical Defenses: Plants produce a variety of chemical compounds to deter would-be attackers. These chemicals can be toxic, repellent, or antinutritive for pests and pathogens. Some examples of these compounds are alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenols. In some cases, plants release these chemicals as a response to an attack, while in others, they may continuously produce these protective substances. 3. Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR): This is a process where plants \\"immunize\\" themselves against future attacks by activating a variety of defense mechanisms. When a plant is infected, it produces signaling molecules called salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene that activate defense genes throughout the plant, thus making it more resistant to further attacks. 4. Mechanical Defenses: Some plants have physical adaptations like thorns, spines, or hairs that deter herbivores from consuming them. These mechanical defenses can also provide a level of protection against disease, as they create a barrier for the pathogens to penetrate. 5. Indirect Defenses: Plants can also form relationships with other organisms, such as ants, to help protect them from herbivores. These ants feed on the nectar that plants produce and, in return, they patrol the plant and attack any herbivores that may be causing damage. 6. RNA Silencing: This is a molecular defense mechanism employed by plants to combat viruses. When a virus invades a plant cell, it produces double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is a viral replication intermediate. The plant detects this dsRNA and breaks it into small pieces that subsequently guide the cell's defense machinery to degrade the virus's genetic material, effectively stopping its replication. In the context of plant communication, while they indeed do not have the capability to \\"talk\\" like humans, they can send chemical signals. These signals can be transported through the air as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or through the soil and roots via chemical compounds known as 'infochemicals.' These forms of communication can alert neighboring plants about an impending attack, stimulate growth, or even attract natural predators of their pests.

She was known for her distinctive half-shaved hairstyle, signature mole above the lip, and her calm and poised demeanor which allowed her to stand out among the other contestants. Throughout the season, her performances were consistently praised, receiving three first call-outs from the judges. The final episode saw Naima competing against Kahlen Rondot in a showdown staged in South Africa, where they performed various tasks, including participating in a photoshoot for CoverGirl cosmetics and walking the runway for a local designer. Ultimately, Naima Mora was declared the winner on account of her overall performance and her determination to succeed in the modeling world. After winning America's Next Top Model Cycle 4, Naima’s career took off as she signed a contract with Ford Models, appeared in various magazines, including Elle and Teen Vogue, walked the runway for notable designers, and participated in advertising campaigns for major brands.

Eleanora Fagan (April 7, 1915 - July 17, 1959), better known as Billie Holiday, was an American jazz musician and singer-songwriter with a career spanning nearly thirty years. Nicknamed \\"Lady Day\\" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills, which made up for her limited range and lack of formal music education. As a young teenager, Holiday started singing in nightclubs in Harlem. She took her professional pseudonym from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and the musician Clarence Holiday, her probable father. At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \\"Halliday\\", the birth surname of her father, but eventually changed it to \\"Holiday\\", his performing name. The young singer teamed up with a neighbor, the tenor saxophone player Kenneth Hollan. From 1929 to 1931, they were a team, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, Pod's and Jerry's on 133rd Street, and the Brooklyn Elks' Club. Benny Goodman recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at the Bright Spot. As her reputation grew, she played in many clubs, including Mexico's and the Alhambra Bar and Grill, where she met Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with Chick Webb. It was also during this period that she connected with her father, who was playing in Fletcher Henderson's band.  Late in 1932, at the age of 17, Holiday replaced the singer Monette Moore at Covan's, a club on West 132nd Street. The producer John Hammond, who loved Moore's singing and had come to hear her, first heard Holiday there in early 1933. Hammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut, at age 18, in November 1933, with Benny Goodman. She recorded two songs: \\"Your Mother's Son-in-Law\\" and \\"Riffin' the Scotch\\", the latter being her first hit. \\"Son-in-Law\\" sold 300 copies, but \\"Riffin' the Scotch\\", released on November 11, sold 5,000 copies. Hammond was impressed by Holiday's singing style and said of her, \\"Her singing almost changed my music tastes and my musical life, because she was the first girl singer I'd come across who actually sang like an improvising jazz genius.\\" Hammond compared Holiday favorably to Armstrong and said she had a good sense of lyric content at her young age.  In 1935, Holiday had a small role as a woman abused by her lover in Duke Ellington's short Symphony in Black: A Rhapsody of Negro Life. In her scene, she sang \\"Saddest Tale\\".","output":"This text is about Eleanora Fagan, better known as Billie Holiday, an American jazz musician and singer-songwriter with a career spanning nearly thirty years."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Moores wrote for Drowned in Sound that \\"Somebody considers unleashing a guitar solo, yet its notes are few and the vocals kick back in before it has the chance to go anywhere. Is it a solo or a riff? Whatever it is, it flicks its middle finger at other solos and riffs, exposing them as absurd, flamboyant, shallow fripperies.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who Winston Churchill bought Chartwell from a family member?  Chartwell is a country house near the town of Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy.

The premise focuses on a specific scenario in which two children are engaging in an action (shaking hands) within a particular context (a crowded area). When individuals shake hands, it involves extending their hands towards one another, grasping the other person's hand, and moving their hands up and down in a rhythmic motion. The physical act of shaking hands inherently implies that hand movement is occurring. In contrast, the hypothesis simply states that \\"the children are moving their hands.\\" It does not provide any detail about why, how, or in what context the children are moving their hands. However, based on the premise, which includes the situation of two children shaking hands, it is clear that some form of hand movement is indeed taking place since it is an integral aspect of the handshaking process. Thus, the premise does indeed tell us that the hypothesis is true. The act of shaking hands, as described in the premise, confirms that the children are moving their hands as stated in the hypothesis. However, it is essential to take into account that the premise is specific to a particular scenario where the children are shaking hands in a crowded area, while the hypothesis does not specify any contextual details about the hand movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Fairborn mayor Dan Kirkpatrick has confirmed a major reason for Wright State withdrawing from the debate was security concerns around Wright State being an open campus. HASAN ABDUL-KARIM/STAFF      Fairborn mayor Dan Kirkpatrick has confirmed a major reason for Wright State withdrawing from the debate was security concerns around Wright State being an open campus. HASAN ABDUL-KARIM/STAFF      By Lynn Hulsey      Staff Writer      Wright State President David Hopkins announced Tuesday the university has withdrawn from hosting the first presidential debate in September.      WSU cited rising costs and lackluster fundraising      Costs rose well over 8 million      University informed Commission on Presidential Debates at noon      WSU in an internal remediation to overcome budget deficit      RELATED: Wright State cancels presidential debate: 5 things to know      UPDATE @ 2:32 p.m.      Hofstra University has offered to allow 15 Wright State students to attend the first presidential debate at the Hempstead, N.Y., campus, which replaces WSU as host of the debate, according to Wright State President David Hopkins.      “What a very generous offer. I really, really appreciate that,” Hopkins said a day after announcing that Wright State was withdrawing as host of the debate.      Hopkins said Wednesday that university donors will be asked to cover the costs for the students, who will be chosen by lottery.      Hopkins on Tuesday announced that he had told the Commission on Presidential Debates that Wright State could no longer serve as host of the Sept. 26 debate, the first of four in the general election.      Hopkins cited rising security costs that were driving estimated costs up from the 5 million he anticipated to as much as 11 million. He said the university had not been able to convince donors to contribute enough to cover the cost, and the financially strapped university could not afford to cover the cost of a debate.      UPDATE @11:47 a.m.      Fairborn mayor Dan Kirkpatrick has confirmed a major reason for Wright State withdrawing from the debate was security concerns around Wright State being an open campus.      He said officials were confident the Nutter Center could be secured through checkpoints, security guards and fence, but with all the students and community members on campus, it did not feel safe.      UPDATE @ 3:34 p.m.      The planned presidential debate at Wright State University had been expected to generate about 14 million in economic impact for the immediate area near the Nutter Center, a local official said.      “As we expanded it, obviously this impact was to ripple throughout the entire region with an estimated economic impact of approximately 25 million dollars,” said Paul Newman Jr., the Fairborn Chamber of Commerce executive director.      Newman said he believes it was a difficult decision for Wright State and David Hopkins, the university president.      However, Newman was surprised by the decision and had no warning the university was thinking about pulling out from hosting the event.      Wright State President Hopkins had repeatedly vowed he would not fund the debate through university reserves, which have plummeted from 162 million in 2012 to a projected 40 million by 2018 as school officials have spent more than they were taking in.      Wright State is cutting 18.9 million more from reserves over the next two years and planning 27.7 million in budget cuts, including 8 million through staff attrition. WSU trustees also raised tuition for graduate and out-of-state students.      TIMELINE: Wright State University and the presidential debate      UPDATE @ 2:58 p.m.      The president of Wright State’s faculty union, Martin Kich, said cancelling the debate was probably for the best.      “I think It’s unfortunate we’ve gotten two months away from it and we have to pull the plug on it. I don’t think that makes anyone look good. But if the alternative is we would be left with a sizeable financial liability because of this, then I think it’s the smart thing to do,” he said.      Kich said he felt the university was low-balling what the debate was actually going to cost.      “Under ideal circumstances, I think it would be a nice thing for the university to host this kind of an event, but given the financial issues the university is grappling with, from the start this seemed like a kind of dubious proposition.”      RELATED: No debate for Wright State — community reacts      UPDATE @ 2:45 p.m.      In a release Tuesday, the Wright State Board of Trustees Chair Michael Bridges said the board fully supports Hopkins’ decision.      “It’s the responsible thing to do,” Bridges said in a release. “While the community has been overwhelmingly supportive of Wright State hosting the debate, the safety and security of the campus and community is of paramount importance.”      Unlike private universities that have hosted debates in the past, Wright State cannot restrict public access to its campus, which added to the security challenges, the university said.      “We were fully aware of the challenges and were prepared to meet them when we decided to host the debate, but things have changed,” Hopkins said. “The current national environment has made security even more critical.”      UPDATE @ 2:23 p.m.      The Commission on Presidential Debates posted this announcement on its website:      “In light of Wright State University’s announcement of earlier today, the September 26, 2016 Presidential Debate will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY. The Commission very much appreciates Wright State’s efforts. Hofstra University served very successfully as a presidential debate site in 2012. On September 23, 2015, the Commission announced that Hofstra University had agreed to serve as an alternate site this debate cycle if needed. The Commission looks forward to working with Hofstra once again.”      2 million in gifts and pledges will be utilized for student and debate related activities. @daytondailynews@WHIORadio — Kara Driscoll (@karadriscollcox) July 19, 2016      UPDATE @ 2:13 p.m.      “We’re not going to shut down the educational institution,” Hopkins said.      Wright State was one of four host universities chosen this year by the the commission, a non-profit in charge of producing the General Election debates.      Earlier this month, officials said the debate was expensive, but worth it.      DOWNLOAD OUR MOBILE APPS FOR LATEST BREAKING NEWS      UPDATE @ 2:09 p.m.      Greene County Sheriff Gene Fischer said he had not spoken with anyone at Wright State University on Tuesday. He had sent some people from his office to Cleveland for the Republican National Convention to check out the security layout on Monday.      “I’m convinced we could have had enough manpower, where’s the money coming from I wouldn’t have any idea,” he said. “We would’ve been able to get the manpower, but fundraising is always an issue.”      Fischer said he didn’t remember exactly how many law enforcement personnel would have been needed to cover the event.      “With everything going on, every time something happens, the number has to get bigger because you never know what to anticipate,” he said      UPDATE @ 2:01 p.m.      “I really wanted this experience for our students,” Hopkins said in a news conference.      The escalating security concerns have caused the financial costs to rise too much, Hopkins said.      The university was expecting to pay about 3.5 million when planning first started, but now it’s exceeded 8 million, he said.      Hopkins said with the nature surrounding this presidential election, the costs were too high.      “We went into this in good faith,” Hopkins said.      Hopkins talks about safety. pic.twitter.com/64yKmAyNZt — Kara Driscoll (@karadriscollcox) July 19, 2016      EARLIER REPORT      WSU President David Hopkins said Tuesday that Wright State is withdrawing as host of first presidential debate scheduled for Sept. 26 at Nutter Center.      He cited escalating costs for security and the inability to raise enough money from community and state to cover what could be as much as 8 million to host the event.      Hopkins said Tuesday in an exclusive interview that he was motivated in part by security concerns raised by the recent attack in Nice, France.      “I can’t assure the safety of our students and the community,” Hopkins said.      Hopkins informed the Commission on Presidential Debates at noon today, and hopes to recoup at least some of the 2 million fee that was paid to the Commission in advance. Approximately 500,000 had been spent already on Nutter Center upgrades.      University will lose some of the 2.5 million they've invested in hosting the debate. — Kara Driscoll (@karadriscollcox) July 19, 2016      The university has raised about 3.5 million in contributions, state funding and in-kind pledges.      The university is in an internal remediation plan to overcome its budget deficit, and that also played a role in the decision, Hopkins said.      “I can’t dip into more reserves to do this debate,” Hopkins said. “I’m not going to do this when we’re in remediation.”      Hopkins said his board of trustees has been supportive and understands the concerns about of spiraling costs and safety.      “I wanted it so much for our students,” Hopkins said. “I hate this decision. It hurts my heart.” ||||| Cleveland (CNN) Wright State University is pulling out of its presidential debate scheduled for September 26, and the debate will move to Hofstra University, sources confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.      Wright State University President David Hopkins told the Dayton Daily News, which first reported the story , that the university decided to pull out of the debate due to rising security concerns and costs.      He said insufficient fundraising forced the university to pull out of the debate, which could have cost the university as much as 8 million, according to the Daily News.      Hofstra University, which hosted a presidential debate in 2012, will instead host the first debate between the general election candidates.

Help as much as you can. This article: From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies, writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: \\"you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.\\" Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including \\"Le lever du soleil sur le Nil\\" (\\"Sunrise over the Nile\\", 1898) and \\"Hymne à la paix\\" (\\"Hymn to Peace\\", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, \\"One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio.\\" He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who received his first musical education from his paternal grandfather?, using the article: Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. The Observer wryly commented, \\"of the..., what would be the answer ?

The band's name is a play on 1960s rock band Dick Dale and the Del-Tones. The Flecktones formed in 1988 when Bela Fleck was invited to perform on the PBS TV series The Lonesome Pine Specials. The original members were Fleck on banjo, Victor Wooten on bass guitar, his brother Roy Wooten on Drumitar, and Howard Levy on harmonica and keyboards. Context: Their debut album, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones (Warner Bros, 1989), received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Jazz Album, as did their second album, Flight of the Cosmic Hippo (Warner Bros., 1991), which also received a nomination for Best Instrumental Composition for the song \\"Blu-Blop\\". Their second album contained the Flecktones's version of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". Their next album had another cartoon cover and the palindromic title UFO TOFU (Warner Bros., 1992). The song \\"Bonnie & Slyde\\" had Fleck playing banjo atypically with a slide, an idea suggested to him by slide guitarist Bonnie Raitt.  UFO Tofu would be the last album the Flecktones recorded with their original lineup until Rocket Science in 2011. Howard Levy left the band in December 1992. While the departure of Levy was tough for the band, it was not unexpected. During their 1992 tour it became evident to the band that Levy was not happy with the rigors of touring and wanted to spend more time with his wife and children.  The remaining trio, consisting of Fleck and the Wooten brothers, recorded their fourth album, Three Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. \\"'Once we started rehearsing, everything was fine,' said Fleck. 'We started finding ways to sound good, and it was real exciting.'\\" Without Levy, the Flecktones as usual spent most of 1993 on the road and released Three Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in September of that year.  In July 1996 the Flecktones released their fifth album, and first live album, Live Art. Devoted fans who had been seeing the band for several years were clamoring for an album to capture the experience of live Flecktones, and this album fit the bill. The trio took home a Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1997 for the track \\"Sinister Minister\\". Question: What is the name of a record company that they were with?. Whats the answer?","output":"The record company that Bela Fleck and the Flecktones were with is Warner Bros. Records. Their debut album, \\"Bela Fleck and the Flecktones\\" (1989), as well as their subsequent albums \\"Flight of the Cosmic Hippo\\" (1991) and \\"UFO Tofu\\" (1992) were all released under Warner Bros.

Placing them on grass would be harmful to them and not in line with their natural habitat.  - Sewage Treatment Plant: Sewage treatment plants are primarily designed for the processing of wastewater and human waste, and not for accommodating live fish. It would be highly unusual and against common sense to transfer fish to a sewage treatment plant when other, better-suited options are available. - Reflecting Pool: While a reflecting pool is a body of water, it is typically a shallow, decorative feature found in gardens or around monuments. Reflecting pools are not specifically designed to serve as habitats for fish, and the conditions may not be suitable for their health and wellbeing. Choosing a fish tank would be a more sensible option, as such a tank is specifically designed to house fish. - Surface of Earth: The surface of Earth is quite a vague and general option.

Giving Women the Access Code TANDEM Bill Gates and Maria Klawe at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash., in 2005.Â CLAREMONT, Calif. — When Maria Klawe became president of Harvey Mudd College in 2006, she was dismayed — but not surprised — at how few women were majoring in computer science. A mathematician and computer scientist herself, she arrived at Harvey Mudd (the smallest of the five so-called Claremont Colleges) in the midst of a nationwide downturn for women in computer science. As recently as 1985, 37 percent of graduates in the field were women; by 2005 it was down to 22 percent, and sinking. And the situation at Mudd was even grimmer. Of the college’s 750 students, about a third were women (the figure is now closer to half), but for years the percentage of computer science graduates had been hovering around the single digits. How Dr. Klawe (pronounced KLAH-vay) and her faculty turned things around — this year, nearly 40 percent of Harvey Mudd’s computer science degrees will go to women — sheds light on a gender gap that elsewhere remains stubbornly resistant to changing times. Thanks in part to companies like Facebook, Yelp and Zynga and in part to cultural sensations like the movie “The Social Network,” coders are hip and computer science is hot. Departments across the nation are brimming with students. But those students are overwhelmingly male. In 2010, just 18.2 percent of undergraduates in the field were women, according to the National Center for Education Statistics — in spite of gains in chemistry, biomechanical engineering and other so-called STEM fields (the acronym stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics). “It must be the unique area of science and technology where women have made negative progress,” said Nicholas Pippenger, a mathematics professor at Harvey Mudd, who is married to Dr. Klawe. Dr. Klawe and others say the underrepresentation of women in the field is detrimental in a larger sense. Computer science, they say, is as vital to propelling society forward in the digital era as mechanical engineering was in the industrial age. “If we’re not getting more women to be part of that, it’s just nuts,” Dr. Klawe said. At Mudd, she continued, “we’re graduating 20 female computer science majors a year, and every one of them is a gem.” In 2005, the year before Dr. Klawe arrived, a group of faculty members embarked on a full makeover of the introductory computer science course, a requirement at Mudd. Known as CS 5, the course focused on hard-core programming, appealing to a particular kind of student — young men, already seasoned programmers, who dominated the class. This only reinforced the women’s sense that computer science was for geeky know-it-alls. “Most of the female students were unwilling to go on in computer science because of the stereotypes they had grown up with,” said Zachary Dodds, a computer scientist at Mudd. “We realized we were helping perpetuate that by teaching such a standard course.” To reduce the intimidation factor, the course was divided into two sections — “gold,” for those with no prior experience, and “black” for everyone else. Java, a notoriously opaque programming language, was replaced by a more accessible language called Python. And the focus of the course changed to computational approaches to solving problems across science. “We realized that we needed to show students computer science is not all about programming,” said Ran Libeskind-Hadas, chairman of the department. “It has intellectual depth and connections to other disciplines.” Dr. Klawe supported the cause wholeheartedly, and provided money from the college for every female freshman to travel to the annual Grace Hopper conference, named after a pioneering programmer. The conference, where freshmen are surrounded by female role models, has inspired many a first-year “Mudder” to explore computer science more seriously. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Dr. Maria Klawe and her faculty at Harvey Mudd College increased the number of women majoring in computer science by making changes to the introductory computer science course and providing support for female students to attend the annual Grace Hopper conference, which celebrates women in technology. This approach improved the course's appeal to female students and created a more supportive environment for them to learn and engage in the field."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Babes in Toyland Context: Lisa Piper (Drew Barrymore), an eleven-year-old girl from Cincinnati, Ohio, takes care of her siblings and cooks for her family. She has no time for toys, and refuses to be treated as a child. During a blizzard on Christmas Eve, Lisa is transported to Toyland. She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress. Barnaby reveals that he had been creating an army of trolls to take over Toyland, and then attempts to corrupt his captives into being his servants with the contents of the flask, stating he would replace Trollog with Lisa and make Mary his Troll Princess. Lisa, however, proves to be immune to the evil, and manages to reverse the effects on her friends. After escaping from Barnaby's stronghold, they return to the Toymaster. When Barnaby unleashes his army of trolls upon Toyland, Lisa's newfound belief animates an army of life-sized toy soldiers that the Toymaster had created, and they drive Barnaby into the Forest of the Night. Barnaby, having lost control of his creatures and having failed at making Lisa his new Trollog, is then banished from Toyland. Jack and Mary are then married.

News article: Pakistan agrees to open supply lines after U.S. apology “We are sorry for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military,” she said. “We are committed to working closely with Pakistan and Afghanistan to prevent this from ever happening again.” Pakistan had refused to reopen the border absent an explicit apology from the United States. Although the State Department has long urged the use of what one official called ”the sorry word,” both the White House and the Pentagon had insisted that it was not merited because both countries were at fault in the deaths, which a U.S. military investigation said resulted from a skirmish in which the Pakistanis fired first at U.S. ground forces on the border. The U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John R. Allen, issued a statement similar to Clinton’s on Tuesday, calling the agreement “a demonstration of Pakistan’s desire to help secure a brighter future for both Afghanistan and the region at large.” Pakistan’s closure of the border resulted in an additional 100 million in transit costs each month as U.S. and NATO supplies and troops have used alternative routes through Central Asia. Those expenses were expected to increase exponentially as the United States begins a major troop drawdown in Afghanistan to be completed by the end of 2014. Pakistan’s cabinet was meeting Tuesday afternoon to discuss the issue, and Clinton’s statement was timed to its decision. The wording of the statement appeared carefully formulated to suit Pakistan’s needs for an apology and the Obama administration’s reluctance to issue a full-throated “sorry” during an election year in which Republicans have accused President Obama of weakness in his foreign policy. The “we” in Clinton’s apology referenced mutual regret, from both her and Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, about the incident. In a telephone conversation with Khar, Clinton said, they both “acknowledged the mistakes that resulted in the loss of Pakistani military lives. We are sorry for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military.” She said Khar “has informed me that the ground supply lines into Afghanistan are opening. Pakistan will continue not to charge any transit fee in the larger interest of peace and security in Afghanistan and the region. This is a tangible demonstration of Pakistan’s support . . . and our shared objectives in the region.” The agreement, Clinton said, “will also help the United States and ISAF [the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan] conduct the planned drawdown at a much lower cost.” “Consistent with current practice,” she said, “no lethal equipment” will transit the route except for supplies destined for Afghan security forces. A Pakistani government statement quoted the country’s new prime minister, Raja Pervez Ashraf, as saying that the continued closure of the supply lines would have forced the country to “impinge” on its relationship with the United States, as well as with other NATO member countries. Pakistan will also reap a financial benefit from the deal. In addition to collecting fees for the transit of containers, it will receive 1.3 billion that the United States owes Pakistan for counterterrorism operations. The Pakistani military had largely deferred to the civilian government to make the decision on reopening borders to NATO convoys. In April, in setting down what it called new “terms of engagement” with the United States, the Pakistani parliament included a demand for an “unconditional apology” for the “condemnable and unprovoked” attack in November. Although the deal means that Afghanistan-bound NATO war supplies will start moving across the border again, the decision also carries the prospect of another public backlash in Pakistan, where public opposition to American policies remains strong. On Tuesday, the Defense Council of Pakistan, which includes pro-Taliban clerics and other foes of the NATO routes, vowed civil disobedience to stop the trucks from rolling. “The decision to reopen NATO supplies is big crime against the country and we will not sit silently over this,” Hamid Gul, leader of the group and a former chief of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency, told the Pakistani cable channel Express News. “We will come to roads and streets and protest against the decision and will also try to stop the supplies.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1.

Minutes before the ball dropped on New Year’s Eve, Dave Herman stood in a frigid, jam-packed Times Square, gripping a microphone and staring into the camera. He had just seconds of on-screen banter with “The Office” actress Angela Kinsey before it was back to Carson Daly — but a moment was all he needed. Herman had completed his 100th job of the year, as a correspondent for NBC’s “New Year’s Eve with Carson Daly.” “It was just incredible,” he told the Daily News on Wednesday. “I can’t wrap my head around it, and I don’t think I ever will.” The 27-year-old New Yorker schlepped through 100 different jobs during 2012, from distributing flyers to data entry to telling fortunes. He was a dog-walker one day, a bartender the next. Each job was chronicled on his blog, 100jobs1year.com. Herman, a self-described actor, producer and writer, came up with the 100 jobs challenge when he realized he was swamped with freelance work in late 2011. “I had booked five different jobs in a week,” he said. “And I thought, maybe I can make something of this. Maybe I can do 100 jobs in a year.” He used temp agencies and the Internet to find work. Eventually, word of mouth helped secure even more gigs. Among the highlights was working with “Goosebumps” author R.L. Stine, Herman said. “I tweeted at him on a whim and said, ‘Do you want to hire me as a scary muse?’” he explained. The muse gig didn’t work out, but the pair did collaborate on an improv show, and Herman crossed job No. 78 off his list in November. The over-experienced Herman is launching another creative project in March, called 10,000 Kevins. “I want to see if I can get 10,000 people named Kevin to sign a petition to get Kevin Bacon to take me to lunch,” he said. In the meantime, Herman recently scored a full-time job — one he wants to hang on to for more than a week. “I think I’m afraid of commitment at this point,” he joked.","output":"A man named Dave Herman completed 100 different jobs in one year, and his last job was being on TV for a few seconds during New Year's Eve.

When flipping a house, even if you've got a great buy, if people do not know about your house they aren't going to make an offer on it. There are a number of different ways you can really get your name and property out into the public eye. Select from the following.  (1). Whatever you do, make sure you're making the necessary contacts and the right amount of money. If you end up getting more than 1 offer, you'll be out of luck.  (2). You can advertise using ads in the newspaper, online listings or craigslist. You might even consider using mls or \\" multiple listing service \\".  (3). Talk to your local bank or credit union and get a broker. Talk to the airline that distributes the most advertising during regular business hours.  (4). To make an impression on other buyers, start out with online listings that attract sellers to your location. Advertising to local authorities and forums is an effective way to attract people that wouldn't usually see you with a bad deal. Answer:","output":"(2). You can advertise using ads in the newspaper, online listings or Craigslist. You might even consider using MLS or \\"multiple listing service\\".  When flipping a house, it's essential to get your property noticed by as many potential buyers as possible. One effective way to achieve this is through advertising, both in print and online media. Traditional newspapers still offer a platform for reaching out to potential buyers. You can place an ad in the classifieds section or, even better, include your property in the real estate section, where individuals actively seeking properties will be looking. Online listings are another powerful venue for advertising your property. Many popular real estate websites offer a platform for listing your property, often free of charge. Make sure to include compelling photos and descriptions of the house to entice buyers. In addition, many online platforms allow you to post updates and alerts about your property, ensuring that prospective buyers are always in the know about any improvements or changes regarding the house. Craigslist is another popular online platform that lets you advertise your property directly to prospective buyers. By posting an ad under the appropriate listings section, you can easily reach a wide audience seeking to buy a home in your area. Just like with other online listings, include striking photographs and detailed descriptions of the property to capture the readers' interest. In addition to the methods mentioned above, you might consider using Multiple Listing Service (MLS). The MLS is a platform used by real estate brokers to share property listings with other brokers. By having your property listed on the MLS, you can significantly increase its exposure to real estate agents and potential buyers in your area. Talk to a local real estate agent to help you navigate the process of listing your property on the MLS. By utilizing a combination of these advertising methods, you greatly increase the chances of selling your flipped house quickly. Each platform has its unique benefits and reaches different types of potential buyers. By covering as many bases as possible, you can feel confident knowing that your property will be found by interested buyers, ultimately leading to a faster sale and, in turn, making your house flipping venture an overwhelming success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You may suddenly be very busy with classes, social activities, and studying. But, you will need to prioritize your significant other and make sure you give them an appropriate amount of time and attention.  Even though it's important to give your boyfriend or girlfriend your attention, it will need to be a balance. You are obviously in college because you want to succeed in school, so make sure you are giving the right amount of time to all of your academic responsibilities.  Sometimes, combining the priorities of school and a significant other can work, too—try having study dates, or doing homework together. Similarly to making your significant other a priority and making time for them, you need to make sure you make time for yourself. Taking time for yourself might seem like an easy thing to do, but you might find out it can be difficult! If you are having trouble making time for yourself, put it in your planner or on your calendar, and make sure not to schedule anything else during that time. If you go to the same school, or even take some of the same classes, the two of you might begin to feel a little overwhelmed from too much time together. Make sure to pencil some alone time into your schedule. Talk to each other honestly and openly. Do not harbor any secrets or grievances. These omissions can end up weakening your bond, especially when they finally come out.  Simply talking isn't necessarily good communication. Make sure you are really listening to your significant other rather than just waiting for your turn to speak.  An advantage of living near your boyfriend or girlfriend through college is that when you communicate with them, you can also read into their body language. For example, folded arms might indicate defensiveness, while a lack of making eye contact might signal disinterest or even shame.","output":"In college, you will be very busy with classes, friends, and studying.

The slipperiness of rocks is typically caused by other environmental factors, such as the presence of water, algae, or moss on the rock surfaces. On the other hand, \\"erosion\\" refers to the process by which natural forces, such as wind, water, ice, or even living organisms, can gradually wear away and remove rock and soil particles. Prolonged contact between rocks can contribute to erosion, as the constant rubbing between the surfaces can break down and wear away the rock material over time. This process is called abrasion, which is a form of mechanical weathering, a subset of processes that fall under the umbrella of erosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: As a parent you might never guess all the ways a good imagination benefits your child. It helps a preschooler : Develop social skills As children play pretend, they explore relationships between family members, friends and coworkers and learn more about how people interact. Playing doctor, they imagine how physicians care for their patients. Playing house, they learn more about how parents feel about their children. Imaginative play helps develop empathy  for others. If children can imagine how it feels to be left out of a game or to lose a pet, they are better able to help those in need. They become more willing to play fair, to share, and to cooperate. Build selfconfidence Young children have very little control over their lives. Imagining oneself as a builder of skyscrapers  or a superhero defending the planet is empowering to a child. It helps them develop confidence in their abilities and their potential. Boost intellectual growth Using the imagination is the beginning of abstract thought.Children who can see a king's castle in a mound  of sand or a delicious dinner in a mud pie are learning to think symbolically . This skill is important in school where a child will have to learn that numerals symbolize groups of objects, letters symbolize sounds, and so on. Practice language skills Kids who play pretend with their friends do a lot of talking.This helps _ their vocabulary, improve sentence structure and promote communication skills. Work out fears Playing pretend can help children work out their fears and worries. When children roleplay about the big, bad monster under the bed, they gain a sense of control over him and he doesn't seem quite so big or so bad. Imaginative play also helps kids vent  confusing feelings they might have, such as anger toward a parent or compete with a new sibling . To encourage your youngster's imagination, read to him every day. Books offer children the opportunity to visit other worlds and create new ones of their own. For generations children have enjoyed reading the story... Question: What's NOT the advantage of children having a good imagination?

Article: There’s been a disturbance in the Force, one felt by fans, critics, and everyone interested in the aggregate quality ratings of movies on Rotten Tomatoes.      On Sunday, it appeared that Star Wars: The Last Jedi was making history. The gap between the audience score and the critics score on Rotten Tomoates was huge. But now, there are whispers that this isn’t remotely accurate and that the audience score is the result of a hack.      On Sunday, a Facebook community page called “Down With Disney’s Treatment of Franchises and Fanboys” claimed that they were responsible for deploying bots to artificially bring down The Last Jedi’s audience score. Inverse spoke with the individual who claims to run the Facebook page. They brazenly call Disney an “abomination” and takes a stalwart defender position on the now discontinued Star Wars Expanded Universe.      “Do you see the hate towards Disney unfolding with this movie and the SJW hate?” the unnamed individual said via email when asked about their motives. “Add to that the whole Disney/Fox deal and what Disney will probably do when Net Neutrality is repealed — well now is a great time to strike Disney.”      But can they prove it? Short answer: No.      “Look for the accounts there that have The Last Jedi as their only review,” the individual wrote in their page. “That is me.” But as of this writing, more than 116,000 reviews had been posted, which would mean scrolling through 920 pages filled with reviews and checking individual user profiles just to find the users that only reviewed The Last Jedi.      But this onerous task would prove what, exactly? That many people wrote their first Rotten Tomatoes review about The Last Jedi? The more likely suspect here might just be a ton of genuinely enraged fans.      On Sunday, Deadline seemed to contradict any claims of hacking with bots:      “The consensus from non-Disney sources this morning is that ‘trolling’ occurred here in regards to the online reaction to Last Jedi.” This means Deadline’s source doesn’t think a hack was at work here, just bad, old-fashioned internet trolls causing trouble.      So what does the individual in charge of this Facebook page have against Disney, exactly? And why would they invent a story about deploying bots?      It involves a multi-pronged response in opposition to diversity in filmmaking, the discontinuation of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, and blaming the failure of DC Comics films on Marvel. In summation, every issue they have goes back to Disney’s business practices.      “They discontinued the Expanded Universe, shut down LucasArts, created an unrealistic environment for any DC movie to find true success and shove SJW messages down our throats.” They also believe that Marvel “sabotaged” the superhero landscape: “Marvel killed and effectively made what Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder tried to achieve with the superhero genre to be null and void.”      In this person’s mind, people didn’t want “Luke Skywalker to be nerfed in favor of MaRey Sue,” referencing the blatantly sexist complaint after The Force Awakens that Rey was a Mary Sue undeserving of her power or her prevalence.      “I brought out the worst in all sorts of people by using my bots. One look at bad numbers allows people to go in with a mindset I help create and to tear down the film.” Whether or not these alleged “bots” did open the door for more negative responses to the film remains to be verified, as there’s no feasible way to track the effectiveness. Nor is there a way to prove if these bots even exist at all.      However, in scrolling through the actual reviews, many of the negative audience reviews on Rotten Tomoates do skew political in the way they are reminiscent of the claims the “hacker” is making. The people who didn’t like the movie say it’s because there was an “SJW agenda,” or they offer similar criticisms of diversity. Back when The Force Awakens opened in 2015, there was also a small but very vocal group who opposed the ideas of a female protagonist and a black stormtrooper.      When reached for comment on this suspicion, Rotten Tomatoes told Inverse: “Similar to other movie sites, we’re currently experiencing a high volume of fan activity around Star Wars: The Last Jedi. We’re closely monitoring all user review activity to make sure it’s valid.”      But what does this mean? Or, to put it another way, does the audience score of The Last Jedi reflect the consensus of reality at all? Do the 56 percent of average people who have seen The Last Jedi actually hate it? And because the Down With Disney “hacker” can’t actually prove bots were used, the whole thing is pretty muddy.      Still, as Joanna Robinson writing for Vanity Fair on Sunday pointed out: “There’s no social-media record to preserve in amber the 1980 reaction from Star Wars fans to the darker Empire Strikes Back, though I have heard, anecdotally, from some who saw it in the theater, that even Empire had to grow on them.”      If there is a divide among human beings who saw The Last Jedi (let’s not even bother to use the word “fans”) on opening weekend, it’s possible we won’t be able to accurately measure that divide for several years to come. In other words, online metrics and vocal Facebook pages claiming to have all-powerful hacking bots are no match for a little bit of perspective on your side.      This story is developing.      Star Wars: The Last Jedi* is out now.      Read Next: “How the Last Jedi Porg Creator Weaponized Cuteness” ||||| Star Wars: The Last Jedi is one of the top-rated movies on Rotten Tomatoes, according to critics, but scroll down the movie’s page a little further and audience testimonies tell a different story.      There’s a gaping disparity between what critics thought of the movie (certified fresh) and the feeling a majority of moviegoers walked away from the theater harnessing. How could a movie so universally applauded by critics not have the same resounding effect on general moviegoers?      It’s hard to discern whether reviews of the movie are genuine or, as some outlets have reported, generated by bots or organized attacks from 4chan. One Facebook group, “Down With Disney's Treatment of Franchises and its Fanboys,” which aligns itself as a pro-DCEU community, announced on Facebook that it had generated trolls to help review-bomb The Last Jedi’s score on Rotten Tomatoes. (Review-bombing is when a horde of negative reviews with low ratings are left on an entities page in protest.) The page defines itself by its anti-Marvel and anti-Disney stance as a pro-DCEU fan page.      “Thanks to friends of mine who taught me a thing or two about Bot Accounts, I used them to create this audience score through Facebook accounts created that subsequently logged into Rotten Tomatoes who rigged this score and still keep it dropping,” the post reads.      Questions about 4chan’s influence on the score have also been raised, but a thread on 4chan’s infamous politically incorrect forum, /pol/, has a number of site users claiming that 4chan wasn’t involved. Some 4chan users suggested it was a /pol/ attack because the audience rating is sitting at 56 percent, which could allude to a 2015 meme that /pol/ participants in Europe and the United States used. The term “56” has become notable among 4chan for a keyword used during organized attacks; when the score for The Last Jedi hovered at 56 percent, people thought it was a sign that 4chan was behind the review bomb.      One /pol/user noted that, “even if /pol/ could muster up 10,000 people, which would be like 2-3 times the amount for popular strawpolls posted more than once, it wouldn't be enough to change it to 56% and be able to keep it there.” This sentiment was echoed on the thread, with many /pol/ members claiming they wish it had been an organized attack, but downplaying any involvement in it.      Some of those comments have been screencapped and can be read below.      Just because 4chan claims to not be behind the review bomb doesn’t mean everything is fine. Many of the reviews being left on The Last Jedi’s page call out the film for its inclusion of “SJW” concepts, criticizing the movie for its forced inclusion of race and powerful female figures. Among those reviews, a large portion are from accounts created that day and have only left comments for The Last Jedi.      One review, which was left earlier today from a new user named Johnny S., called out The Last Jedi for its political tendencies. A portion of his review can be read below.      If you like stunning visuals, superficial character development, a choppy, incoherent, illogical plot, plot holes, SJW concepts such as capitalism is bad, animal abuse is bad, \\"make love not war\\", every bad guy being a white male, and neutering every positive protagonist male in this movie, or you are only a casual fan of Star Wars, you'll probably like this movie.      There are countless other reviews like this one that go back to Dec. 14, when the first public screenings for The Last Jedi began. When asked by Polygon whether Rotten Tomatoes was worried about attacks on The Last Jedi, a representative for the company said the website is closely monitoring the situation.      “Fans can rate a movie several ways,” the representative said. “They can rate it ‘want to see’ or ‘not interested,’ add a score from .5 to 5 stars as well as post a written review with the score. Similar to other movie sites, we’re currently experiencing a high volume of fan activity around Star Wars: The Last Jedi. We’re closely monitoring all user review activity to make sure it’s valid.”      For Rotten Tomatoes — and for general audiences — it’s important to note the difference between illegitimate and legitimate criticism. The Last Jedi, just like any review, is subject to people’s opinions, and all legitimate opinions should be heard. In one opinion piece, we called out the movie for its lack of direction heading into Episode IX, saying “a middle act should not leave so much ambiguity,” adding that we couldn’t see “one clear purpose coming out of The Last Jedi.”      Frustrations over how nostalgia is used in the movie, the use of exaggerated comedic bits and the quick dismissal of Snoke as a character are all valid criticism points. Many people walked away from The Last Jedi feeling unsure about how it sits in the universe created by George Lucas 40 years ago. The issue, as many critics have pointed out, is the reactionary response online. When people are burning their Star Wars shirts and calling out for bots to raid review sites as a way of getting disappointment across, that’s when questionable attacks come into play.      The last Jedi was quite simply insulting to every Star Wars movie before it. pic.twitter.com/Z4nL2SYVVO — Carson Juhl (@carson_juhl) December 15, 2017      With more than 100,000 reviews of the movie, most people are convinced that something is amiss — especially after predominant polling sites like CinemaScore gave the film an “A” after collecting survey data from the movie’s opening night. The backlash to the movie, which is unprecedented for a Disney film in recent years, led to Dave Hollis, Disney’s president of theatrical distribution, issuing a statement to Deadline about the situation.      “Rian Johnson, the cast, and the Lucasfilm team have delivered an experience that is totally ‘Star Wars’ yet at the same time fresh, unexpected and new,” Hollis told Deadline. “That makes this a ‘Star Wars’ film like audiences have never seen – it’s got people talking, puzzling over its mysteries, and it’s a lot to take in, and we see that as all positive, that should help set the film up for great word-of-mouth and repeat viewing as we enter the lucrative holiday period.”      Despite the negative reviews flooding Rotten Tomatoes — a number of which, Polygon confirmed just from reading through 15 pages of reviews, contain phrases like “SJW” or “diversity” in their description — Star Wars: The Last Jedi is still one of the year’s most successful movies. The film is projected to have surpassed 220 million during its opening weekend, joining Star Wars: The Force Awakens, The Avengers and Jurassic World as one of four films to cross the 200 million line.      As critics have pointed out, this has nothing to do with whether people liked The Last Jedi, but when looking at reactionary comments on sites like Rotten Tomatoes, which allow users to post their reviews with little oversight, it’s important to read the language being used in those descriptions. As cultural critic Peter Coffin said on Twitter, “if you only looked on Reddit (or Rotten Tomatoes user reviews), you’d think the world hated Star Wars: The Last Jedi.”      Polygon has reached out to Rotten Tomatoes for more information on whether the audience score is expected to change in the coming days or if it’s expected to hover around 56 percent. If it stays the same, it will be one of the only movies “Certified Fresh” by critics and “Certified Rotten” by audiences.      Update (Dec. 21): After reports of the attack being organized by a right-wing group began to circulate, a Rotten Tomatoes representative told Polygon that its security team and database experts “haven’t determined there to be any problems.” Rotten Tomatoes’ full statement can be read below. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. |||||Summary:","output":"Disney's latest Star Wars installment, The Last Jedi, has become embroiled in a controversy over audience and critic divisions on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes.

He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Auburn University (then known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute) in 1901. He had already decided on a military career and had become first sergeant of a cavalry company in the Alabama National Guard. However, he obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Alabama in 1903 and practiced law in Montgomery, Alabama for a year. Returning to the United States in April 1919, Smith's assignments in the next four years included duty at Norfolk, Virginia, study at the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island, and service in Washington, D.C., with the War Plans Section of the Office of Naval Operations. There, he was the first Marine officer to serve on the Joint Army-Navy Planning Committee. Leaving Washington in May 1923, he served aboard the battleships Wyoming and Arkansas as Fleet Marine Officer, U.S. Scouting Fleet, until September of that year.  In February 1924, after serving at Marine Corps Headquarters and in the West Indies in connection with joint Army-Navy maneuvers, Smith joined the Marine Brigade on expeditionary duty in Haiti, serving as that unit's Chief of Staff and Officer in Charge of Operations and Training. He returned from that country in August 1925, to serve as chief of staff of the 1st Marine Brigade at Quantico, Virginia, until September 1926, as a student in the Marine Corps School, Quantico, from then until June 1927, and as Post Quartermaster of the Marine Barracks, Philadelphia Navy Yard, from July 1927 to March 1931.  In April 1931, Smith began another tour of sea duty, this time aboard the USS California as Aide to the Commander and Force Marine Officer of the Battle Force, U.S. Fleet. He served in those capacities until June 1933, commanded the Marine Barracks at the Washington Navy Yard from then until January 1935, and served the following two years at San Francisco, California, as chief of staff, Department of the Pacific. From there he was ordered to Marine Corps Headquarters in March 1937, to serve two years as director of the Division of Operations and Training, after which he was Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps under Major General Thomas Holcomb from April to September 1939.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that wrote I know that my Redeemer liveth? , can you please find it?   The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\"  The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\"  should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and... Answer:","output":"The person who wrote \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is not mentioned specifically in your article. However, the context and clues within the text suggest that the piece referred to is part of an oratorio called \\"Messiah.\\" This larger work is extensively known to have been composed by George Frideric Handel.  Handel was a German, later British, Baroque composer who is well-known for his operas, oratorios, and concertos. His music was highly influential throughout Europe, and many of his compositions remain significant in Western classical music. \\"Messiah\\" is among his most famous works, renowned for its beautiful and emotionally charged choral sequences. \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the numbers in the \\"Messiah\\" oratorio. Specifically, it is written in E major and is an opening soprano solo. This suggests that Handel, as the composer of \\"Messiah,\\" would be the person who wrote the music for \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth.\\" However, it should be understood that the oratorio \\"Messiah\\" is based on biblical texts, and the lyrics of \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" come directly from Scripture, specifically from the Book of Job in the Old Testament. While the music was composed by Handel, the words themselves are drawn directly from the Bible. In conclusion, George Frideric Handel wrote the music for the soprano solo \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" as part of his oratorio \\"Messiah,\\" but the phrase itself originates from the biblical text of the Book of Job."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Disappointing Product review: I had high hopes for this book as I enjoyed the Secret Life of Bees so much. However, I ended up very disppointed. I finished the book, but wanted it to end quickly. I think what I disliked most was the main character, Jessie. For me, she is believable at first with regard to her history, her mother and issues with her husband. The whole whirlwind, selfish, infatuation with a monk, whom she met briefly 1 or 2 times and immediately fell IN LOVE with was too unbelievable to me. The fact that he's a monk doesn't come much into play for her, which is also somewhat bogus for me. Although I'm probably in the minority, I think that the book could have been written and made interesting w/o the whole affair w/the monk. The issues with her father's death and her mother were the real interesting part for me, the rest unbelievable. Disappointing ending.

The goal is to find the longest substring that is a palindrome in the given string. Here's the approach I used: 1. I first consider the given string: \\"nnwnwlnlwlnwwww\\" 2. I start by checking for the longest possible palindrome by checking if the entire string is a palindrome or not. In this case, the complete string is not a palindrome. 3. I then check for a palindrome of length (length of string - 1). I repeat this process, decreasing the length by 1 each time until I find a palindrome. 4. I slide through the string and compare the substrings of the current length, while checking if they are palindromes. 5. I stop when I find the first palindrome in the process, as it will be the longest, since we are starting from the longest possible length and decreasing it. Following these steps for the given input \\"nnwnwlnlwlnwwww\\": - Starting with a length of 13, I slide through the string and check for palindromes:     - \\"nnwnwlnlwlnww\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"nwnwlnlwlnwww\\" - Not a palindrome - Move to the next length, 12, and check for palindromes again:     - \\"nnwnwlnlwlnw\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"nwnwlnlwlnww\\" - Not a palindrome - Continuing the process, I check for palindromes of length 11:     - \\"nnwnwlnlwln\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"nwnwlnlwlnw\\" - Not a palindrome - And so on, until I reach the length of 7:     - \\"nnwnwln\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"nwnwlnl\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"wnwlnlw\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"nwlnlwl\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"wlnlwln\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"lnlwlnw\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"nlwlnww\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"lwlnwww\\" - Not a palindrome - At length 6, I finally find a palindrome:      \\"nnwnwl\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"nwnwln\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"wnwlnl\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"nwlnlw\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"wlnlwln\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"lnlwlnw\\" - Not a palindrome     - \\"nlwlnww\\" - **Palindrome** So, by using the definition of a palindrome and sliding through the given string while decreasing the length of the substrings to be checked, I found the longest palindrome to be \\"nlwlnww\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's analyze both sentences in detail to understand the contexts: Sentence 1 discusses the experience of wearing a suit and how it can sometimes feel stiff and uncomfortable. The person mentioned in this sentence is writing training material and prefers to be comfortable while working. The suit is associated with a potential meeting with a customer later in the day, which highlights that the suit may be worn due to professional settings when the need arises. Sentence 2 discusses a separate situation of being on stage and feeling the presence of an audience while wearing a suit. In this context, the person not only feels self-conscious due to the suit but also experiences awareness of being watched by others. To answer your question, the truth of the second sentence is not dependent on the truth of the first sentence. Both sentences are true on their own if one experiences the described situations and feelings individually.

Process:  - Kidneys filter waste out of blood - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells - Calcium levels are maintained.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there was only one person eating happens, how will it affect blood is cleaned through kidney.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context suggests that if there was only one person eating, how would this affect the blood filtration process through the kidneys. To understand the impact of this hypothetical situation, we need to first comprehend the various roles that kidneys play and the factors that influence their functioning. As you mentioned, the primary functions of the kidneys include filtering waste out of the blood, regulating blood composition, maintaining constant water volume and pH levels, helping in blood pressure regulation, stimulating the production of red blood cells, and managing calcium levels. Kidneys accomplish these tasks through nephrons, which are tiny filtering units present in large numbers in each kidney. Nephrons work continuously to eliminate waste products, excess ions, and water from the bloodstream. In the perturbation hypothesis you've presented, there would be only one person eating. This could potentially have several effects on the kidney function, depending on factors like the person's diet, lifestyle, and overall health. 1. Diet: If the person has a balanced diet rich in nutrients and low in harmful substances, it might have a positive effect on their kidney function. The person will likely experience normal kidney filtration and waste removal processes. However, if the person consumes a diet high in sodium, sugar, or harmful substances, it could put a strain on their kidneys over time, making it harder for them to filter out waste effectively. 2. Lifestyle: The person's lifestyle also plays a significant role in determining their kidney health. Sedentary lifestyles and a lack of physical activity can contribute to obesity and other health conditions that impair kidney function. On the other hand, staying physically active and maintaining a healthy weight could help the kidneys perform their functions more effectively. 3. Health conditions: The presence of pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or autoimmune diseases might increase the risk of kidney damage and affect their ability to filter blood. 4. Hydration: Proper hydration is crucial for maintaining healthy kidney function, as it enables them to eliminate waste through urine more efficiently. Dehydration or inadequate water intake could lead to kidney stones or urinary tract infections, which obstruct the normal functioning of the kidneys. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis you've presented suggests that if a single individual was eating, the effect on kidney filtration and blood cleaning would depend on the person's diet, lifestyle, health status, and hydration levels. Ensuring these factors are aligned with a healthy lifestyle would contribute to proper kidney function and effective blood filtration. On the contrary, poor dietary habits, inadequate hydration, and pre-existing health issues could directly or indirectly lead to decreased kidney performance and compromised blood filtration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering Why did Jesse do this? Answer:","output":"When Jesse desperately grasped onto Addison's hand after slipping on the edge of the volcano, it can be understood as a natural human reaction driven by a multitude of factors ranging from basic human instincts, trust, and emotional bonds. Here is a detailed explanation of why Jesse did this: 1. Survival instinct: The most basic explanation for Jesse's action is the innate human survival instinct. The moment Jesse slipped and faced the imminent danger of falling into the volcano, their brain's natural response was to seek support and safety. Grasping onto Addison's hand was an instant reflex to secure their own safety and prevent falling. 2. Trust in Addison: Jesse's act of reaching out for Addison's hand also demonstrates the trust built between them. Having Addison nearby during such a catastrophic event provided Jesse with a sense of security in the belief that Addison is someone they can rely on in life-threatening situations. Trusting that Addison will attempt to help them could have been a source of comfort and courage for Jesse in that critical moment. 3. Emotional bond and friendship: Jesse and Addison likely share a strong emotional bond due to their friendship or relationship. Emotional bonds create a sense of connection that goes beyond mere physical presence. By holding onto Addison's hand, Jesse not only sought physical support but also leaned on the emotional connection they shared. This connection could provide some mental strength amidst the panic and fear. 4. The power of touch: Human touch can be a powerful source of comfort and reassurance. In times of extreme distress, the touch of another person we trust can offer solace and help soothe panic. In Jesse's case, grasping Addison's hand could provide a sense of security and calm that could not be derived from any other action. 5. Collective strength: Two people working in unison can be more effective in overcoming challenges than a single person. By holding onto Addison's hand, Jesse was not only seeking help but also acknowledging their collective strength in the face of adversity. This combined effort could have increased their chances of overcoming the dangerous situation they found themselves in. In conclusion, Jesse's decision to grasp onto Addison's hand as they slipped on the edge of the volcano can be attributed to various factors like basic survival instincts, trust in their friend, emotional bonds, the power of touch, and the idea of collective strength. These elements combined to create a compelling reason for Jesse to reach out to Addison in that perilous moment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a news article: Mississippi quietly passed its “religious freedom” law Tuesday, prompting alarm from gay and lesbian rights activists who say it could be used to justify discrimination in the name of religion.      The Mississippi version is narrowed from the religious freedom proposals championed by religious conservatives across the country, and now largely mirrors the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.      “While this is an improvement upon the language that the legislature previously contemplated, it still falls short,” said Eunice Rho of the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU had pushed for specific language that would prevent the bill from being used to protect discrimination in the name of religion.      “The language still exposes virtually every branch, office, and agency of the government to litigation, which will require taxpayer funds to defend,” Rho said.      Republican state lawmakers, spurred by cases in states like New Mexico and Colorado where businesses were prevented from turning away same-sex couples because of laws barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, have sought to pass bills that create or strengthen religious exemptions. Many were modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, but with new provisions stating explicitly that business owners could use their religion as a legal defense if sued by a customer – legal language specifically designed to protect business owners in cases like those in New Mexico and Colorado. Mississippi has no state laws barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.      Proposed in about a dozen states, all of these bills have faced significant backlashes, both from LGBT rights activists and business organizations, and until now they have all failed. Arizona Republican Governor Jan Brewer vetoed one in February, after the business community and both U.S. Senators, both Republicans, came out against the bill.      In mid-March, Mississippi shelved its version after facing a backlash similar to what has been seen in other states where such bills have been introduced. But the version that passed Tuesday is nearly identical to the federal religious freedom law, with the exception of a provision that prevents employees of private businesses from filing religiously-based claims against their employers.      By adopting language that mirrors federal law, Mississippi lawmakers who backed the bill assuaged the concerns of the business community that the proposal could lead to discrimination.      “The legislature understands the need to follow the federal approach, and if they do that we’re fine, we’re not going to have a discrimination problem,” Blake Wilson of the Mississippi Economic Council told msnbc Monday afternoon before the final bill emerged. The MEC functions as the state’s chamber of commerce, and has been in contact with Mississippi lawmakers regarding the bill.      “We’ve been in plenty of contact with the key folks, and we’ve distributed our position extensively in both houses,” Wilson told msnbc Monday.      Prior to the revisions by Mississippi lawmakers, the MEC had opposed passage of the bill. With the business community on board, there were few remaining obstacles to Mississippi being the first state to pass a religious freedom law since the most recent push began.      Yet contrary to the beliefs of the Mississippi Economic Council, religious right activists clearly envision the Mississippi law as empowering businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples in the name of religion. Shortly after the Mississippi law passed, Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Center, released a statement saying as much.      “Whether it’s someone like Pastor Telsa DeBerry who was hindered by the Holly Springs city government from building a new church in the downtown area, or a wedding vendor, whose orthodox Christian faith will not allow her to affirm same-sex ‘marriage,’ the provisions of RFRA would apply to prevent the government from discriminating against religious exercise,” Perkins said. ”The Founders never envisioned a government forcing Americans to choose between the basic teachings of their faith and losing their livelihood.”      The Family Research Center’s website states that the group opposes ”the vigorous efforts of homosexual activists to demand that homosexuality be accepted as equivalent to heterosexuality in law, in the media, and in schools. “      As msnbc has previously reported, civil liberties groups originally backed the federal law that Mississippi’s version closely resembles. Their opposition to such a law now has to do with how the courts have begun to interpret the scope of religious freedom laws, as not only protecting individual religious exercise but also actions that affect third parties, such as a florist turning away a customer who is purchasing flowers for a same-sex wedding. LGBT rights supporters don’t believe businesses that serve the general public should be able to discriminate against customers on the basis of sexual orientation.      A group of legal scholars opposing the bill wrote to Mississippi legislators in March, arguing that in light of recent court decisions, laws designed to defend religious freedom and seemingly neutral in intent could be used to undermine protections against discrimination. “Twenty years ago, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act might have been less fraught with legal and policy peril,” they wrote. “Now, when it will most likely be both seen and used as a shield against enforcement of civil rights laws (current and future), enacting it seems like a uniquely poor idea.” ||||| Photo by Dan Anderson/Reuters            On Tuesday, the Mississippi legislature easily passed an Arizona-style anti-gay segregation bill, potentially legalizing anti-gay discrimination throughout the state. The bill, which in an earlier form received unanimous bipartisan support from the state House of Representatives, is almost certain to be signed by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant. That will make Mississippi the first state, but likely not the last, to enshrine anti-gay animus in law.      Mark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern covers courts and the law for Slate.      Many commentators have assumed that these “religious liberty” bills will be struck down by the courts—but in the case of Mississippi, it’s not quite so simple. Unlike Kansas’ and Idaho’s anti-gay laws, Mississippi’s cleverly couches its animus in seemingly neutral language. After the fallout from Arizona’s failed bill, previously enthusiastic Mississippi legislators rewrote their state’s measure to curb its anti-gay extremism. These revisions struck out the bill’s most odious provision, a section that handed private businesses a blank check to refuse service to gay people. What remains at the heart of Mississippi’s reworked bill is a dense proscription against “state action” that “burden[s] a person’s right to exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,” unless it’s “essential to further a compelling government interest” and “the least restrictive means” of furthering that interest.      Advertisement            If all this sounds cryptic, that’s because it is: The Mississippi legislature’s intention seemed to be to write a bill so broad and opaque that no court could possibly quibble with the constitutionality of the text alone. Indeed, even the most liberal judges of the Ninth Circuit probably couldn’t find a basis to strike down the measure as it stands now. But some day, an ambitiously anti-gay Mississippian is bound to cite the law in court. And at that point, Mississippi is going to find itself with a Romer problem.      From the vantage point of the Windsor era, Romer v. Evans might seem like a quaint relic. The case concerned a vicious Colorado constitutional amendment that forbade any city or county from passing gay anti-discrimination legislation, which many gay rights activists—still reeling from their defeat in Bowers—expected the Supreme Court to uphold. Yet six members of the court voted to strike down the Romer amendment, insisting that legislation targeting a specific group must “advance a legitimate government interest”—and really, really hating gay people didn’t quite pass muster. Since then, Romer has stood for the proposition that no state may pass a law expressly designed to demean or disadvantage gays.      The question for the courts, then, is whether Mississippi’s new law will disadvantage gay people as a group. And on its face, the statute says nothing about gays: Legislators took pains, after all, to cloak their bill in the legalese of “general applicability,” distinguishing it from the Romer amendment (and Kansas’ recent abomination). But read between the lines, and Mississippi’s bill has the potential to do exactly what the Romer amendment did: pre-empt any city or county from protecting LGBT people from discrimination. A landlord need only insist that renting to gay people “burden[s] [his] exercise of religion,” and a city ordinance banning anti-gay housing discrimination would be suddenly unenforceable. Every attempted protection for LGBT people would be rendered toothless in practice by the religious liberty defense, thus creating a regime of discrimination that looks strikingly similar to the Romer dystopia that the court so resoundingly rejected. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Mississippi passed a \\"religious freedom\\" law, which has some people worried because they think it can be used to allow discrimination against gay and lesbian people in the name of religion. This law is similar to a federal law from the United States called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

'Scrummy': Soprano Laura Wright has hit back at comments that classical singers are too thin. ‘Scrummy Soprano’ Laura Wright yesterday launched a war of words with Dame Kiri te Kanawa, describing her recent comments about singers being too thin as ‘stupid’. Dame Kiri, 69, stirred controversy last month when she said of young singers: ‘Sometimes they’re more beautiful than their voice, and that’s a bit of a sadness.’ She added: ‘When I was at the Met [in New York], I would see these young girls, starving hungry but terrified to put on weight. ‘They couldn’t even go down to the canteen and eat in front of anyone because they were being watched. ‘You have got to have beef on you if you’re going to sing.’ Laura, 23, who has sung for the Queen six times in the past year, said: ‘It is so stupid she has highlighted body stuff. ‘I find it strange that she is commenting on girls’ figures.’ ‘She pointed out sexualisation of young women in the classical industry and that frustrates me. ‘I just received my first-class degree at the Royal College of Music and at no point in my four-year course did my figure come into it. ‘For me it is about being healthy, I’m not thin or enormous, but just a sporty shape. I look after my vocal muscles and my other muscles as well and I don’t feel the pressure to diet to go on stage thin.’ The divas’ disagreement comes as both women take to the stage tonight in the last of the Coronation Jubilee Festival Gala evenings at Buckingham Palace. Wright’s reaction to Kiri’s comments are in stark contrast to Welsh star Katherine Jenkins conciliatory attitude about Dame Kiri’s scathing comments about ‘crossover’ singers such as herself. Dame Kiri told The Radio Times in May when Katherine’s name was mentioned: ‘We should talk about serious classical singers if you want to stick to the subject.’ Controversy: Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, pictured performing at the Coronation festival, has said modern young singers are 'more beautiful than their voice' Ms Jenkins, 33, who will also perform tonight, said: ‘I don’t think Dame Kiri ever says these things. I think she’s been misquoted, as is so often the case. ‘When I met her, she was a lovely person, so I’m going to ignore it.’ Meanwhile, Ms Wright has revealed that some of her tutors at the Royal College of Music believed that her heavy concert schedule would be a distraction from her studies. Despite her outstanding academic success, Laura added: ‘Some tutors at the College disagreed with what I have been doing and haven’t been supportive.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about a disagreement between two singers, Laura Wright and Dame Kiri te Kanawa.

Please answer the following question: What was the name of the person that painted the painting that the Royal Scottish Academy purchased?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition, The Combat was bought from Etty by fellow artist John Martin for 300 guineas (about £24,000 in 2019 terms), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete. The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.The 1832 exhibition of Youth on the Prow, and...

I tried to put the dogs new toy into the basket, but the  Pick your answer from: [I] basket was too large.; [II] toy was too large.;","output":"[II] toy was too large. As soon as I received the new dog toy from the online pet store, I was quite surprised by its size. The toy was much larger than I had anticipated. The website had described it as medium-sized, but the reality was quite different. It was a plush jumbo-sized bone wrapped in brightly colored fabric. It seemed perfect for a larger breed rather than our small terrier, Caesar. However, Caesar showed immense interest in the toy, his eyes wide with curiosity and anticipation. In our home, we have a designated basket where all of Caesar's toys live. It's a cute wicker basket, robust and just the perfect size for his collection of squeaky toys, rubber balls, and various chewing items. Over time, it has become his personal treasure box where he scurries through every morning, choosing what will keep him entertained for the day. I made an attempt to fit this new toy into the basket, adhering to our unspoken house rule of keeping things organized, especially Caesar's belongings. However, I found myself struggling to even fit half of the toy in. After a few attempts of turning and adjusting, it was clear that this plush bone was just too big. I considered our options. Buying a new, larger basket was one, but it wouldn't quite fit in Caesar's designated corner. Downsizing the toy by taking out a part of its stuffing seemed harsh and unjust to our eagerly waiting pet. We could leave the toy out, but then it would throw off the balance of our well-thought-out decor. Facing this challenge, the solution I finally came up with was to install a small shelf above the current basket. It would be like a dual-story house for Caesar's toys. This way, the smaller toys could remain in the basket, and the larger ones, including this new huge plush bone, could rest on the shelf. I congratulated myself on the thought, not just finding a solution, but an opportunity to enhance Caesar's corner aesthetically too. The meticulously cleaned and polished wood for the shelf matched the rest of the furniture in the room. Looking at Caesar, who was all this while observing with hopeful eyes, I handed him the plush bone. His tail wagged with joy and he trotted away happily with his larger-than-life toy. After all, seeing Caesar happy was what mattered most. It was a simple reminder about life- some problems may seem hard to handle at first, just like the large toy, but with a bit of creativity, practicality, and patience, there's always a way around, a solution waiting to be unearthed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Gorbachev's expansion of Glasnost allowed for open discussion on any subject in the media, breaking away from previous Communist Party restrictions. By appealing directly to the people for support and offering increased civil liberties, Gorbachev effectively bypassed the Central Committee's control and silenced the Party \\"conservatives\\" who opposed political reform.

Movie title: Evening Movie plot: The film alternates between two time periods, the 1950s and the present, in which a dying Ann Grant Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) reflects on her past. Her confusing comments about people she never mentioned before leave her daughters, reserved Constance (Natasha Richardson) and restless Nina (Toni Collette), wondering if their mother is delusional. As a young woman in her early twenties, cabaret singer Ann (Claire Danes) arrives at the spacious Newport, Rhode Island, home of her best friend Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer), who is on the verge of getting married to Karl Ross (Timothy Kiefer). Lila's brother (and Ann's college friend) Buddy (Hugh Dancy) introduces her to Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), a young doctor and the son of a former family servant. Buddy tells Ann his sister always has adored Harris, and expresses his concern that she's marrying another man out of a sense of duty rather than love. Inebriated, Buddy passes out, and as Ann and Harris chat they find themselves bonding. On Lila's wedding day, she confesses to Ann that she confronted Harris with her feelings for him and he rebuffed her, so she goes along with the ceremony as planned and marries Karl. At the reception, at Lila's request, Ann sings a song and is joined on stage by Harris. Afterwards Buddy, drunk again, confronts the two about their growing closeness. Then he unexpectedly kisses Harris. As Lila prepares to depart with her new husband, Ann offers to take the bride away with her, but Lila refuses and leaves for her honeymoon. Buddy admits to Ann he's had a crush on Harris since his childhood, though he also claims not to be \\"that way\\" - he denies that this would be okay as Ann assures him. He then changes the subject, confessing he has loved Ann ever since their college days, offering as proof a note she once sent him he has kept in his pocket ever since. Ann is unconvinced.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose relationship with Shostakovich's was tender?  Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the formula for maximum acceleration? How is this formula determined? How is maximum velocity calculated? How is the formula determined? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"Hello! I'll explain those concepts to you like you're a five-year-old! 1. Maximum acceleration: Acceleration is how fast something speeds up. Think of it like riding a bike or playing on a swing. The faster you pedal or push on the swing, the faster it goes. The formula for maximum acceleration is F = m * a, which means Force (F) = mass (m) * acceleration (a). The mass is how heavy something is, and acceleration is how fast it speeds up. To understand how this formula is determined, imagine pushing a toy car. The harder you push (force), the faster the car speeds up (acceleration). The weight of the car (mass) also plays a role. A heavier car needs more force to speed up than a lighter car. 2. Maximum Velocity: Velocity is how fast something moves in a certain direction. Think of it like how fast a race car goes around a track. To calculate maximum velocity, we need to use this formula: v = u + a * t. In this formula, v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (or the speed before the race starts), a is the acceleration, and t is the time it takes to speed up or slow down. To understand how this formula is determined, imagine pushing a toy car again. If you give it a gentle push and let go, the car starts moving at a certain initial speed (u). If you keep pushing harder, it speeds up (acceleration) over some time (t). The final speed (v) is the sum of initial speed and the speed gained due to acceleration. Now, these two questions are not the same. The first question is about acceleration, which is how fast something speeds up. The second question is about velocity, which is how fast something moves in a certain direction. Both concepts are important, and they help us understand how things move."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid.  Now, I have a new situation: Rob was in his chemistry lab, experimenting with different states of matter. He had a liquid substance that he labeled as state A. He then transformed half of the liquid substance to gaseous state. He labeled it as state B. Finally, he froze the remaining half of the liquid to solid state. He labeled it as state C.  Answer this question please: Which state has less possible arrangements, state A or state B? Answer:","output":"State A has less possible arrangements than state B. Step 1: Understand the context of the states - State A is the liquid state - State B is the gaseous state Step 2: Relate the context to entropy - Entropy is a measure of the number of possible arrangements of particles in a system.  - According to the background provided, when a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements. This is because they are no longer confined to a specified volume. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. Step 3: Compare the entropy in state A and state B - Based on the information about entropy in different states of matter, we can conclude that the gaseous state (State B) has more possible arrangements of particles than the liquid state (State A).

Here is a news article: Image copyright ESA/ROSETTA/NAVCAM Image caption The new report answers one of the big questions of the Rosetta mission      The rubber duck-shaped comet being followed by Europe's Rosetta probe used to be two separate objects.      Scientists say pictures of 67P show its two lobes to have \\"onion skin\\" layers that intersect in a way that can only be the result of two different bodies having collided and stuck together.      Ever since Rosetta arrived at the comet, the origin of its bizarre form has been one of the major puzzles.      The solution is now due to be published in the journal Nature.      Mission team members have also held a media conference to give further details, at the European Planetary Science Congress in Nantes, France.      Rosetta first spied the duck shape on approach to 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in July 2014.      The idea that it was a \\"contact binary\\" - two conjoined comets - was a popular explanation from the word go.      But proving it has not been straightforward. An alternative possibility is simply that the icy dirt ball has been sculpted this way.      Every time it comes around the Sun, 67P's ices warm and it throws off gas and dust, and it could have been that this process has dominated in just one region to produce the distinctive appearance.      The Osiris camera on Rosetta can now settle the debate.      It reveals layers up to 650m thick in the body of the duck that are independent of similar strata detected in its head.      Image copyright ESA/ROSETTA/MPS FOR OSIRIS TEAM Image caption The deep pit at bottom-right shows the internal layering on the duck's body      Additional measurements taken by Rosetta of variations in the local tug of gravity across the lobes also support this two-body origin.      The direction of the tugging is more closely aligned with the independent layering than with a centre of mass associated with a single object.      Union of onions      Scientists say that to collide and stick together, the impact must have been a very low velocity one - perhaps just a few metres per second. Any faster and the primary objects would have done enormous damage to each other.      \\"I would say it's a quite beautiful love story,\\" Matteo Massironi, from the Osiris team, said at Monday's press briefing.      He added that a key piece of evidence was a series of cross-sections of the comet, which the team were able to construct by extending the layers glimpsed on the surface into a 3D model of 67P's interior. These cross-sections painted a clear picture of two distinct sets of layers, reminiscent of a pair of onions.      \\"You don't know the structure of an onion until you cut across it,\\" Dr Massironi said. \\"What we have seen is that this stratification is really continuous - and that [the one in the tail] doesn't match that of the head.\\"      The discovery's consequences for what we understand about comet formation could be quite profound, says team member Stephen Lowry from Kent University, UK.      \\"It shows that comets were forming into large sizes and that they were then still colliding in this grown form to make even larger comets. So, it's not simply a case of independent comets completely forming out of centimetre- or metre-sized planetesimals, to make the comets we see today. And that's really quite fascinating, because it could be quite a ubiquitous process.\\"      Image copyright ESA/ROSETTA/MPS FOR OSIRIS TEAM Image caption The local gravity field supports the idea that 67P was once two separate objects rather than a single formation      Other comets seen at relatively close quarters also display lobed shapes, including comets Halley, Borrelly and Hartley-2. Could they also be the result of low-velocity bump-and-stick events?      The tantalising prospect now is whether what was once two objects could split into two again. Could the constant erosion of gas and dust result in the duck losing its head? And will Rosetta be on hand to witness it?      The European Space Agency (Esa) probe has pictured a crack in the neck region of 67P, says Dr Lowry.      \\"If a comet is going to split, it's most likely to break along the interface between the two lobes. But I haven't seen any evidence yet that the crack is getting longer or wider. That's a strong indicator to me that perhaps 67P won't split on this orbit of the Sun.\\"      Image copyright NASA Image caption Comets Borrelly and Hartley-2 have lobed shapes.

At that point the spacecraft will spiral gradually closer and land yet again on 67P, said Esa project scientist Matt Taylor at the press conference - making a reference to the Philae lander's bumpy touchdown in November 2014.      He added that although the comet had passed its \\"perihelion\\" (its closest approach to the Sun), the mission was really only just beginning. \\"The papers are starting to flow.\\"      Comet 67P - \\"Space duck\\" in numbers      A full rotation of the body takes just over 12.4 hours      The axis of rotation runs through the \\"neck\\" region      Its larger lobe (\\"body\\") is about 4.1 × 3.3 × 1.8 km      The smaller lobe (\\"head\\") is about 2.6 × 2.3 × 1.8 km      Gravity measurements give a mass of 10 billion tonnes      Mapping estimates the volume to be about 21.4 cubic km      The density works out at about 470kg per cubic metre      This would imply that Comet 67P is highly porous      It is 70-80% empty space, but are there big voids inside?

In a paper published in Nature, researchers say that the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is made of two formerly distinct bodies that likely came together in a gentle collision in the early stages of the solar system.      It's a cometary partnership that has lasted billions of years.      The European Space Agency's Rosetta orbiter began sending back the earliest images of comet 67P's strange, bi-lobed shape in July 2014, and scientists have been wondering about the origins of its unusual morphology ever since.      The comet has three distinct regions -- a major lobe (the main body of the \\"duck\\"), a minor lobe (the head) and a thin, neck-like region that connects the two.      \\"Since we resolved the comet, the question of whether it was two objects that joined together or one comet that has been eaten away has been dangling,\\" said Matt Taylor of the European Space Agency, project scientist for the Rosetta mission. \\"Now we have answered it -- it's a contact binary.\\"      To come to this conclusion, an international research team analyzed images of the comet collected by cameras aboard the Rosetta orbiter.      The scientists were particularly interested in the distinct layers of material called strata that were visible along the comet's many steep cliffs, and which continue at least 2,000 feet into the center of its nucleus. These concentric strata suggest that the structure of the comet is similar to that of an onion.      If the comet had always been just one body with what looks like a bite taken out of it, the scientists would expect to see the layers on both lobes arranged around a center point of gravity close to the neck. Instead, the researchers observed that the layers were generally well-ordered around the local gravity of each lobe. This suggests the lobes formed individually, each around their own center of mass.

(European Space Agency / Rosetta / MPS for OSIRIS Team) (European Space Agency / Rosetta / MPS for OSIRIS Team)      The scientists were also able to show that the strata across the neck region do not match up with the strata on either the body or the head of the comet.      Finally, the team looked at gravity vectors that run perpendicular to the strata and found that they matched computer models of two separate objects, rather than a single object.      See the most-read Science stories this hour >>      \\"All together, these three lines of evidence leave a very narrow space for doubt,\\" said Matteo Massironi of the University of Padua in Italy, who led the investigation.      Joseph Masiero, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who specializes in asteroids and comets, said the argument is convincing.      \\"If you put it together, it looks like you have two onions sitting next to each other, not a single onion with a piece taken out,\\" said Masiero, who wasn't involved in the study.      The authors note that the two lobes of comet 67P are strikingly similar in terms of their structure, which suggests that both lobes may have come from the same region of the solar system, or at least formed through similar processes, Taylor said.      However, questions remain. The paper does not address what processes helped these two bodies become one. Most impacts cause objects to break apart, not stick together. Could these two objects simply have nudged each other and then became stuck?      Possibly. In a paper published earlier this year in Science, a different set of researchers used 3-D computer simulations to show how two bodies moving at bicycle speed might gently collide and then merge together. They also found that a very low-velocity impact would displace some but not all of the material on the two bodies involved.      Massironi said the two objects that make up comet 67P are not necessarily being held together by gravity alone.      \\"There could have been some processes of cementation during the collision itself and in the following evolution of the comet,\\" he said.      It seems more work will need to be done on that line of inquiry as well.      \\"They convinced me that these are two things stuck together,\\" Masiero said. \\"But how do you stick them together?

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found is accurate, but it only covers a portion of what Freedom Summer was. To provide you with a more detailed understanding, Freedom Summer, also known as the Mississippi Summer Project, was a voter registration drive held in 1964 aimed at increasing the number of registered African American voters in Mississippi. The southern state was known for its institutionalized racial segregation and violent suppression of black voting rights. The project was indeed organized by the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), a coalition of the Mississippi branches of the four major civil rights organizations: the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The Freedom Summer campaign involved over a thousand volunteers, mostly white college students from the North, who worked alongside local African American activists. They engaged in various activities such as establishing \\"Freedom Schools,\\" which provided alternative education with a focus on black history, literacy training, and civic engagement. They also established community centers and offered legal assistance for African American citizens. However, the Freedom Summer was met with significant resistance from local white supremacists, often leading to violence against the activists. There were numerous incidents of beatings, bombings, and arrests. The most infamous event occurred when three civil rights workers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, were abducted and murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Despite the challenges and violence, Freedom Summer played a pivotal role in raising awareness about the pervasive racial discrimination and voter suppression in the South. It also contributed to the eventual passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting practices and substantially increased African American voter registration."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was the eldest of six children born to Nancy Hamilton (1901-1972) and Joseph Hayes (1887-1978). The Hayes children were: Ira (1923-1955), Harold (1924-1925), Arlene (1926-1929), Leonard (1927-1952), Vernon (1929-1958), and Kenneth (born 1931). Joseph Hayes was a World War Context: Hayes enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve on August 26, 1942. He completed recruit training in Platoon 701 at Marine Corps Base, San Diego (renamed in 1948, Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego) and in October volunteered for Marine paratrooper (Paramarine) training at the Marine Parachute School at Camp Gillespie located east of San Diego. He received the codename of Chief Falling Cloud. On November 30, he graduated from the Parachute Training School and received his silver \\"jump wings\\". On December 1, he was promoted to Private First Class.  On December 2, 1942, he joined Company B, 3rd Parachute Battalion, Divisional Special Troops, 3rd Marine Division, at Camp Elliott, California. On March 14, 1943, Hayes sailed for New Caledonia with the 3rd Parachute Battalion, which was assigned to Camp Kiser there on March 25 until September 26; the unit was redesignated in April as Company K, 3rd Parachute Battalion, 1st Marine Parachute Regiment of the I Marine Amphibious Corps. The 3rd battalion was shipped to Guadalcanal and remained there until it was sent to Vella Lavella, arriving on October 14 for occupational duty. On December 4, Hayes landed with the 3rd battalion on Bougainville and fought against the Japanese as a platoon automatic rifleman (BAR man) with Company K during the Bougainville Campaign. The 3rd Parachute Battalion was shipped back to Guadalcanal, and he stayed there until sometime in February when the Paramarines were sent back to California. The 1st Parachute Regiment was officially disbanded at Camp Pendleton, California, in February 1944.  Hayes was transferred to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment of the newly activated 5th Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. Hayes sailed to Hawaii with his company in September for continued training with the 5th division as it trained for the invasion and capture of Iwo Jima.

In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump.

Grant, Biscuit, and Milo are punks living in Queens. Bored with their lives, they decide to move to Los Angeles, and set out on a cross-country drive. In Utah they assist Elvis impersonator \\"Daredelvis\\" with getting his trailer unstuck. Later, Grant sees a mirage of a cowboy on horseback. While camping in the Arizona desert they are attacked by a gang of vicious rednecks, and Milo is murdered by their leader, Missoula. Grant and Biscuit escape and collapse in the desert, where Grant again sees a vision of the cowboy. The local sheriffs do not believe the boys' story, having no record of Missoula or his gang and being unable to find Milo's body as evidence of the murder. Grant resolves to track down the gang and avenge Milo's death, despite Biscuit's reservations. Heading back into Utah, they find one of the gang's trucks overturned and several of the members dead. Before dying, one of them reveals that they planned to turn themselves in but were killed by Missoula, who is headed north through Wyoming to Montana. The boys also meet Jessie, a young woman who runs a gas station and towing business. Catching up to Missoula's truck, Grant and Biscuit engage in a high-speed shootout with Missoula and his buddy Blix, but swerve off the road and crash. They are rescued by Jessie, who teaches Grant how to shoot and ride a horse and strikes up a romance with him. Meanwhile, Biscuit has a dream in which he is part of a Native American tribe who are slaughtered by Union Army soldiers led by Missoula. Upon awakening, he begins to imitate a Native American warrior and insists on resuming the pursuit.

Although words related in form or meaning, e.g. Hellenist (Ancient Greek: Ἑλληνιστής, Hellēnistēs), have been attested since ancient times, it was J. G. Droysen in the mid-19th century, who in his classic work Geschichte des Hellenismus, i.e. History of Hellenism, coined the term Hellenistic to refer to and define the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander’s conquest. Following Droysen, Hellenistic and related terms, e.g. Hellenism, have been widely used in various contexts; a notable such use is in Culture and Anarchy by Matthew Arnold, where Hellenism is used in contrast with Hebraism.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question, \\"Which of the following does not refer to the same work: History of Hellenism, Geschichte des Hellenismus, or Culture and Anarchy?\\" is Culture and Anarchy. Both \\"History of Hellenism\\" and \\"Geschichte des Hellenismus\\" refer to the same work, as they are simply translations of the title of J.G.

Droysen coined the term \\"Hellenistic\\" in this work to describe the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander the Great's conquests. On the other hand, \\"Culture and Anarchy\\" is a different work altogether. It was written by Matthew Arnold and does not solely focus on Hellenism. Instead, it is a collection of essays on culture, politics, and society. In this work, Arnold uses the term \\"Hellenism\\" in contrast to \\"Hebraism,\\" discussing the importance of these two concepts in shaping the cultural and intellectual life of his time.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which is the outermost layer of the atmosphere????","output":"The outermost layer of the atmosphere is called the exosphere. The Earth's atmosphere is composed of several layers that extend from the Earth's surface to approximately 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) further into space. These layers are defined based on temperature variations and composition. Let's discuss the various layers of the atmosphere and provide a brief explanation of the exosphere, with its specific characteristics and relevance. 1. Troposphere: This is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, extending from the Earth's surface to an altitude of about 4 to 12 miles (6 to 20 kilometers) depending on the location. It contains roughly 80% of the total mass of the atmosphere and is the region where weather occurs, including clouds, storms, and precipitation. 2. Stratosphere: The stratosphere lies above the troposphere, extending from an altitude of around 12 miles (20 kilometers) up to around 31 miles (50 kilometers). The temperature in this layer generally increases with altitude due to the presence of the ozone layer, which absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation and protects life on Earth from harmful effects. 3. Mesosphere: The mesosphere stretches from the top of the stratosphere at about 31 miles (50 kilometers) to about 53 miles (85 kilometers) in altitude. In this layer, temperatures decrease with altitude, reaching their lowest point at the mesopause, which lies at the boundary of the mesosphere and the next layer. 4. Thermosphere: This is the layer above the mesosphere, extending from about 53 miles (85 kilometers) to about 373 miles (600 kilometers) above the Earth's surface. Here, the temperature increases with altitude due to the absorption of high-energy solar radiation by the low-density gases present. The thermosphere is also the region where auroras occur and where the International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth. 5. Exosphere: The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere, starting at the outer edge of the thermosphere at around 373 miles (600 kilometers) above the Earth and extending up to 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) or more, merging seamlessly with interplanetary space. This layer is composed mainly of low-density hydrogen, helium, and other trace gases. The exosphere is characterized by sparsely scattered gas particles that gradually get thinner and eventually merge with the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Since the exosphere lacks a definitive boundary separating it from interplanetary space, its outer limit is poorly defined. The main importance of this layer lies in the fact that it acts as the medium through which satellites (especially those in geostationary orbits) and other man-made objects orbit the Earth. Additionally, it helps protect life on Earth from solar radiation and space debris through various interacting phenomena. In summary, the exosphere is the outermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere, characterized by very low density and primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and some trace gases. This layer merges gradually into interplanetary space and plays an essential role in supporting satellite communication and protecting Earth from space debris and solar radiation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: John Kenneth Galbraith  (October 15, 1908 - April 29, 2006), also known as Ken Galbraith, was a Canadian-born economist, public official, and diplomat, and a leading proponent of 20th-century American liberalism. His books on economic topics were bestsellers from the 1950s through the 2000s, during which time Galbraith fulfilled the role of public intellectual. As an economist, he leaned toward post-Keynesian economics from an institutionalist perspective. Galbraith was a long-time Harvard faculty member and stayed with Harvard University for half a century as a professor of economics. Context: In February 1946, Galbraith took a leave of absence from his magazine work for a senior position in the State Department as director of the Office of Economic Security Policy where he was nominally in charge of economic affairs regarding Germany, Japan, Austria, and South Korea. He was distrusted by the senior diplomats so he was relegated to routine work with few opportunities to make policy. Galbraith favored detente with the Soviet Union, along with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and General Lucius D. Clay, a military governor of the US Zone in Germany from 1947 to 1949, but they were out of step with the containment policy then being developed by George Kennan and favored by the majority of the US major policymakers. After a disconcerting half-year, Galbraith resigned in September 1946 and went back to his magazine writing on economics issues. Later, he immortalized his frustration with \\"the ways of Foggy Bottom\\" in a satirical novel, The Triumph (1968). The postwar period also was memorable for Galbraith because of his work, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, to establish a progressive policy organization Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) in support of the cause of economic and social justice in 1947.  During his time as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith was appointed United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. His rapport with President Kennedy was such that he regularly bypassed the State Department and sent his diplomatic cables directly to the president. In India, he became a confidant of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and extensively advised the Indian government on economic matters. In 1966, when he was no longer ambassador, he told the United States Senate that one of the main causes of the 1965 Kashmir war was American military aid to Pakistan.  While in India, he helped establish one of the first computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Even after leaving office, Galbraith remained a friend and supporter of India. Because of his recommendation, First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy undertook her 1962 diplomatic missions in India and Pakistan.  In autumn 1972 Galbraith was an adviser and assistant to Nixon's rival candidate George McGovern in the election campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled in to China in his role as president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong's communist government with the economists Leontief and Tobin and in 1973 published an account of his experiences in A China Passage. Galbraith wrote that there was \\"no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system,\\" \\"[d]issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, one suspects, with great politeness,\\" \\"Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York,\\" and considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%. Question: Did he meet anyone famous? Answer:","output":"Yes, John Kenneth Galbraith met several famous individuals throughout his career. Some of the notable people he met and interacted with include President John F. Kennedy, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Eleanor Roosevelt, Hubert Humphrey, General Lucius D. Clay, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, and Mao Zedong's communist government representatives in China. Due to his prominent role in economics, policy, and diplomacy, Galbraith had the opportunity to meet and engage with influential figures of his time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Every day he runs up and down a hill near his house until he is out of breath, then walks around his house until his breathing rate returns to normal.  Will breathing rate increase or decrease when the body requires more energy to preform a task such as running?  Hint: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Answer:","output":"Breathing rate will increase when the body requires more energy to perform a task such as running. This is because the body needs more oxygen to support the increased energy demand, which is provided through the process of cellular respiration. As a result, the faster breathing rate helps supply more oxygen to the cells, allowing them to produce more ATP molecules from glucose to meet the energy requirements for the task."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the place that U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect?  Petrified Forest National Park straddles the border between Apache County and Navajo County in northeastern Arizona. The park is about 30 miles (48 km) long from north to south, and its width varies from a maximum of about 12 miles (19 km) in the north to a minimum of about 1 mile (1.6 km) along a narrow corridor between the north and south, where the park widens again to about 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8 km).I-40, former U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect the park generally east–west along a similar route. Adamana, a ghost town, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the park along the BNSF tracks. Holbrook, about 26 miles (42 km) west of park headquarters along I-40, is the nearest city. Bisecting the park north–south is Park Road, which runs between I-40 near park headquarters on the north and U.S. Route 180 on the south. Historic Highway 180, an earlier alignment of the modern route, crosses the southern edge of the park. Like Route 66, it has deteriorated and is closed. Many unpaved maintenance roads, closed to the public, intersect Park Road at various points.The fee area of the park covers about 230 square miles (600 km2). The Navajo Nation borders the park on the north and northeast. State-owned land, federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, and private land, much of it used for cattle ranching, adjoin the other borders. The park’s elevation above sea level varies from a low of 5,340 feet (1,630 m) along the Puerco River to a high of 6,230 feet (1,900 m) at Pilot Rock; the average elevation is about 5,400 feet (1,600 m). The terrain varies from gentle hills and major petrified wood deposits in the south to eroded badlands in the north.  Most of the park's intermittent streams—including Lithodendron Wash, Dead Wash, Ninemile Wash, and Dry Wash—empty into the Puerco River. In the southern part of the park, Cottonwood Wash and Jim Camp Wash flow into the Little Colorado River.

(CNN) -- Former England and Mexico coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has been appointed as coach of the Ivory Coast national team for the World Cup finals in South Africa. Eriksson led England to the quarterfinals of both the 2002 and 2006 World Cup finals but had a less successful spell with Mexico, and was sacked from that post in April last year. The Swede was recently director of football at lower league English side Notts County, but left that position when the club ran into financial difficulties. The appointment of Eriksson was announced live on national television on Sunday evening by Souleymane Alex Bamba, a member of Ivory Coast's Football Federation. \\"The OPTIONS: - CNN has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - England has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - English has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Eriksson has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Football Federation has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Former England has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Ivory Coast has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Mexico has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Notts County has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Souleymane Alex Bamba has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - South Africa has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Sven-Goran Eriksson has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Swede has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - Swede Eriksson has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. - World Cup has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico.","output":"\\"The appointment of Eriksson marks yet another milestone in his already decorated career, as he has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. The Ivory Coast Football Federation is hopeful that Eriksson's experience and tactical acumen will help the national team make a deep run in the World Cup finals in South Africa. The Elephants, as the team is fondly known, are no strangers to the global stage as they boast an impressive array of talent, including stars such as Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure. With Eriksson at the helm, expectations are high for the Ivory Coast to make history and potentially bring home their first World Cup trophy. Eriksson's first order of business will be to assess the current squad and make any necessary adjustments before the tournament begins. He will also need to work closely with his coaching staff to devise a game plan that fully utilizes the team's strengths while mitigating any potential weaknesses. The Ivory Coast will be facing stiff competition in the group stage, but Eriksson's experience in previous World Cups should serve as a valuable asset in navigating this difficult path. However, Eriksson's appointment has not been without controversy, as critics have pointed to his mixed track record. His tenure with Mexico, which ended in a dismissal after a series of lackluster results, has led some to question if the Swede can still deliver on the world stage. Moreover, his previous involvement in Notts County's financial difficulties has cast a shadow over his managerial prowess. Nevertheless, the Ivory Coast Football Federation and the players remain optimistic about their chances under Eriksson's guidance. Souleymane Alex Bamba, of the Ivory Coast Football Federation, noted during the announcement that Eriksson's global experience and extensive knowledge of the sport make him an ideal candidate to maximize the team's potential in the World Cup. Fans and supporters are also rallying behind their team, eager to see them rise to the occasion and etch their names in football history. As preparations continue and the excitement around the tournament mounts, all eyes will be on Sven-Goran Eriksson and the Ivory Coast national team as they embark on their journey in South Africa. With a combination of experience, talent, and grit, the Elephants are determined to prove that they are a force to be reckoned with on the world stage. The upcoming World Cup in South Africa presents the perfect opportunity for Eriksson and his players to silence their critics and achieve success for their proud nation.\\""},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being.  By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... According to the above context, answer the following question. What will be the result of people not hiding their emotions probably? Answer:","output":"The result of people not hiding their emotions will likely be a healthier expression and release of various emotions, leading to improved mental health and overall well-being. By acknowledging and allowing themselves to experience emotions, individuals can prevent the buildup of stress and anxiety that comes from avoiding or suppressing feelings. In turn, this prevents potential emotional eruptions that may cause harm to oneself or others. By expressing emotions in appropriate ways, people can effectively manage challenges, such as self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression, leading to a happier, healthier, and more balanced life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the lung is not able to produce happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves the lung not being able to produce (I assume you meant not able to function properly) and the liver having to work softer (I assume you meant that the liver has to compensate for the lung's inability to function correctly).  If the lung is not able to function properly, it will affect the overall oxygen supply and the removal of carbon dioxide from the body, which can negatively impact various body functions and organs, including the liver. The liver requires oxygen to efficiently perform its functions, including removing toxins from the blood, processing and storing nutrients, and producing bile. The perturbation might indirectly affect the liver's ability to carry out its processes. As a result, the liver may have to work harder to maintain its functions in a reduced-oxygen environment, and it might not be as efficient in processing nutrients and removing toxins. This scenario can lead to a potential buildup of waste materials and decreased nutrient absorption, ultimately affecting the overall health of the body.

Q: One student started packing up at the beginning of a lab exercise. I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult. It would be very inappropriate of me to follow you around, inviting you to office hours. And you must do the homework and the labs.” He stayed for the lab. I notified his counselor about what was going on, and she called him in and said the same things that I said.

Article: A letter of reply is sometimes a most treasured thing. Here is a story that tells about this common and natural human feeling. The busiest woman in Labrador during one bitter cold Christmas not very long ago, was an Australian nurse named Kate Austen. But Nurse Austen was not too busy to write with a long, friendly letter for every gift of food or clothing received for poor villagers in the north of Australian. Among the gifts was a box of knittings   for children, knitted and sent by a woman in Toronto. Nurse Austen, was busy, and not feeling too well that winter. She could have written just ordinary routine notes of acknowledgement. But that was not her way. She sat down and wrote the woman in Toronto a real letter telling all about the village, and the names of the children who were wearing the knitted gloves and caps, and what they said when they got them, and how they looked when they wore them. She wanted the woman who had knitted and sent all those lovely knittings \\"to see how much happiness and warmth she had created.\\" Not long after, she received the following answer from Canada. Dear Miss Austen, Your letter made me happy. I did not expect such a full return, I am eighty years old, and I am blind. There is little I can do expect knit, and that is why I knit so many caps and sweaters scarves. For sixty years I have been making up missionary packages of such clothing or food or medicine or book as I could collect. But never before in all that time have I had a personal letter picturing the village and telling me who is wearing the clothing and what they said. I did not suppose that ever in my lifetime I should receive a letter like that. My God bless you. Sincerely yours,                                                                  Laura N. Russell ,.

Exhausted but jubilant, about a dozen of nearly 30 supporters who had filled a suite at the tony Olympic Fairmont Hotel overnight leaped to their feet as the verdict was reported on a wide-screen television and began hugging one another. A few huddled together for a quick prayer.      \\"It was remembering Meredith,\\" Margaret Ralph, an old friend of Knox's mother, said of victim Meredith Kercher, who was found stabbed to death in the apartment she shared with Knox in Italy in 2007.      \\"Meredith lost her life.

October 3, 2011 at 3:55 AM      Posted by Jonathan Martin      Sept. 27 – Defense lawyer says Knox is less of a “femme fatale” and more like Jessica Rabbit – just drawn that way.      Sept. 24 – Prosecutors ask court to increase Knox and Sollecito’s sentences to life in prison.      Sept. 7 – Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman rejects a prosecution request for new DNA testing. Prosecution requests to introduce newly found records about the DNA tests, and to hear a new witness are also dismissed. The hearing is adjourned until September 23.      Dec. 4 —The eight-member jury finds Knox and Sollecito guilty, sentencing them to 26 and 25 years, respectively.      Oct. 28, 2008 — Judge Paolo Micheli convicts Guede of murder and sexual assault, and sentences him to 30 years. Guede appeals. Micheli also orders Knox and Sollecito to stand trial on charges of murder and sexual assault.      Nov. 20 — A fourth suspect, an Italian citizen originally from the Ivory Coast, Rudy Guede, 21, is apprehended in Germany. Meanwhile, Lumumba is released from custody due to a lack of evidence.      Nov. 9 — An Italian court rules that Knox, Sollecito and Lumumba can remain in jail for up to one year during the investigation.      Nov. 6 — Knox, her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 23, and nightclub owner Patrick Diya Lumumba, 44, are arrested by Italian police. All three say they are innocent.      Nov. 1, 2007 — 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher is found dead in the bedroom of the apartment in Perugia, Italy, that she shared with 20-year-old University of Washington student Amanda Knox. The cause of death is a stab wound to the neck. Police allege that Kercher was killed while fending off a sexual assault.      UPDATE 1:35 p.m. Margaret Ralph, the parent of Knox's former Seattle Prep schoolmate and soccer teammate, said Knox will likely need time to rehabilitate. \\"Imagine being behind cement walls and bars for four years, and knowing you're innocent,\\" said Ralph.      \\"I'm sure she's wounded, but she has all this support from her family, her friends, her community. And she's going to have to find a way to deal with the people who still think she's guilty.\\"      UPDATE 1:26 p.m. Pamela Van Swearingen, a Seattle attorney, helped research Knox's options to appeal to the European Union human rights court. \\"This is wonderful, righting a big wrong,\\" she said.      Since the prosecution can still appeal, Van Swearingen said Knox's family should expedite her exit. \\"I hope they will get Amanda Knox out of Italy very quickly,\\" she said.      Knox was fined more than 22,000 Euros on the slander charge, but Van Swearingen said raising that should not be a problem now. \\"I think people will be very helpful with the fundraising,\\" she said.      UPDATE 1:23 p.m. Joe Starr said he hopes to get a text message soon from Chris Mellas, his best friend and the father-in-law of Knox, saying they were on their way to the airport.      Unlike the verdict in the 2009 trial, the Knox family did not buy a ticket in advance for Knox, Starr said. And contrary to media reports in London, no one has booked a privated jet to fly Knox home, he said.      Knox's passport expired while she was in prison for four years, according to media reports. But Starr said he expected the state department will help. \\"Once she gets to customs, I don't think anyone will argue who she is,\\" said Starr.      UPDATE 1:00 p.m. Tom Wright, surrounded by dozens of journalists, expressed sympathy to Kercher's family, saying this is a \\"solemn occasion.\\" He then congratulated Raffaele Sollecito, and Knox's family.      \\"To Amanda herself, we say, way to go kid.

He said the campaign to prove Knox's innocence was the work \\" of four years and thousands of people. We did it.\\"      UPDATE 12:50 p.m. Amanda Knox acquitted in the 2007 murder of her British roommate Meredith Kercher.      In the room at the Fairmont, there were cries of \\"Yes\\" and hugs everywhere, as the verdict was read.      Before the translation of the verdict was heard, Tom Wright, one of Knox's staunches supporters, sat stunned. \\"Everybody is hugging (in court), so that looks good\\"            UPDATE 12:05 p.m. With a verdict rendered and Knox and Sollecito on their way from prison to hear it, one question arising at the Friends of Amanda gathering in Seattle is whether the verdict will tamp down the blog wars that have waged over the case.      Each side - the \\"innocentisti\\" (innocents) and \\"colpevolisti\\" (guilties) - have taken their shots. Knox's step-father, Chris Mellas, has done battle on comment threads, and Italian police at one point arrested an innocentisti blogger in Perugia.      Peggy Ganong, a Seattle translator who helps run a \\"colpevolisti\\" web forum, complained to Seattle Police about alleged online stalking via comment threads on one website. The investigation is now closed.      On the innocentisi side, Karen Pruett, who runs a Facebook page on Knox, said she's called the FBI three times because photos of Amanda Knox's school-aged step-sisters appeared on a colpevolisti site. Most of the links to the photos disappeared, but Pruett wonders why the photos needed to be posted at all.      \\"It tells me they (the colpevolisti) are obsessed with Amanda, and not all that interested in the case itself,\\" said Pruett, a hairdresser on Vashon Island. \\"There is just so much obsession with Amanda's family and Raffaele's family.\\"      UPDATE 11:10 a.m.The court in Perugia hearing the appeal says the verdict is now expected at around 12:30 p.m. PDT.      UPDATE 9:15a.m.If Knox is not acquitted on appeal, she can appeal to Italy's highest court, which is similar to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Italian high court looks at procedures and issues previously argued in the lower courts to come to a decision. The prosecution can also appeal to the high court if Knox is acquitted, according to several news agencies.      UPDATE 7:50 a.m. About a dozen supporters are hunkered down at a suite in the downtown Seattle Fairmont Olympic hotel, watching the news conference held by Meredith Kercher's family.      One of the questions lurking in the background here involves the slander charges against Knox and her parents. Knox was convicted of criminal slander for falsely accusing her former boss, Patrick Lumumba, fined 80,000 Euros and sentenced to a year in prison. A second slander case against Knox, for accusing police detectives of hitting her during an interrogation, is on hold.      Her appeal includes the slander charge against Lumumba. Mike Heavey, a Knox suporter and King County Superior court judge, said the jurors could vacate the conviction and the fine as part of today's decision. Knox was also fined and ordered to pay 4 million Euros to the Kercher family as part of her murder conviction; that fine is also in play with the verdict.      Among the theories being floated here is that Knox could be acquitted of the murder conviction but having her slander charge upheld, and released on time served.      Two other slander charges, against both Knox and her parents, involving their allegation that Italian police hit her during an interrogation, are on hold, pending this appeal.      \\"Hopefully those wouldn't go forward if this criminal case is dismissed,\\" said Anne Bremner, a spokeswoman for Friends of Amanda.      Speaking of defamation, the Knox family has spoken with a Seattle attorney, Mark Walters about potentially suing over a Lifetime movie based on the case. Walters, who is at the Fairmont Olympic suite are gathered, declined to talk about any conversations with the Knox family.      UPDATE: Both defendants gave emotional closing statements.      A verdict is not expected until around 11 a.m. local time. We'll be updating throughout the morning.      ORIGINAL POST: A homegrown group of Amanda Knox's most dedicated defenders are planning a private gathering at a Seattle hotel very early Monday, hoping for a celebration but bracing for something else.      A verdict in the Italian appeals trial of Knox, the former University of Washington student convicted in the bloody and sensational 2007 murder of her roommate, Meredith Kercher, is expected as early as 3 a.m. Seattle time. Knox is expected to speak about three hours earlier to the Italian court and jurors.      The early-morning gathering is to be held by Friends of Amanda, an ad hoc group of family friends, attorneys, forensic scientists and retired law enforcement. The group formed to battle inflammatory descriptions of Knox, but evolved into an innocence campaign seeking to debunk key forensic evidence.      \\"I think it's had a hugely positive effect,\\" said Mark Waterbury, a Redmond forensic scientist who did not know Knox before the case, but wrote a book debunking the DNA evidence presented against her.            A cottage industry has grown up around the case, with at least 10 books, a television movie and dozens of websites dedicated to parsing evidence as well as Knox's psyche. Defenders such as Waterbury have been ridiculed and celebrated.      Opinions of the case are hot enough that organizers of Monday's event asked that its location not be disclosed, to prevent anti-Knox protesters from crashing.      Most of Knox's large family -- including her parents, sister and two half-sisters, aunts and several classmates -- were in Perugia on Monday, anticipating a celebration. The Italian court is hearing a \\"de novo\\" appeal, allowing it to re-examine all the evidence. The six jurors and two presiding judges could vacate the conviction, or they could reaffirm the 2009 trial verdict and give Knox a life sentence, as prosecutors have asked.      Anne Bremner, a Seattle attorney and spokeswoman for Friends of Amanda, said Knox, now 24, could potentially be held in prison or required to stay in Italy even if her conviction is vacated, should prosecutors appeal.      \\"Given the history of this case, her attorneys have prepped for any eventuality,\\" Bremner said.      It also is unlikely that Knox would return to Seattle immediately if she is released, to give her time relax and to avoid the sensational international media frenzy in an undisclosed location.      Knox has repeatedly said she hopes to return home, and her family has said she is likely to write a book. In recent weeks, supporters have been asking local business leaders to consider hiring Knox if she returns.      \\"I think Seattle is about the best place for a person like Amanda Knox,\\" said Bremner. \\"It is not the type of town that hassles people who are famous,\\" she said, citing Bill Gates and Mary Kay LeTourneau, Bremner's former client.      Knox has done correspondence course work at the University of Washington while in prison, but has not graduated, according to the UW.      Knox grew up in West Seattle with a younger sister. Her parents, Curt and Edda Knox, divorced while she was a toddler. Her parents each remarried, and retained homes within blocks of each other.      Knox, a Seattle Prep graduate, was a dean's list student studying Romance languages when she enrolled in the University for Foreigners in Perugia in October 2007. She had saved 7,000 for her junior year abroad, working at a University District coffee shop and an art gallery and Seattle Mariners games.      She rented a room in a home with three other girls, including Kercher, just outside of Perugia. Just weeks before the murder, she met Raffaele Sollecito, an Italian computer science student, at a classical music recital. \\"I'm in love,\\" she wrote in a message to friends back in Seattle.      On Nov. 4, 2007, days after Kercher's body was found, Knox wrote a letter to her mother, Edda Mellas, saying she wanted to stay in Perugia.      \\"I am not afraid of Italy. I am not afraid of anything in particular. I am afraid because I am confused,\\" Knox wrote.      She was arrested the next day, and in a statement that was later thrown out by an Italian court, implicated Patrick Lumumba, her boss at a bar where she had worked. She wrote a new statement on Nov. 6, 2007, saying she'd been at home with Sollecito the night of the murder.      She has steadfastly professed her innocence ever since. She was convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 26 years in prison.      Knox's family remained silent for months after the arrest on the advice of Italian lawyers, declined interview requests from The Seattle Times and other outlets, even as British and Italian tabloids inaccurately sensationalized her as hard partying and sexually voracious.      In response to that coverage and leaks from Italian law enforcement, which also proved inaccurate, the parents of several of Knox's classmates at Seattle Prep formed Friends of Amanda to defend her.      Bremner, who came on later, described the effort as \\"turning a supertanker of bad information coming from leaks out of a closed proceeding.\\"      Their website has now received nearly 800,000 hits, and the group has raised at least 80,000 to defray her legal bills, well over 1 million.      King County Superior Court Judge Mike Heavey, whose daughter attended Seattle Prep with Knox, wrote a letter on court letterhead to the presiding Italian judge, questioning the conduct of Knox's prosecutor and police and asking the trial to be moved out of Perugia. The Washington State Judicial Conduct Commission admonished him in 2010 for improperly influencing a pending case .      using the prestige of his judicial office to advance the private interests of another (Knox).      Others, however, agreed. An American writer, Douglas Preston, assisted Knox's defenders by telling of his alleged mistreatment by the lead prosecutor on the Knox case. A criminal investigator, several forensic experts and a retired FBI agent also publicly rebutted evidence they said had been manipulated or wrongly analyzed by Italian law enforcement.      Their key forensic rebuttal involved so-called \\"low copy DNA\\" samples taken from the alleged murder weapon, a kitchen knife seized at Sollecito's apartment allegedly containing both Knox's and Kercher's DNA. Waterbury, the Redmond biotech entrepreneur, labeled the DNA testing as \\"pretend science.\\"      During Knox's appeal this summer and fall, an independent review of the knife DNA essentially agreed with Knox's defenders, finding that the sample was too low to be admitted as evidence.      But prosecutors pushed back on that finding during the appeal, and emphasized other evidence, including alleged telltales of a staged break-in at the murder scene.      Knox's defenders, in Seattle and online, have deployed strong rhetoric in her defense.      At a Seattle University symposium in April, Steve Moore, a retired FBI agent who once oversaw Al Queda investigations, compared Knox's prosecution to a \\"lynching.\\"      \\"This will be an academy class in most forensic academies, I hope,\\" said Moore. \\"This is the worst case I have ever seen in a western country.\\"       ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a brief statement or account of the main points of something.

Let's break down and analyze each component of this data for a more comprehensive understanding: 1. (19255) 1994 VK8: This is an alphanumeric code identifying a particular celestial object:    - \\"19255\\": This is the assigned number or catalog designation of the celestial body, revealing its discovery sequence.    - \\"1994\\": This signifies the year of discovery, indicating that the object was first observed or recorded in 1994.    - \\"VK8\\": These characters form a provisional designation that consists of two letters and a number, providing additional details about the time of discovery and the specific order of discovery. In this code, \\"V\\" represents the half-month (period of 15 days) in which the object was discovered, \\"K\\" is a letter indicating the sequence of discovery within that half-month, and \\"8\\" denotes the numeric order of discoveries made in that sequence. 2. Periapsis: The term \\"periapsis\\" is a general term used in celestial mechanics to describe the point at which an orbiting object is closest to the celestial body it is orbiting. For objects orbiting Earth or another planet, the specific term \\"perigee\\" or \\"perihelion\\" is used, respectively. In the context of this data, it represents the closest distance that (19255) 1994 VK8 approaches to the Sun in its orbit. 3. 6155910000000.0: This number represents the value of the periapsis distance of (19255) 1994 VK8 in meters. It can be read as 6.15591 x 10¹² meters or approximately 6.156 trillion meters (6155.91 million km). This value indicates the minimum distance between (19255) 1994 VK8 and the Sun during this celestial object's orbital path. Putting it all together, the provided data offers information about a specific celestial object, (19255) 1994 VK8, discovered in 1994. This celestial object's orbit around the Sun has a minimum distance of approximately 6.156 trillion meters (6155.91 million km) or 4.060 billion miles, which is referred to as its periapsis. It is important to note that (19255) 1994 VK8 is likely to be a minor planet or asteroid. More information about its composition, size, orbital period, and aphelion (farthest point from the Sun in its orbit) would be required for a complete analysis of its orbital and physical properties.

Here is a news article: LONDON (AP) — The FBI has put a spoke in the wheel of a major Russian digital disruption operation potentially aimed at causing havoc in Ukraine, evidence pieced together from researchers, Ukrainian officials and U.S. court documents indicates.      On Wednesday, network technology company Cisco Systems and antivirus company Symantec warnedthat a half-million internet-connected routers had been compromised in a possible effort to lay the groundwork for a cyber-sabotage operation against targets in Ukraine.      Court documents simultaneously unsealed in Pittsburgh show the FBI has seized a key website communicating with the massive army of hijacked devices, disrupting what could have been — and might still be — an ambitious cyberattack by the Russian government-aligned hacking group widely known as Fancy Bear.      \\"I hope it catches the actors off guard and leads to the downfall of their network,\\" said Craig Williams, the director of outreach for Talos, the digital threat intelligence unit of Cisco that cooperated with the bureau. But he warned that the hackers could still regain control of the infected routers if they possessed their addresses and the right resources to re-establish command and control.      FBI Assistant Director Scott Smith said the agency \\"has taken a critical step in minimizing the impact of the malware attack. While this is an important first step, the FBI's work is not done.\\"      Much about the hackers' motives remains open to conjecture. Cisco said the malicious software, which it and Symantec both dubbed VPNFilter after a folder it creates, was sitting on more than 500,000 routers in 54 countries but mostly in Ukraine, and had the capacity to render them unusable — a massively disruptive move if carried out at such a scale.      \\"It could be a significant threat to users around the world,\\" said Williams.      The U.S. Justice Department said the malware \\"could be used for a variety of malicious purposes, including intelligence gathering, theft of valuable information, destructive or disruptive attacks, and the misattribution of such activities.\\"      Ukraine's cyberpolice said in a statement that it was possible the hackers planned to strike during \\"large-scale events,\\" an apparent reference either to the upcoming Champions League game between Real Madrid and Liverpool in the capital, Kiev, on Saturday or to Ukraine's upcoming Constitution Day celebrations.      Ukraine has been locked in a years-long struggle with Russia-backed separatists in the country's east and has repeatedly been hit by cyberattacks of escalating severity. Last year witnessed the eruption of the NotPetya worm, which crippled critical systems, including hospitals , across the country and dealt hundreds of millions of dollars in collateral damage around the globe. Ukraine, the United States and Britain have blamed the attack on Moscow — a charge the Kremlin has denied.      Cisco and Symantec both steered clear of attributing the VPNFilter malware to any particular actor, but an FBI affidavit explicitly attributed it to Fancy Bear, the same group that hacked into the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and has been linked to a long series of digital intrusions stretching back more than a decade. The U.S. intelligence community assesses that Fancy Bear acts on behalf of Russia's military intelligence service.      An FBI affidavit — whose existence was first reported by The Daily Beast — said the hackers used lines of code hidden in the metadata of online photo albums to communicate with their network of seeded routers. If the photo albums disappeared, the hackers turned to a fallback website — the same site whose seizure the FBI ordered Tuesday.      An email sent to the website's registered owner was returned as undeliverable.      When asked why the FBI specifically named Fancy Bear where Cisco did not, Williams noted that while attribution was extremely tricky based on malware analysis alone, \\"if you combine that knowledge with a traditional intelligence apparatus interesting things can come to light.\\"      In any case, he said, \\"we have a high degree of confidence that the actor behind this is acting against the Ukraine's best interest.\\"      Cisco said in a research note that the malware affected devices geared for small and home offices from manufacturers including Netgear, TP-Link and Linksys and had the potential to disable \\"internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide or in a focused region.\\"      The malware's principal capabilities, the company said, included stealthy intelligence-collecting, monitoring industrial-control software and, if triggered, \\"bricking\\" or disabling routers. It also persists on the infected routers after they are rebooted.      ___      Bajak reported from Boston. Chad Day in Washington contributed to this report.      ___      Court documents: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4482618-VPNFilter-FBI-affidavit.html      Talos' blog post: https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html ||||| The FBI is advising users of consumer-grade routers and network-attached storage devices to reboot them as soon as possible to counter Russian-engineered malware that has infected hundreds of thousands devices.      Researchers from Cisco’s Talos security team first disclosed the existence of the malware on Wednesday. The detailed report said the malware infected more than 500,000 devices made by Linksys, Mikrotik, Netgear, QNAP, and TP-Link. Known as VPNFilter, the malware allowed attackers to collect communications, launch attacks on others, and permanently destroy the devices with a single command. The report said the malware was developed by hackers working for an advanced nation, possibly Russia, and advised users of affected router models to perform a factory reset, or at a minimum to reboot.      Limited persistence      Later in the day, The Daily Beast reported that VPNFilter was indeed developed by a Russian hacking group , one known by a variety of names, including Sofacy, Fancy Bear, APT 28, and Pawn Storm. The Daily Beast also said the FBI had seized an Internet domain VPNFilter used as a backup means to deliver later stages of the malware to devices that were already infected with the initial stage 1. The seizure meant that the primary and secondary means to deliver stages 2 and 3 had been dismantled, leaving only a third fallback, which relied on attackers sending special packets to each infected device.      The redundant mechanisms for delivering the later stages address a fundamental shortcoming in VPNFilter—stages 2 and 3 can’t survive a reboot, meaning they are wiped clean as soon as a device is restarted. Instead, only stage 1 remains. Presumably, once an infected device reboots, stage 1 will cause it to reach out to the recently seized ToKnowAll.com address. The FBI’s advice to reboot small office and home office routers and NAS devices capitalizes on this limitation. In a statement published Friday, FBI officials suggested that users of all consumer-grade routers, not just those known to be vulnerable to VPNFilter, protect themselves. The officials wrote:      The FBI recommends any owner of small office and home office routers reboot the devices to temporarily disrupt the malware and aid the potential identification of infected devices. Owners are advised to consider disabling remote management settings on devices and secure with strong passwords and encryption when enabled. Network devices should be upgraded to the latest available versions of firmware.      In a statement also published Friday, Justice Department officials wrote:      Owners of SOHO and NAS devices that may be infected should reboot their devices as soon as possible, temporarily eliminating the second stage malware and causing the first stage malware on their device to call out for instructions. Although devices will remain vulnerable to reinfection with the second stage malware while connected to the Internet, these efforts maximize opportunities to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the time available before Sofacy actors learn of the vulnerability in their command-and-control infrastructure.      The US Department of Homeland Security has also issued a statement advising that \\"all SOHO router owners power cycle (reboot) their devices to temporarily disrupt the malware.\\"      As noted in the statements, rebooting serves the objectives of (1) temporarily preventing infected devices from running the stages that collect data and other advanced attacks and (2) helping FBI officials to track who was infected. Friday’s statement said the FBI is working with the non-profit Shadow Foundation to disseminate the IP addresses of infected devices to ISPs and foreign authorities to notify end users.      Authorities and researchers still don’t know for certain how compromised devices are initially infected. They suspect the attackers exploited known vulnerabilities and default passwords that end users had yet to patch or change. That uncertainty is likely driving the advice in the FBI statement that all router and NAS users reboot, rather than only users of the 14 models known to be affected by VPNFilter, which are:      Linksys E1200      Linksys E2500      Linksys WRVS4400N      Mikrotik RouterOS for Cloud Core Routers: Versions 1016, 1036, and 1072      Netgear DGN2200      Netgear R6400      Netgear R7000      Netgear R8000      Netgear WNR1000      Netgear WNR2000      QNAP TS251      QNAP TS439 Pro      Other QNAP NAS devices running QTS software      TP-Link R600VPN      The advice to reboot, update, change default passwords, and disable remote administration is sound and in most cases requires no more than 15 minutes. Of course, a more effective measure is to follow the advice Cisco gave Wednesday to users of affected devices and perform a factory reset, which will permanently remove all of the malware, including stage 1. This generally involves using a paper clip or thumb tack to hold down a button on the back of the device for 5 seconds. The reset will remove any configuration settings stored on the device, so users will have to restore those settings once the device initially reboots. (It's never a bad idea to disable UPnP when practical, but that protection appears to have no effect on VPNFilter.)      There's no easy way to know if a router has been infected by VPNFilter. For more advanced users, Cisco provided detailed indicators of compromise in Wednesday’s report, along with firewall rules that can be used to protect devices. Ars has much more about VPNFilter here. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Oh, this is actually a pretty big and technical report! But don't worry, I'm here to help you understand it. Imagine your toy car runs on batteries, and somebody sneaky figured out a way to control your toy car to move any time they want, or even break it. This would be really annoying and scary, right?  Now, replace your toy car with 'internet routers' - those little boxes that help us connect to the internet. Acccording to this article, a sneaky group from Russia known as 'Fancy Bear' have figured out a way to control and break lots and lots of these internet routers around the world, but specifically, and most worryingly, in Ukraine. That's like if someone could control or break not just your toy car, but all the toy cars in your city! The good guys in this story, the FBI (they're a bit like the police, but for the whole of the US), have worked with some smart tech companies and have managed to stop this sneaky group from being able to control these routers. However, they are warning that the sneaky group might figure out how to take control again. The very clever people at a couple of tech companies (Cisco and Symantec) have named the way the sneaky people were controlling the routers \\"VPNFilter\\", and have found that it's on more than 500,000 routers in 54 countries. Ukraine (which is kind of like the place where all our schools are located in this story) think that the sneaky people might try to cause trouble during some of their big celebrations, a bit like trying to stop all the toy cars during a big toy car racing event. This would be very disruptive and annoying for everyone. Finally, the FBI have given some good advice to people to 'reboot' (which is like turning something off and then back on again) their routers to stop this control and possibly break it down. They also advise people ensure their 'firmware' (the system that helps the router run properly) is up to date, like making sure your toy car has fresh batteries and is in good working condition.  The article goes on to list out some routers (the toy cars) that might be affected by the VPNFilter problem. People who have these routers should do the reboot, make sure the firmware is up to date and change passwords for safety."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Ted Skjellum (born 4 March 1972), also known by the stage names Nocturno Culto, Nocturno or Kveldulv, is a Norwegian musician best known as the vocalist, lead guitarist, and partial bassist (shared with Fenriz) of the influential black metal band Darkthrone. He has been with the band since 1988. He is also the vocalist of the band Sarke. He currently works in Norway as a school teacher, and has a son and a daughter. He has also released a documentary film called \\"The Misanthrope\\" in which he deals with black metal music and life in Norway.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Gylve Fenris Nagell (born 28 November 1971), better known as Fenriz, is a Norwegian musician and politician who is best known as being one half of the metal duo Darkthrone. Although primarily a drummer, he has also performed bass, guitar and vocals for Darkthrone and a number of other metal bands. Fenriz is known for his refusal to play live, his obsessiveness about music listening, supporting other underground bands and his lack of interest in the mainstream music business in general. Fenriz has had three solo projects: the folk metal project Isengard, the dark ambient project Neptune Towers and the doom metal project Red Planet.  - Darkthrone is a Norwegian black metal band. It formed in 1986 as a death metal band under the name Black Death. In 1991, the band embraced a black metal style influenced by Bathory and Celtic Frost and became one of the leading bands in the Norwegian black metal scene. Their first three black metal albums\\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\\", \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\" (sometimes dubbed the \\"Unholy Trinity\\")  are considered the peak of the band's career and to be among the most influential albums in the genre. For most of this time, Darkthrone has been a duo of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz, who have sought to remain outside the music mainstream. Since 2006, their work has strayed from the traditional black metal style and incorporated more elements of traditional heavy metal, speed metal and punk rock, being likened to Motörhead.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music.  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.  - Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890  1937).  - A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the second studio album by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone. It was released on 26 February 1992 by Peaceville Records. It contained the band's first black metal recordings, and is considered a classic within the genre. It was the first album of what fans dub the \\"Unholy Trinity\\", the other albums being \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\". The last album to feature bassist Dag Nilsen.   - Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums.  - Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words \\"\\" (\\"nekros\\"; \\"dead\\") and \\"\\" (\\"philia\\"; \\"love\\").  - Peaceville Records is a British independent heavy metal record label. The label was founded by Paul \\"Hammy\\" Halmshaw (of the bands Instigators and Civilised Society) in Dewsbury, England in 1987, who was also a one-time drummer of Sore Throat. Originally a tape label releasing anarcho punk, the releases moved towards metal through crust punk and similar forms of metal-influenced English hardcore punk. Halmshaw started running the label full-time in 1988, although the original tape label incarnation was founded in 1981 as a vehicle for releasing Instigators demo cassettes.  - Ivar Enger , also known as \`\` Zephyrous '' , is a guitarist who played for black metal band Darkthrone . He is credited as featuring on the band 's first three albums ; Soulside Journey , A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon , as well as the Goatlord album ; the rehearsal tapes of what was originally intended to be their second album ( with later added vocals ) . He is said to have left due to delving into misanthropy , instead of generally leaving , as Darkthrone never had touring stress and he did n't leave prior because of the swift change from death metal to black metal , like other former member Dag Nielsen did . The band maintains that Zephyrous went into a forest and never returned . However , in a 2006 interview with the German website Voices From The Dark Side , Nocturno Culto claims he still has contact with Zephyrous and would like him to join the band as a guest on a few songs at some point . Very little information about Zephyrous is known , as Darkthrone have always maintained mystery about themselves , let alone past members . In two interviews in 2001 and 2002 with Nocturno Culto , he stated that Zephyrous left Darkthrone partly because he felt \`\` left out '' by N.Culto and Fenriz , who were very close at the time , and partly because he was an alcoholic and had a black out while driving his car . \`\` He woke up in the hospital with much strings attached to him '' . \`\` He left Darkthrone in much anger '' .

Here are possible answers to this question: - soccer game - capillaries - ball - animals - person  I believe the correct choice is \\"soccer game\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"soccer game\\" because it is a sport where the use of hands is generally not allowed (except for the goalkeeper), and it is less likely to involve bloodshed compared to more physical contact sports like boxing or football. Soccer primarily involves the use of feet, head, and torso to control the ball and score goals, which makes it relatively safer in terms of causing injuries that lead to blood loss. However, accidents and collisions may still occur, but they are not as common as in other high-contact sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who warned that other composers were interested in adapting La Tosca? , can you please find it?   The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti.  Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini.  One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand... The answer to this question is:","output":"The last name of the person who warned that other composers were interested in adapting La Tosca is Sardou.  My justification for this answer starts with the understanding of the question. The user asked for the last name of a person who gave warning about other composers' interest in adapting La Tosca. In the provided text, it is stated that Sardou, the French Playwright who initially wrote La Tosca, was the one who expressed concerns about other composers being interested in adapting his work.

The visual system is processing what is seen on the page; the motor system controls your eye movements and the turn of the pages (or click of the mouse); the prefrontal cortex maintains attention. Even fundamental functions, like breathing and regulation of body temperature, are controlled by the nervous system. The nervous system is one of two systems that exert control over all the organ systems of the body; the other is the endocrine system. The nervous system’s control is much more specific and rapid than the hormonal system. It communicates signals through cells and the tiny gaps between them rather than through the circulatory system as in the endocrine system. It uses a combination of chemical and electrochemical signals, rather than purely chemical signals used by the endocrine system to cover long distances quickly. The nervous system acquires information from sensory organs, processes it and then may initiate a response either through motor function, leading to movement, or in a change in the organism’s physiological state. Nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom vary in structure and complexity. Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. Others, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a “nerve net. ” Flatworms have both a central nervous system (CNS), made up of a ganglion (clusters of connected neurons) and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Job offer many years ago. I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Select from: a). No; b). Yes; Question: what are the rules of fencing? Would \\"Competitive Fencing is one of five sports which has been featured at every one of the modern Olympic Games , the other four being Athletics , Cycling , Swimming , and Gymnastics .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"b). Yes. The statement \\"Competitive Fencing is one of the five sports which has been featured at every one of the modern Olympic Games, the other four being Athletics, Cycling, Swimming, and Gymnastics\\" is a reasonable answer for the question about the rules of fencing. However, this statement mainly focuses on the history and prominence of fencing as an Olympic sport. To provide a more detailed answer, here is a brief overview of the rules of fencing: 1. Types of weapons: Fencing is divided into three categories based on the weapon used: Foil, Épée, and Sabre.   2. Foil: Foil is a thrusting weapon with a flexible rectangular blade. In foil fencing, the target area is the torso, and points are scored by landing a touch on the opponent's target area with the tip of the weapon.   3. Épée: Épée is also a thrusting weapon, but it has a stiffer triangular blade. The entire body is considered the target area in épée fencing, and points are scored by landing a touch anywhere on the opponent's body with the tip of the weapon.   4. Sabre: Sabre is a cutting and thrusting weapon with a flat, curved blade. In sabre fencing, the target area includes the torso, arms, and head, excluding the hands. Points in sabre are scored by landing a touch on the opponent's target area with the edge of the weapon or the tip.   5. Right of way: This rule applies to foil and sabre fencing. It is used to determine which fencer scores a point if both fencers land a touch simultaneously. The fencer who initiated the attack has the right of way, and the other fencer must defend or perform a counter-attack to score.   6. Scoring system: A point is scored when one fencer touches their opponent's valid target area with their weapon. In foil and sabre, only the fencer with the right of way scores, while in épée, simultaneous touches result in points for both fencers.   7. Timing: Fencing bouts are timed and generally last for a total of three 3-minute periods with a 1-minute break between periods. The first fencer to reach 15 points, or the fencer with the highest score after the time has elapsed, wins the bout.   8. Referee: A referee oversees the bout and is responsible for determining the right of way, awarding points, and assessing penalties for rule violations.   9. Penalties: Fencers can receive penalties for various infractions, such as crossing the boundary of the fencing strip, causing the delay of the bout, or performing illegal actions. Penalties can range from warnings to loss of points or disqualification. In summary, the rules of fencing include the use of different weapons, a focus on strikes and tactics, the right of way rule, a scoring system, timed bouts, the role of a referee, and penalties for rule violations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Bess and Dee were two entomologists. they were studying ants. Dee liked to learn more about leaf cutter ants, while Bess learned all she could about all other ants.  and a hint : Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.  Please answer this question : Which person read less about indirect herbivory ants?","output":"To answer the question about who read less about indirect herbivory ants, let's evaluate the information provided about Bess and Dee: 1. Bess learned all she could about all other ants (meaning, ants other than leafcutter ants as studied by Dee). 2. Dee liked to learn more about leafcutter ants. Now, let's consider the given hint: - Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores. However, a few ants, such as leafcutter ants, have evolved specialized ways to obtain nutrition. From this information, we can conclude that Bess, who focused on all other ants, would likely have read about various types of ants, including those that engage in indirect herbivory. On the other hand, Dee focused primarily on leafcutter ants, which have a specialized way of obtaining nutrition through a symbiotic relationship with fungi. Therefore, Dee read less about indirect herbivory ants as compared to Bess, as Dee's focus was on the more specialized leafcutter ants."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer:  Pyriel's heart  for the following movie plot:  Danyael Rosales, a street preacher who thinks God doesn't care about anyone because of the death of his parents Valerie Rosales and the angel Danyael from the previous film. He is then forced to face his destiny. As a Nephilim, he has some of the angels' abilities, such as regeneration, and can only be killed if his heart is removed. One night, a blind assassin shoots Danyael as he preaches before a crowd, but the assassin is driven off before he can take out Danyael's heart. As punishment for his failure, Zophael kills the assassin and starts going after Danyael himself with an extendable bladed weapon (the blade can be turned into a three-pronged hook) with which he plans to use to remove Danyael's heart, killing him for good. However, Danyael is protected by Gabriel, a now-human fallen angel who killed Danyael's father and performed many misdeeds. After being defeated by Danyael's mother, Gabriel was turned into a human as punishment. He has spent eighteen years as a human, and realized how wrong he was in the past so has now switched sides.Zophael manages to convince Danyael's girlfriend Maggie to work with him on killing Danyael, but she realizes she's on the wrong side and tries to shoot the angel. It has little effect on Zophael, and he tells her what he is. Frightened, Maggie agrees to help him, and the two catch up to Danyael on a Native American reservation, where he is going to confront Pyriel, another angel who wants to overthrow God. Danyael briefly meets Mary, a Native American woman (first introduced as a child in the first film). Mary informs Danyael that she dreamed of his coming, and that she believes he will be victorious against Pyriel. After parting from Mary, Danyael is attacked by Zophael, crashing Maggie's truck and badly injuring her. He then faces off against Danyael in battle, and seemingly defeats him by impaling his chest with a motorcycle tailpipe, but the angel gets back up and uses his weapon to impale Danyael from behind.

He gets on a plane that makes several stops along the way, and, because of inclement weather, there are delays and waits in waiting rooms and restaurants, where he strikes up conversations with three other travelers, a struggling actress (Shelley Winters), an alcoholic doctor (Michael Rennie), and a clownish traveling salesman (Keenan Wynn).

A cyclist is making his way more than 1,900 miles across Europe fuelled only by food he is able to rescue from bins along the way. Baptiste Dubanchet set off from Paris, France, in April and is cycling all the way to the Polish capital, Warsaw, in a bid to raise awareness of how much food we waste. The 25-year-old from Bordeaux has already travelled through Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, surviving only on food destined for landfill. Baptiste Dubanchet pictured raiding supermarket bins in Berlin, Germany, during his 1,900-mile odyssey across Europe eating only food that others have thrown away. He hopes his project will raise awareness of waste. Resourceful: The 25-year-old from Bordeaux has already travelled through Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, surviving only on food destined for landfill. A wealth of food: This picture shows how much edible food is thrown away by businesses every single day. Along the way he has stayed with locals met online, who agreed to put him up for free, but he has refused any food - or even a beer - other than what has already been discarded. When he's been unable to find a sofa to sleep on he's camped out in the open. 'The objective is to make this trip relying only from food destined to be thrown away, from hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, supermarkets and markets, in order to denounce food waste,' he says on his website. Campaigners in Britain have welcomed his project, pointing out that even as we throw away hundreds of thousands of tons of edible food, there are people who do not have enough to eat. Mr Dubanchet chose to make the journey by bicycle to keep his carbon footprint as close to zero as possible. He set off on April 15 and last weekend he arrived in Konin, Poland, for the last leg of his journey. Yum: Mr Dubanchet eats a calabrese during a snack break during his trans-continental bike ride. Mr Dubanchet during a stop off in Belgium: He chose to cycle to keep his carbon footprint as low as possible. Mr Dubanchet in the Netherlands: He said the idea came to him when he was travelling in the developing world. As he travelled throught Germany, he told a reporter for The Local that his first objective when arriving at a new town is to track down sources of food. 'I have to find food fast because after all the cycling I am tired and I need the energy,' he said. 'Is my stomach full or empty? That is the most important thing, not what I am eating.' He has a sign written in each country's language to explain his project, but said many businesses have a policy of not giving anything away - even if it's to be thrown in the bin. Some workers, he says, have even risked their jobs to help him out. Mr Dubanchet said the idea came to him when he want travelling in Latin America and South East Asia after he graduated. He said the sight of so many people going hungry compelled him to do something to highlight how much food we waste in Europe. He wrote on his blog: 'The reason I can find sufficient food, is that industrialised countries are rich enough to allow themselves to waste tons of food that is still consumable. 'I find some food thrown away just because the packaging is wet or damaged, whole bags of fruit in the bin because one of the fruit is bruised, yoghurts, cheese, or other products discarded because of irrelevant expiry dates.' Mr Dubanchet and a friend with food he'd raided from a bin: The Frenchman has stayed with strangers met online during his journey and, when he couldn't find anyone to put him up, he camped out in the open. In a host's kitchen in Frankfurt: 'The reason I can find sufficient food, is that industrialised countries are rich enough to allow themselves to waste tons of food that is still consumable,' he wrote on his blog. Epic journey: Mr Dubanchet has visited six countries on his trip across Europe, and not spent a penny on food. Mary McGrath, chief executive of British charity FoodCycle, which takes food destined for the bin, cooks it up and serves it to people at risk of food poverty, welcomed Mr Dubanchet's initiative. She said: 'Baptiste has highlighted the unacceptable level of food waste that exists at all stages of the supply chain - from farm to fork. 'In the UK it is estimated that over 400,000 tonnes of food is thrown away at retail level yet over 4 million people are affected by food poverty. 'Food poverty and food waste shouldn’t co-exist in the same communities but unfortunately they do. 'We should be doing everything possible to ensure that as much edible surplus food as possible is going to help people who are struggling to get by.'

Answer a question about this article: In total, 156 prisoners have been either acquitted, or received pardons or commutations on the basis of possible innocence, between 1973 to 2015. Death penalty opponents often argue that this statistic shows how perilously close states have come to undertaking wrongful executions; proponents point out that the statistic refers only to those exonerated in law, and that the truly innocent may be a smaller number. Statistics likely understate the actual problem of wrongful convictions because once an execution has occurred there is often insufficient motivation and finance to keep a case open, and it becomes unlikely at that point that the miscarriage of justice will ever be exposed.

No To provide a detailed explanation, Sydney's constant loud and annoying behaviors seem to be driving Remy mad. This indicates that Remy is not comfortable or content with the noise and annoyance produced by Sydney. Consequently, when asked what Remy would want to do next, suggesting that they would want to \\"keep being loud\\" is not a valid answer. Instead, Remy would likely be seeking alternatives to resolve the issue or alleviate the disturbance that Sydney's noises are causing. Some possible solutions or actions that Remy may consider include: 1. Communicating with Sydney: Remy could express their concerns and discomfort with Sydney, asking them to be more mindful of the noise they produce. A calm and respectful conversation may lead to a mutual understanding and improved behavior from Sydney. 2. Seeking an alternative environment: Remy may choose to distance themselves from the situation, either temporarily or permanently. This could involve finding a quieter place to work or relax, or making changes to their living situation if it proves to be too disruptive. 3. Utilizing noise-cancellation tools: Remy could invest in noise-canceling headphones or earplugs to help block out or minimize Sydney's annoying sounds. This solution allows Remy to maintain their presence in the shared space without being significantly disturbed by Sydney's noise. 4. Finding a compromise or establishing ground rules: Remy and Sydney could work together to schedule designated quiet times or establish boundaries within the living or working area. This gives both parties an opportunity to respect each other's needs and preferences while promoting a more harmonious environment. In conclusion, Remy would most likely not want to continue experiencing Sydney's loud and annoying behavior.

Living in poverty can have devastating effects on an individual's physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It may limit access to basic necessities like food, clean water, adequate housing, healthcare, and education. The feelings of hopelessness and desperation that often accompany poverty can lead to increased stress and vulnerability to mental health issues. 1. Health problems: Poverty often equates to a lack of access to proper nutrition, which can lead to malnutrition and other health issues like diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. It can also cause stress, which can result in mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and exacerbate existing health issues. 2. Limited access to education and employment opportunities: People living in poverty may not have the resources to attain a proper education, limiting their prospects of obtaining well-paying jobs or pursuing higher education. This lack of educational opportunities may result in a cycle of poverty that can persist throughout generations. 3. Inadequate housing: Living in poverty may mean that an individual or family must reside in substandard or overcrowded housing. This can expose residents to hazardous living conditions, including poor sanitation, increased risk of illness, and higher levels of crime. 4. Social exclusion: People who live in poverty can experience social isolation and exclusion, as they may be unable to participate in activities that their more affluent peers can easily access. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and alienation, which can further contribute to mental health problems. 5. Impeded development in children: Children growing up in poverty-stricken environments often face significant disadvantages when it comes to their cognitive, social, and emotional development. This can lead to delays in language development, lower academic achievement, and increased rates of behavioral and emotional issues. 6. Vulnerability to crime and violence: Poverty can create desperation, which can lead people to engage in criminal activities in order to survive. Furthermore, impoverished communities often experience higher crime rates, leading to increased exposure to violence, which can affect an individual's mental and emotional health. 7. Limited access to healthcare: People who live in poverty may not have access to proper healthcare or be unable to afford medical services. This can result in unaddressed health issues, chronic illnesses, or complications due to a lack of preventive care. The hardships associated with living in poverty can create a significant barrier to upward mobility and make it difficult for an individual to break the cycle of poverty. Addressing the root causes of poverty and implementing policies that promote economic stability, access to education, and healthcare are essential for alleviating poverty and providing opportunities for a better quality of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford. The lecture that evening was on \\"fairy life\\", and at the end of the meeting Polly Wright showed the two fairy photographs taken by her daughter and niece to the... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that had their hand out to a 1-foot-tall gnome?, what is it ?","output":"The full name of the person who had their hand out to a 1-foot-tall gnome in the story described in the article is Elsie Wright.

Article: The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry. The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \\"mini-Aeneid\\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \\"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps.\\" In Silius Italicus, Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers. With almost every line of his epic Punica Silius references Virgil. Indeed, Silius is known to have bought Virgil's tomb and worshipped the poet. Partially as a result of his so-called \\"Messianic\\" Fourth Eclogue—widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ—Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the Sortes Vergilianae, the process of using Virgil's poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time of Hadrian, and continued into the Middle Ages. In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer. Virgil also found commentators in antiquity. Servius, a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on the commentary of Donatus. Servius' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil's life, sources, and references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating. Now answer this question: Who was one of Virgil's most ardent admirers who referenced Virgil in almost every line of his epic?","output":"One of Virgil's most ardent admirers who referenced Virgil in almost every line of his epic was Silius Italicus."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: When you're playing defense, you'll wear a leather glove on your non-throwing hand to help you catch thrown or batted balls.  If you purchase a new glove, you will want to \\"break it in\\" by removing the stiffness of the new leather. There are several methods of doing this, including baking the glove in an oven with special oil applied, leaving it in the sun, or playing a lot of catch with it. Playing the catcher position in fast-pitch requires a special glove. The gloves of catchers (and first basemen) are called mitts. They are made of heavier construction than the typical softball glove. Softball bats are not all the same. They must be chosen with a player’s size and strength in mind. When you look for a bat, look at three primary factors: the length, the weight, and the style.  To find a bat that is the right length, stand up straight and hold a bat by its knob at the end. If you can hold your arm straight down, and the bat touches the ground, it is the right length for you. If you have to bend your elbow, it is too long. If the bat doesn't touch the ground, it's too short. To find a bat that is the right weight, look at the drop. The drop is the numerical difference between the bat's height (in inches) and its weight (in ounces). The drop will range anywhere from -8 to -12. Lighter bats (near -12), are good for weak or slow batters. Heavier bats (near -8), are best for strong batters. You can also test the suitability of the bat's weight by placing it in your throwing hand and holding it straight out in front of you. If you can easily hold it at arm's length for a full minute or more, it is not too heavy for you. There are two main types of softball bats available, aluminum and composite. Each type is appropriate for both beginners and experienced players, but aluminum bats are more popular. These are also available in single- or double-walled construction. Single-walled are cheaper but slightly less effective than double-walled bats. Composite bats will hit the ball farther, but they can crack easily in cold weather. Playing softball, especially fast-pitch, can be dangerous if you don’t take safety precautions. Most fast-pitch leagues require batters to use a caged batting helmet (pictured above), but even if they don’t, it is best to wear one when you are up to bat. Cleats are used in several sports and give you better traction while running after a ball or between bases. For softball, rubber or plastic cleats are appropriate. Metal cleats are typically banned in softball leagues, as they pose a danger to sliding runners and infielders who try to tag them. These include batting gloves, which cushion the hands, protect against blisters, and improve bat grip. If you are a fast-pitch catcher, you will want to use a mask, chest protector and shin guards. Some players who frequently slide into bases choose to wear sliding pads.","output":"In softball, players wear leather gloves to catch thrown or batted balls, and breaking-in new gloves is essential.

If steroid hormones are made of fats, then what are steroid hormones made of?  Answer choices: - fats  - blood  - H 2 O  - sugar  - dust  - muscle  - gasoline  - SO2 Answer:","output":"Steroid hormones are made of fats. Specifically, they are derived from lipids, which are a type of fat molecule. The main building block of steroid hormones is cholesterol, a complex lipid molecule that is an essential component of cell membranes and a precursor for several important biological molecules, including steroid hormones. Steroid hormones are a class of hormones that include testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol, among others. These hormones play critical roles in various biological processes, such as growth, development, immune function, metabolism, and reproductive function. They are synthesized in the endocrine glands, including the adrenal glands, gonads (testes and ovaries), and in some cases, the placenta during pregnancy. The process of making steroid hormones from cholesterol involves a series of enzymatic reactions that modify the structure of the cholesterol molecule. During these reactions, functional groups are added or removed, and the steroid ring system is formed. Once they have been produced, steroid hormones are secreted by the endocrine glands into the bloodstream, where they are transported to their target cells. Upon reaching their target cells, steroid hormones diffuse across the cell membrane due to their lipid-soluble nature. Once inside the cell, they bind to specific intracellular molecular receptors, forming a hormone-receptor complex. This complex then moves into the nucleus of the cell and acts as regulatory molecules, influencing gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences and controlling the transcription of target genes. This process ultimately leads to the regulation of various cellular processes and functions in response to hormonal signaling. In summary, steroid hormones are made of fats, specifically cholesterol-derived lipids. They play critical roles in regulating various biological processes and functions, and their mode of action involves binding to intracellular receptors and controlling gene expression in target cells. The other options presented - blood, H2O, sugar, dust, muscle, gasoline, and SO2 - are not related to the composition of steroid hormones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A.

It boasts cool combat features, a spooky paranormal story line and some dramatic tension. But because its emphasis is on combat, not thrills, the game is not nearly as scary as it should be. \\"F.E.A.R. 3\\" (Day 1 Studios, Warner Bros. Interactive) continues its franchise's story of a family in conflict as two brothers work together to track down their psychically enhanced mother, Alma, who is about to give birth. However, their reasons for wanting to find dear Mom are totally opposite. Filmmaker John Carpenter, director of the classic fright flick \\"Halloween,\\" helped create cinematics for the game that heighten its fear factor. Comic book horror writer Steve Niles co-wrote the story line. Co-op mode is the preferred mode of play here, allowing you to take advantage of each brother's skills during combat and strive toward the highest score on each level. You can play as Point Man, who is well versed in military training and technique, or as Paxton Fettel, who was slain during the original \\"F.E.A.R\\" but returns here as a ghost with psychic energy powers. The brothers must navigate wave after wave of soldiers, whacked-out cultists and creepy creatures created from Alma's mind. The battlefields range from a looted food warehouse to the science bunker where Alma is being held. While the action is pretty linear, there are detours in which you can search for hidden weapons and ammo, psychic link gathering locations, and an Alma doll, which scores big points when found. There are enemies who require some extra work to defeat, including one called a Phase Caster, who summons additional soldiers over and over. Kill him first. Seriously. It is easy to get immersed in the run-and-gun aspects of \\"F.E.A.R. 3,\\" but keep in mind that it's also supposed to be a horror game. Remember, Mom is a psychic time bomb allegedly waiting to erupt when she gives birth to ... whatever. To be sure, there are some very good horror moments in the game. The apparitions that briefly appear, scare and disappear are disconcerting. And having a ghost brother along during solo mode is a constant reminder. When they occur, the terror elements are jump-out-of-your-seat frightening. It is almost like watching a horror movie from the eyes of the lead actor. The problem is those moments don't seem to occur as often as you'd think or hope. There were plenty of times in the game where I forgot it was supposed to be a thriller and not just a shooter. Some levels' features are so combat-heavy that there's no room for any memorable paranormal experiences. Early in the game I was peeking around every corner expecting to find some apparition or twisted scene, only to shrug and move on. By the end of the game, I stopped looking for ghosts and just treated everything as a combat scene. Multiplayer modes help make the game fun to replay. You can work together with your teammates to survive waves of enemies emerging from an advancing fog, or be possessed by Alma and try to take over your former teammates. \\"F.E.A.R 3\\" is a well-made first-person shooter that will challenge players with intelligent enemies and compelling battles. Sadly, the frights aren't quite as jarring as they could have been. Which, I'm sure, makes the ghosts very sad. Boo. \\"F.E.A.R. 3\\" is playable on the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

Harrison began his career on the stage in 1924. He served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, reaching the rank of flight lieutenant. He won his first Tony Award for his performance as Henry VIII in the play Anne of the Thousand Days in 1949. Harrison's film debut was in The Great Game (1930), other notable early films include The Citadel (1938), Night Train to Munich (1940), Major Barbara (1941), Blithe Spirit (1945), Anna and the King of Siam (1946), The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), and The Foxes of Harrow (1947). He was best known for his portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins in the 1964 film version of My Fair Lady, based on the eponymous Broadway production (which in turn was based on George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion), for which Harrison won a Best Actor Oscar.  He also starred in 1967's Doctor Dolittle. At the height of his box office clout after the success of My Fair Lady, Harrison proved a domineering and demanding force during production, demanding auditions for prospective composers after musical playwright Leslie Bricusse was contracted and demanding to have his singing recorded live during shooting, only to agree to have it rerecorded in post-production. He also disrupted production with incidents with his wife, Rachel Roberts and deliberate misbehaviour, such as when he deliberately moved his yacht in front of cameras during shooting in St. Lucia and refused to move it out of sight due to contract disputes. Harrison was at one point temporarily replaced by Christopher Plummer, until he agreed to be more cooperative.  He starred in the 1968 comedy The Honey Pot, a modern adaptation of Ben Jonson's play Volpone. Two of his co-stars, Maggie Smith and Cliff Robertson, were to become lifelong friends. Both spoke at his New York City memorial at the Little Church Around the Corner when Harrison died in 1990.  Harrison was not by any objective standards a singer (his talking on pitch style he used in My Fair Lady would be adopted by many other classically trained actors with limited vocal ranges); the music was usually written to allow for long periods of recitative, or \\"speaking to the music\\". Nevertheless, \\"Talk to the Animals\\", which Harrison performed in Doctor Dolittle, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1967.  Despite excelling in comedy (Noel Coward described him as \\"The best light comedy actor in the world--except for me.\\"), he attracted favourable notices in dramatic roles such as his portrayal of Julius Caesar in Cleopatra (1963) and as Pope Julius II in The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965), opposite Charlton Heston as Michelangelo. He also acted in a Hindi film Shalimar alongside Indian Bollywood star Dharmendra as well as appearing as an ageing homosexual man opposite Richard Burton as his lover in Staircase (1969).

Article: Trees are useful to man in three important ways: They provide him with wood and other products; they provide him shade;. and they help to prevent droughts and floods. Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, man has not realized that the third of these services is the most important.In his eagerness to make money from trees, he has cut them down in large numbers, only to find that without them he has lost the best friends he had. And besides, he is usually too careless to plant and look after new trees. So the forests slowly disappear. This does not only mean that man will have fewer trees. The results are even more serious: for where there are trees, their roots break up soil allowing the rain to sink in and also bind the soil, thus preventing it from being washed away easily;but where there are no trees, the rain falls on hard ground and flows away, causing floods and carrying away the rich top-soil. When the top-soil is gone, nothing remains but worthless desert. Two thousand years ago,a rich and powerful country cut down its trees to build warships, with which to gain itself an empire .It set up the empire, but, without its trees, its soil became poor and grew weak. When the empire fell to pieces, the home country found itself faced by floods and starvation . Question: The most important service of trees to man is that  _  .

Given the question: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too.

Background: Fairport Convention are a British folk rock band. Formed in 1967, they are widely regarded as a key group in the English folk rock movement. Their seminal album Liege & Lief is considered to have launched the British folk rock movement, which provided a distinctively English identity to rock music and helped awaken much wider interest in traditional music in general. The band have drawn heavily on the Child Ballads, songs of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. Context: The new band began a hectic schedule of performing in Britain and the World and prepared material for a new album. The result was the all-instrumental Expletive Delighted! (1986). This showcased the virtuosity of Sanders and Allcock, but perhaps inevitably was not popular with all fans. This was followed by the recording In Real Time: Live '87 which managed to capture the energy and power of the new Fairport on stage, despite the fact that it was recorded in the studio with audience reactions dubbed on.  In this period the band were playing to larger and larger audiences, both on tour and at Cropredy, and it was very productive in terms of recording. Fairport had the considerable composing and arranging skills of Allcock and, to fill the gap created by a lack of a songwriter in the band, they turned to some of the most talented available in the contemporary folk scene. The results were Red & Gold (1989) The Five Seasons (1990) and Jewel in the Crown (1995), the last of which was judged 'their bestselling and undoubtedly finest album in years.'  At this point, with Mattacks busy with other projects, the band shifted to an acoustic format for touring and released the unplugged Old, New, Borrow Blue as 'Fairport Acoustic Convention' in 1996. For a while the four-piece acoustic line-up ran in parallel with the electric format. When Allcock left the band, he was replaced by Chris Leslie on vocals, mandolin and fiddle, who formerly worked with Swarbrick in Whippersnapper, and had a one-off stint with the band replacing Ric Sanders for 1992 Cropredy Festival. This meant that for the first time since reforming, the band had a recognized songwriter who contributed significantly to the band's output on the next album Who Knows Where the Time Goes (1997), particularly the rousing 'John Gaudie'. By the time of the 1997 thirty-year anniversary Festival at Cropredy, the new Fairport had been in existence for over a decade and contributed a significant chapter to the history of the band. Question: was its release a success? Answer:","output":"Yes, the releases during this period were successful for Fairport Convention. The albums Red & Gold (1989), The Five Seasons (1990), and Jewel in the Crown (1995) showcased the band's talents and were well-received, with Jewel in the Crown being judged as \\"their bestselling and undoubtedly finest album in years.\\" The addition of Chris Leslie as a recognized songwriter also contributed significantly to the band's output and success, particularly on the album Who Knows Where the Time Goes (1997).

He aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: \\"My Happiness\\" and \\"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\\". He later claimed that he intended the record as a gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he \\"sounded like\\", although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer Peter Guralnick argued that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, \\"I sing all kinds.\\" When she pressed him on who he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, \\"I don't sound like nobody.\\" After he recorded, Sun boss Sam Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: \\"Good ballad singer. Hold.\\"In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun Records—\\"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\\" and \\"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\\"—but again nothing came of it. Not long after, he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows. He explained to his father, \\"They told me I couldn't sing.\\" Songfellow Jim Hamill later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time. In April, Presley began working for the Crown Electric company as a truck driver. His friend Ronnie Smith, after playing a few local gigs with him, suggested he contact Eddie Bond, leader of Smith's professional band, which had an opening for a vocalist. Bond rejected him after a tryout, advising Presley to stick to truck driving \\"because you're never going to make it as a singer\\".Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, \\"Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'\\" In June, he acquired a demo...

Stine and Anne Rice are popular novelists who write under their real names, albeit a variation or a shortened version of their full names. R. L. Stine, whose full name is Robert Lawrence Stine, is an American novelist, short story writer, television producer, screenwriter, and executive editor. He is best known for his children's horror fiction series, Goosebumps, which has become a worldwide phenomenon. The R. L. Stine name became synonymous with children's horror, but he has also written various other genres such as humor novels, picture books, and even adult horror novels. Born on October 8, 1943, in Columbus, Ohio, Stine has created a prolific career that spans over several decades with hundreds of stories to his name. By using his initials instead of his full name, R. L. Stine creates a brand and image around the works he produces, making him easily recognizable to readers. Anne Rice, on the other hand, was born on October 4, 1941, in New Orleans, Louisiana, as Howard Allen Frances O'Brien. She is an American author of gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotica. In her career, Anne Rice is best known for her Vampire Chronicles series of novels, including the famous Interview with the Vampire, which was later adapted into a Hollywood film. The pseudonym \\"Anne Rice\\" is derived from her first name, Anne, and her husband's last name, Rice. The name change from Howard to Anne occurred in the first days of her elementary school when the nun asked her what name she preferred, and she chose Anne. Throughout her career, she has become a prominent and influential author in the realms of gothic and supernatural fiction. In conclusion, both R. L. Stine and Anne Rice write under their real names, but with variations or shortened forms for different reasons. These pen names have allowed them both to create a recognizable and distinct brand for each of their respective works, contributing to their immense popularity and success as novelists."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some have called it the most influential show in the history of television. American Idol has been extremely successful in the country since 2002. The show was number one for six years! The most popular episode had nearly 38 million _ . But why is the show so popular? The idea of the show is this: everyday people get a chance to show their singing talents to the world and become an \\"American Idol\\", a famous pop star. Anyone in the country(between the ages of 15 and 28) can have a try--a chance of becoming world famous. In fact, everyday people are the ones who are allowed on the show. If you are a professional singer--you cannot be an American Idol. The winners are regular people from small towns--people who sang in churches or bars but had bigger dreams. The winners of the contest don't get a prize of money. Instead, they get to record an album. Famous stars such as Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood gained fame  from winning the show.

Mr Sinclair denies raping and murdering Helen Scott and Christine Eadie, who were last seen at the World's End pub in Edinburgh on 15 October 1977. Dr Nagle said that someone had knelt on Ms Eadie and throttled her. He told the court that he and a colleague carried out post-mortem examinations on both girls a few days after their bodies had been discovered. Reports they compiled in both cases detailed the girls' injuries, internally and externally. He said the injuries on the murdered 17-year-olds were consistent with someone who had been repeatedly punched and subjected to blunt force injuries. In Ms Eadie's case, they included pinpoint haemorrhaging, abrasions, scratches, a \\"ligature track\\" around the neck, bruising to the mouth and pressure marks on the upper thighs, the court heard. In most cases, the injuries would have been caused by an assailant, he told the court. The pathologists' report, read to the court by Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, who is prosecuting the case, concluded in Ms Eadie's case: \\"From our examination we are of the opinion that death was due to asphyxia due to strangulation with a ligature and by gagging of the mouth.\\" Mr Mulholland went on to ask the witness: \\"Are the injuries consistent with Christine Eadie being repeatedly punched, subjected to blunt force injury, someone kneeling on her with their hands around her neck, throttling her and placing a ligature around her neck, with a gag in her mouth and asphyxiating and strangling her?\\" Dr Nagle agreed. The court also heard details of Ms Scott's injuries, including scratches, a ligature mark and one injury consistent with a shoe \\"stomping on the left side of her head\\". The report on her post-mortem examination, also read to the jury, concluded: \\"As a result of our examination, we are of the opinion that the death was due to asphyxia, consequent upon strangulation.\\" Questioning the witness, Mr Mulholland asked: \\"She had injuries consistent with repeated punching, injuries consistent with stomping, an injury which could be consistent with kicking, is that correct?\\" \\"Yes,\\" replied Dr Nagle. The prosecutor continued: \\"She also had injuries consistent with throttling, someone placing their hands around her neck, and also injuries consistent with the application of a ligature around her wrists during life and also around her neck during life? \\"And as a result of asphyxia, throttling, strangling, has caused her death?\\" Again, Dr Nagle agreed. Later the court heard  from forensic pathologist Professor Anthony Busuttil, 68, who prepared a report after studying post-mortem and toxicology analysis carried out by others on both girls. He stressed that he was not directly involved in the post-mortem process. He concluded it was \\"very likely\\" that the two murders were committed by the same person. Factors such as the way the bodies were disposed of, the use of ligatures, the damage to the bodies, helped him reach that conclusion, he told the jury. \\"It's likely that the two murders were perpetrated in a similar way, very likely by the same person or persons,\\" he said. Mr Sinclair is alleged to have gagged the girls, bound their wrists and tied a ligature around their necks. He denies inflicting blunt force injuries on Ms Eadie by repeatedly punching and kicking her on the body and biting her. He also denies forcing Ms Scott to walk barefoot into a field, ripping the strap from her handbag, repeatedly punching and kicking her on the head and body and stamping on her head. And he denies stealing clothing, footwear, jewellery and other personal effects from the teenagers in an attempt to pervert the course of justice. Mr Sinclair has lodged three special defences, of incrimination, consent and alibi. The trial continues. Summary:","output":"A man named Mr. Sinclair is in court because he is accused of hurting and killing two girls, Helen and Christine, a long time ago. Dr. Nagle, a special doctor, told the people in court that he found many signs of the girls being hurt very badly by someone.

Mr. Sinclair says he didn't do it, and the court is still trying to figure everything out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, Beth studied noble gasses while Jane decided to know more about alkanes.  Which student learned less about the smallest alkane? Answer:","output":"Beth learned less about the smallest alkane, as her focus was on noble gases rather than alkanes, which were the primary subject of Jane's studies. In order to provide a more detailed explanation, it is important to understand what noble gases and alkanes are, as well as what distinguishes the smallest alkane from other alkanes. Noble gases are a group of chemical elements found in Group 18 on the periodic table. They are highly unreactive due to their full outer electron shells, which gives them maximum stability. Some examples of noble gases include helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar). These gases are used in various applications, such as filling balloons, in neon signs, and as coolants in some nuclear reactors. On the other hand, alkanes are a class of hydrocarbons consisting of only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms, with single bonds between the carbon atoms. They are often referred to as saturated hydrocarbons, as they contain the maximum number of hydrogen atoms that can be bonded to the carbon atoms. Alkanes are the simplest type of hydrocarbons and play vital roles in the energy sector, primarily as fuels like methane, propane, and butane. Methane (CH4) is the smallest alkane, consisting of a single carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. It is a primary component of natural gas and is widely used as a fuel source. As methane is the first and simplest alkane in the alkane series, it is considered the base for studying and understanding alkanes in general. Given that Beth studied noble gases while Jane focused her studies on alkanes, it can be deduced that Beth learned less about methane, the smallest alkane, than Jane. As Jane was specifically researching alkanes, she would have a broader understanding of the properties, structures, and characteristics of methane and other alkanes compared to Beth, who was focused on the entirely different category of noble gases. Therefore, Beth learned less about the smallest alkane, methane, than Jane, whose studies were directly related to alkanes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Clarence Linden Crabbe II (; February 7, 1908 - April 23, 1983), commonly known by his stage name Buster Crabbe, was an American two-time Olympic swimmer and movie actor. He won the 1932 Olympic gold medal for 400-meter freestyle swimming event, which launched his career onto the silver screen. He starred in a number of popular films in the 1930s and 1940s. He also played the title role in the serials Tarzan the Fearless, Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. Crabbe starred in the television series, Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion (1955 to 1957) as Captain Michael Gallant; the adventure series aired on NBC. His real-life son, Cullen Crabbe, appeared in this show as the character \\"Cuffy Sanders\\".  Crabbe was featured frequently in archival footage in the children's television program, The Gabby Hayes Show. Prior to his playing \\"Captain Michael Gallant\\" Crabbe had hosted a local NYC based children's film wraparound television series The Buster Crabbe Show. The series, which was set against the backdrop of a ranch foreman's bunk house featured Crabbe engaging his viewers in games, stories, craftmaking, hobbies, informational segments, and interviews with guest performers and personalities in between reruns of old movie serials, westerns and comedies. The Buster Crabbe Show was seen weekday evenings on WOR-TV (Channel 9) in New York City from Monday March 12, 1951, to Friday October 3, 1952. The series returned to the NYC airways on WJZ-TV (Channel 7) (now WABC) on Monday September 21, 1953, and was retitled Buster's Buddies!. The WJZ TV version of the series included a studio audience of kids and became more of a kids' variety show. Despite the addition of the studio audience and Crabbe's personality, Buster's Buddies! was not a hit and it was canceled on Friday March 26, 1954.  Crabbe made regular television appearances, including one on an episode of the 1979 series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, in which he played a retired fighter pilot named \\"Brigadier Gordon\\" in honor of Flash Gordon. When Rogers (Gil Gerard) praises his flying, Gordon replies \\"I've been doing that sort of thing since before you were born.\\" Rogers (who was born over 500 years earlier) responds \\"You think so, old timer?\\" to which Gordon replies \\"Young man, I know so.\\" In fact, Crabbe had been playing \\"Buck Rogers\\" since long before Gerard was born.","output":"This text is about Clarence Linden Crabbe II, commonly known by his stage name Buster Crabbe, an American two-time Olympic swimmer and movie actor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We can do this by following these steps: 1. Start by expanding the equation:    683194*u + 12350 = 683064*u 2. Our goal is to have the variable \\"u\\" on only one side of the equation. In order to do that, we need to subtract 683064*u from both sides of the equation:    683194*u - 683064*u + 12350 = 683064*u - 683064*u 3.

To do that, we need to subtract 12350 from both sides of the equation:    130*u = -12350 5. Finally, to get the value of \\"u\\", we need to divide both sides by 130:    u = -12350 / 130 6.

Background: Douglas Richard Flutie (born October 23, 1962) is a former quarterback in the National Football League (NFL), Canadian Football League (CFL), and United States Football League (USFL). Flutie first rose to prominence during his college football career at Boston College, where he received the Heisman Trophy and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award in 1984. His \\"Hail Flutie\\" touchdown pass in a game against Miami on November 23, 1984 (dubbed \\"The Pass\\") is considered among the greatest moments in college football and American sports history. Flutie was selected as the 285th pick in the 11th round of the 1985 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams, making him the lowest drafted Heisman Award winner among those who were drafted. Context: Flutie played football for Boston College, the only Division I-A school to recruit him, from 1981 to 1984, and won the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award in his senior year (1984). Flutie became the first quarterback to win the Heisman since Pat Sullivan in 1971. Flutie left school as the NCAA's all-time passing yardage leader with 10,579 yards and was a consensus All-American as a senior. He earned Player of the Year awards from UPI, Kodak, The Sporting News, and the Maxwell Football Club. The quarterback coach for Boston College from 1981 - 1983 was Tom Coughlin.  Flutie gained national attention in 1984 when he led the Eagles to victory in a high-scoring, back-and-forth game against the Miami Hurricanes (led by QB Bernie Kosar). The game was nationally televised on CBS the day after Thanksgiving and thus had a huge audience. Miami staged a dramatic drive to take the lead, 45-41, in the closing minute of the game. Boston College then took possession at its own 22-yard line with 28 seconds to go. After two passes moved the ball another 30 yards, only 6 seconds remained. On the last play of the game, Flutie scrambled away from the defense and threw a \\"Hail Mary pass\\" that was caught in the end zone by Gerard Phelan, giving BC a 47-45 win. Flutie won the Heisman trophy a week later, but the voting had finished before the game; Flutie said, however, that \\"without the Hail Mary pass I think I could have been very easily forgotten\\".  The subsequent rise in applications for admission to Boston College after Flutie's \\"Hail Mary\\" gave rise to the admissions phenomenon known as the \\"Flutie Effect\\". This idea essentially states that a winning sports team can increase the recognition value of a school enough to make it more attractive to potential applicants.  In addition to his collegiate athletic achievement, Flutie maintained a distinguished academic record at Boston College. He was a candidate for a Rhodes Scholarship, for which he was named a finalist in 1984. Upon graduating, Flutie won a National Football Foundation post-graduate scholarship.  In November 2008, Flutie was honored by Boston College with a statue of him throwing his famous \\"Hail Mary\\" pass outside of Alumni Stadium. His number, 22, has been retired by the Boston College football program. Question: Who di dhe play for ?

He made many contributions that were crucial to the early development of all-electronic television. He is perhaps best known for his 1927 invention of the first fully functional all-electronic image pickup device (video camera tube), the \\"image dissector\\", as well as the first fully functional and complete all-electronic television system. He was also the first person to demonstrate such a system to the public. Farnsworth developed a television system complete with receiver and camera, which he produced commercially in the form of the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation, from 1938 to 1951, in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves.

We struggle to improve our memory, intelligence, and attention span. We drink cup after cup of coffee to help us get through the day. However, a new study published in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science warns that there are limits to how smart humans can get, and trying to increase your thinking ability could beurisky. Each of our body parts evolved in a certain way for a reason. For example, we are not 3 meters tall because most people's hearts are not strong enough to send blood up that high. Scientists are now saying that our thinking ability works in the same way. A baby's brain size is limited by a series of factors, such as the size of the mother's pelvis  . If our brains evolved to vbe bigger, there could be more deaths during childbirth.  The study of Ashkenazi Jews  , who have an average IQ much higher than other Europeans, showed that they were more likely to develop diseases of the nervous system. This might be because of their increased brainpower. If intelligence cannot be improved, can we at least get better at concentrating? Not really, say scientists. They studied drugs like caffeine that improve attention span. They found that the drugs only helped people with serious attention problems. For those who did not have trouble paying attention, the drugs could have the opposite effect. Scientists say that this suggests there is an upper limit to how much people can or should concentrate. Our memory is also a \\"double-edged sword  \\". People with extremely vivid   memories could end up having a difficult life because they cannot forget bad things that happen to them. Thomas Hills of the University of Warwick in the UK, one of the authors of the paper, said that considering all the problems in trying to get smarter, it's unlikely there will ever be a \\"supermind\\".

Review: While being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the Gundam Wing series, upon re-watching the series, I have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, the gundam design, character design, and character depth are masterfully executed. While at first appearing like a boy band of sorts, the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art, with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters. Consequently, it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character. Personally, I liked Heero because of his stoic personality. While I may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general (how can we obtain peace?) while providing action packed battles in large robot suits, which, to say the least, is excellent.

Question: 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area,  because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year.  Which month of the year was drier, August 2018 or August 2019?  Hint: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] Answer:","output":"To determine which month was drier, August 2018 or August 2019, we'll need to analyze the information provided and understand the pattern of the subtropical ridge's influence on the monsoon season. Step 1: Understand the influence of subtropical ridge on the monsoon season. - A stronger-than-normal subtropical ridge leads to a wet monsoon season in Asia. - The position of the ridge affects how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend in the United States.  - Monsoon conditions in the Desert Southwest typically occur from July to September. Step 2: Analyze the information for 2018 and 2019. - 2018: Very wet year for the Four Corners area due to a strong subtropical ridge. - 2019: Dry year due to a weaker subtropical ridge. Step 3: Compare August of each year. - August 2018: Given that 2018 was a very wet year, it's likely that the subtropical ridge was stronger than normal, leading to increased monsoon moisture across the Desert Southwest. - August 2019: In contrast, 2019 was a dry year, indicating a weaker subtropical ridge, which, in turn, would result in less monsoon moisture and fewer thunderstorms in the Four Corners area. Based on this analysis, August 2019 was drier than August 2018, as the subtropical ridge that year lacked strength, leading to decreased monsoon moisture and storms in the region compared to the wetter conditions experienced in August 2018."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: CSKA Moscow officials have accused Manchester airport immigration officials of deliberately refusing their star player Zoran Tosic the right to play in the Champions League match at the Etihad Stadium. Former Manchester United winger Tosic is not in the team to face City after allegedly arriving at the airport on Tuesday with the wrong visa. The Serb was allowed in the country but not allowed to play in or even attend the match. Now directors of the Russian club have claimed the decision was a deliberate act aimed at sabotaging CSKA’s plans for tonight’s game in Group E. CSKA Moscow's Zoran Tosic was told he couldn’t play against Manchester City because of a visa issue. According to sources in Russia, the former Manchester United player was only in possession of a ‘transit visa’ rather than the necessary work visa. As such he was allowed in to the country but told he could not play in the game or even travel to the stadium for the game. It is understood that Tosic is currently at the CSKA team hotel in Manchester City centre. CSKA, meanwhile, are considering an official complaint, feeling that their player has been deliberately targeted because of the threat he carries on the field. City need to win after taking only two points from their first three matches. Tosic (left) apparently only had a 'transit visa' and so was forced to stay at the team's hotel during the match.

Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal. Her biographer Victoria Glendinning considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West's \\"one magnificent act of creation\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: where do the electrons come from in the electron transport chain?","output":"The electron transport chain (ETC) is a critical process in cellular respiration, playing a fundamental role in converting energy from nutrient molecules into the readily usable form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Electrons play an essential role in this process, and their origin in the electron transport chain comes primarily from the reduction of certain coenzymes during the earlier stages of cellular respiration. In eukaryotic cells, the electron transport chain is located within the inner mitochondrial membrane, while in prokaryotic cells, it's embedded in the plasma membrane. The process allows for the controlled release of energy, which is harnessed for ATP synthesis. The ETC consists of a series of protein complexes (Complexes I-IV) and mobile electron carriers. The source of electrons in the electron transport chain can be traced back to the earlier stages of cellular respiration, including glycolysis, the conversion of pyruvate to Acetyl CoA, and the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or the TCA cycle). During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate, generating a small amount of ATP. During this stage, a pair of electrons are transferred to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), reducing it to NADH. This transfer occurs by the removal of a hydrogen atom, consisting of a proton and an electron, from a molecule in the glycolytic pathway. The NADH thus produced carries high-energy electrons and moves to the next stages of cellular respiration. The pyruvate molecules generated in glycolysis are transported into the mitochondria (in eukaryotes) and converted into Acetyl CoA. In this process, another pair of electrons are transferred from pyruvate to NAD+, generating another molecule of NADH. This takes place through the action of an enzyme known as pyruvate dehydrogenase. Next comes the citric acid cycle, where each Acetyl CoA enters the cycle and undergoes a series of chemical reactions. Throughout this process, electrons are further extracted and transferred to both NAD+ and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The reduction of these coenzymes results in the formation of NADH and FADH2. For each turn of the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH and one molecule of FADH2 are produced. Finally, the electrons carried by NADH and FADH2 enter the electron transport chain. Complex I and Complex II in the ETC receive electrons from NADH and FADH2, respectively. These complexes pass the electrons through a series of redox reactions to additional protein complexes and mobile electron carriers. The ultimate destination of these electrons is molecular oxygen (O2), which becomes reduced to form water. In summary, the electrons involved in the electron transport chain come primarily from the reduction of NAD+ and FAD during glycolysis, pyruvate conversion to Acetyl CoA, and the citric acid cycle. As these high-energy electrons pass through the ETC, they release energy that is used to create an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which in turn enables the synthesis of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This plaza has so many different eateries that you could do a food crawl and never leave the area. That is basically what I did today. After lunch at Thai Style Noodle House, my friend and I felt like getting boba, before going to Sunville Bakery. Being told that this place has the freshest tapioca in town, we thought it would be a good time to give it a try.   I had originally ordered the durian,  the fruit that smells like feet, but they ran out. I then asked for the mixed vegetable juice, but the lady did not know how to make it. Eventually, I decided  on the avocado. At this point, I had thoroughly disgusted my friend with all my choices and she vowed to stay away from my drink, so bonus.  My friend had ordered the banana and was not overly fond of it.   The rating is not due to the fact that they ran out, or the service was bad, but it was because the boba was too fresh or soft. The pearls at the bottom of my drink were piping hot and had no consistency or texture. As I began to chew, the surprise hit me, I felt no give as they disintegrated. On top of that, the smoothies had no creaminess to it. The sweetness was perfect, they do not use a sickening amount of syrup. Overall it tasted like fruit water with soft tofu. Select from: 1). negative 2). positive","output":"1). negative The sentiment of the review is negative because although the reviewer mentioned some positive aspects, such as the variety of eateries in the area and the adequate sweetness of the smoothies, the main points of criticism were focused on the quality of the boba and the smoothies.

The second, Uziel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body. The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a \\"dark soul\\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon.

A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends.

Movie title: Dracula: Prince of Darkness Movie plot: A prologue replays the final scenes from Dracula, in which Dr. Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) destroys Dracula (Christopher Lee) by driving him into the sunlight. These scenes are accompanied by voice-over narration that describes how Van Helsing, a scholar of vampirism, was able to end Dracula's century-long reign of terror and destroy his cult; only the memory of Dracula's evil remains. The main story begins as Father Sandor prevents local authorities from disposing of a woman's corpse as if it were a vampire. Sandor chastises the presiding priest for perpetuating the fear of vampirism, and reminds him that Dracula was destroyed 10 years previously. Sandor visits an inn and warns four English tourists â the Kents â not to visit Karlsbad; they ignore his advice. As night approaches, the Kents find themselves abandoned by their fear-stricken coach driver two kilometres from Karlsbad, in view of a castle. A driverless carriage takes them to the castle, where they find a dining table set for four people and their bags unpacked in the bedrooms. A servant named Klove explains that his master, the late Count Dracula, ordered that the castle should always be ready to welcome strangers. After dinner the Kents settle in their rooms. Later that night, Alan investigates a noise and follows Klove to the crypt, where Klove kills him and mixes his blood with Dracula's ashes, reviving the Count. Klove entices Helen to the crypt, where she becomes Dracula's first victim. The next morning Charles and Diana can find no trace of Alan, Helen or Klove. Charles takes Diana to a woodsmanâs hut and then he returns to the castle to search for Alan and Helen. Klove tricks Diana into returning to the castle. Charles finds Alanâs dismembered body in a trunk in the crypt. It is now dark and Dracula rises. Diana meets Helen, but Helen has become one of the undead and she attacks her. Dracula enters and warns Helen away from Diana. Charles struggles with Dracula until Diana realises her crucifix is an effective weapon against...","output":"Dracula. In the movie \\"Dracula: Prince of Darkness,\\" the character Diana is played by Suzan Farmer. Suzan Farmer was a British actress who appeared in numerous films and television productions throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In this film, she plays the role of Diana Kent, a young English tourist who, along with her husband and friends, unwittingly finds herself a guest at Count Dracula's castle. \\"Dracula: Prince of Darkness\\" is a 1966 British horror film produced by Hammer Film Productions. It is the third entry to Hammer's Dracula film series and is a direct sequel to the 1958 film \\"Dracula.\\" The film stars Christopher Lee as Count Dracula, and Peter Cushing as Dr. Van Helsing, though their paths do not cross in this particular installment. In the movie, the main story revolves around the resurrection of Dracula after he was destroyed ten years ago by Dr. Van Helsing. A traveller named Father Sandor warns four English tourists, the Kents, to avoid visiting Karlsbad, but they ignore his advice. When their coach driver abandons them near the castle, a driverless carriage takes them to the castle once owned by Dracula.  The film's plot combines classic elements of gothic horror with a supernatural thriller, as the English tourists find themselves entangled in the dark web of Count Dracula's return. The presence of mysterious servants, abandoned castles, and unexplained occurrences contributes to the eerie atmosphere of the movie. The film also emphasizes the struggle between good and evil, as characters like Diana and Charles courageously face off against Dracula and his victims-turned-vampires. In deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, several factors must be considered. The Hammer Dracula films have a dedicated fan base, and the combination of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in lead roles will likely draw interest from viewers who enjoy classic horror movies. Additionally, gothic horror films often create a visually compelling world, with opulent costumes, atmospheric settings, and dramatic lighting. However, it is important to consider the potential return on investment for this particular proposal. The movie could appeal to a niche market, given its 1960s production and specific genre. Modern audiences might expect updated special effects and production values, which may not be present in a film created in the mid-20th century. Overall, your decision to invest in this film proposal largely depends on your individual preferences and analysis of the target audience. If you believe the appeal of classic horror films and the talents of actors like Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing can outweigh potential concerns about dated production values, it may be a project worth investing in. On the other hand, if you feel that the film's unique qualities may limit its commercial appeal, it might be best to explore other investment opportunities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

True, he had \\"signed papers\\" to teach the school for a year; but he knew that the trustees would let him off if he procured a suitable substitute. He resolved to teach until the fall vacation, which came in October, and then go. Kilmeny had promised that their marriage should take place in the following spring.

The idea of Kilmeny in a boarding school was something that could not be thought about without laughter.  \\"I can't see why she can't learn all she needs to learn after she is married to me, just as well as before,\\" he grumbled to her uncle and aunt.  \\"But we want to keep her with us for another winter yet,\\" explained Thomas Gordon patiently. \\"We are going to miss her terrible when she does go, Master.

Q:Information:  - Freya North ( born 21 November 1967 ) is a British writer , active since 1996 , and one of the precursors of chick lit. Her novels , which have been critical and financial successes , centre on strong female characters and their raunchy exploits .  - Genre fiction, also known as popular fiction, is plot-driven fictional works written with the intent of fitting into a specific literary genre, in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre. Genre fiction is generally distinguished from \\"literary fiction\\". Screenwriting teacher Robert McKee defines \\"genre conventions\\" as the \\"specific settings, roles, events, and values that define individual genres and their subgenres\\". These conventions, always fluid, are usually implicit, but sometimes are made into explicit requirements by publishers of fiction as a guide to authors seeking publication. There is no consensus as to exactly what the conventions of any genre are, or even what the genres themselves are; assigning of works to genres is to some extent arbitrary and subjective.  - Chick lit or Chick literature is genre fiction, which consists of heroine-centered narratives that focus on the trials and tribulations of their individual protagonists. The genre often addresses issues of modern womanhood  from romantic relationships to female friendships to matters in the workplace  in humorous and lighthearted ways. At its onset, chick lits protagonists tended to be single, white, heterosexual, British and American women in their late twenties and early thirties, living in metropolitan areas. The genre became popular in the late 1990s, with chick lit titles topping bestseller lists and the creation of imprints devoted entirely to chick lit. Chick lit critics generally agree that British author Helen Fieldings \\"Bridget Joness Diary\\" (1996) is the ur-text of chick lit.  - Helen Fielding (born 19 February 1958) is an English novelist and screenwriter, best known as the creator of the fictional character Bridget Jones, and a sequence of novels and films beginning with the life of a thirtysomething singleton in London trying to make sense of life and love.

Charles Spotswoode's son Jimmy became involved with \\"the Canary\\", a conniving showgirl. The Canary, determined to force Jimmy to marry her so she can join the social elite, threatens to reveal that Jimmy was embezzling from his father. She turns down the elder Spotswoode's bribe to leave Jimmy alone. She telephones two men she has been blackmailing, Cleaver and Mannix, and demands one final generous gift from each of them by the next day. She makes the same request of \\"creepy\\" admirer Dr. Lindquist. Her ex-husband Tony Sheel eavesdrops and wants half, but she refuses to give him anything, even after he hits her. Cleaver, Mannix and Lindquist are all shown lurking about her apartment building late that night. Spotswoode visits her at her apartment around midnight, but cannot get her to change her mind. After he reaches the lobby of her building, he and another person hear screams from her place. They knock on the door, but she assures them that she is fine. The Canary is found strangled the next day. The coroner places the time of death around midnight. District Attorney Markham investigates, aided by Philo Vance (a close friend of Charles Spotswoode) and Police Sergeant Heath. After all the suspects are brought in for questioning, Vance asks Markham to keep them waiting for a few hours. Markham agrees. Vance subtly maneuvers Cleaver, Mannix, Lindquist and the two Spotswoodes into playing poker to pass the time so he can observe their personality traits. Only one shows the daring, imagination and discipline required for the crime; that man bluffs Vance, betting everything with just a pair of deuces. The suspects are then released. Sheel, who witnessed the murder while hiding in the closet, sends the killer several blackmail letters. He too is strangled.

Use a bar of clay softener. Add in liquid clay. Add mineral oil. Rub the clay with petroleum jelly. Combine hard clay with fresh clay.","output":"Title: The Art of Softening Clay: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction: Clay sculptures and pottery have been a significant part of human culture for thousands of years. Over time, people have developed various techniques for creating, molding, and conditioning the clay, which is essential for the longevity of their artwork. This article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to soften clay by using different methods such as liquid diluent, clay softeners, and more. Step 1: Add in a liquid diluent Clay can often become hard due to moisture loss, making it difficult to mold and work with. To combat this, adding a liquid diluent is beneficial. A few drops of water or even rubbing alcohol can significantly soften the clay. Adding a few more micro-droplets of the liquid diluent will help in evenly distributing the moisture throughout the clay, making it more pliable for sculpting. It is essential to be cautious with the amount added, as too much can lead to a mushy texture. Step 2: Use a bar of clay softener Clay softeners are specially designed products to aid in the conditioning and softening of hardened clay. To use a clay softener, rub the bar over the hard clay surface and knead the clay until you achieve the desired softness. The softeners will penetrate the clay, preventing it from becoming brittle and ensuring its longevity. Be sure to wear protective gloves while working with clay softeners, as there might be some chemicals present in these products. Step 3: Add in liquid clay Another way to soften and condition clay is by adding liquid clay (or polymer clay) to the mix. Liquid clay is a versatile medium that can be easily combined with solid clay. This method helps in improving the overall blend and creating a smoother texture. To add liquid clay, first, warm the solid clay slightly, and then mix it with liquid clay in a suitable ratio. This combination will result in a softer, more workable clay mass. Step 4: Add mineral oil Mineral oil can also be used to soften clay. The oil works by providing a lubricating effect to help loosen the hard clay particles, making it easier for the artist to work with. Add a small amount of mineral oil to the clay and knead it thoroughly. It is important to be precise with the quantity of mineral oil used, as too much can result in a greasy texture that might be challenging to work with. Step 5: Rub the clay with petroleum jelly Petroleum jelly can serve as a useful alternative for clay softening. Simply rub a small amount of petroleum jelly onto the hardened clay and knead it gently. The jelly will help retain moisture in the clay, making it more malleable for your artwork. This method is especially popular among professional sculptors since petroleum jelly is inexpensive and readily available. Step 6: Combine hard clay with fresh clay If the clay is still too hard after trying the methods mentioned above, consider mixing it with fresh clay. By combining pieces of hard clay with more pliable fresh pieces, you can achieve an intermediate texture that's easier to sculpt and mold. This technique is particularly useful when working with natural clay, which tends to dry out rapidly. Conclusion: Softening clay is essential for a successful sculpture or pottery piece. Applying the steps mentioned above can help artists tackle hardened clay effectively and ensure their artwork lasts for years to come. Whether you're a seasoned professional or a beginner, these techniques offer various solutions to make your clay soft, pliable, and ready for your creative touch."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with \\"If I Were a Boy\\"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio.

Answer a question about this article: The practice of labelling the infringement of exclusive rights in creative works as \\"piracy\\" predates statutory copyright law. Prior to the Statute of Anne in 1710, the Stationers' Company of London in 1557, received a Royal Charter giving the company a monopoly on publication and tasking it with enforcing the charter. Those who violated the charter were labelled pirates as early as 1603. The term \\"piracy\\" has been used to refer to the unauthorized copying, distribution and selling of works in copyright. Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works uses the term \\"piracy\\" in relation to copyright infringement, stating \\"Pirated works may be seized on importation into those countries of the Union where the original work enjoys legal protection.\\" Article 61 of the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) requires criminal procedures and penalties in cases of \\"willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale.\\" Piracy traditionally refers to acts of copyright infringement intentionally committed for financial gain, though more recently, copyright holders have described online copyright infringement, particularly in relation to peer-to-peer file sharing networks, as \\"piracy.\\" What did the Royal Charter give to the Stationers' Company of London?","output":"The Royal Charter gave the Stationers' Company of London a special permission called a monopoly.

SEC Allows Some Adjusted Revenue Metrics Under “Unusual Circumstances” The Securities and Exchange Commission will allow some companies to report adjusted revenues under special circumstances, but these must clear it with the regulator first, said Mark Kronforst, chief accountant for the division of corporation finance. “If you do have unusual circumstances, please do come and talk to us,” Mr. Kronfrost said, speaking on a panel at the American Institute of CPAs conference in Washington D.C. “We don’t want to suggest that there’s no circumstance under which revenue can be adjusted.” The SEC in May issued new guidelines on the use of financial figures that don’t conform with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a push to rein in the practice. The guidelines targeted the prominence of non-GAAP figures in earnings releases and specifically prohibited certain adjustments to revenue. The SEC’s focus on revenue adjustments prompted several companies in the video game industry, for example, to drop their non-GAAP revenue figures from financial filings. Moreover, the regulator has criticized companies, including Tesla Motors Inc., for continuing the practice despite the new guidelines. By contrast, Microsoft Corp. has continued to report adjusted revenue due to unusual business circumstances, Mr. Kronforst said. Microsoft is transitioning its Windows business from a license sale model to a software as a service model at the same time as U.S. rules governing revenue accounting are on the cusp of change, said Frank Brod, Microsoft’s chief accounting officer, speaking on the same panel. Under current revenue accounting rules, Microsoft recognizes its license sales revenues upfront, but must recognize its growing pool of subscription revenue over time, Mr. Brod said. But the timing of subscription revenue recognition will change under the new accounting rules, so the company has provided non-GAAP revenue metrics as way of helping investors bridge the two standards, Mr. Brod said. Microsoft sought input from its audit committee members, and held discussions with the SEC’s corporation finance division as well as with the office of the chief accountant to ensure it could keep reporting that non-GAAP measure while also complying with the new non-GAAP guidelines, Mr. Brod said. “As Frank has demonstrated, there situations where we think it’s just fine [to adjust revenue],” Mr. Konforst said. Still, Mr. Brod said Microsoft will adopt the new revenue recognition rules as early as it possibly can, which is July 1, 2017 for the company. “We will no longer have a non-GAAP adjustment to revenue at that time,” Mr. Brod said. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is permitting some companies to report adjusted revenues under unusual circumstances. For exceptional situations, firms looking to provide non-GAAP measures must gain approval from the regulator. Although the SEC issued new guidelines in May that aimed to limit the use of non-GAAP figures in earnings releases, the decision to adjust reporting under special circumstances has emerged from discussions around Microsoft's ongoing transition toward a software-as-a-service model."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Nogales, Mexico (CNN) -- In the push to free an American woman from a Mexican prison, a video shown in court Thursday could be key. The security camera footage shows Yanira Maldonado and her husband boarding a bus in Mexico last week. They are carrying a purse, two blankets and two bottles of water. It's an everyday scene that plays out at bus stations around the world. But in this case, defense attorney Francisco Benitez argues that the images are a crucial piece of evidence. Why? Because nothing they're carrying, he argues, could hold the amount of marijuana that Yanira Maldonado is accused of smuggling.

Women who experience stress, worry or panic attacks before becoming pregnant are more than twice as likely to report that their child cried ‘excessively’. It is not known why this link exists, but researchers said mothers suffering from anxiety may have a more ‘intrusive’ parenting style that could cause babies to cry more. Stress: Mothers with a history of anxiety have babies who cry for longer, research showed (posed by model) Experts also suggest a baby’s excessive crying may be due to the mother’s production of stress hormones during pregnancy, which may cross the placenta and affect the development of a child’s brain. They are calling for women suffering from anxiety in pregnancy to be supported during early motherhood. GP Dr Clare Bailey, a parenting specialist, said: ‘Mothers can easily get into a traumatic negative cycle when worrying about a newborn child. The more they worry, the less they sleep and calm themselves down and the more they worry. ‘Anxiety can make them hypervigilant, distressed by crying and even rejected by their child. ‘It intuitively sounds likely that a calm mother feeling relaxed, comfortable and confident will be more likely to help a child regulate its crying, while an anxious mother may be less likely to help a baby to self-settle. Babies can pick up emotional cues very early on.’ Some 300 mothers were interviewed while pregnant and asked about their history of anxiety (posed by model) The study, published in the journal Archives Of Disease In Childhood, looked at nearly 300 women who were in the early stages of pregnancy. They were asked about their history of anxiety and depression, and were interviewed during their pregnancy and until their child was 16 months old. Ten per cent of the women reported excessive crying following the birth. Further analysis found that babies born to women with an anxiety disorder were significantly more likely to cry for longer periods. Child health specialist Dr Harriet Hiscock, from the University of Melbourne, warned that the role of the father also needed to be examined and cautioned against adding to ‘a mother’s day of worry by blaming her for her infant’s crying’. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The latest research indicates that anxious mothers are more likely to have babies who cry for longer periods.

While the exact reason for this link is unknown, researchers suggest that mothers with anxiety may have a more intrusive parenting style, leading to increased crying in their babies. Additionally, excessive crying may be attributed to the mother's production of stress hormones during pregnancy. These stress hormones may cross the placenta and impact the development of the child's brain. Experts are calling for women experiencing anxiety during pregnancy to be provided support during early motherhood. Dr. Clare Bailey, a parenting specialist, explains that anxiety can create a negative cycle for new mothers. The more they worry, the less they sleep, and the more anxious they become.

Please answer the following question: Sondra Crench kicked a roach out of her way as she walked into her tiny apartment and sat down at her old laptop. It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay. Then she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games. Sounded pretty cool for kids. She wished there had been such a place when she was growing up there. But what really caught her eye was the note about auditions for a house band. It would play two hours a night, and earn 2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by.

Plot title: Charly Movie plot: Charly Gordon (Cliff Robertson), an intellectually disabled man with a strong desire to make himself smarter, has been attending night school for two years where he has been taught by Alice Kinnian (Claire Bloom) to read and write. However, his spelling remains poor and he is even unable to spell his own name. Alice takes Charly to the \\"Nemur-Straus\\" clinic run by Dr. Richard Nemur and Dr. Anna Straus. Nemur and Straus have been increasing the intelligence of laboratory mice with a new surgical procedure and are looking for a human test subject. As part of a series of tests to ascertain Charly's suitability for the procedure, he is made to race Algernon, one of the laboratory mice. Algernon physically runs through a maze while Charly uses a pencil to trace his way through a diagram of the same maze. Charly is disappointed that he consistently loses the races. Nevertheless, he is given the experimental surgery. After the surgery, Charly is initially angered that he is not immediately smarter than he was before and still loses in races against Algernon. Eventually, however, he beats Algernon in a race and then his intelligence starts increasing rapidly. Alice continues to teach him, but he soon surpasses her. Charly's co-workers also try to tease him by making him work on a machine that they believe he will not be able to work. When Charly shows he can work the machine, his co-workers are not pleased with the fact that he is now intelligent and cannot be teased anymore. They sign a petition against him and he loses his job at the bakery. Charly also starts staring at Alice's bottom and breasts as well as drawing and painting abstract nude figures of her.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  and the situation: Scientists studied water stratification in two saltwater lakes. they were trying to find out why the fish population decreased in Long lake, and was very healthy and abundant in Shoal lake. They found out the phenomenon occurred more often in Long lake, leading to very many unpleasant chain effects.

Governed by a set of 42 laws, this globally admired sport has seen numerous changes and evolutions throughout the years. However, despite various updates and adaptations, certain rulings have generated far-reaching debates and deliberations. Consequently, the International Cricket Council (ICC), the chief governing body of international cricket, is poised to revise one of the game's most controversial laws based on the recommendations of an expert committee. This comprehensive analysis will delve into the background of the contentious law, the expert committee's report, and the potential implications that the revision brings to the cricketing world. Background and Controversial Law: Among the 42 cricket laws, one in particular has been the subject of widespread dispute. The controversy stems from the fact that this law is considered unfair by the majority of cricket-playing nations and has recently led to several contentious decisions that have negatively affected the outcome of crucial matches. While the specifics of the law remain undisclosed, it is known that this controversial law has been pivotal in influencing game results and public opinion. The Expert Committee and their Report: In response to growing concerns and calls for change, the ICC established an expert committee to thoroughly examine the law and its consequences. This committee was composed of former cricket players, umpires, coaches, and administrators, along with legal and sports management professionals. Their task was to scrutinize the law and develop a comprehensive report that would inform and guide the ICC's decision on potential revisions. The report delved into several key aspects, including: 1. Historical origins and the evolution of the law. 2. Comparison with other sports and their governing rules. 3. Analysis of its practicality and fairness in today's game. 4. Potential impact on players, teams, and the overall perception of cricket as a sport. 5. Recommendations on revising the law to ensure fairness and uphold the spirit of the game. Implications of the Revision: The forthcoming revision, based on the insightful recommendations outlined in the expert committee's report, is expected to initiate a series of significant developments within international cricket. The primary implications of the revision are: 1. Alteration of match outcomes: As this controversial law has previously influenced game results, the revision seeks to limit such occurrences, ensuring that matches are decided fairly and squarely on the field. 2. Impact on players' mindset and strategies: With the controversial law revised, players and teams may feel more at ease, leading to changes in game plans and strategies. 3. Maintenance of the game's integrity: By addressing this contentious issue, the ICC showcases its commitment to protecting and preserving the integrity of cricket, reinforcing its status as a \\"gentleman's game.\\" 4. Encouragement of dialogue and review: The revision process highlights the need for continuous evaluation of the laws, which may prompt further examinations and adaptations to ensure the game remains relevant, dynamic, and fair. Conclusion: The revision of the controversial law in international cricket marks a significant turning point for the sport. Strengthened by the thorough research and recommendations of the expert committee, the ICC's bold decision to address this issue head-on will undoubtedly result in a renewed sense of fairness and balance within the game. As cricket continues to evolve and captivate audiences worldwide, it is essential that the laws governing the sport reflect its dynamic nature while upholding its long-standing traditions and values. The upcoming revision serves as a testament to the ICC's dedication to preserving and enhancing the spirit of cricket for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You know when we watch movies and sometimes there are good guys and bad guys? Today, we are going to talk about an actor from India named Sanjay Dutt. He got into some trouble with the law a few years ago, and the court just gave him a punishment. Sanjay Dutt is an actor, which means he pretends to be different characters in movies. But in real life, he was involved in something very serious. Back in 1993, some very bad people set off bombs in a big city called Mumbai. It was a very sad and scary time. The police found out that Sanjay Dutt had some powerful and dangerous things called weapons. These weapons were related to the bombings. The police said Sanjay had an AK-56 rifle and a 9 mm pistol, and he wasn't allowed to have them. Sometimes, people can have weapons if they have a special permission (called a license), but Sanjay did not have one. In 2006, a court found Sanjay guilty of illegally having these weapons. That means the court believed that he broke the law by keeping those weapons without permission. Sanjay told the court that he only had those weapons because he wanted to keep his family safe from the bad people. He did not want to hurt anyone. Now, India's top court, which is like the biggest and most important group of judges in the country, has decided that Sanjay Dutt must go to prison for five years. Prison is a place where people have to stay when they break the laws, so they can learn from their mistakes and not do bad things anymore. So, kids, now you know the story of Sanjay Dutt, the famous actor who got into trouble with the law.

Here, \\"little\\" is translated as \\"kleinen\\" (the adjective for small) and \\"tag\\" as \\"Anhänger\\" (the German word for a luggage label or tag). - \\"so you know\\" can be translated as \\"damit Sie wissen\\". - \\"where\\" is translated to \\"wohin\\", which means \\"to where\\", as it refers to the destination of the luggage. - \\"the airline\\" is translated to \\"die Fluggesellschaft\\". - \\"sent it\\" is translated as \\"es geschickt hat\\". - \\"which is different from\\" is translated as \\"was sich von ... unterscheidet\\". - \\"where the airline sent you\\" can be translated to \\"dem Ort, an den die Fluggesellschaft Sie geschickt hat\\".

Sentence Analysis: The sentence discusses \\"well-thought stunts or a car chase.\\" If taken literally, the sentence mentions two scenarios: stunts that are well thought out, and a car chase. It's important to note that there are no obvious positive or negative words, just neutral. So, we need to infer the underlying sentiment from the context, which here is absent. 2. Sentiment Inference: Since there is no explicit context signalling how the user feels about well-thought stunts or a car chase, it makes determining concrete sentiments challenging. 3. Sentiment Complexity: These subjects may sound thrilling and exciting to some people who enjoy actions and stunts, thus holding a positive sentiment. On the contrary, others might associate this with danger or risky behaviours, thus holding a negative sentiment.  4. Conclusion: As there's no surrounding context or explicit expressive words, the sentence in isolation would be labelled as neutral. It's impossible to assign a definitive sentiment without more information about the user's feelings or the context in which it's said.  So, for an AI, the given sentence devoid of explicit context appears to have a neutral sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They appeal to everyone from amateurs to Olympians, if nothing else, because it may seem a far more comfortable option than pounding the streets in the depth of winter. But how safe are they? The question has been raised by the sudden death of Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Dave Goldberg, who was found lying next to a machine at a Mexican resort. The SurveyMonkey chief executive had slipped, banged his head and later died of his injuries. About 24,000 people were admitted to US hospitals last year with treadmill-related injuries, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) estimates, with slips and strains the most common causes. But deaths are rare, with 30 reported deaths over a 12-year period to 2012, according to the CPSC, and not all of these are caused by hazards specific to treadmills. Some people suffer heart attacks from the exercise, for example. Indeed, you are more likely to be killed by lightning than by exercising on a treadmill. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 261 people died in the US after being struck by lightning between 2006 and 2013. Children, however, are at particular risk. The daughter of US boxer Mike Tyson died after becoming entangled in the cable of a treadmill, and there are numerous cases of children suffering severe friction burns after trapping fingers and hands in the revolving belt. Australia has even launched a public campaign on the dangers of treadmills to young children. Few gym companies in the UK approached for information responded, but LA fitness said that the number of people injured on treadmills was \\"low - just 2% of all our accidents\\". The company recommends being properly inducted on machines, knowing the safety features, having water at hand and not looking at your feet when you are running as among the best ways to stay safe. And any inherent risks in with exercise need to be contrasted with the risks of inactivity. Advice on exercising can appear confusing - one recent report suggested that intensive training may be as bad as not jogging at all. But World Health Organization advice remains that adults should do at least 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week.","output":"Treadmills have become an essential and best-selling piece of gym equipment in the US, catering to everyone from amateurs to Olympians due to their versatility and appealing as a comfortable alternative to outdoor running during harsh weather conditions.

It revolutionized the world of communication, knowledge dissemination and ultimately, laid the foundation for the cultural, scientific and industrial growth of the modern world. In this article, we will explore the history of the Gutenberg printing press, its impact on society, and how it has shaped the course of human history. The Life of Johannes Gutenberg Before delving into the invention itself, it is essential to understand the inventor behind this revolutionary technology. Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg was born around 1400 in Mainz, Germany, to a family of merchants and metalworkers. He was exposed to the crafts of metalworking and goldsmithing from a young age, which significantly influenced his future endeavors and inventions. During his early years, Gutenberg moved between Strasbourg, where he gained experience with the booming paper trade, and Mainz, where the intellectual and religious environment influenced his printing aspirations. Eventually, with the knowledge he gleaned from his travels, Gutenberg began working on a project that would change the world—the invention of the moveable type printing press. The Invention of the Gutenberg Printing Press Until the 1440s, the production of books and documents primarily relied on manual labor, including the tedious process of scribes meticulously hand-copying every word. This method was slow, expensive, and limited in scope, causing the distribution and access to information to remain limited to a select few. Gutenberg's groundbreaking invention consisted of several critical elements that made mass production of printed materials possible. The most notable was the development of the \\"moveable type,\\" which consisted of individual metal letter blocks that could be arranged to form words and sentences. These metal typefaces were cast using a metal alloy comprised mostly of lead, allowing for repeatable use and consistent results.  Additionally, Gutenberg's printing press featured an innovative inking mechanism known as the \\"inking ball,\\" which significantly improved the process of applying uniform ink to the typefaces. Finally, Gutenberg's press utilized a screw mechanism, reminiscent of those in wine and olive presses, to apply ample and even pressure to the inked typefaces onto the paper. The Impact of the Gutenberg Printing Press The invention of the Gutenberg printing press had far-reaching consequences on society, impacting various aspects that include religion, knowledge dissemination, and cultural growth. Some of these consequences are as follows: 1. Democratization of Knowledge: The printing press allowed books and written materials to be produced more quickly and inexpensively than ever before, which led to a dramatic increase in the number of books available to the general public. This democratization of knowledge enabled broader segments of society to become literate and informed, no longer restricting education to a privileged few. 2. The Reformation: As more people gained access to religious texts, they became increasingly educated about their faith and its institutional structures. This directly contributed to various reform movements throughout Europe, particularly the Protestant Reformation, which challenged the authority of the Roman Catholic Church and initiated lasting religious, political, and social changes. 3. The Scientific Revolution: The ease of sharing and distributing ideas fostered by the printing press contributed to the birth of the Scientific Revolution. Pioneering scientists like Galileo Galilei, Nicolaus Copernicus, and Isaac Newton were able to publish their groundbreaking works, disseminating their findings and sparking a wave of intellectual curiosity that ultimately led to great advancements in various scientific fields. 4. The Enlightenment: The spread of information enabled by the Gutenberg printing press spurred critical thinking, skepticism, and intellectual exchange. This culminated in the period known as the Enlightenment, characterized by significant advancements in philosophy, politics, and social thought that laid the groundwork for modern democratic and humanistic ideals. Conclusion The Gutenberg printing press fundamentally transformed society by democratizing access to information, knowledge, and ideas. It acted as a catalyst for social, religious, and intellectual revolutions that significantly impacted the way humans perceived the world around them - shaping the modern world as we know it today. In an increasingly digital age, it is essential to remember the impact of Gutenberg's invention and the profound legacy it has left behind. The lessons it teaches us about the power of knowledge and its dissemination remain relevant as we navigate the complex landscape of technology and information in the 21st century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Watching Fire and Ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year. It wasn't at all a bad movie, certainly not average, but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one-dimensional (which, perhaps as based on Frank Miller's comic book, was the right decision to go with). But its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody sword-led combat, with the occasional freaky creature or super-hot female to go with the painterly surroundings. While I would probably re-watch Fire and Ice before 300 again, they both aroused that similar feeling - the exception this time being, naturally, that it's Frank Frazetta, the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics, collaborating with director Ralph Bakshi, in what isn't typical Hollywood fare but something for the die-hard fans. What this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time (it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their Masters of the Universe VHS tapes back in the day) is the possible cons mentioned before and, maybe, that you will see something somewhat unique. Fire and Ice isn't even the only Bakshi rotoscoped feature, but it's possibly the most fluid- if not quite my personal favorite- of the few he made, and he and his team create a whole striking world that's part pre-historic, part out-of-this-world fantastic, and part medieval, and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds, the skies and grounds. There's a slight drawback for Bakshi fans in this facet of character design; Bakshi went as far as to say it's more Frazetta than him. This may be true, but it doesn't make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we don't see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion (my favorite was the momentary skeleton-guide- how they rotoscoped that amazes me). I neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it. If you're already a die-hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a 'damsel' or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada, so suffice to say it's about, well, Fire against Ice, with characters named Nekron and Darkwolf (the coolest male of the lot and most comic-book in appearance) and Teegra (the typical hottie who's almost *too* perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure). What the plot does do, as an asset, is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action, the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle, like when the ogres are hunting after Teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes. And per usual for Bakshi, he conjures up some craziness (if not quite his usual inspired lunacy) in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material. If you've seen Wizards, you'll understand what I mean to a lesser extent. So, if you're an animation buff, seek this out right away for some 'old-school' (i.e. 1980s) action and incredible design. For everyone else, it's... good, not great, as I would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension, with some alterations, 300.

Question: A big fountain was the center piece of the renovation, it had all been paid for by a grant to the what? Options: - city - state - front of casino - rome - public place  The answer is \\"city\\" because","output":"the grant was likely given by a municipal government or local authority in order to revitalize a public space, improve the aesthetics of an area, and foster a sense of community engagement. There are several reasons why a city would be the entity responsible for funding such a project. First, fountains are often found in public squares, parks, or other communal areas that are meant for the enjoyment of the local population. As a result, these installations are typically governed and maintained by the city, making it the most logical choice for financing. The city government may have sought the grant to design and construct the fountain as part of a larger urban redevelopment initiative, aimed at attracting businesses, tourists, and residents to the area. Second, a city may have received the grant as part of a regional or national initiative to support local governments in their efforts to improve the quality of life for their citizens. Such grants can be allocated for a variety of purposes, including the construction and maintenance of public amenities like parks, fountains, and other attractions. By investing in an impressive and visually appealing centerpiece, the city can create a landmark that enhances its overall image and encourages people to visit or take pride in their community. Third, city governments often have a vested interest in the promotion of local arts and culture. A fountain can be an opportunity to accomplish this goal, not only through its aesthetic appeal but also by incorporating elements of cultural and historical significance. The fountain could be designed by a local artist or showcase symbols or themes that are unique to the local area, reinforcing a sense of identity and heritage. By securing a grant to finance the project, the city can support the local arts scene and ensure that an important community asset is protected. In comparison to the other options mentioned, the \\"state\\" would be less likely to fund a focal fountain in a city center, as state government typically focuses on larger projects that span across multiple cities or municipalities within its jurisdiction. The \\"front of the casino\\" implies that the casino would be the primary benefactor of the fountain, and therefore is not a grant source. Rome is irrelevant in this context, as it is a specific location that likely has no direct involvement with the municipal grant in question. Lastly, \\"public place\\" is not a funding source, but rather a location where the fountain would be installed. In conclusion, given the reasons explained above, the grant for the big fountain as the centerpiece of the renovation most likely came from the city. This financial support would allow for the creation of an attractive and engaging public space, fostering community pride and contributing to the overall appeal of the area."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options are: A. negative; B. positive;","output":"Based on the preceding movie review containing the word \\"flop,\\" I would choose option A. negative as the movie has been seen negatively. The word \\"flop\\" is often used to describe movies that have failed to meet the expectations of audiences and critics alike. It usually implies that a film, despite having a significant budget or star power, has failed to captivate the target audience or to generate positive reviews and good box office performance. In the context of a movie review, it suggests that the reviewer felt the film did not live up to the hype or simply wasn't engaging, entertaining, or well-executed overall. Negative reviews are important for both movie-goers and filmmakers. For audiences, a negative review can help them determine whether a movie is worth investing their time and money in watching. It can provide insights into the weaknesses of a film and guide them in their decision-making process, ultimately allowing them to find movies better suited to their personal preferences. On the other hand, negative reviews can also serve as constructive criticism for filmmakers, directors, and producers. A comprehensive and detailed review outlining the perceived flaws in a movie can help the filmmakers identify shortcomings and learn from the mistakes made during the production of that particular movie. This feedback is invaluable, as it can guide them in honing their craft and making better films in the future. In conclusion, a movie review containing the word \\"flop\\" signals a negative perception of the film, and this should be taken into account when considering whether to watch the movie or not.

What is the final step of the following process: -  Solution caves are formed in limestone and similar rocks by the action of water - After a rain, water seeps into cracks and pores of soil and rock - The water percolates beneath the land surface - Some of the water reaches a zone where all the cracks and pores in the rock are already filled with water - Rainwater absorbs some carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere and even more as it drains through soil and decaying vegetation - The water combines chemically with the carbon dioxide - A weak carbonic acid solution is formed A:","output":"The final step of the process is the dissolution of the limestone rock, leading to the formation of caves and karst landscapes. As the weak carbonic acid solution forms, it continues to seep through the soil and into the cracks and pores of the limestone rock within the saturated zone. Limestone is a carbonate rock, primarily made up of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate, CaCO3). The carbonic acid in the water reacts with the calcium carbonate, resulting in a chemical weathering process called dissolution. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows: H2O + CO2 (carbonic acid in solution) --> H2CO3 (carbonic acid) H2CO3 + CaCO3 (calcite in limestone) --> Ca2+ + 2HCO3- (calcium and bicarbonate ions in solution) The calcium and bicarbonate ions are now in the water, and the limestone rock is gradually dissolved at points where the weak carbonic acid solution comes into contact with it. This dissolution creates small channels and openings within the limestone, and as more water flows through these paths, the process continually enlarges the cracks and pores. Over time, the dissolution process leads to the formation of underground cavities and passages, eventually creating an interconnected network within the limestone bedrock. These solution caves and passages can grow larger as the dissolution process persists, sometimes resulting in the development of extensive cave systems and remarkable karst landscapes above the ground. The final step of this process is the creation of the solution caves and karst features, which can host a wide range of unique geological formations such as stalactites, stalagmites, and flowstones as mineral-rich water drips and flows through the caves. This process can also result in the formation of sinkholes and the collapse of cave roofs, which contribute to the dynamic nature of karst landscapes. These unique features and structures not only create habitats for various species but also serve as valuable sources for scientists to study Earth's history and geological processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This process is called a \\"streak test\\" and can help identify and characterize minerals based on the color and texture of the streak left. A streak plate is generally made of unglazed porcelain and is used in the field of mineralogy as a diagnostic tool in the identification of rock-forming minerals. Now, let's consider the scenario where a piece of talc is rolled over a black chalkboard. Talc is a common silicate mineral that has a characteristically soft, greasy feel and can usually be scratched by a fingernail. It is composed of hydrated magnesium silicate and has a monoclinic crystal structure. Talc is commonly used in many industries, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and ceramics.  As the talc is rolled over the black chalkboard, the friction and mechanical pressure cause small particles of the mineral to break away and form a fine powder, similar to the process in a streak test. The color and texture of this powder can provide helpful information for identifying the talc. Generally, talc has a white or pale greenish streak, which would be easily visible against the black background of the chalkboard. As the talc moves across the chalkboard, the friction may cause it to heat up slightly, further breaking down the mineral into a fine powder. The soft and smooth consistency of talc makes it suitable for drawing on a chalkboard since it adheres well to the surface and can subsequently be wiped away effortlessly. In addition to producing a visible streak, the movement of talc over a chalkboard may also generate a characteristic sound. The soft, low-density nature of talc causes it to produce a faint, squeaky noise as it moves across the board. This sound – along with the streak it creates – helps to provide another clue of its composition and identity. In summary, when a piece of talc is rolled over a black chalkboard, the resulting phenomenon includes a visible colored streak, the formation of a fine powder, and a distinct sound. The streak test, color, texture, and other properties exhibited by talc during this process help to confirm and characterize the mineral, making it an essential practice in the study of mineralogy for identification purposes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: DAPCHI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Islamist militants freed scores of kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls on Wednesday, driving them back into the town where they had been captured a month ago.      The captors gave no reason for their release, which triggered celebrations and tears, but the government denied that a ransom had been paid. Several of the girls said some of their friends had died in captivity and one was still being held.      The fighters from the Boko Haram group, some shouting “God is greatest”, drove the girls back into the northeast town of Dapchi in a line of trucks in the morning and dropped them off before leaving, witnesses told Reuters. Some residents fled as the convoy rolled in.      “I don’t know why they brought us back but they said because we are children of Muslims,” one of the freed girls, Khadija Grema, told Reuters.      After the release, in the nearby village of Jumbam, some of the girls held each other and wept, huddling on the ground in beige hijabs as residents stood around them.      Aliyu Maina, reunited with his 13-year-old daughter, said the fighters “stopped and blocked the road, they didn’t talk to anybody, they didn’t greet anybody”.      “They said people should make space for people to recognize their children and I got my child.”      Boko Haram has waged a insurgency for nine years in northeast Nigeria and neighboring states in which tens of thousands of people have been killed, more than 2 million displaced and thousands abducted.      A 2015 military campaign drove the group from most territory it controlled, but much of the area remains beyond government rule, and insurgents still stage attacks from strongholds near Lake Chad.      The kidnapping of 110 girls aged 11-19 on Feb. 19 from Dapchi was the biggest mass abduction since Boko Haram took more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in 2014 - a case that triggered international outrage.      Dapchi residents said more than 100 girls had returned on Wednesday. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Nigerian government was transporting the girls by bus to Maiduguri, one of the largest cities in the northeast and the hub for the fight against Boko Haram.      “One girl is still with them because she is a Christian,” said Grema, the freed student. “About five are dead but it was not as if they killed them - it was because of the stress and trauma that made them tired and weak.”      “They didn’t harm us,” Grema added. “They were giving us food, very good food. We didn’t have any problem.”      She described how, after the kidnapping, the girls were transported by car and canoe, moving through villages and along waterways to a safehouse.      Some of the newly-released Dapchi schoolgirls board a plane in Maiduguri, Nigeria March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde      Another girl who gave her name as Fatima said two of her friends were among those who died, trampled as they were being transported.      “They kept us in a big, covered house where no one could spot where we were, even by air we could not be seen,” said Fatima.      Muhammad Bursari said his niece Hadiza Muhammed, another of the freed girls, told him the remaining student was still in captivity because she had refused to convert to Islam.      NO RANSOM      Nigeria’s information minister, Lai Mohammed, said in a statement 101 released girls had been registered so far.      “No ransom was paid to them to effect this release,” he told Reuters separately. The only condition they gave us is not to release (the girls) to the military but release them in the town of Dapchi without the military presence.”      Nigeria had secured the release “through back-channel efforts and with the help of some friends of the country,” Mohammed said in the statement.      “For the release to work, the government had a clear understanding that violence and confrontation would not be the way out as it could endanger the lives of the girls, hence a non-violent approach was the preferred option,” it said.      Boko Haram never explained why the girls were taken, but many Nigerians speculated that the goal was ransom. Boko Haram received millions of euros for the release of some of the Chibok girls last year.      The abduction piled pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari, who came to power in 2015 promising to crack down on the insurgency. He is expected to seek re-election next year.      Mohammed Dala said he had found his 12-year-old daughter in a crowd of the girls in the center of town.      “Some motors painted in military color came with our girls,” he told Reuters. “They (the militants) ... said we should not flee. They dropped the girls at the center of town, near Ali’s tea shop. I found my daughter and left.”      Slideshow (11 Images)      Most of the other girls were taken to a hospital guarded by the military, witnesses said. ||||| FILE - This image taken from video on Thursday Feb. 22, 2018 shows the exterior of Government Girls Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Nigeria.

Nigeria's security forces failed to respond to several... (Associated Press)      LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — Boko Haram extremists returned most of the 110 girls abducted from their Nigeria boarding school a month ago with an ominous warning, witnesses said Wednesday.      The fighters rolled into Dapchi around 2 a.m. in nine vehicles and the girls were left in the center of town. As terrified residents emerged from their homes, the extremists said \\"this is a warning to you all,\\" resident Ba'ana Musa told The Associated Press.      \\"We did it out of pity. And don't ever put your daughters in school again,\\" the extremists said. Boko Haram means \\"Western education is forbidden\\" in the Hausa language.      Nigeria's information minister said 76 of the 110 schoolgirls had been confirmed freed and indicated that the number would rise as the release was \\"ongoing.\\"      \\"No ransoms were paid,\\" the minister, Lai Mohammed, said in a statement. The girls were released \\"through back-channel efforts and with the help of some friends of the country, and it was unconditional.\\"      Family members were en route to the town Wednesday morning.      \\"When I get there we will do a head count to see if all of them have been released,\\" said Bashir Manzo, whose 16-year-old daughter was among those kidnapped during the Feb. 19 attack.      Manzo confirmed that his daughter was among those freed.      \\"As I speak to you there is jubilation in Dapchi,\\" he said.      The mass abduction and the government response brought back painful memories of the 2014 attack on a boarding school in Chibok. Boko Haram militants abducted 276 girls, and about 100 of them have never returned. Some girls were forced to marry their captors, and many had children fathered by the militants.      Residents in Dapchi fled on Wednesday morning upon hearing that Boko Haram vehicles were headed toward the town.      \\"We fled but, from our hiding, we could see them and surprisingly, we saw our girls getting out of the vehicles,\\" Umar Hassan told the AP.      \\"They assembled the girls and talked to them for some few minutes and left without any confrontation,\\" said another resident, Kachallah Musa.      Their release came a day after an Amnesty International report accused the Nigerian military of failing to heed several warnings of the imminent attack last month. The military has called the report an \\"outright falsehood.\\"      Nigeria's government celebrated the girls' release. \\"GREAT NEWS from Dapchi, Yobe State. Thank God for the safe return of our sisters.

The protons are said to be \\"shielded\\" from the applied magnetic field by the electrons in the water molecule, the same effect that gives rise to chemical shift in NMR spectroscopy, and this is indicated by a prime on the symbol for the gyromagnetic ratio, γ′p. The gyromagnetic ratio is related to the shielded proton magnetic moment μ′p, the spin number I (I = 1⁄2 for protons) and the reduced Planck constant. What is the answer to this question: The gyromagnetic ratio is the constant proportion between the magentic field and what?","output":"The gyromagnetic ratio is the constant of proportionality between the magnetic field (B) and the frequency (ν) of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) for electrons. In simple terms, it establishes a direct relationship between the magnetic field applied to a system and the frequency at which nuclear or electron spins resonate. Mathematically, it can be represented by the equation: ν = γB Here, ν is the frequency of either NMR or EPR, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the applied magnetic field. The gyromagnetic ratio, thus, connects the magnetic field with the resonance frequency, which is an essential aspect of understanding and interpreting NMR and EPR spectroscopy experiments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The first reinforcement to the Teutonic forces arrived in early 1261, but was wiped out on January 21, 1261 by Herkus Monte in the Battle of Pokarwis. In January 1262 reinforcements arrived from the Rhineland, led by Wilhelm VII, Duke of Jülich, who was obliged by Pope Alexander IV to fulfil his crusader duties in Prussia. This army broke the Siege of Königsberg but as soon as the army returned home, the Sambians resumed the siege and were reinforced by Herkus Monte and his Natangians. Herkus was later injured and the Natangians retreated, leaving the Sambians unable to stop supplies reaching the castle and the siege eventually failed. Prussians were more successful capturing castles deeper into the Prussian territory , and the Knights were left only with strongholds in Balga, Elbing, Culm, Thorn, and Königsberg. Most castles fell in 1262-1263, and Bartenstein fell in 1264. The Prussians destroyed captured forts instead of using them for their own defence, so the end of successful sieges meant that large Prussian forces did not have to stay near their home and were then free to operate in other parts of Prussia, raiding the Culmerland and Kuyavia. A recovered Herkus Monte raided Culmerland with a large force and took many prisoners in 1263. On his way back to Natangia, Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their enemies. In the Battle of Löbau that ensued, Prussians killed forty knights, including the Master and the Marshal. The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians. In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia, killing Duke Siemowit I, and raided Culmerland, provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising. However, assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns. Skalmantas, leader of Sudovians, raided Culm  in 1263 and in 1265. Answer this question: Which happened first, the Battle of Lobau or the sacking of Bartenstein?","output":"Imagine a big game of knights and castles. The Teutonic Knights were like a team trying to build and control castles in a land called Prussia, where people called Prussians lived. The Prussians didn't like this, so they fought against the knights. One day, a group of helpers called reinforcements came to help the Teutonic Knights, but a brave Prussian warrior named Herkus Monte defeated them in a battle called the Battle of Pokarwis. Later, more helpers came from a faraway place called the Rhineland, and they were led by a man named Wilhelm VII. These helpers stopped a big fight called the Siege of Königsberg, but when they went back home, the Prussians started fighting again. There were many battles and castle sieges during this time, and the Prussians captured a lot of castles. First, many castles were captured in the years 1262 and 1263. Then, after those battles, a castle called Bartenstein was captured in 1264. After that, Herkus Monte, who was feeling better after being injured, led a big attack and captured many prisoners in 1263. But on his way back, he had another big battle called the Battle of Löbau, where they defeated more knights. So, to answer your question, the Battle of Löbau happened first, then the sacking of Bartenstein."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Meanwhile, in 1274, the former Dali Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of Yunnan, with Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar as governor. In May 1275, the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned; that the Burmese evidently had no intention of submitting; and that war was the only way forward. But the emperor rejected an outright invasion. Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275-76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276. By 1277, at least one Burmese vassal state named \\"Gold Teeth\\"  had submitted to the Mongols. Like in 1272, the Burmese government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state; but unlike in 1272, the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there. Though it was ultimately under Mongol command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were Turkic-speaking peoples or people from the further west: Turks from Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv and Nishapur, but also captive soldiers from the Persian Khwarazmid empire, the Kipchaks, and even Bulgars from the lower Volga.

It might take around 4 to 16 weeks for your eyebrows to grow back fully. Just like the hair on your head, eyebrow hair has a cycle, and it takes some time for it to grow back. Question 2: I have two options to answer this question, so let me explain them to you: 1) No - Sometimes, your eyebrows might not grow back exactly the same as they were before. This can happen if you've plucked or trimmed them too many times, or if there's some problem with the skin under your eyebrows. 2) Yes - If you take good care of your eyebrows and the skin around them, there's a good chance that your eyebrow roots can grow back healthy and the same as they were before. Would the answers be the same for both questions? Not really, because the first question is about the time it takes for eyebrows to grow back, and the second question is about whether they'll grow back healthy and the same as before.

The answer to this question is:","output":"energy. Coral reefs provide a multitude of benefits to ocean organisms, making them essential components of marine ecosystems. One of their most vital contributions is the provision of energy, in the form of food, to various marine species. Coral reefs are incredibly diverse and productive ecosystems that support diverse communities of plants, algae, and animals. This productivity and abundance of life result in the plentiful availability of food that supports a vast number of organisms. In addition to being important food sources themselves, coral reefs also act as feeding grounds for a broad range of marine animals, including fish, invertebrates, sea turtles, and marine mammals. Many of these organisms visit the reefs specifically to search for food, taking advantage of the diverse prey items available. Consequently, these predators can find and consume the energy they need to survive, grow, and reproduce. Furthermore, coral reefs provide habitat and shelter for an extraordinary number of marine species. The reefs' complex structure creates a myriad of nooks and crannies that create spaces for smaller organisms to hide from predators, breed, and raise their young. In turn, these smaller species contribute to the overall energy resources of the reef ecosystem, offering food for larger marine life -- a prime example of how interconnected and resourceful these ecosystems are. For these reasons, energy is the best answer among the given choices, as it encompasses the essential role that coral reefs play in providing sustenance and nourishment to countless marine species. While factors such as light and oxygen play a crucial role in the overall functioning of coral reef ecosystems, the focal point of the question is directed toward the direct benefits coral reefs offer to ocean organisms, which primarily involve food and shelter, and both fundamentally contribute to the provision of energy within the marine food web."},{"instruction":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the last names of all of the people on the album City? ?  of demos that were remixed\\".

Plot title: The Poseidon Adventure Movie plot: The S.S. Poseidon, an ocean liner slated for retirement and scrapping, makes her way across the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea from New York City to Athens. Despite protests from Captain Harrison (Leslie Nielsen), who fears for the ship's safety, the representative of her new owners, Mr. Linarcos, insists that he should go at full speedâ26 or so knotsâtowards Athens to save money, preventing him from taking on additional ballast. The Reverend Frank Scott (Gene Hackman), a heretical minister believing God helps those who help themselves, delivers a sermon. Detective Lt. Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) and wife Linda (Stella Stevens), a sarcastic former prostitute, deal with her seasickness. Susan (Pamela Sue Martin) and younger brother Robin (Eric Shea) are traveling to meet their parents. Robin is interested in how the ship works and frequently visits the engine room. Retired Jewish hardware store owner Manny Rosen (Jack Albertson) and wife Belle (Shelley Winters) are going to Israel to meet their two-year-old grandson for the first time. Haberdasher James Martin (Red Buttons) is a love-shy, health-conscious bachelor. The ship's singer, Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley), rehearses for the New Year's Day celebration with her band. That evening, passengers gather in the dining room to celebrate. Harrison is called to the bridge in response to a report of an undersea earthquake. He receives word from the lookout that a huge wave is approaching from the direction of Crete, at 60Â mph. He issues a mayday distress signal and commands a \\"hard left\\" turn, but it is too late. The wave hits the ship and she capsizes. In the dining room, survivors take stock of their predicament. Acres (Roddy McDowell), an injured waiter, is trapped at the galley door now high above. Scott surmises that the escape route will be found \\"upwards\\", at the outer hull, now above water. Robin tells him the hull near the propeller shaft is only one inch (2.54Â cm) thick.

This implies flexibility and adaptability in creating different recipes or meal variations. Sentence 2 proposes converting a casserole, generally cooked in an oven, into a stovetop recipe, where cooking would take place on the stovetop rather than in an oven. While both sentences discuss the idea of altering recipes and applying adaptability in cooking, it is not possible to tell with certainty whether the premise of Sentence 1 being true would automatically make Sentence 2 true as well. Although Sentence 1 speaks to the general idea of modifying recipes, it does not explicitly mention or provide information about converting one specific type of dish, like a casserole, to another specific method of cooking, such as stovetop cooking. The context of Sentence 1 is not sufficient to conclude that Sentence 2 must be true. Ultimately, there are many factors to consider in determining whether it is possible to convert a casserole into a stovetop recipe. This may include the chosen ingredients, cooking methods, cooking time, and whether the recipe can maintain its desired characteristics once transformed.

The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

Seeing her shabby appearance, the pastor guessed the reason, and, taking her by the hand, took her inside and found a place for her in the Sunday School class. The child was so touched that she went to bed that night thinking of the children who have no place to worship Jesus. Some years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor buildings and the parents called for the kindhearted pastor, who had befriended their daughter, to handle the final arrangements. As her poor little body was being moved, a worn purse was found which seemed to have been picked up from some trash dump. Inside was found 57 cents and a note scribbled in childish handwriting which read, \\"This is to help build the little church bigger so more children can go to Sunday School.\\" For two years she had saved for this offering of love. When the pastor tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he would do. Carrying this note, he told people the story of her unselfish love and devotion. A newspaper learned of the story and published it. It was read by a Realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the church could not pay so much, he offered it for 57 cents. Church members made large donations. Checks came from far and wide. Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to 250,000, a huge sum for that time. When you are in the city of Philadelphia, look up Temple Baptist Church, with a seating capacity of 3,300 and Temple University, where hundreds of students are trained. Have a look, too, at the Good Samaritan Hospital and at a Sunday School building which houses hundreds of Sunday scholars, so that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside during Sunday school time.

Should I validate this answer? Available choices: (a). No (b). Yes The answer is:","output":"(a). No While the suggested answer provides information on the various healthcare programs in the United States, it does not specifically answer the question of how much the country spends on health care. To give you a clearer understanding, I will provide more accurate and relevant information. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the United States spent 3.8 trillion on health care in 2019. This amount accounts for approximately 17.7% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The spending on health care can further be broken down into different categories: 1. Private health insurance spending accounted for 31% (about 1.2 trillion) of the total health care expenditures. 2. Medicare, a federally funded program that primarily provides health coverage to individuals aged 65 or older, accounted for 21% (about 800 billion) in 2019. 3. Medicaid, a joint federal and state-funded program that offers health coverage for low-income individuals and families, constituted 16% (about 613 billion) of the spending. 4.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Note that professional-grade, commercially available eye washes are always preferable to homemade remedies. No matter how meticulous you are, there's always the risk of accidentally irritating the eyes or giving yourself a potentially severe infection. There are reported cases of people trying to make saline solution at home and getting acanthamoeba infections. This is a risky procedure. However, if you understand the risks and still want to make your own eye wash solution, there are measures you can take to ensure that your solution is as clean and safe as possible. Begin by boiling a pot of water to kill bacteria and other organisms in it that can contaminate your eyes. Bring the water to a full rolling boil for at least one minute and then cool before use.  If possible, it's better to use sterile, purified water rather than ordinary tap water. Tap water can contain more bacteria and additives than sterile water. If you don't want to make an eye wash solution, you can always substitute tap water. Just understand that it may be more irritating and it carries a higher risk of containing bacteria, etc. For homemade eye washes, add one teaspoon of ordinary table salt for each cup of water while the water is boiling. The closer your solution is to the natural salinity (salt concentration) of your tears, the lesser the shock to your eyes. Though the salinity of tears varies based on whether the tears are produced as the result of emotions (pain, sadness, etc.) or merely as a lubricant for the eye during normal use, tears are usually less than 1% salt by weight. Ensure the salt that you add dissolves in the water. Since the water is boiling and you've added a relatively small amount of salt, it shouldn't take much stirring to dissolve it completely. Stir until you no longer see solid salt grains at the bottom of the pot. Never use an eyewash that's still hot. You can seriously injure or even blind yourself by burning your eyes with hot water. Remove your solution from heat and allow it to cool to room temperature. You may transfer the solution to a different container, provided the container has been carefully washed and rinsed with soap and sterile water. When the solution reaches room temperature (or lower) it's ready for use.  Cover the solution while it's cooling to ensure no new contaminants are introduced. Keeping the solution cool can give it a refreshing effect when it's used on your eyes. However, don’t cool the eyewash below 60°F (15.6°C). It can be painful and even slightly damaging to your eyes. Even if you take extra care to keep your solution clean, be sure to throw it out after a day or two. Bacteria can be re-introduced to a solution after it's been boiled.","output":"This article explains how to make your own eye wash solution using boiled water and salt, but reminds you that it's safer to use professional-grade eye washes, as homemade ones can have more risks like infections or irritation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even if you want to..I am anonymous for the same reason. So this happened when I was 16 year old. I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly… before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Please answer the following question: What is the question to: \\"The MBTI focuses on normal populations and emphasizes the value of naturally occurring differences.\\"? The topic is Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. Answer:","output":"The question to the statement \\"The MBTI focuses on normal populations and emphasizes the value of naturally occurring differences\\" would be: \\"How does the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) approach assessing personality types, and what importance does it place on the natural variations that exist within normal populations?\\"  To provide a detailed answer, it is important to first understand the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The MBTI is a widely-used self-report questionnaire designed to assess an individual's personality type by measuring their preferences across four dimensions: extraversion-introversion, sensing-intuition, thinking-feeling, and judging-perceiving. It was developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine Briggs, based on the theories of Carl Jung. The results of the assessment categorize an individual into one of the 16 possible personality types, each represented by a four-letter code (e.g., INFP, ESTJ, etc.). The MBTI's focus on normal populations means that it is not intended to identify or diagnose psychological disorders, but rather to provide insight into an individual's personality preferences within naturally occurring differences across the general population. This emphasis is a significant departure from many other psychological measures, which often focus on identifying abnormal or problematic behavior in clinical populations.  By valuing the natural variations that exist within normal populations, the MBTI seeks to promote a greater understanding and appreciation for the unique strengths and challenges associated with each of the different personality types. This understanding can be applied in various settings such as personal growth and self-awareness, career counseling, team building and conflict resolution. The central premise of the MBTI is that no one personality type is inherently superior or inferior to another – each has its own mix of strengths and areas for potential growth. Some of the benefits of recognizing the natural differences among personality types using the MBTI include, but are not limited to:  1. Enhanced self-awareness: Understanding one's own personality type and preferences can lead to a greater appreciation for their own strengths and recognition of areas in which they may seek personal growth and development. 2. Improved relationships: By appreciating the natural differences in personality types, individuals can develop a better understanding and empathy for the perspectives of others, leading to improved communication and reduced conflict within relationships. 3. Team-building and effective communication: In professional settings, recognizing the various strengths and working styles associated with different personality types can contribute to the formation of more effective teams and assist individuals in collaborating and communicating more effectively. 4. Career guidance: Understanding individual strengths and preferences can help individuals identify career paths that align with their unique personality type, leading to greater job satisfaction and success. 5. Personal growth and development: By focusing on the valuable aspects of natural personality differences, individuals can pursue personal growth and development tailored to their unique characteristics and strengths. In conclusion, the question to the statement \\"The MBTI focuses on normal populations and emphasizes the value of naturally occurring differences\\" highlights the understanding of how the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator assesses personality types within normal populations, and the importance it places on recognizing and appreciating the natural variations that exist among individuals. The MBTI encourages a greater understanding and appreciation for the strengths and potential growth areas within each personality type, promoting overall self-awareness, improved relationships, team-building, effective communication, career guidance, and personal growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(May 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2001, William Hundert, a retired Classics teacher, is flown out to a luxurious resort in the Hamptons owned by one of his former students in order to be the guest of honor in an impromptu reunion. As he gets settled in he reflects on the turn of events in a flashback of his time working at Saint Benedict's Academy, a prestigious preparatory school. Twenty-eight years earlier, a younger Mr. Hundert is enthusiastic about the start of the school year. His class turns out to be a strict yet inspiring lesson for the freshmen. They include laid-back Louis Masoudi, introverted Martin Blythe, and studious Deepak Mehta. Hundert inspires his students to study hard in order to become one of the three contestants for The Emperor's Club and be crowned \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\", an academic competition between top three students of his class regarding the Classics. When the headmaster explains the contest to the students, he mentions that Blythe's father was once a \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\". Hundert's orderly world is shaken when a new student, Sedgewick Bell, walks into his classroom late. Bell is the cocky son of a senior U.S. senator who possesses none of Hundert's principles. After Sedgewick plays the class clown, Hundert asks him to name a single Roman Emperor. When Bell cannot, Hundert has the other students perfectly recite the line of succession of the Roman Empire. Hundert also makes a trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with Senator Bell. Bell's father is uninterested in his son's character development, telling Hundert just to teach Bell so he can graduate. In a phone call, Senator Bell chastises Sedgewick for wasting his fatherâs time and money. After seeing him chastened, Hundert tries to become a mentor to Bell in order to make him a better man.

On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, West Wind (1928–29), was one of the eight reliefs of the 'four winds' high on the walls of London Underground's headquarters at 55 Broadway. The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including Eric Gill with the ground-level pieces provided by Epstein.  1928 saw Moore's first solo exhibition, held at the Warren Gallery in London.  In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in Kiev in 1907 to Ukrainian–Polish parents. Her father did not return from the Russian Revolution and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in Buckinghamshire. Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in Hampstead at 11a Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of avant-garde artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband Ben Nicholson moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while Naum Gabo, Roland Penrose, Cecil Stephenson and the art critic Herbert Read also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as \\"a nest of gentle artists\\"). This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore.
