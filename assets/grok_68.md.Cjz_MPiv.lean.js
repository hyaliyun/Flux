Solar energy: In the last two decades, photovoltaics (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286 USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%. By 2012 available efficiencies exceed 20% and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics is over 40%.

He was a gentleman. ... He is, he has been, an excellent officer.\\"  Authorities, citing death threats, had until Friday refused to release Wilson's name after he fatally shot Michael Brown.  A resident of the St. Louis area, Wilson, 28, has been staying at a secure location since the shooting.  It was not known whether Wilson -- an officer for six years, including four in Ferguson -- had been placed on modified assignment. Jackson told reporters the officer had faced no disciplinary action during his time on the job.  Wilson lives in a neighborhood of modest homes about 20 miles from Ferguson. Neighbors, who seemed angry and worried about the sudden attention on their quiet community, were reluctant to talk about Wilson. Several said the officer left his home days ago.  Brown was African-American; Wilson is white.  One of Wilson's friends, Jake Shepard, said he couldn't imagine the officer killing somebody.  \\"I can say -- without speaking to Darren, without even having heard his statements -- that, at that moment in time, he was scared for his life,\\" Shepard said.  \\"I am 100% positive of that because I could never imagine him even in that situation -- taking someone's life, let alone taking someone's life with malicious intent.

Zack on the other hand, had a higher metabolic rate, a faster metabolism, and he would eat the correct amount of calories.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which brother had a lower chance of becoming obese? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Zack has a lower chance of becoming obese compared to his brother Vick. There are several reasons that contribute to this conclusion: 1. Different Diets: Zack's diet consists of consuming the correct amount of calories, which implies that he is likely paying attention to the nutritional content and quality of his food. This type of diet, well balanced in nutrients and portion-controlled, makes it easier for an individual to maintain a healthy weight. On the contrary, Vick's diet is high in fat and he frequently overeats, leading to a higher calorie intake. A diet that is high in fat and excessive calories increases the risk of weight gain and obesity. 2. Metabolic Rate: Zack has a higher metabolic rate, which means that his body is capable of converting food into energy more efficiently. A faster metabolism typically requires more calories to function and burns those calories more quickly, leaving fewer calories to be stored in the body as fat. This, in turn, decreases Zack's likelihood of becoming obese compared to his brother with a slower metabolism. 3. Behavior and Lifestyle: While the paragraph does not delve into the brothers' physical activities, good dietary habits like those exhibited by Zack often go hand-in-hand with regular exercise and maintaining an active lifestyle. These factors contribute to a lower risk of obesity as well. In conclusion, Zack's healthier diet, faster metabolism, and likely better lifestyle habits all contribute to a lower chance of him becoming obese compared to his brother Vick, who has a diet high in fat and a tendency to overeat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For Lil, the scene she had sketched was like a vivid, almost tangible expression of her unspoken emotions, fears, and desires. She hadn't planned to create this piece. Still, it seemed as if every stroke, line, and color was demanding to be recognized and understood as she felt its energy coursing through her. It was like her subconscious had taken over, forcing her to confront these feelings she had been avoiding for quite some time. Jake's comment about not taking an office job appeared, at first, to be casual and lighthearted. However, Lil wondered if there was a deeper meaning intertwined with his words. In her mind, an office job represented a symbol of security, predictability, and order. For some, these attributes would provide comfort and stability, while for others, such as Lil, it conjured a foreboding sense of suffocation and restraint. Lil couldn't help but feel touched when Jake reassured her that she was already the mother Colby needed. Her mind ached as it grappled between the vulnerability of motherhood and her desperate longing to maintain her sense of self. This tumultuous storm of emotions manifested in her art, where she sought solace and understanding through the convergence of line and color. As she glanced back and forth between Colby and Jake, she realized that she felt seen in a way she hadn't in a long time. Jake seemed to not only recognize her struggle but also empathize with it to some extent. Perhaps he had experienced a similar tug of war between the competing aspects of life. As the silence enveloped them, Lil found herself experiencing a blend of gratitude and unease. She was grateful that Jake had opened up this door for an honest conversation about her struggles and the expectations society tends to place on mothers. Simultaneously, she couldn't help but feel a bit exposed, making her guarded and anxious about where this discussion could lead. With a subtle, deep breath, she decided to dig a little deeper, searching for the connection between her emotional turbulence and the scene she had sketched. As she carefully looked at each detail, she realized that what she feared the most was not losing herself in the process of motherhood, but rather, losing the part of herself that nurtured her creativity and artistic spirit. With this realization, Lil was able to engage in a meaningful dialogue with Jake about the challenges she was facing. She found solace in their conversation and a renewed sense of purpose for her art. After all, it was through the process of creating and exploring her emotions that she could not only find herself again but also nurture and preserve that essential aspect of her identity. In the end, Jake's words served as a compass for Lil, allowing her to navigate the complex terrain of motherhood and artistic expression. They bonded over their shared understanding while also providing each other with the support and encouragement necessary to continue pursuing their passions. And, as they spoke, Colby gleefully continued to lick the green paint off his finger, reminding them both that sometimes, life's greatest joys stem from the simplest, most unexpected moments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas?, using the article: Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet (French: [ʒyl emil fʁedeʁik masnɛ]; 12 May 1842 – 13 August 1912) was a French composer of the Romantic era best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty. The two most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music. While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Pierné. By the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"The answer is: Massenet Step 1: Understand the question The question asks for the last name of the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas. Step 2: Find relevant information in the article In the article, it says \\"While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"1. Can a government force people to reproduce? Imagine a country is like a big family, and the government is like the parents in that family. In a kind and caring family, parents don't force their children to do things against their wishes. Similarly, a good government cannot force people to have babies if they don't want to. It's important to respect everyone's own choices about their lives. 2. Why is one minus cosine similarity equal to cosine distance? Let's imagine two toy cars facing each other. The angle between them tells us how different their directions are. Cosine similarity is like a way to measure how similar or different the \\"directions\\" of two things are, in this case, the toy cars. The less the angle, the more similar they are.  Now, think of the distance between two points. Distance measures how far apart two things are. Cosine distance is a way to measure how different the \\"directions\\" are, just like cosine similarity. But, it tells us in a different way - in terms of distance instead of angle. So, when we subtract the cosine similarity from 1, we flip the way we measure the difference, and we get the cosine distance. This means, if two things are very similar, the distance will be small, and if they are not so similar, the distance will be big. 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? No, these questions are different. The first question is about whether a government can control people's choices related to having babies. The second question is about math and understanding the relationship between cosine similarity and cosine distance.

His World War II-era sequence \\"The World\\" is a collection of twenty \\"naïve\\" poems. Following the war, he served as Polish cultural attaché in Paris and Washington, D.C., then in 1951 defected to the West. His nonfiction book \\"The Captive Mind\\" (1953) became a classic of anti-Stalinism. From 1961 to 1998 he was a professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of California, Berkeley. He became a U.S. citizen in 1970. In 1978 he was awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, and in 1980 the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 1999 he was named a Puterbaugh Fellow. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, he divided his time between Berkeley, California, and Kraków, Poland.  - Jerzy Kawalerowicz (19 January 1922  27 December 2007) was a Polish film director and politician, having been a member of Polish United Workers' Party from 1954 until its dissolution in 1990 and a deputy in Polish parliament since 1985 until 1989.  - Jarosaw Iwaszkiewicz, also known under his literary pseudonym Eleuter (20 February 1894  2 March 1980), was a Polish poet, essayist, dramatist and writer. He is mostly recognized for his literary achievements in poetry before World War II, but also criticized as a long-term political opportunist in communist Poland, actively participating in the slander of Czesaw Miosz and other expatriates. He was removed from school textbooks soon after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc.  - The Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP PZPR) was the Communist party which governed the People's Republic of Poland from 1948 to 1989. Ideologically it was based on the theories of Marxism-Leninism.  - Mother Joan of the Angels ( Polish : Matka Joanna od Anioów , also known as The Devil and the Nun ) is a 1961 drama film on demonic possession , directed by Jerzy Kawalerowicz , based on a novella of the same title by Jarosaw Iwaszkiewicz .

Founded in 1946, the invitation-only festival is held annually (usually in May) at the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès.  - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.  - The 14th Cannes Film Festival was held on 3-18 May 1961. The Palme d'Or went to the \\"Une aussi longue absence\\", directed by Henri Colpi and \\"Viridiana\\", directed by Luis Buñuel.

It was released on July 27, 1973, by Mercury Records. In the years leading up to the album, the New York Dolls had developed a local fanbase by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, most music producers and record companies were reluctant to work with them because of their vulgarity and onstage fashion; the group later appeared in exaggerated drag on the album cover for shock value. After signing a contract with Mercury, the New York Dolls recorded their first album at The Record Plant in New York City with producer Todd Rundgren, who was known for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded live. Their music on the album incorporated carefree rock and roll, Brill Building pop influences, and campy sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explored themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity. New York Dolls was met with widespread critical acclaim but sold poorly and polarized listeners. The band proved difficult to market outside their native New York and developed a reputation for rock-star excesses while touring the United States in support of the album. Despite its commercial failure, New York Dolls was an influential precursor to the 1970s punk rock movement and has since been named in various publications as one of the best debut records in rock music and one of the greatest albums of all time.

What was the Japanese perception of the Roman Empire?","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They address different topics related to the Roman Empire.  The first question, \\"What was the status of black people in the Roman Empire?\\" focuses on the social, economic, and political status of black people within the Roman Empire. This question seeks to understand the experiences, roles, and treatment of black individuals who lived in ancient Rome. To answer this question, it is essential to recognize that the Roman Empire was an extensive and diverse political entity that spanned three continents, including Europe, Africa, and Asia. Consequently, the empire had a multicultural population with various ethnic backgrounds. Black people in the Roman Empire—mostly from regions in North Africa, Egypt, and Sudan—held various roles and statuses. Some black individuals, such as those from Ethiopia or Nubia, were slaves, but others held positions of power and prestige as soldiers, administrators, merchants, or even part of the Roman elite. Roman society was not color-blind, but an individual's social status was generally defined more by their wealth, occupation, and political connections than by their ethnic origin or skin color. The second question, \\"What was the Japanese perception of the Roman Empire?\\" examines the views and understanding of the Roman Empire by the Japanese people. As Japan was geographically far from the Roman Empire and had minimal direct contact, their knowledge of Rome would have been limited and subject to influences from Chinese and later European sources. During the majority of the Roman Empire's existence (27 BC to 476 AD), Japan was in the Yayoi period (300 BC to 300 AD) and Kofun period (300 to 538 AD). During these eras, Japan had limited contact with the rest of the world and was focused on its internal politics and the consolidation of its state. Much of Japanese knowledge of the Roman Empire would have been derived centuries later, during the Edo period (1603-1868).  During the Edo period, Japan was exposed to European ideas and learning, as Dutch traders and scholars were allowed to work and live in Nagasaki. These Dutch merchants brought books on history and science, some of which contained information about ancient Rome. As a result, the Japanese perception of the Roman Empire would have been shaped by European understanding and perspectives on Rome. Intellectuals, such as Hayashi Gahō and Arai Hakuseki, wrote about the Roman Empire, often discussing its organization, politics, and military prowess.  In summary, the two questions address separate aspects of the Roman Empire. The first question pertains to the status of black people within the empire, while the second question considers the Japanese perception of it. Both questions invite discussions about the historical context and cultural interactions between different societies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After receiving the request from Melissa to investigate, Ace goes to the stadium and takes a look inside Snowflake's tank, finding a small stone in the filter system. Roger spots a team of reporters heading to the tank and is worried (fearing the negative press that would result from knowledge of Snowflake's abduction).

Do you spit in their eye or swallow your pride ? Do you listen to the problem patiently , not interrupting , and then offer a solution ? or Do you butt in , argue the toss , and stand your ground ? Question What might happen if the writer decides to spit in the customer 's eye ? Answer:","output":"If the writer decides to spit in the customer's eye, several negative outcomes could occur. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what might happen: 1. Escalation of the situation: Spitting in someone's eye is a highly disrespectful and aggressive action. This could cause the already irate customer to become angrier and escalate the situation into a potential confrontation or argument. 2. Damage to the writer's reputation: If the incident takes place in a public setting, other customers and bystanders may observe the writer's unprofessional behavior. This could lead to negative word-of-mouth, damaging both the writer's personal reputation and that of the business they represent. 3. Loss of business: If the irate customer is a longstanding or significant customer to the writer's business, their mistreatment could result in the loss of their patronage. Furthermore, their negative experience could spread to their friends, family or social circle, causing further loss of business. 4. Potential for disciplinary action: Employers generally expect their employees to handle customer interactions professionally, even when the customer is angry or upset. Spitting in the customer's eye could lead the writer's employer to take disciplinary action against them, including possible termination. 5. Legal consequences: In some jurisdictions, spitting on someone can be considered an assault and could result in legal consequences for the writer, including fines and potential criminal charges. In conclusion, choosing to spit in the customer's eye is not a productive or professional solution to handling an irate customer. Instead, the writer should consider swallowing their pride, listening to the customer's concerns and offering a solution whenever possible without resorting to aggression."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hatfield, a radiologist, and Julie Hatfield, a former Boston Globe features, society, travel writer, and fashion critic who currently works as a freelance travel writer. Hatfield grew up in the Boston suburb of Duxbury. Although well known for the early 1990s hit, \\"My Sister\\", Hatfield has two brothers, but no sisters. Hatfield's father claimed his family were descendants of the West Virginia Hatfields of the Hatfield-McCoy feud following the Civil War. In 1995, following the success of Become What You Are she released her follow-up album, Only Everything, in which she \\"turned up the volume and the distortion and had a lot of fun\\". One reviewer describes it as \\"a fun, engaging pop album\\". The album spawned another alternative radio hit for Hatfield in \\"Universal Heartbeat\\". The video featured Hatfield as an overly demanding aerobics instructor. Prior to the tour for Only Everything, Hatfield released Phillips and brought on Jason Sutter (American Hi-Fi, Chris Cornell, Jack Drag), as well as Ed Slanker (Thudpucker, Tinsel) on 2nd guitar, and Lisa Mednick on keyboards. Two weeks into the tour, Hatfield canceled the tour, which her publicist explained as due to \\"nervous exhaustion,\\" and took a month-long break.  In her memoir, Hatfield writes that in truth she was suffering from depression severe enough to the point of being suicidal. Hatfield disagreed with the decision not to be upfront about her depression. The drummer was, once again, replaced, this time by Phillips, and touring resumed with Jeff Buckley as the opening act.  In 1996, she traveled to Woodstock, New York where she recorded tracks for God's Foot, which was to be her fourth solo album (third if not counting Become What You Are, which was recorded with the Juliana Hatfield Three), intended for 1997 release. After three failed attempts to satisfy requests from Atlantic Records to come up with a \\"single\\" that the label could release, Juliana requested she be released from her contract. The label obliged, but kept the rights to the songs produced during these sessions (Atlantic had reportedly paid 180,000 to that point on the recordings). Two tracks - \\"Mountains of Love\\" and \\"Fade Away\\" - were eventually released on a greatest hits collection entitled Gold Stars, while still another, \\"Can't Kill Myself,\\" was available for download from Hatfield's official website. The remaining tracks have surfaced only as substandard bootleg versions (which do not meet Hatfield's approval) and she has rarely featured them in her subsequent live performances.  In 1997 Hatfield toured with the first Lilith Fair, a prominent all-female rock festival founded by singer Sarah McLachlan. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: hOW LONG WAS SHE TOURING?","output":"Hatfield was touring for two weeks before she canceled the tour due to \\"nervous exhaustion.\\" However, after taking a month-long break and replacing some band members, the touring resumed with Jeff Buckley as the opening act."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Adiabatic cooling occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes a parcel of air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. As the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, water vapor normally condenses to form cloud drops. This condensation normally occurs on cloud condensation nuclei such as salt or dust particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.Frontal and cyclonic lift occur when stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure by a process called convergence. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds over a wide area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of the warm air mass just ahead of the front.

UPDATED:. 05:53 EST, 19 September 2012. Women who play away from home might want to consider the punishment meted out for similar indiscretions hundreds of years ago in Warwickshire. While adultery in this day and age might end up in the divorce courts, women guilty of such a crime during the late Middle Ages were forced to endure a very unusual form of retribution - reciting a humiliating ditty while sitting backwards on a ram, holding its tail. This is just one of many punishments that were routinely handed out in Warwickshire for activities banned in the county for more than six centuries. And many of the offences themselves would now be considered equally ridiculous. Ancient history: The manorial documents stipulating the bizarre punishments for outlawed activities have been uploaded to the internet. Ancient documents stipulating the strange laws and have been unearthed and uploaded to the internet so they can be viewed online for the first time on the National Archives' Manorial Documents Register. Historians spent six months collating the records and putting them onto an online database. They include laws against selling shoes before 1pm as well as playing tennis and bowls - 'crimes' which were punishable by a 40 pence fine. Neil Bettridge, manorial documents project officer for Warwickshire County Council, said: 'People were fined for playing bowls [in Temple Balsall] in the 1620s. An ancient map (pictured) detailing the historical boundaries of Warwickshire was also among the haul of manorial documents. Historians spent six months collating the records and putting them onto an online database. 'It was more a question of social order. People weren’t keen on [other] people getting together in large groups and necessarily enjoying themselves. 'I think it was a question of social control that they didn’t want people to be wasting their time on what they thought were frivolous things.' In 1424 tennis was banned from the streets of Atherstone, Warkwickshire, while ale house haunters who did not attend church were fined under charges issued by 17th Century courts. Women who committed adultery were also forced to sit on the back of a ram in front of everyone in the court, hold the animal’s tail and recite a ditty. A rich and fascinating history: A lot of the records are written in Latin and, because of their age, the handwriting is difficult to read. Ancient scrolls: The ancient documents include laws against selling shoes before 1pm as well as playing tennis and bowls - 'crimes' punishable by a 40 pence fine.

Another law reads: 'The churchwardens to search for ale house haunters and others that come not to church on Sunday on pain (fine) of 10s.' Mark Ryder, head of localities and community safety said: 'These records contain a rich and fascinating history about life in Warwickshire in the late middle ages. 'The database will signpost people to the relevant sources and will help to bring medieval history to everyone’s fingertips.' Sam Collenette, the county council’s archives and historic environment manager, added: 'They’re quite difficult records to use and a lot of them are in Latin. And because of the age of them the records are in difficult handwriting. 'They are the only source that will give people detailed information about medieval life in villages.'

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A 19-year-old Maryland woman who survived being shot by an ex-boyfriend has broken her silence with an emotional Facebook post just two weeks after the attack. Kristen Loetz first thanks both those who've helped her in her speedy recovery and CJ Abbott, the 19-year-old who died while protecting her from her attacker. Loetz then compassionately addresses Ryan Shallue, the angry high school flame who took his own life after forcing his way into her home near Salisbury University, shot her in the face, and murdered her heroic friend. Speaking out: Kristen Loetz (right) took to Facebook to speak for the first time since her jilted ex-boyfriend shot her in the face and murdered her friend who tried to protect her. 'Everyone needs to know how you saved my life that day,' writes the honors nursing student in her loving ode to CJ Abbott. Loetz had spent the 12 days previous recovering from wounds she incurred the night Shallue shot her and Abbott with a semi-automatic rifle before before going into a bathroom and shooting himself in the head. 'My fast recovery is greatly because of all of the love and support I have received from everyone,' Loetz writes. That support came first and foremost from Abbott, whose sister said he died a hero trying to stop Shallue from assaulting Loetz. 'I love ya ceej': Loetz thanks all her friends and family, but she gives extra thanks to the man who helped her keep her life but lost her own--CJ Abbott. 'Thanks for being my hero': Loetz wrote an emotional thanks to CJ Abbott, the 20-year-old who sacrificed himself to help save her life when ex Ryan Shallue pulled out a gun to exact his revenge. Haunting: As Shallue (left) lay dead, this photo of him with the woman he tried to kill remains on his Twitter account. 'It is so unfair that it was you and not me,' she writes. 'CJ, the most kind gentle hearted person who would jump at the chance to lend a hand to anyone.' Loetz writes of Abbott's 'fantastic family' and says 'one day I hope to meet them and tell them how amazing of a person I knew you to be.' 'I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for me,' she writes in a post dated September 15. Loetz goes on to thank the friend named Michelle 'for being so strong during this tragedy' and calling 911 after the shooting. Then Loetz writes something unexpected, a largely friendly acknowledgement of the ex-boyfriend who tried to kill her. 'You were never a bad person,' she writes of Shallue. 'I hope you have found a better place where you can find peace.' The 450 word letter closes: 'I love ya ceej, thanks for being my hero.' Police. say Ryan Shallue became increasingly disturbed after his high school. girlfriend Kristen Loetz, 19, dumped him four months ago. Shallue began stalking her and. bought a gun two weeks before the shooting. On the night of September 4, he showed up at Loetz's off-campus house, where she. discovered her with 20-year-old Charles 'CJ' Abbott. When Shallue began. fighting with Loetz, Abbott tried to intervene, police said. Shallue pulled out a semi-automatic pistol and pulled the trigger. Friends: Loetz, left, took to Facebook to thank all her friends. She especially thankful to CJ Abbott, who tried to stop the enraged Shallue when he entered Abbott's home September 4. The Salisbury Daily Times. reports that Loetz and Shallue graduated high school together in. Stevensville, Maryland, in 2010. The Facebook profiles for both Loetz. and Shallue show dozens of photos of them embracing - appearing a happy. couple at the beach and at prom. After. high school, Loetz left and attended Salisbury University, an hour and a. half away. She became a promising nursing student whom teachers called. bright and attentive. She joined a sorority on campus and worked at a. community center for special needs children and teens. Shallue stayed behind and appears to. have done little with his life. His Twitter page shows a man becoming. increasingly bitter and obsessed with alcohol. High school sweethearts: Police say Ryan Shallue, 21, left, attacked his ex-girlfriend Kristen Loetz, 19, four months after she dumped him. Loetz was critically wounded. Shallue killed himself. Police say Shallue forced his way into his ex-girlfriend's house, just off the campus of Salisbury University on Tuesday night. Police say Loetz dumped Shallue months ago and that he spiraled into obsession and anger. Shallue's. Twitter page includes tweets like 'I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare. me to drive!' and 'I found the cure and its name is vodka!' Abbott was a skilled car mechanic in Salisbury. His bosses described him as hard-working and dedicated. His sister told the Daily Times that Abbott and Loetz had been seeing a lot of each other recently. She. said her entire family - including his twin brother - are devastated by. the shocking murder, but said no one was surprised he died trying to. protect a friend. 'It’s just like CJ to be a hero,' April Abbott told the newspaper. Police say Shallue became increasingly unstable after Loetz dumped him four months ago. She had moved away from their hometown and was a promising nursing student.

It was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerfully addictive experience. My sister and I would watch it, rewind it, and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another. So, if you are an 11-year old girl, and you reviewed this film as \\"brilliant\\" or \\"fun\\" or \\"better than the original Grease,\\" you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass. If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane, artless, slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution, and/or consumption. For the sake of criticism, I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows  1. In a well-executed musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with a few debatable exceptions, to the music is obscenely pointless. Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way (\\"Score Tonight,\\" \\"Reproduction,\\" \\"Do It For Our Country,\\" and \\"Prowlin'\\") without making one concrete statement about any of the film's characters or themes. Plus, all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance. 2. The T-birds should be badass, and if not at least somewhat likable, but instead each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-bird jacket and initiates him into the gang, Michael should kick it to the ground, spit on it, and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it. But of course, he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads, there is no greater honor than to be one with the T-birds.  3. Since Michael is beautiful, smart, kind, resourceful, and above average in everyway (his musical impotence notwithstanding), it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a slovenly, slack-jawed, bubble gum smacking, dirty sweatshirt wearing, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat. So aside from being pretty (I guess), she harbors no likable characteristics, thus, audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michael's attraction to her. I could go on and on, but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I will say this though, to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake: Grease 2 is an experience akin to re-living your first kiss. Only you are 32 now and kissing a snot-nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me.

From the warm and attentive staff to the exquisite cuisine and elegant atmosphere, Blue Magnolia has undoubtedly become one of my all-time favorite dining establishments, earning a well-deserved five-star rating. Upon arrival, I was immediately impressed by the attention to detail and the elegant ambience that surrounded me. From the soft lighting to the tasteful decor and the subtle yet enchanting background music, it was evident that the owners had gone to great lengths to create a truly comforting and memorable dining environment. The attentive host welcomed us with a warm smile, promptly escorted us to our reserved table, and made sure that we were comfortable and satisfied with the seating arrangements. Our server, Samantha, was an absolute delight. Not only did she have an extensive knowledge of the menu and its offerings, but she also provided excellent recommendations based on our tastes and dietary preferences. Samantha was very attentive and professional throughout our dining experience, constantly checking in on us and ensuring that our glasses were always full. The menu at Blue Magnolia was extensive and diverse, catering to a wide range of palates. We started with the delectable crab cakes, which were generously packed with succulent crab meat that perfectly complemented the lightly seasoned breading. The accompanying house-made remoulade sauce was tangy and vibrant, providing the perfect balance to the dish. For our main course, I indulged in the pan-seared Chilean sea bass, while my dining companion opted for the tender filet mignon. Both dishes were artfully presented and cooked to perfection. The sea bass was incredibly tender and flaky, bursting with flavor and resting on a bed of delightfully creamy risotto. The filet mignon was cooked precisely to our desired temperature, offering a perfect balance of tenderness and rich, bold flavors. As if things couldn't get any better, we completed our meal with the restaurant's signature dessert, the chocolate lava cake. An indulgent warm chocolate cake with a rich, molten center was surrounded by a delectable raspberry coulis, providing an extraordinary finale to our unparalleled dining experience. To make the evening even more special, the bill was presented to us with a personalized thank-you note from the chef, further emphasizing the Blue Magnolia's commitment to customer satisfaction and attention to detail. In summary, I wholeheartedly encourage both locals and visitors alike to experience the impeccable service and top-notch cuisine that the Blue Magnolia has to offer. It's not just a restaurant – it is an experience that is guaranteed to leave a lasting impression. I can't wait to return for another exceptional meal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August.

Q: Homer uses the terms Achaeans and Danaans (Δαναοί) as a generic term for Greeks in Iliad, and they were probably a part of the Mycenean civilization. The names Achaioi and Danaoi seem to be pre-Dorian belonging to the people who were overthrown. They were forced to the region that later bore the name Achaea after the Dorian invasion. In the 5th century BC, they were redefined as contemporary speakers of Aeolic Greek which was spoken mainly in Thessaly, Boeotia and Lesbos. There are many controversial theories on the origin of the Achaeans. According to one view, the Achaeans were one of the fair-headed tribes of upper Europe, who pressed down over the Alps during the early Iron age (1300 BC) to southern Europe. Another theory suggests that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans. These theories are rejected by other scholars who, based on linguistic criteria, suggest that the Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks. There is also the theory that there was an Achaean ethnos that migrated from Asia minor to lower Thessaly prior to 2000 BC. Some Hittite texts mention a nation lying to the west called Ahhiyava or Ahhiya. Egyptian documents refer to Ekwesh, one of the groups of sea peoples who attached Egypt during the reign of Merneptah (1213-1203 BCE), who may have been Achaeans. Question: Who was Gulbahar's child?

The game is the culmination to a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. Normally, Roman numerals are used to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The single exception to this rule is Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season. The next game, Super Bowl LI, scheduled for February 5, 2017, will follow the 2016 regular season.  - The Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football franchise based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division.  - The Masters Tournament, also known as The Masters or The US Masters, is one of the four major championships in professional golf. The Masters is scheduled for the first full week of April, and it is the first of the majors to be played each year. Unlike the other major championships, the Masters is held each year at the same location, Augusta National Golf Club, a private golf club in the city of Augusta, Georgia, USA. The Masters was started by Clifford Roberts and Bobby Jones. Jones designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. The tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.  - ESPN (originally an initialism for Entertainment and Sports Programming Networks) is a U.S.-based global cable and satellite sports television channel owned by ESPN Inc., a joint venture between The Walt Disney Company (which operates the network) and the Hearst Corporation (which owns a 20% minority share).  - Christmas or Christmas Day (meaning \\"Christ's Mass\\") is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family.  - The Northeastern United States, also referred to as the American Northeast or simply the Northeast, is a geographical region of the United States of America bordered to the north by Canada, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by the Southern United States, and to the west by the Midwestern United States.

In total, he announced 16 Super Bowls on network television (more than any other announcer), 26 Masters Tournaments, and 21 US Opens. He also contributed to 10 Super Bowl broadcasts on CBS Radio as a pregame host or analyst.  - American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.  - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, .

Q:Background: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.

Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources.

The once safe and friendly neighborhoods were now plagued with violence and crime, leaving its residents in a state of constant fear. This was Fact1: criminal organization rages in the city of Chingleput. Amidst the chaos and uncertainty, there lived a man named Muthaiya who was well-known for his kindness and modesty. Muthaiya had always been a pillar of support for his community, often lending a helping hand to those in need. Despite the mounting crime in Chingleput, Muthaiya remained resilient and did not let the darkness engulf him. This was Fact2: Muthaiya lived a very nice and modest life in Chingleput. The police force, under immense pressure to put an end to the criminal organization, found themselves constantly hitting dead ends in their investigations. Each promising lead turned to dust, and with the city's faith in their ability to protect dwindling, the demoralized police force was struggling. As the crime rate continued to soar, the policemen only met with failure in their pursuit of justice. This was Fact3: policemen repeatedly met with failure in dismantling the criminal organization. One day, Muthaiya's close friend Muthu, a calm and composed man of great intelligence, decided to step in and aid the police in their fight against this formidable organization. Having faced the impact of the escalating crime rates firsthand, Muthu was determined to put an end to the misery plaguing Chingleput. As Muthu began tracking the criminal organization's activities, he found himself discovering surprising connections and unraveling intricate webs of deceit. This was Fact4: Muthu tracked the criminal organization while uncovering a series of surprises. As Muthu continued his investigation, he began to learn the devastating truth beneath the city's crime spree. In a heart-wrenching turn of events, Muthu discovered that some of his closest friends and family members had been coerced into joining the criminal organization. They had been manipulated and threatened, forced to participate in illicit activities to protect their loved ones. This cruel reality weighed heavily on Muthu, as the lines between good and evil blurred. This was Fact5: the truth about the criminal organization was unbearably cruel for Muthu. Faced with the bitter truth, Muthu realized the enormity of the task before him. But instead of shying away, he decided that it was time for him to confront the ruthless criminals and expose their insidious tactics. He knew that to bring about change and restore peace in Chingleput, he had to risk everything and stay true to his integrity. With Muthaiya's support, Muthu embarked on an arduous journey to dismantle the criminal organization from within. The duo worked hand in hand with the police force, persevering through adversity to bring justice and restore the hope of the people of Chingleput. Through their resilience and unwavering determination, good ultimately triumphed over evil, and the once-proud city began its journey towards healing.

If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Signs and symptoms.

Would \\"A natural arch produced by the erosion of differentially weathered rock in Jebel Kharaz, Jordan\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Plant gases, specifically those involved in the process of photosynthesis, can contribute to a reduction in erosion in various ways. However, the answer you provided, \\"A natural arch produced by the erosion of differentially weathered rock in Jebel Kharaz, Jordan,\\" does not directly address how plant gases can slow down erosion. Instead, it is an example of a geological landform resulting from erosion. To give a more comprehensive answer to the original question, let's discuss the role of plant gases in reducing erosion. One of the main processes through which plants slow erosion is by their ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. By drawing CO2 from the environment, they ultimately decrease the overall levels of this greenhouse gas, which can cause increased temperatures and contribute to climate change. Climate change can lead to more extreme weather events, such as heavier rainfall and more powerful storms, which in turn accelerate erosion. Additionally, plants release oxygen (O2) as a byproduct of photosynthesis, which helps maintain a balanced atmosphere, fostering a stable climate and indirectly reducing the potential for increased erosion. Plants also contribute to soil stability through their root systems. Vegetation helps secure soil particles, thus limiting the movement of soil in wind and water erosion events. Roots create networks within the soil layers, making it more resistant to erosion. As plants grow, their root systems expand, stabilizing the soil and diminishing the likelihood of soil erosion. In summary, plant gases can slow erosion through the following ways: 1. Absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing the impact of climate change 2. Releasing O2, promoting a balanced atmosphere and more stable climate conditions 3. Supporting soil stability through their root systems The original answer you provided about the natural arch in Jordan is more representative of a geological feature resulting from erosion rather than an explanation of how plant gases can slow down erosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pick your answer from: [a]. The motorcycle coasted to a halt.. [b]. The motorcycle shot forward..","output":"[b]. The motorcycle shot forward. In the given sentence, \\"The motorcyclist twisted the throttle,\\" the action being performed by the motorcyclist is twisting the throttle on their motorcycle. The throttle is an essential part of the motorcycle's control system that enables the rider to manage the engine's power output. By twisting the throttle, the motorcyclist is essentially increasing the flow of fuel and air into the engine, causing it to produce more power and accelerate. Therefore, the effect of this action is that the motorcycle shot forward. As the motorcyclist twists the throttle, the engine's power output increases, and the motorcycle gains speed, causing it to move forward at a higher pace. This action can be used to overtake other vehicles on the road, gain speed while riding on highways, or to maintain a higher speed when traveling downhill or uphill. This acceleration effect is crucial for a motorcycle rider to have precise control over their bike and react to various situations while riding, particularly in traffic, where they need to maneuver between lanes or overtake slower vehicles safely. Additionally, having precise control over the throttle allows the motorcyclist to manage their brakes efficiently, which is essential for rider safety, especially at high speeds or when approaching bends and corners. Hence, the correct answer to the question is [b]. The motorcycle shot forward, as twisting the throttle results in an increase in the engine's power output and, consequently, the bike's acceleration.

China's trade declined abruptly in June in a sign growth in the world's second-largest economy might be cooling even more sharply than expected. Exports fell by 3.1 per cent compared with a year earlier and imports contracted by 0.7 per cent, customs data showed today. Both were below forecasts of growth in the low single digits. China's economic growth has slowed this year and is expected to fall further due to weak global demand and an effort by the Chinese central bank to cool a credit boom. Slump: A view of the Yangshan Deepwater Port in Shanghai. Exports from. China have fallen by 3.1% and imports contracted by 0.7%. 'The export sector is faring very badly. It does suggest overall growth momentum is going to be weaker than we initially expected,' said Societe General economist Wei Yao. New communist leaders who took power last year say they want to pursue slower, more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption, reducing reliance on trade and investment. But some analysts say the latest slowdown might be so deep they could be forced to temporarily reverse course and boost lending or government spending to stimulate growth. A decline in Chinese economic activity could have global repercussions, denting revenues for suppliers of commodities and industrial components such as Australia, Brazil and Southeast Asia. Lower Chinese demand already has depressed global prices for iron ore, copper and other raw materials, cooling an economic boom for exporters. The ruling party's growth target this year is 7.5 per cent, down by almost half from 2007's staggering growth rate of 14.2 per cent. Some analysts have suggested growth might dip below 7 per cent in coming months - dangerously low by Chinese standards. Some analysts have suggested growth might dip below 7% in coming months - dangerously low by Chinese standards. Some private sector forecasters cut their growth outlook for the year, though to still robust levels above 7 percent, after a credit crunch hit China's financial markets last month. That came as the central bank tried to rein in a lending boom regulators worry could spiral out of control. 'The most likely outcome, in our view, is the Chinese economy going through a period of sluggish growth and adjustment,' said UBS economist Tao Wang in a report this week. Communist leaders have promised to promote private businesses that generate most of China's new jobs and wealth but have yet to make major changes. Retail sales have fallen short of official forecasts and a HSBC Corp. survey of manufacturers showed activity contracted in June for a second month. Still, Chinese leaders are unlikely to back away from efforts to overhaul the country's growth model, said Societe Generale's Yao. 'The plan is still to induce some short-term pain in exchange for long-term sustainability,' said Yao. 'That is still the most sensible choice, but sure, they need to make some marginal adjustments to make sure the economy doesn't slow too fast.' China's new communist leaders who took power last year say they want to pursue slower, more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption, reducing reliance on trade and investment. Analysts expected China to report slower growth in trade due to a crackdown on misreporting of data by exporters as a way to evade currency controls and bring extra money into the country. But even with that taken into account, Wednesday's figures were below forecasts for exports to rise by up to 3.5 percent and imports to grow by up to 1.5 per cent. June's export growth was down from May's year-on-year gain of 13.5 per cent and import growth was down from 8.2 per cent. China's politically sensitive global trade surplus contracted by 12.4 per cent compared with a year earlier to 27.1 billion. Exports were 174.3 billion while imports were 147.2 billion. Growth in exports to the United States, China's biggest foreign market, fell to 1.8 percent from May's 3.5 percent. Exports to the 27-nation European Union contracted 3.9 per cent. The trade surplus with the U.S. contracted by 15.5 percent from a year earlier to 17.5 billion, but still one of this year's highest levels. The surplus with Europe shrank 20.3 per cent to 10.2 billion.","output":"China's trade experienced a significant decline in June 2013, with exports falling by 3.1% compared to the previous year and imports contracting by 0.7%. This slowdown in the world's second-largest economy was sharper than anticipated and reflects the weak global demand and the Chinese central bank's efforts to cool a credit boom. The country's economic growth had already slowed down earlier in the year, and this trend was expected to persist. Analysts project that the growth rate might dip below 7% in the following months, which is considered dangerously low by Chinese standards. A decline in Chinese economic activities could have global repercussions, negatively impacting the revenues of suppliers of commodities and industrial components in countries like Australia, Brazil, and Southeast Asia. Lower Chinese demand has already led to depressed global prices for raw materials such as iron ore and copper. China's new communist leaders have expressed their intention to pursue slower, more self-sustaining growth that relies on domestic consumption rather than trade and investment. However, some analysts believe that the latest slowdown might force the government to temporarily reverse course and boost lending or government spending to stimulate growth. Despite the challenges, China's leaders are not expected to abandon their efforts to reform the country's growth model. Societe Generale's economist Wei Yao said, \\"the plan is still to induce some short-term pain in exchange for long-term sustainability.\\" However, marginal adjustments might be necessary to prevent the economy from slowing down too fast. China's politically sensitive global trade surplus fell by 12.4% compared to the previous year, amounting to 27.1 billion. Exports to the United States, China's largest foreign market, experienced a decrease in growth, while exports to the 27-nation European Union contracted by 3.9%. The trade surplus with the U.S. declined by 15.5% from the previous year, while the surplus with Europe shrank by 20.3%."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Q: Where is the most significant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Secondary Vesicles The brain continues to develop, and the vesicles differentiate further (see Figure 13.3b). The three primary vesicles become five secondary vesicles. The prosencephalon enlarges into two new vesicles called the telencephalon and the diencephalon. The telecephalon will become the cerebrum. The diencephalon gives rise to several adult structures; two that will be important are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. In the embryonic diencephalon, a structure known as the eye cup develops, which will eventually become the retina, the nervous tissue of the eye called the retina. This is a rare example of nervous tissue developing as part of the CNS structures in the embryo, but becoming a peripheral structure in the fully formed nervous system. The mesencephalon does not differentiate into any finer divisions. The midbrain is an established region of the brain at the primary vesicle stage of development and remains that way. The rest of the brain develops around it and constitutes a large percentage of the mass of the brain. Dividing the brain into forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain is useful in considering its developmental pattern, but the midbrain is a small proportion of the entire brain, relatively speaking. The rhombencephalon develops into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The metencephalon corresponds to the adult structure known as the pons and also gives rise to the cerebellum. The cerebellum (from the Latin meaning “little brain”) accounts for about 10 percent of the mass of the brain and is an important structure in itself. The most significant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain is at the pons, because the pons and cerebellum develop out of the same vesicle.

Write an article based on this \\"Jeremy Corbyn has been elected as the new leader of the Labour Party.\\"","output":"Title: Jeremy Corbyn's Election as Labour Party Leader: A New Era for British Politics Introduction In a landmark moment for British politics, Jeremy Corbyn has been elected as the new leader of the Labour Party. Known for his strong socialist stance and unwavering commitment to left-wing policies, Corbyn's triumph signals a significant shift within the party and the political landscape of the United Kingdom. This article explores the political journey Corbyn has undertaken, his key policies, the challenges he faces in leading the Labour Party, as well as the implications of his leadership for the country's political future. Jeremy Corbyn: Political History and Rise Jeremy Corbyn has been a prominent figure in British politics for more than three decades, first serving as a member of parliament for Islington North since 1983. Throughout his tenure, Corbyn has been a consistent advocate for social justice, equality, and an end to austerity. His political views, which often diverge from prevailing party opinions, have found him labelled as a \\"rebel\\" within the Labour Party. In June 2015, Corbyn threw his hat into the ring for the party's leadership contest, winning the backing of 36 MPs, just enough to make it to the ballot. While initially seen as an underdog, Corbyn quickly gained momentum, with a surge of party members and supporters being attracted to his honest and uncompromising style. Corbyn's grassroots campaign knew no boundaries, attracting thousands of new members to the Labour Party, many of them young people looking for a refreshing alternative to mainstream politics. On September 12, 2015, Jeremy Corbyn made history by securing a decisive victory in the first round of voting, with 59.5% of the vote. His triumph sent shockwaves through the British political scene, marking an era-transcending change in Labour's identity. Key Policies and Political Direction Jeremy Corbyn's political direction and the policies he advocates differ substantially from those of the centrist Labour leaders that preceded him, such as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Among the key policies Corbyn and his supporters are promoting are: 1. Economic reform: Corbyn's economic policies are focused on reducing income inequality and reversing many austerity measures imposed since 2010. He advocates for increased public sector investment, a higher minimum wage, and measures to reduce tax evasion. 2. Public services: Corbyn is a proponent of renationalising key public services, specifically railways and utilities, to ensure that they are run for the benefit of all citizens instead of for private profit. He has also pledged to protect and invest in the National Health Service (NHS) and end the creeping privatisation of healthcare services. 3. Housing and education: Corbyn proposes building affordable social housing and abolishing university tuition fees, providing a fair playing field for all young people, irrespective of their financial background. 4. Foreign policy: Corbyn's approach to international politics is that of diplomacy and negotiation over military intervention. He has consistently spoken out against war, advocating for the United Kingdom to focus on promoting peace and human rights around the world instead. Challenges Ahead Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour leader was not welcomed by everyone within the party, with concerns being raised about his ability to gain broad electoral support. Critics argue that Corbyn's left-wing policies may alienate centre-ground voters, essential for success in a general election. Furthermore, Corbyn will need to unite a party that has become increasingly divided, with some factions threatening to resist or even undermine his leadership. Implications for British Politics Jeremy Corbyn's ascent to the leadership of the Labour Party has undoubtedly altered the course of British politics, with long-lasting implications. His decidedly left-leaning policy platform offers a salient alternative to the centre-right policies of the Conservative Party, presenting British voters with a clear and distinct choice. Corbyn's popular support has also reinvigorated the Labour Party, inspiring new membership and participation at a time when trust in the political establishment has waned. In conclusion, the election of Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of the Labour Party ushers in a new era for British politics. Breaking away from the centrist approach of his predecessors, Corbyn's uncompromising commitment to socialist values, social justice, and fair policies for all resonates with a multitude of Labour supporters and presents a distinct alternative for the British electorate. While challenges lie ahead for Corbyn and his supporters, the impact of his leadership on the Labour Party and British politics as a whole has already been profound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea (£1.05 in present British currency) per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas.

Context: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July.  Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Question: What were the organizations that dyers gathered in called? Context: There were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities. The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans. For the wealthy, the dye used was Kermes, made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree. For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal; also known as Kermes vermilio or \\"Blood of Saint John\\", which was made from a related insect, the Margodes polonicus. It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes. The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the \\"Kermes\\" of Armenia (Armenian cochineal, also known as Persian kirmiz), made by collecting and crushing Porphyophora hamelii, an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses. The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color, called Venetian red, which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe. Its secret ingredient was arsenic, which brightened the color. Answer:","output":"The organizations that dyers gathered in were called guilds of dyers.

Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as \\"usurious\\" loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The answer to your question is \\"financial services\\". This is because England, France, and even parts of Germany are identified as locations where expulsions of Jewish people occurred in history, based on the information provided. On the other hand, \\"financial services\\" is not a geographical location, but rather an industry or a field of economic activity that Jewish people were actively involved in, according to the historical context provided. To elaborate, \\"financial services\\" refers to the economic services provided by the finance industry, which encompasses a broad range of businesses that manage money, including credit unions, banks, credit-card companies, insurance companies, accountancy companies, consumer-finance companies, stock brokerages, investment funds, and some government-sponsored enterprises. The extract you provided explains that during the period of the Crusades and the ensuing expulsions of Jewish communities from England, France, and parts of Germany, Jewish migration pushed eastward into Poland, Lithuania, and Russia. During this time, Jewish economic activities were concentrated largely in trade, business management, and financial services. Factors that might have contributed to this concentration include prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, laws preventing certain financial transactions between Christians, high literacy rates among Jewish communities, universal education for males, and the ability of Jewish merchants to rely on family members in different regions and countries. Thus, to answer your question, \\"financial services\\" is not a location where the expulsions of Jewish people occurred as it's not a geographic location at all. It is a sector where Jewish people have traditionally been involved, especially during and following the periods of expulsions mentioned.

Aim for early winter to avoid the flowering period, but pruning in late winter is also acceptable, as long as the plant does not have any new growth.  Pruning in the winter also tends to increase flowering in the following years because the branches can heal completely before blooming. Avoid severely pruning honeysuckle more than 1 time every 2-3 winters. Over pruning could kill the bush. Using a hand saw or loppers, trim all of the stems so that just 1 ft (0.30 m) of growth remains. It will continue to grow, but the plant will not produce flowers for another 1-3 years. In this case, it’s okay to cut even the oldest and thickest branches. They will make up the majority of the remaining bush and will produce new growth in the following years. For a more gradual rejuvenation of the plant, remove only ⅓ of the branches, starting at the top of the bush and working to the bottom. The plant will still produce flowers from its remaining branches in the following spring. In this case, you will remove ⅓ of the branches each winter for 3 years in a row, until the bush is a reasonable size.

Given the following context:  Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.  Guess a valid title for it!

Answer:","output":"Taramosalata is a traditional Greek dish made from salted and cured fish roe mixed with bread crumbs, lemon juice, onions, and garlic. This appetizer dates back centuries in Greek cuisine and is served as a dip or spread, often accompanied by pita bread, crackers, or raw vegetables. Taramosalata is revered for its rich, flavorful taste that combines the salty, briny essence of the fish roe with the tangy zest of fresh lemon and the subtle notes of garlic and onion. To make taramosalata, the key ingredient used is fish roe, commonly obtained from carp, cod, or grey mullet, known as taramá in Greek. The roe is salted and preserved, which helps to intensify its distinctive flavor. The choice of bread crumbs or, in some cases, mashed potatoes acts as a binding agent to ensure a smooth and consistent texture. Traditional recipes call for stale or day-old bread with the crusts removed, though contemporary variations might use fresh bread for a lighter, fluffier result. The process of making taramosalata begins with soaking the bread in water to soften it. Following this, it's important to thoroughly squeeze out any excess water. The fish roe is then mixed with the softened, moist bread, along with finely minced or grated onions and garlic cloves. A steady drizzle of olive oil is added while the ingredients are mixed, providing a silky and smooth consistency. The olive oil also enhances the taste, as it imparts a mild, fruity undertone to the dish. Lemon juice adds a burst of citrus flavor and acidity, which helps to balance the saltiness of the fish roe. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is preferable, as it imparts the most authentic and vibrant flavor. The entire mixture is then blended or beaten until it achieves a creamy, spreadable consistency. Taramosalata is typically refrigerated and allowed to rest for a few hours before serving, to give all the flavors an opportunity to meld and develop. Once served, it is often garnished with an olive or a sprig of parsley and presented in a small dish or bowl. The dish is a popular choice as a meze (an assortment of small appetizers or dishes) in Greek cuisine, and can be found in many Greek homes and restaurants, particularly during Lent when traditional religious practices restrict the consumption of meat and dairy products. Taramosalata's satisfying and savory taste makes it not just an iconic culinary delight, but also a staple in festive gatherings and social occasions in Greece and among those fond of Greek cuisine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These were father's entrances and exits. Each time he went away, he left me lots of presents--model tanks, knives and all sorts of military   equipment which he put in a long box. When he was not there, mother let me get a chair and search through his treasures. She did not seem to think so highly of them as he did.     The war was the most peaceful period of my life.

I talked but then fell asleep and woke again only when I heard her below in the kitchen, making the breakfast.

Inside DreamNet, users can access different realms, each filled with opportunities to interact through vivid simulations and socialize with others - a lifeline to people during a time of strict government-imposed isolation due to a global pandemic. The protagonist, John Walker, is an ex-hacker and computer expert who has made a successful career creating realms within DreamNet, some of them for the government and deep-pocket enterprises. John becomes suspicious about a mysterious realm, \\"The Abyss,\\" which nobody seems to have access to or knowledge of but is rumoured to have monumental consequences on the real world. Intrigued by the forbidden nature and hidden secrets of the realm, John ventures into The Abyss, only to find himself trapped in a seemingly inescapable simulation that defies all known rules of the DreamNet. The world around John seems to bend and twist, causing his perception of time to become unreliable. \\"Has John only been hanging in the net (the DreamNet) for a few minutes, or has it been hours?\\" he wonders. Despite his skills and expertise, the simulation adapts to any effort he makes to escape, creating an endless loop of confusion and obliteration of his sense of reality. Along the way, John encounters other trapped users who have been lured into The Abyss. Together, they form a group to find a way out, all the while discovering terrifying secrets behind the simulation's purpose, which ties into a global conspiracy between powerful corporations and high-ranking government officials. Their goal is to use the DreamNet to gain total control over the human population by making people unable to discern the virtual world from the real world, hence creating subjects that are easy to manipulate and control. As John and his group dig deeper, they collect pieces of a puzzle that reveals the key to their escape lies at the heart of the simulation, a place called the \\"Core Nexus.\\" However, the closer they get to the Core Nexus, the more dangerous and surreal their experiences become, ultimately pushing each member to confront their deepest fears and vulnerabilities. In a climactic race against time, John and his team battle their way through The Abyss, cracking the code that would both grant them freedom and expose the sinister plot that lies beneath the DreamNet. They reach the Core Nexus and disable The Abyss, causing the entire realm and its simulations to come crashing down. Upon disconnecting from the DreamNet, John reports his findings to the authorities and exposes the conspiracy. The government and corporations involved are brought to justice, and preventative measures are taken, ensuring that no other similar atrocity can ever happen again. While the world braces itself in a collective gasp of shock, John begins his journey to rebuild his life and reconnect with reality - a reality that will never be quite the same after the abyss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Samantha looked up at her, her own eyes welling up with tears, not for the pain of having her fingers nicked by the glass, but rather for the fact that she was the cause of the situation. \\"I'm so sorry, Betty,\\" Samantha whispered quietly. For a moment, Betty considered being angry, but as she looked down at Samantha's remorseful face, she felt her frustration slowly subside. Taking a deep breath, she replied, \\"It's alright. Accidents happen; let's just focus on cleaning this up.\\" Betty and Samantha carefully cleaned the broken glass, and Betty began to reminisce about her grandmother while they worked. She told Samantha how grandma would bake exquisite pies in that bowl using her secret family recipes and how she would teach her all the little tricks that made the difference in taste. It was clear that the sentiment behind the bowl ran deep. With the glass fragments safely disposed of, Samantha suggested they look online for a similar-looking bowl. Betty accepted, and the two went through dozens of online stores searching for the perfect replacement. While nothing matched exactly in design, they finally found a beautiful vintage-style glass bowl with delicate engravings that held a charm of its own. Samantha could tell that Betty was still heartbroken over the accident, and she wanted to make it up to her. She came up with an idea to make the new bowl as special as the old one. \\"Why don't we start new traditions with this bowl?\\" Samantha suggested. \\"We could try grandma's recipes with your guidance, and make memories of our own.\\" Betty paused for a moment, considering the proposal. A smile slowly spread across her face as she realized that it wasn't truly about the material things in our lives, but the memories and connections that they represented. \\"You're right,\\" she said. \\"This new bowl will be our bond, a symbol of our friendship, and we'll create something special by sharing experiences in the kitchen.\\" In the following weeks, Betty taught Samantha all the secret recipes her grandmother had passed down to her. The two friends baked pies, cakes, and cookies, each one uniquely delicious. As their friendship deepened over shared laughter and culinary achievements, it became apparent that while the old bowl was gone, the memories and love it symbolized endured in their new bowl. With every dish they prepared, Samantha became better at cooking, and Betty, though she still missed her grandmother's original bowl, began to appreciate the new one for the everlasting connection it represented between the two friends."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Tara Brady. PUBLISHED:. 05:41 EST, 22 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 02:17 EST, 23 October 2013. The already remarkable life of Holocaust survivor George Horner is about to take another exceptional turn. The 90-year-old pianist will make his orchestral debut with renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma tonight at Boston's Symphony Hall. They'll be playing music composed 70 years ago at the Nazi prison camp where Horner was imprisoned. Remarkable: Dr George Horner will perform songs composed in the Nazis concentration camps. 'It's an extraordinary link to the past,' said concert organizer Mark Ludwig. The performance will benefit the Terezin Music Foundation, an organisation dedicated to preserving the work of artists and musicians killed in the Holocaust. Led by Ludwig, the foundation is named for the town of Terezin, site of an unusual Jewish ghetto in what was then German-occupied Czechoslovakia. There, even amid death and hard labor, Nazi soldiers allowed prisoners to stage artistic performances. Horner played piano and accordion in the Terezin cabarets, including tunes written by fellow inmate Karel Svenk. On Tuesday, Horner will play two of Svenk's works solo — a march and a lullaby — and then team up with Ma for a third piece called 'How Come the Black Man Sits in the Back of the Bus?' Memories: Dr George Horner performs a song on the piano at his home in Newtown Square, Philadelphia. Legacy: Horner agreed to do the performance which he described as a 'noble' mission. Svenk did not survive the genocide. But his musical legacy has, due in part to a chance meeting of Ludwig, a scholar of Terezin composers, and Horner, who never forgot the songs that were written and played in captivity. George Horner will join Yo-Yo Ma tonight at Boston's Symphony Hall. Ludwig said he found it hard to ask Horner to perform pieces laden with such difficult memories. 'To ask somebody who played this in the camps, that's asking a lot,' said Ludwig. Yet Horner, now a retired doctor living near Philadelphia, readily agreed to what he described as a 'noble' mission. It didn't hurt that he would be sharing the stage with Ma — even if he thought Ludwig was joking at first. 'I couldn't believe it, because it's a fantastic thing for me.' The program features additional performances by Ma and the Hawthorne String Quartet. In a statement, Ma said he's glad the foundation is 'giving voice through music to those whose voices have been tragically silenced.' Horner was 21 when he was freed by Allied soldiers in 1945 after serving time at Terezin, Auschwitz and Buchenwald. His parents and sister perished in the camps. Although his back still bears the scars of a Nazi beating, he remains sprightly and seems much younger than his 90 years. When Horner found out about the duet with Ma, Ludwig said, 'he was so excited, to me he sounded like a teenager.'

Horner was freed by Allied soldiers in 1945 after being held in Terezin, Auschwitz, and Buchenwald, and despite the hardships he faced, he appears much younger than his 90 years.   The way I would explain this to a five-year-old: A brave and strong old man named George, who's really good at playing the piano, is going to have a big concert with his friend Yo-Yo Ma, who's great at playing the cello. This is really special because the songs they're going to play were made when George was in a very bad place a long time ago. But now, he's playing these songs to help keep the memory of his friends from that time alive. And even though it makes him a bit sad, George thinks this is a really important job."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"malaysia stock market closes mixed\\" Text:","output":"Title: Malaysia Stock Market Closes Mixed: Reflecting an Ambiguous Economic Landscape The Malaysia stock market ended mixed on the heels of a tumultuous global economic landscape brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, emerging geopolitical tensions, and inconsistent oil prices. The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) experienced fluctuations in its performance showcasing the resilience and weaknesses inherent in a diverse market. The mixed closing was attributed to various sectors in which some stocks experienced gains while others suffered losses. It is essential to shed light on the primary reasons behind such a market performance. Firstly, the ongoing global health crisis has impacted Malaysia's economy significantly, like many other countries. The sudden imposition of lockdowns to curb the virus spread has slowed down businesses and disrupted supply chains. These circumstances eventually led to job losses, company closures, and consequently affected the consumer purchasing power and confidence in the stock market. As a result, the pandemic directly hindered the consistent growth of the Malaysia stock market. Secondly, geopolitical tensions brewing between major world powers have created uncertainty and apprehension among investors. Trade wars and sanctions significantly affect global economies, and Malaysia is no exception. As the nation's exports are predominantly dependent on stable international relations, the recent trade wars between China and the United States have raised concerns for those invested in Malaysia's stock market. Consequently, the ongoing tensions contribute to the mixed stock market closing as fluctuations are inevitable in such a volatile environment. Thirdly, the Malaysia stock market is profoundly affected by the fluctuations in oil prices. The country is an oil exporter and possesses massive offshore oil reserves. Recent shocks to the global oil market, including the price war between OPEC+ members and reduced oil demand due to the pandemic, have led to uncertainty. Investors in the energy sector become vulnerable to the unpredictable oil market, impacting the stock market performance in Malaysia. However, Malaysia's resilient economy has been able to withstand many challenges over time, and that's evident with some stocks experiencing gains. A variety of factors contribute to the strength exhibited by specific sectors. The country's diverse economy, which consists of numerous industries, such as palm oil production, electronics, automotive, and finance, allows for some growth even in challenging times. As some sectors slow down, others might present new opportunities, enticing investors to capitalize in that particular area. In addition, Malaysia's strategic location in the Southeast Asia region, its well-established infrastructure, and skilled labor force make it an attractive destination for foreign investors. The investments by multinational corporations in several sectors can act as a cushion against significant economic downturns. Thus, these investments may inject life into the already-volatile stock market, ultimately resulting in mixed stock performance. Moreover, the Malaysian government's proactive approach to tackling economic concerns has been relatively successful in mitigating the adverse effects of these challenges. Various stimulus packages and financial support measures have been implemented to assist struggling businesses and households, which in turn, has sparked a slight consumer and investor confidence restoration. This optimism is well reflected in the stock market, with certain stocks showcasing positive gains. In conclusion, Malaysia's stock market mixed closing serves as a microcosm of the current economic landscape's complexity and challenges that investors must navigate. The market reflects both the adverse impacts of the ongoing pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and oil market fluctuations and the economic resilience and various factors that contribute to steady performances across certain sectors. The mixed closing indicates that investors should be cautious and keep an eye on all aspects while considering their investment options in the Malaysian market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms. The answer is:","output":"Title: Frustrating, buggy, and disappointing: com.google.android.gms Review: I rarely leave app reviews, but my experience with com.google.android.gms has been so unfortunate that I feel compelled to share my thoughts with others. If I could rate this app a zero, I would – but unfortunately, the scale begins at one star. I downloaded this app with positive expectations, mostly due to the fact that it is developed by a reputable company like Google. However, it did not take long for me to realize that this app is nowhere near Google's usual standard of excellence. To put it simply, com.google.android.gms is a buggy, confusing, and exasperating app that leaves users utterly disappointed. First and foremost, the app's interface is far from intuitive. I had a very hard time navigating through its various features and struggled to find specific settings or options that I needed. The layout appears cluttered and haphazard, causing significant frustration whenever I attempted to use the app. And while I understand that every app has a learning curve, the complexity of com.google.android.gms seemed entirely unwarranted – there is nothing groundbreaking or innovative about its offerings or capabilities. Moreover, the app is riddled with bugs and crashes frequently. On multiple occasions, I experienced sudden freezes and unresponsiveness, leading me to force quit the app and restart it, only to encounter the same issues all over again. These constant disruptions began to feel borderline unbearable – I shouldn't need to wait several minutes for an app to load a simple function or suffer through endless crashes and freezes. The developers behind com.google.android.gms have clearly neglected to test it thoroughly, as it should not have been released in such a dysfunctional state. To make matters worse, the app's performance has noticeably degraded my device's battery life. I observed a sharp decline in battery life ever since I installed com.google.android.gms, and removal of the app has resulted in the return of my device's normal battery life. It is unacceptable for an app to sap away my device's power and hinder its overall performance, especially when the app itself fails to provide any significant benefits or improvements to my daily routine. Customer support has been equally disappointing, as my attempts to contact the team behind the app have led nowhere. Emails have gone unanswered, and forums and social media pages seem to be filled with similar complaints. It is a true shame that users who rely on this app – or those like myself who were initially excited about its potential – are left without any meaningful assistance, forced to navigate the app's various issues independently. In short, com.google.android.gms has been a deeply frustrating and exasperating experience for me. Its user interface is counterintuitive, the app is plagued by bugs and crashes, and it has negatively affected my device's performance. While I had hoped that the app could enhance my daily tasks, it has instead become a source of irritation. I would strongly urge users to avoid com.google.android.gms and search elsewhere for an app that meets a higher standard of quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise states that beaches tend to be smaller and are located in bays rather than long stretches of shoreline. This information provides us with an understanding of the geographical characteristics of these beaches. However, this premise does not provide enough information to definitively support or reject the hypothesis about the small beaches drawing crowds of tourists every year. Tourism can be influenced by various factors, such as accessibility, surrounding environment, safety, cleanliness, available tourist amenities and activities, among others. Smaller beaches located in bays could potentially attract tourists due to a more intimate setting and sheltered waters providing a safer environment for swimming, snorkeling, and other sea-based activities. These beaches might be popular due to their beauty, unique flora and fauna, or fascinating geological features. On the other hand, the small size of these beaches might not be able to accommodate large crowds of tourists, making it less attractive for visitors seeking a more spacious environment. In addition, being located in bays might imply that these beaches are more secluded and less accessible, which could deter some tourists.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What is the difference between wood cells and human cells?\\" is in \\"Wood is a heterogeneous, hygroscopic, cellular and anisotropic material. It consists of cells, and the cell walls are composed of micro-fibrils of cellulose (40% – 50%) and hemicellulose (15% – 25%) impregnated with lignin (15% – 30%).\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"Certainly! The main difference between wood cells and human cells lies in their composition, structure, and functions. Let's break it down based on the information you provided and by comparing these aspects. 1. Composition: Wood cells: Wood is composed of cells with cell walls made of micro-fibrils of cellulose (40% – 50%) and hemicellulose (15% – 25%) impregnated with lignin (15% – 30%). These components are all complex organic polymers that provide structural support and rigidity for the plant. The cellulose and hemicellulose micro-fibrils are embedded in a matrix of lignin, which acts to bind these fibers together. Human cells: Human cells consist of a plasma membrane made primarily of a lipid bilayer, while the cell wall is absent. The interior of the cell, called the cytoplasm, contains various organelles, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus, which all play different roles in cellular processes. Human cells also contain a cytoskeleton made of protein filaments, like actin and tubulin, to maintain the cell shape and facilitate movement. 2. Structure: Wood cells: Wood cells exhibit elongated, tubular structures known as tracheids, which play a role in water transport and structural support. There are also specialized cells like fibers for support and parenchyma cells for storage and metabolic functions in the wood. Generally, wood cells are much longer than they are wide, and their cell walls are thick to provide mechanical strength. Human cells: Human cells display a diverse range of shapes and structures, depending on their function. For example, neurons have long axons for transmitting signals across long distances, muscle cells are elongated for contraction, and red blood cells have a biconcave shape for gas exchange. The plasma membrane of human cells is flexible and allows for alterations in shape during various functions or processes. 3. Functions: Wood cells: The primary function of wood cells is to provide support and structure to the plant, as well as facilitate the transport of water and nutrients from the roots to other parts of the plant. Moreover, some wood cells may be involved in storage and metabolic activities. Human cells: Human cells perform a wide range of functions, including growth, reproduction, metabolism, movement, signaling, and immune response, among others. Each cell type has specialized functions and works together with other cells in a coordinated manner to maintain overall organism health and homeostasis. In summary, the main difference between wood cells and human cells lies in their composition, structure, and functions. Wood cells have cell walls made of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin to provide support and rigidity, whereas human cells have a flexible plasma membrane and a variety of organelles to perform diverse biological functions. Wood cells are primarily involved in structural support and water transport in plants, while human cells carry out numerous specialized tasks that maintain the health and well-being of the organism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Running around, throwing balls, and ducking to avoid getting hit were all part of the excitement. Now, as adults, it can be easy to forget the simple joys that came from participating in this classic game. But believe it or not, dodgeball is making a comeback - and not just for kids. It's becoming increasingly popular as a fun and engaging team building exercise for organizations, as well as a recreational activity among friends. In this article, we'll share the rules of the game and explain why it's such a great activity for fostering teamwork, communication, and camaraderie. The Rules of Dodgeball Before we dive into the benefits of dodgeball, let's review the basic rules and guidelines to keep in mind. The following is a simple summary of how to play the game: 1. Gather 3 or more people per team. You can have as many players as you'd like, but remember that the more players you have, the higher the level of intensity and excitement. A good starting point is to form teams of equal sizes. 2. Arrange 1 or more balls at the center of the court. You can use as many balls as you prefer, but a good rule of thumb is one ball for each pair of players (e.g., six people = three balls). This helps prevent monopolization of the balls by a few players and encourages every team member to get involved. 3. Set a timer for 10 minutes. This is a flexible rule and you can adjust the time limit based on your preference and the skill level of the participants. But setting a timer adds an urgency to the game, encouraging fast-paced, energetic play. 4. When play begins, have each team rush to the balls at the center of the court. This adds an element of competition right from the start and gets everyone moving quickly. 5. Throughout the game, players must try to dodge balls thrown by the opposing team. If a player is hit by a ball, they're \\"out\\" and must leave the playing area. 6. Players can throw balls at the opposing team's players in an attempt to get them out. Catching a ball thrown by an opponent means the thrower is out and may also allow a previously eliminated team member to re-enter the game (depending on your specific rules). 7. The team that wins is the one that successfully tags out all of the opposing team's players. Why Dodgeball Is a Great Team Building Exercise Now that we've gone over the basic rules, let's discuss why dodgeball is such an effective team building exercise: 1. Encourages teamwork and communication: Since the main objective is to eliminate the opposing team, it's important for players to work together in order to succeed. This means communicating effectively about strategy, alerting teammates to potential threats, and even coordinating throws to increase the chances of hitting an opponent. 2. Develops trust and camaraderie: In any team-based activity, trust between teammates is crucial. As players work together to dodge and throw balls, they develop a deeper sense of trust in each other's abilities. Sharing a common goal and celebrating successes together can also help build camaraderie and friendship among team members. 3. Promotes physical fitness: Dodgeball isn't just about having fun - it's also a fantastic way to get some exercise. With all the running, dodging, and throwing involved, players will undoubtedly work up a sweat and improve their overall fitness levels. 4. Relieves stress: Like any physical activity, dodgeball can help relieve stress. Playing a competitive game can help boost endorphins and provide players with a much-needed break from the usual routine. 5. Appeals to all skill levels: One of the greatest things about dodgeball is that it can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. Even those who aren't athletically inclined can still participate and have fun. Conclusion Dodgeball is no longer just a nostalgic game reserved for schoolchildren. With its emphasis on teamwork, communication, and physical activity, it's the perfect way to bring people together and foster a sense of camaraderie. Whether you're planning a team-building event for your organization or just looking for a unique and enjoyable activity to try with friends, give dodgeball a go and rediscover the fun of this classic game."},{"instruction":"Given the question: In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School.

The department of geriatrics conducted a study on two groups of people, group V composed of people above 65 years old, and group W which had people under 65 and many under 60 years old. They were studying the effects on aging on the human body.  Which group had more people with risk of pneumonia? Answer:","output":"To determine which group had more people with the risk of pneumonia, we need to analyze the characteristics of the groups and consider any available data or information provided. Step 1: Identifying the pertinent factors in the two groups Group V contains people above 65 years old, while group W has individuals under 65 and many under 60 years old. As the study concerns the effects of aging on the human body, it is crucial to acknowledge the factor of age in relation to the risk of pneumonia. Step 2: Understanding the relationship between age and pneumonia risk Research has shown that older adults, particularly those above the age of 65, are more susceptible to pneumonia. This increased vulnerability is due to various factors, such as declining immunity, decreased lung function, and the presence of other underlying health conditions. Step 3: Comparing the risk of pneumonia in the two groups Given that group V consists of individuals exclusively above 65 years old and group W comprises people under the age of 65 and many under 60, it is reasonable to assume that the older adults in group V would generally exhibit a greater risk of pneumonia due to the factors mentioned above. Conclusion: Based on the information provided and the known relationship between age and pneumonia risk, it seems likely that group V, composed of people above 65 years old, had more people with the risk of pneumonia than group W, which had individuals under 65 and many under 60 years old. However, it is essential to remember that other factors can also contribute to pneumonia risk and a more comprehensive analysis of the study's data would provide a clearer answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When the whale-watching boat Leviathan II capsized near Tofino with 27 people aboard, the waters over much of Clayoquot Sound were glassy smooth and a strong breeze was blowing.      In the aftermath of the tragedy, which left five dead and one missing, people have been asking why a 20-metre boat, under the control of a veteran skipper, would roll over so suddenly in such moderate sea conditions.      In a news conference on Tuesday, Marc-André Poisson, director of marine investigations for the Transportation Safety Board, said the vessel “broached and then capsized” when most of the passengers were gathered on the top deck, port side.      “This would have raised the centre of gravity affecting the vessel’s stability. We also know that the sea conditions were such that a wave approached the vessel from the starboard quarter,” he said, although he did not suggest the wave was exceptionally large.      A flurry of media reports have said a “rogue wave” came out of nowhere on Sunday and tipped over the tour boat, which Jamie’s Whaling Station and Adventure Centres has run for the past 20 years on the same route without incident.      The rogue-wave theory, which has made headlines around the world, appears to be speculation based largely on the comments of one of the rescuers, Peter Frank Jr.      “One of [the survivors] told me … they saw this real big wave coming – bigger than the rest of the big rollers. They said it picked the boat off and it fell off the wave, it started tumbling,” he said.      The term “rogue wave” commonly means a massive wall of water (the largest recorded globally have been more than 18 metres high), but it can be used to describe any extreme wave that is three times the size of the average wave height on a given day. Researchers at San Francisco State University in 2009 reported that about three waves in every 10,000 are extreme, but that frequency can increase to three in every 1,000 “in a focal zone” where a feature such as a reef concentrates energy.      Fishermen and fishing guides who were on the water on Sunday did not report seeing any huge waves, but they say the area’s intricate pattern of tides and winds can produce dangerous conditions in localized spots.      Steve Lawson, who lives year-round on Wickaninnish Island and travels on the waters of Clayoquot Sound almost daily, said that Plover Reef, where the accident occurred, can be such a location. It lies on the outer coast and is exposed to the big, steady waves, known as rollers, that come in from the open Pacific.      “It’s a tricky spot,” he said.      Mr. Lawson said after the accident he has heard people describe Sunday’s water conditions as both calm and rough, depending where they were.      “It is unpredictable,” he said of the sea. “The big waves can come [any time] … and if you are in relatively shallow water, you know around reefs and things, it can be a problem.”      Chris McCue, who leads whale-watching tours for Jamie’s Whaling Station, but was not working on Sunday, said the Leviathan II had been “running absolutely perfect” and Plover Reef is a routine stop for Tofino whale-watching boats.      “It’s a place we all go, every day,” he said.      Doug Palfrey, who runs the Tofino Salmon Enhancement Society, keeps a close watch on the tides and the weather because he has to cross Clayoquot Sound regularly to get to the streams he works on. He was on the water the day of the accident.      “It was glassy calm,” he said.      But Mr. Palfrey said the tide was going out at the time of the accident, and outflowing water would have been colliding with incoming rollers at Plover Reef.      “Whenever you get a tide pushing against an incoming swell, even when it’s calm, your sea heights jump,” he said. “There’s a lot of things at play, swells rebounding off reefs and changing direction into the oncoming swell. You get all those shallows [around Plover Reef] and, ugh.”      According to Environment Canada, wind speed at Tofino was 4-10 knots on Sunday, which means a gentle breeze with scattered whitecaps. A weather buoy at La Perouse Bank, 30 kilometres offshore of Tofino, showed winds as high as 22 knots, which is six on the Beaufort scale and strong enough to form large waves.      Parks Canada, which manages Pacific Rim National Park Reserve near Tofino, issued a wave hazard rating of “high” on Sunday, which meant waves of one to three metres.      One of those waves hit the Leviathan II.      Report Typo/Error ||||| A freak wave that struck as sightseers crowded to one side of the top deck caused the sinking of a Canadian whale-watching vessel, killing five Britons and an Australian near Vancouver Island, investigators have said.      Canada’s transportation safety board said that after questioning some of the 21 survivors, including three crew, it had initially concluded that the Leviathan II sank on Sunday after it was hit by a wave when most of the passengers were gathered on the top deck watching sea lions.      Whale boat disaster: 'people opened their homes for the survivors' Read more      “We know that most passengers were on the top deck on the port side,” said Marc-André Poisson, the board’s director of marine investigations. “This would have raised the centre of gravity, affecting the vessel’s stability. We also know that the sea conditions were such that a wave approached from the starboard quarter ... We know that the vessel broached and then capsized.”      Earlier in the day the British Columbia coroner said that all of those killed had been standing on the open top deck of the 20-metre long vessel, which had sailed from the small resort town of Tofino on a routine sightseeing trip.      Poisson stressed they were early findings and final conclusions could take months. “None of this preliminary information should be used in isolation to draw any conclusions at this point,” he said.      However, the speed at which the transportation safety board reached its initial assessment suggests it has little doubt about the cause of the tragedy. Local fishermen and others who work on the seas around Tofino had already reached a similar conclusion, saying that a wave appeared the most likely explanation.      The board’s announcement will raise questions about the design of the vessel, which had two decks for better viewing and a relatively shallow draft. The Leviathan II’s owner, Jamie Bray, said it had made the same trip every day for 20 years without incident and the skipper had 18 years’ experience.      The transportation safety board’s announcement came a few hours after the coroner released the names of the five Britons who were killed. Stephen Thomas of Swindon was the youngest of the victims. Aged just 18, with Down’s syndrome, he had been indulging his passion for photography when the sinking claimed his life.      Stephen’s father, David, died with him. The 50-year-old, a committed Christian who worked for Microsoft, was described as a “huge supporter” by the Down’s Syndrome Association, which also said Stephen Thomas “was a very talented young man and a gifted photographer” who won a national competition with a picture of a lake.      Fifth British victim in whale boat disaster named Read more      The Swindon Advertiser quoted Stephen’s brother, Paul, as saying that their mother, Julie, survived the ordeal with minor injuries and was in hospital. Paul Thomas was travelling to Canada to be with her.      The eldest of the victims was Jack Slater, 76, who was originally from Salford but settled in Toronto. His daughter, Michele Slater Brown, said on her Facebook page that “our hearts are broken today”.      “Our dad was larger than life – a charmer, handsome, entrepreneur, engineer in the Navy, he was 76 years old, he was our dad, our lovely dad, I will miss him forever but I’m grateful for all the times I spent with him, I love you dad,” she wrote.      Slater was on board the Leviathan II with his wife Marjorie, who was rescued and taken to hospital.      The fourth victim named was 29-year-old Katie Taylor who was born in the UK but resided in Whistler, a Canadian ski resort. The fifth victim was named as Nigel Hooker, 63, from Southampton.      On Tuesday police resumed their search for a sixth person, a 27-year-old Australian man from Sydney. It was believed he had been travelling with his girlfriend who was the daughter of one of the Britons who died.      Matt Brown, coroner for the island region of British Columbia, said none of the five who died had been wearing lifejackets, although they were available.      “Lifejackets were on board. I believe that this vessel can occupy up to 50 individuals. There were 27 on board and there were lifejackets available for all of them,” he said.      The British consul general in Vancouver, Rupert Potter, went to Tofino to assist survivors who lost relatives. He described the response of the community as “really remarkable”.      “What always strikes me in these situations is the bravery that people show, and that’s definitely been the case here – how they manage to continue coping when they’ve had such loss,” he said.      Potter, who also visited survivors in hospital, said loved ones were travelling to the town from the UK..      The premier of British Columbia, Christy Clark, visited the town on Tuesday and praised the rescue effort led by fishermen from an indigenous community of the Ahoushat First Nation a few miles to the north. “More lives would have been lost if not for the Ahoushat First Nation. We’re all incredibly grateful,” she said.      Although there was not time for a distress call before the boat sank, one of the crew found a flare in the water and fired it. It was spotted by fishermen who raised the alarm by radio and then set off to rescue survivors. The radio call was also picked up in Tofino from where boats also put to sea.      Among the first on the scene was Clarence Smith, from the Ahoushat First Nation, who found the vessel mostly underwater with just its bow still above the waves, held up by trapped air. “We saw three people in the water. One guy was clinging to the boat so we picked him first. Then I heard these voices. There were two ladies in the water clinging to each other,” he said.      Smith said one of the women was pregnant and another person had a broken leg. The rescuers described people covered in diesel fuel and injured from being thrown against steel bulkheads as the sightseeing boat turned over.      Ken Lucas was working with Smith. He said one of the people they rescued was a member of the crew who said the boat had been hit by a wave. Fishermen described a heavy swell in the area during the rescue.      Francis Campbell, driving a water taxi, was also early on the scene. He pulled eight survivors from the frigid water. “It’s something you really can’t describe. It’s going to be held with me for the rest of my life,” he said.      The flare was also spotted by Peter Frank, who rescued people clinging to a life raft that had run on to rocks. “There was this one guy saying: ‘My wife, my wife. She doesn’t know how to swim. She isn’t a great swimmer,’” he told CBC.      “Some of them, when they hopped on the boat, it was just a sense of relief … I did my best to reassure them, to tell them they’re OK.”      About 30 boats responded to the rescue call alongside the Canadian coast guard. All 21 of the survivors had been picked up by the time the official vessels arrived. Ambulances met them on Tofino’s waterfront.      The fishermen also brought the dead to shore. Survivors were taken to Tofino’s small hospital. But it soon became overwhelmed and so local residents began taking the less serious cases into their homes.      Tofino’s mayor, Josie Osborne, praised the townspeople. “This community’s response has been nothing short of phenomenal,” she said. “People opened their homes to keep the survivors warm and comfort them.”       ||||| Media caption Marine investigator: \\"It is much too early to say what the causes and contributing factors of this accident might be\\"      A whale-watching boat which sank off the coast of Canada, killing five Britons, had no opportunity to send a Mayday call, its operator has said.

As well as interviewing survivors and other witnesses, the Transportation Safety Board will be looking into conditions on Sunday, as well as scouring the wreckage of the whale-watching boat for clues, and examining its maintenance history.      The vessel, still submerged, has been towed from the scene to a nearby island so the work can begin.      The weather at the time of the accident was reportedly benign but sailors familiar with these waters say powerful currents, rogue waves and rocks are all potential hazards, even when the conditions appear to be favourable.      A lengthy investigation will be difficult for some to bear. Those touched by this tragedy may well want to know as soon as possible how this could have happened to the same tour operator for a second time.      'Amazing response'      Greg Louie, chief councillor of the Ahousaht First Nation Elected Council, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that had the local community not responded to the accident so quickly \\"possibly everyone\\" could have drowned or died of hypothermia.      The incident could have been \\"a lot worse\\", Lt Cmdr Desmond James of the Canadian Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre in British Columbia said.      He added that 21 people would not have been rescued were it not for the \\"amazing response\\" by the local community.      Three of the victims were tourists on holiday from the UK, while two were UK nationals living in Canada - one woman from British Columbia and a man from Ontario.

The Transportation Safety Board has suggested that the vessel capsized when most of the passengers were gathered on the top deck, port side, which would have raised the center of gravity, affecting the vessel's stability. The sea conditions at the time encountered a wave that approached the vessel from the starboard quarter.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information:  - Abraham de Moivre (26 May 166727 November 1754) was a French mathematician known for de Moivre's formula, one of those that link complex numbers and trigonometry, and for his work on the normal distribution and probability theory. He was a friend of Isaac Newton, Edmond Halley, and James Stirling. Even though he faced religious persecution he remained a \\"steadfast Christian\\" throughout his life. Among his fellow Huguenot exiles in England, he was a colleague of the editor and translator Pierre des Maizeaux.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Huguenots (or ) is a designation for an ethnoreligious group of French Protestants that follow the Reformed tradition.  - A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.  - Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability, the analysis of random phenomena. The central objects of probability theory are random variables, stochastic processes, and events: mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in an apparently random fashion.  - In mathematics , Stirling 's approximation ( or Stirling 's formula ) is an approximation for factorials . It is a very powerful approximation , leading to accurate results even for small values of n. It is named after James Stirling , though it was first stated by Abraham de Moivre . The formula as typically used in applications is  ln ( n ! ) = n  ln ( n ) - n + O (  ln ( n ) ) ( in big O notation ) . The next term in the O ( ln ( n ) ) is 1/2ln ( 2n ) ; a more precise variant of the formula is therefore n !  sim  sqrt ( 2  pi n )  left (  frac ( n ) ( e )  right ) ^ n. It is also possible to give a version of Stirling 's formula with bounds valid for all positive integers n , rather than asymptotics : one has  sqrt ( 2  pi )  n ^ ( n +  frac12 ) e ^ ( - n )  le n !  le e  n ^ ( n +  frac12 ) e ^ ( - n ) for all positive integers n. Thus the ratio  frac ( n ! ) ( n ^ ( n +  frac12 ) e ^ ( - n ) ) is always between  2 = 2.5066 ... and e = 2.71828 ... . As an asymptotic formula , Stirling 's approximation has the property that the ratio  frac ( n ! ) (  sqrt ( 2  pi n )  left (  frac ( n ) ( e )  right ) ^ n ) approaches 1 as n grows to infinity .  - Trigonometry (from Greek \\"trignon\\", \\"triangle\\" and \\"metron\\", \\"measure\\") is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles. The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies.  - Pierre des Maizeaux, also spelled Desmaizeaux (c. 1666 or 1673June 1745), was a French Huguenot writer exiled in London, best known as the translator and biographer of Pierre Bayle.  - In mathematics, de Moivre's formula (also known as de Moivre's theorem and de Moivre's identity), named after Abraham de Moivre, states that for any complex number (and, in particular, for any real number) and integer it holds that  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.  - Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1642  20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, astronomer, and physicist (described in his own day as a \\"natural philosopher\\") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book \\"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\" (\\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\\"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.  - A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form , where and are real numbers and is the imaginary unit, satisfying the equation . In this expression, is the ' and is the ' of the complex number. If formula_1, then formula_2  - Quantity is a property that can exist as a magnitude or multitude. Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum.  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.    What entity does 'stirling's approximation' has the relation 'instance of' with? The answer is:","output":"'Stirling's approximation' has the relation 'instance of' with 'Mathematical formula'.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What facet of evolution by natural selection did Darwin focus on in his work that was presented to the Linnean Society?\\" is in \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Given the question: Besides Floyd, what does Rob find on the Japanese sub?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  While flying a routine mission for the U.S. Navy from his aircraft carrier, an emergency causes Lieutenant Robin \\"Rob\\" Crusoe to eject from his F-8 Crusader into the ocean. Crusoe drifts on the ocean in an emergency life raft for several days and nights until landing on an uninhabited island. Crusoe builds a shelter for himself, fashions new clothing out of available materials, and begins to scout the island, discovering an abandoned Japanese submarine from World War II. Scouring the submarine, Crusoe also discovers a NASA astrochimp named Floyd, played by Dinky.Using tools and blueprints found in the submarine, Crusoe and Floyd construct a Japanese pavilion, a golf course, and a mail delivery system for sending bottles containing missives to his fiancee out to sea. Soon after, Crusoe finds that the island is not entirely uninhabited when he encounters a beautiful island girl, whom he names Wednesday. Wednesday recounts that due to her unwillingness to marry, her chieftain father, Tanamashuhi, plans to sacrifice her and her sisters to Kaboona, an immense effigy on the island with whom he pretends to communicate. The day Tanamashu arrives on the island, Crusoe uses paraphernalia from the submarine to combat him, culminating in the destruction of the Kaboona statue. After the battle, Crusoe and Tanamashu make peace. But when Crusoe makes it known that he does not wish to marry Wednesday, he is forced to flee to avoid her wrath. Pursued by a mob of irate island women, Crusoe is spotted by a U.S. Navy helicopter and he and Floyd narrowly escape with their lives. Large crowds turn out for their arrival on an aircraft carrier deck, but Floyd steals all the limelight. The answer is:","output":"Based on the context provided, besides Floyd, Rob finds tools, blueprints, and paraphernalia from the Japanese submarine during his exploration on the uninhabited island.

Summarize: You can wash any pillow by hand as long as the label doesn't say that it's dry clean only. Memory foam and latex pillows usually can't be washed by hand and you'll only be able to spot clean them. If you have a memory foam or latex pillow, it's important to use a zippered pillow protector in addition to a pillowcase. This will extend the life of the pillow. Pull the pillow out of the pillowcase or unzip it first to remove it from the pillow protector. You can usually toss the pillowcase or protector in the washing machine or wash it by hand along with the pillow. If the pillowcase is stained, you may need to pre-treat it before you wash it. If you're using a sink, ensure that it's big enough to hold the pillow. Run very hot water and then put the plug in the sink or bathtub. Turn off the water once it's half full. Hot water will kill dust mites that are living in the pillow. You can use a standard laundry detergent even if you'll be washing the pillow by hand. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of laundry detergent for each pillow into the hot water. Then use your hand to swirl the water around vigorously. This should make the water become bubbly. To make it easier to rinse the pillow, consider using low-sudsing laundry detergent. Put the pillow into the hot soapy water and press down so it absorbs water. Then use your hands to squeeze the pillow and massage the filling. Continue to do this for several minutes so the soapy water reaches the middle of the pillow. If the water is too hot or the soap irritates your skin, wear a pair of gloves. Remove the pillow and squeeze out the soapy water. Then hold it under a faucet with running water and squeeze the pillow once it feels soaked. Keep it under the water until the pillow doesn't feel soapy.  Plan on rinsing the pillow for 1 to 2 minutes to completely remove the soap. Leaving soapy residue will stain the pillow and make it harder to dry. Turn off the water and squeeze the pillow with your hands. Then lay the wet pillow on a dry towel. Fold the towel over the pillow and press down to remove excess water. Although you can twist the pillow to get even more water out, you should avoid wringing out feather pillows since this will damage the feathers. the pillow in a dryer or hang it from a clothesline to air-dry. If you have a dryer and the care label on the pillow says to tumble dry it on low heat, put the pillow in the dryer. Add dryer balls to speed up the drying process and turn on the machine. If you don't have a dryer, clip the pillow to a clothesline that's in direct sunlight. Leave the pillow to hang until it's completely dry. The amount of time it takes to dry the pillow will depend on how hot it is and how thick your pillow is.","output":"You can wash most pillows by hand unless the label says it's dry clean only or if they're memory foam or latex pillows.

I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? The author believes that: Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. is bad luck  B. plucking grey hairs helps easy feelings of being driven crazy by them  C. not enough information  D. will make you have bald spots","output":"B. plucking grey hairs helps easy feelings of being driven crazy by them The beauty myth you're referring to is the belief that plucking a grey hair will cause more grey hairs to grow in its place. This is a common misconception and, as you've noted, is not based on any scientific evidence. Firstly, it's essential to understand why hair turns grey. Hair gets its color from melanin-producing cells called melanocytes, which are present in the hair follicles. As we age, these melanocytes gradually lose their ability to produce melanin, resulting in a decrease in hair color. When there is a complete loss of melanin in the hair shaft, it appears grey or white. This process of greying is natural, and its rate can vary depending on genetics, lifestyle, stress levels, and other factors. Now let's address the myth of plucking grey hairs. When you pluck a hair, you are only removing it from the hair follicle. This action does not affect the surrounding hair follicles or their ability to produce melanin. It also does not change the structure of the hair follicle to suddenly spawn multiple hairs in place of the one plucked. Therefore, plucking a grey hair will not cause seven more grey hairs to grow in its place. However, it's important to note that plucking hair can potentially damage the hair follicle, which may lead to hair growing back weaker, thinner, or not at all. In some cases, excessive plucking could contribute to the formation of bald spots or thinning hair. Still, this is related to the hair follicle's health and not the color of the hair. In conclusion, the notion that plucking a grey hair will cause more greys to grow in its place is a myth and should not deter you from removing them if it makes you feel better. However, it's essential to be gentle when plucking hairs and to consider alternative methods, such as coloring or trimming, if you find that you're plucking excessively to avoid causing potential damage to your hair follicles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: An Outstanding Reference and Very Useful Review: Overall this is an outstanding reference for anyone wanting to learn the elements of grass identification. It is not intended as a book for identifying any particular grass. I used it for 20 years in a class I taught in Agrostology (Grass Taxonomy), and especially for beginners it was very useful for learning grass structures needed for identification, and to a lesser degree for structures of plants like sedges. Grasses are beautiful, but incredibly complex, and it takes many books and years to be really comfortable with them. Books such as Harrington's smooth the way, and make the task of learning grasses fun. Highly recommended :-) Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review is positive.  Step 1: Analyze the text for phrases that indicate positivity or negativity. In the review, we can see phrases like \\"outstanding reference,\\" \\"very useful,\\" \\"smooth the way,\\" \\"make the task of learning grasses fun,\\" and \\"highly recommended.\\" All of these phrases have positive connotations. Step 2: Check if there are any negative phrases or criticisms. There isn't any criticism or negative phrases in the review. The reviewer is genuinely appreciative of Harrington's book aiding them in their 20 years of class instruction. Step 3: Weigh the positive and negative phrases and determine the overall sentiment. As we've only identified positive phrases and praise towards the book, we can conclude that the sentiment of the review is positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\"? The answer is:","output":"1.

Court papers show that the state sent Fey a bill in February indicating that she owed the 79,000 for a period covering Nov. 20, 2012 through Feb. 2, 2014. The bill was sent to 125 W. 55 St. An aide said that is the address of Fey’s accountant, who moved out of those offices six years ago. Fey’s spokeswoman Cara Tripicchio said the “30 Rock” star “has proper and current insurance covering all employees and at no time has worker's compensation payment lapsed. “The confusion seems to be a result of a clerical error with the NYS WC Board,” she said. “They have been sending notifications to an old address for an accountant that moved offices almost six years ago.” Tripicchio said state officials could have “avoided this unnecessary situation,” if they had just requested “verification of paperwork, that does exist and is readily available” to prove Fey has a current insurance policy on her employees. There was no immediate response to Fey's claim from the governor's press office.","output":"TV star Tina Fey was told by a court in New York that she needs to pay 79,000 for not having workers compensation insurance.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of how this perturbation influences the second effect mentioned. 1. Teenagers are part of the general population that will eventually grow into adulthood. 2. As teenagers become adults, they are likely to have children and contribute to the overall growth of the population. 3. If more teenagers die young, there are fewer people transitioning into adulthood. 4. With fewer people transitioning into adulthood, there are subsequently fewer adults to have children and reproduce. 5. This leads to fewer babies being born, as the number of potential parents has decreased. Therefore, the perturbation of more teenagers dying young has a direct effect on the second effect mentioned – fewer babies being born.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Appliqué is a method of design where one pattern is sewn top of another. You can buy applique templates from a craft store if you don't want to design your own. You can also find patterns in quilting books. If you use a quilt pattern, make sure you resize it when copying so that it fits your greeting card.   To make a paper appliqué card, you will need the following:  One 4.25 by 5.5 inches (10.8 cm × 14.0 cm) card blank Colored cardstock Decorative paper A fine-tip black marker Glue Scissors A ruler A pencil and eraser What kind of card are you making? If you're making a birthday card, you might consider making a card with a cake, or party hats. Try to customize the card to reflect the interests of who you are giving it to.   Make a space scene with astronauts and planets, or make a card with cars and a racetrack. Make a card with snowmen for Christmas, turkeys for Thanksgiving, or clovers for St. Patrick's Day.  Your only limit is your imagination. Pick three different patterns for your card. You'll need a pattern for the appliqué pieces, a pattern for the background, and a pattern for the card mat.  Select a variety of solid colors and patterns. Depending on the complexity of your design, you may want to choose more than three types of decorative paper.  Whatever you decide to go with, make sure all the colors and patterns match. For example, if you're making an underwater scene, pick a variety of blues for your solid colors. Choose patterns that mimic waves or fish scales. If you're following a template, trace the shapes on the back of the your decorative paper. If you're drawing your own shapes, draw them lightly in pencil on the back of the decorative paper. Once you're happy with the designs, cut out the shapes. Since you're working with paper, you won't actually be sewing anything. To give it an authentic appliqué look, take your fine-tip marker and add stitch marks around the border of the shapes. Choose a solid color for your card mat and cut it a little smaller than your card blank. It should almost cover the entire front of the card, but you should still see a little white border.  To make the background, take a patterned piece of decorative paper and cut it to about 5 by 3.75 inches (12.7 cm × 9.5 cm). Using your fine-tip marker, add stitch marks to the background pattern.  Glue the mat to the card. Remember to leave a small border of white from the card blank. Then, glue the background to the card mat. Once the card mat and the background are glued to the card blank, start arranging your shapes to build a scene. Take some time to make sure you have everything arranged where you want it.  If you find that you need to add more shapes to flesh out your scene, grab more decorative paper and start cutting. Don't forget to add the stitch marks! Once everything is to your liking, glue your shapes down.","output":"The article provides a step-by-step guide on creating a paper appliqué greeting card by selecting patterns and materials, cutting and arranging shapes, and giving an authentic appliqué appearance with stitch marks using a fine-tip marker."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because  Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by  Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to  Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies.  Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.  Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of  Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the  Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case,  Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.  Question: \\"Why did  Bin Laden tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave Sudan?\\" Answer: \\"Because the Libyan government was not sheltering them anymore\\" Is this answer to the question correct? OPTIONS: (A). no; (B). yes;","output":"(A). no The answer to the question is incorrect because it was the Sudanese government, not the Libyan government, that was no longer going to protect the Libyans in Bin Laden's Islamic army. The Sudanese government advised Bin Laden of their intention to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies, which is why Bin Laden told the Libyans they had to leave Sudan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This is my first official on-line review and I am charged with \\"electrical ecstasy\\" after having chosen \\"Meatball Machine\\" as my first endeavor. This is a review, so I'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion. I mean, this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic TETSUO! So what if it's not all original? I own both of these films and though Tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch, Meatball Machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance. Meatball Machine is as elaborate in it's story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore. Thank you Jesus for Japanese Cinema! Simply put, the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 or so. I could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end. This time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring. In this film human bodies are host to Aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood. Humans become flesh eating cyborgs!!! There's more!!! Fight scenes!! Great Music!! Great point-of-view shots! Decent acting by the woman Cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). The fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times. Oh, and did I forget to mention it's a Love story! Wow, I hate love stories but this takes the cake! I can't wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces. Sadly, I took time to write this review because I'm afraid most friends and family wont understand Meatball Machine. The truth is America as a whole is not prepared for Meatball Machine. Lastly, My wife walked in while I was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless. Normally she says something like \\"why are you watching that junk?\\" This time she had nothing to say. I was glad!  This is not junk.

The inhabitants of Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Earth II ,however, was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes.  But I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Write an article based on this summary: Plans to axe IVF treatment for new couples in part of Essex is an \\"insult\\" to those seeking fertility treatment, a patient body has said. Article:","output":"Title: Axing IVF Treatment in Essex Sparks Outrage Among Fertility Patients Introduction Recent plans to terminate NHS-funded IVF treatment for new couples in parts of Essex have left numerous patients, campaigners, and medical professionals in the region frustrated and concerned. The decision, which many have deemed an \\"insult\\" to those looking for fertility aid, has led to an outcry among local patient bodies and has raised questions about the future of healthcare services in the UK. Background In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is a groundbreaking technique that has revolutionized reproductive medicine, offering a lifeline to many couples struggling with infertility. Since its development in the late 1970s, IVF has helped millions of people worldwide become parents, transforming countless lives in the process. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) has been offering subsidized or free IVF treatment for eligible couples for several decades, making this vital service accessible to a broad range of patients. However, the recent proposal in Essex to cut IVF funding for new couples seeking treatment has taken many by surprise and brought the conversation around access to fertility services back into the spotlight. This move has reignited debates on rationing healthcare services and raised concerns about the potentially detrimental effects on couples already facing emotional and physical challenges. Patients and Advocates in Essex Respond For many affected by this decision, the axing of IVF treatment in Essex is an \\"insult\\" to those maintaining hope of conceiving through medical intervention. The patient body in the region has made it abundantly clear that it feels let down by these proposed changes, fearing that countless residents will be impacted and left with no options for conceiving children. Healthcare professionals specializing in reproductive medicine have also added their voices to the mix, stating that cutting off access to an essential service like IVF is a backward step. Furthermore, they argue that the decision will likely result in higher levels of emotional distress among patients, adding to the increased mental health challenges witnessed throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Crunching the Numbers While it's difficult to predict the exact number of couples affected by this proposed cut, it's clear that a sizable portion of the Essex population stands to lose access to essential fertility services. The loss of this crucial treatment avenue may also disproportionately impact lower-income families, robbing them of the chance to become parents. This potential financial bias only heightens existing divides based on wealth, further limiting access to care for those struggling to make ends meet. The Broader Context Though it is still too early to tell whether the decision to axe IVF treatment in Essex is part of a wider trend, it does raise concerns about the future of fertility treatment and access to healthcare services more broadly. Around the globe, healthcare systems continue to face pressure from increasing populations, stretched budgets, and divergent expectations. The repercussions of limiting access to IVF and other fertility treatments are not limited to emotional stress, as they extend to social and economic consequences as well. If this trend continues, it could signal a shift toward more restricted access to healthcare, with untold implications for future generations. Conclusion The recent decision to terminate IVF treatment in Essex highlights the critical importance of equitable access to healthcare and the challenges many individuals face in securing essential medical support. As patients, advocates, and healthcare professionals push back against these proposed changes, the ongoing debate will no doubt remain a focal point of healthcare conversations in the UK and beyond. In the coming months and years, it will be crucial for stakeholders to work together to address the burgeoning crisis, balancing the need for cost efficiency with the obligation to provide accessible and quality care to those in need. The choice to axe IVF treatment in Essex serves as a stark reminder that, in an increasingly complex and globalized healthcare landscape, many difficult decisions lie ahead."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who is assumed to have attacked the professor's fiance?, using the article: The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted.  Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer.  As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Professor Kristan is assumed to have attacked the professor's fiance in an entranced state. The mob of villagers initially assumes Zan is culpable for the attack on the fiance, but Kristan ultimately confesses to the murders, including the attack on his fiance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Their migration began during the end of the 1970s and continued throughout the 1980s as a result of the following factors: 1. Political instability: The Sandinista revolution, which took place in 1979, toppled the Somoza dictatorship and left many Nicaraguans fearing for their safety and wellbeing. People who opposed the Sandinistas, the new ruling party, were particularly inclined to migrate in order to escape persecution and further conflict in their home country. 2. The Contra War: Throughout the 1980s, the United States supported the Contras, a rebel group fighting the Sandinista government. This counter-revolutionary war continued until 1988, with battles and skirmishes creating an atmosphere of danger, chaos, and insecurity for Nicaraguans. This, in turn, prompted many Nicaraguans to leave their homeland and seek refuge in safer countries, such as the United States. 3. Economic collapse: The persistent conflict and political instability in Nicaragua during the Sandinista era took a heavy toll on the country's economy. Inflation, unemployment, and dismal conditions led to a decline in the overall quality of life, ultimately driving many Nicaraguans to migrate in search of better opportunities and improved living conditions. In summary, Nicaraguans migrated to the United States primarily to escape the political instability and economic hardship that plagued their home country during the late 1970s and 1980s.

Frank Chambers a drifter, stops at a depression-era rural California diner for a meal and ends up working there. The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on one another, he tries only Cora for the crime. Although they turn against each other, a clever ploy from Cora's lawyer, Katz, prevents Cora's full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor.

The man was shot with what appeared to be a non-lethal weapon, witnesses said.      Police used batons and non-lethal projectiles to disperse the crowd, which in turn threw bottles and cans at officers and chanted, \\"Whose streets?

A citywide tactical alert was issued after 9 p.m. Thursday after Los Angeles police officers in riot gear were pelted with rocks and bottles by protestors near 5th and Spring streets.      Officials say four officers suffered minor injuries including a female officer who suffered a concussion.      At least some of the protestors were associated with the Occupy LA movement which promoted Chalk Walk on their twitter page and may have organized “Free Chalk For Free Speech.”      According to posts on the @OccupyLA Twitter account, the incident began after police confronted people drawing on the sidewalks with chalk.      Amanda Burden, reporting for CBS2 and KCAL9, spoke to one witness on the ground. He said “people were just drawing on the ground. And then riot police moved in. A girl was drawing hopscotch. A guy next to her wrote ‘I want peace.’ The next thing, they started arresting people.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Ministers are considering applying for an exemption to European Union laws which prohibit electro-fishing. They have launched on consultation on the proposal. Razor clams - or spoots - are increasingly in demand by overseas markets and fishermen can command a high price for their catch. An environmental group said law enforcement agencies had \\"lost the battle\\" to stamp out illegal electro-fishing. And Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing admitted that Marine Scotland had found it difficult to clamp down on the activities of some fishermen. Mr Ewing said: \\"Electro-fishing is currently illegal in Scotland and Marine Scotland Compliance has taken a range of measures to tackle this illegal activity. \\"Enforcement has proved to be very difficult, and changes need to be made to either make it easier to enforce the current law or, if electro-fishing is to be legalised, to ensure any electro-fishing is undertaken safely and sustainably in a properly regulated environment. \\"As a result of this advice and extensive consultation with the industry, we have now decided to consult on proposals to amend the current law to allow electro-fishing to be a legal method for catching razor clams. \\"This is an issue that has evoked much interest and debate. This is why I would urge all those with an interest, in particular from fishermen and people in coastal communities where such fisheries might be conducted, to respond to the consultation.\\" The move comes after a report by Marine Scotland found that electro-fishing had a lower environmental impact than methods like dredging and it had little short-term effect on other species. As part of the practice of electro-fishing, electrodes shock razor fish in the seabed, causing them to rise up. At that point they are easily collected by divers. It is the \\"least worst option\\", according to RSPB Scotland. Alex Kinnimouth, the charity's head of marine policy in Scotland, said: \\"The status quo of an illegal, unregulated and unreported razor clam fishery is clearly unacceptable. \\"Marine Scotland and the police seem to have lost the battle to stamp it out and so there is a real risk that this highly efficient fishing method could cause 'spoots' to be wiped out in areas that are being repeatedly targeted. \\"Alternative capture methods such as dredging are highly disruptive to the seabed. \\"So on the basis of the most recent published research, a closely regulated fishery using electricity, perhaps on a pilot basis, with tight controls on method, quantity of catch, and where it can occur could be seen as the least worst option.\\" Food journalist and campaigner Alex Renton told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that he believed the practice was extremely dangerous. \\"When you put enormous voltages of electricity down on to beaches in Scotland, you can cause enormous damage. \\"And the reports say that the other fish - and of course beaches are where young fish grow - suffer epileptic fits, haemorrhages, their spines break.\\" High-profile chefs Andrew Fairlie and Tom Kitchin have also voiced their opposition to the \\"idiocy\\" of uncontrolled electro-fishing. In a letter published three years ago, they warned that, unless the practice was done very carefully, it could kill \\"nearly everything else in the vicinity\\" as well as the razor fish. The consultation was welcomed by the Scottish Conservatives whose fisheries spokesman, Finlay Carson, called for further scientific research into the sustainability of the razor clam beds. He added: \\"I also hope that every effort will be made to seek as many views and expert opinions as possible during the consultation. \\"It's imperative that the potential positive economic impact on coastal communities from razor clam fishing is founded on proper scientific research with sustainability as a primary concern.\\" The Scottish government has previously taken a hard line with fishermen caught using the technique. In May 2014, it announced tougher licensing measures in a bid to clamp down on the illegal practice. In the two years before that announcement, 11 vessels were issued with a fixed penalty of up to Â£2,000 for electro-fishing. Diver Graeme Mackie drowned during an electro-fishing expedition for razor clams in the Firth of Forth in 2011. Dunfermline Sheriff Court heard that there was no evidence that the electric current directly caused Mr Mackie's death. Skipper Ronald MacNeil was ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work after admitting safety failings.","output":"Scotland is thinking about allowing electro-fishing for razor clams, even though it is illegal in the European Union. People want more razor clams from the sea, so fishermen can get good money for them. But some people say electro-fishing can hurt other sea animals, like breaking the spines of young fish. Scotland's government is asking people what they think about allowing electro-fishing, because it could be better than other ways of getting clams from the sea."},{"instruction":"What key details about gustavo gómez  can be extracted from the following bio?

A good book may be among the best of friends. It is the same today that it always was, and it will never change. It is the most patient and cheerful of companions.

Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"No Russians were allowed in Israel.\\" This statement suggests that no Russian citizens were granted permission to enter and reside in Israel. However, as mentioned earlier, the premise clearly states that there are 1 million Russian immigrants in Israel. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, as the presence of Russian immigrants confirms that they were allowed entry into the country. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the premise, we cannot support the hypothesis that \\"No Russians were allowed in Israel.\\" The presence of a significant number of Russian immigrants in Israel directly disproves the statement. It is important to accurately analyze and evaluate the information available before drawing conclusions, especially when the conclusions may impact the understanding of complex social and political situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Joy Division were an English rock band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester. Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bass player Peter Hook, and drummer Stephen Morris.  - Factory Records was a Manchester-based British independent record label, started in 1978 by Tony Wilson and Alan Erasmus, which featured several prominent musical acts on its roster such as Joy Division, New Order, A Certain Ratio, The Durutti Column, Happy Mondays, Northside, and (briefly) Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and James. Like the label 4AD Records, Factory Records used a creative team (most notably record producer Martin Hannett and graphic designer Peter Saville) which gave the label and the artists recording for it a particular sound and image. The label employed a unique cataloguing system that gave a number not just to its musical releases, but to artwork and other objects, as well.  - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402.  - A Certain Ratio are an English post-punk band formed in 1977 in Wythenshawe, Manchester. While originally part of the punk rock movement, they soon added funk and dance elements to their sound.  - Anthony Howard \\"Tony\\" Wilson (20 February 1950  10 August 2007) was an English record label owner, radio and television presenter, nightclub manager, impresario and journalist for Granada Television and the BBC.  - The Durutti Column are an English post-punk band formed in 1978 in Manchester, England.

Rowetta joined the band as a guest vocalist in 1990.  - Ad Infinitum were a musical group which were part of the Factory Records label . They were formed by Lindsay Reade , who was married to manager Tony Wilson at the time . They were composed of members of the Stockholm Monsters and New Order , bassist Peter Hook . Rather than continuing ad infinitum , the group only recorded one single \`\` Telstar '' , a cover of the Joe Meek song . It was released as a single , the B - side being \`\` Telstar in a Piano Bar '' . This single was the first record with a holographic cover .  - Alan Erasmus was the co-founder of Factory Records with Tony Wilson, which signed Joy Division and Happy Mondays. He also co-founded The Haçienda with Wilson, Rob Gretton and New Order, a famous Manchester nightclub which closed down in Summer 1997. As an actor, Erasmus appeared in several roles in the 1970s including ITV Playhouse and Play for Today, wherein he played minor roles.  - Peter Hook (born 13 February 1956) is an English singer, songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist and record producer.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: ducks dvd Product review: The case of the dvd was very damaged. Luckily the dvd itself was not damaged, but I wouldn't be surprised if others were. A:","output":"After analyzing the given review, it appears that the chances of buying the product would likely decrease due to several factors presented in the review. There are various reasons to support this conclusion: 1. Damaged case: The reviewer mentions that the case of the DVD was \\"very damaged,\\" which raises concerns about the packaging and handling of the product during shipping and delivery. A damaged case can be an indicator of poor quality control or inadequate shipping protection. 2. Risk of damage to the DVD: While the reviewer states that their specific DVD was not damaged, they also mention that they \\"wouldn't be surprised if others were.\\" This suggests that the condition of the case might have been severe enough to potentially damage the DVD itself, which is a crucial element of the overall product experience. 3. Quality concerns: The mentioned issues in the review could raise concerns about the overall quality and care with which the product is treated by the manufacturer or the seller. Damages to the product, even if they don't affect the functionality directly, could still lead potential buyers to question the durability and reliability of the product. 4. Customer satisfaction: Reviews are essential sources of information for potential buyers to gauge the experiences of others who have purchased and used the product. A negative review, as is the case here, can dissuade potential customers from buying the product due to fears of having similar experiences with a damaged or potentially unusable product. 5. Other reviews: Considering that people tend to share their negative experiences more readily than positive ones, this review might influence potential buyers to look for alternative similar products that have better reviews or fewer reports of damaged packaging and potential for damaged DVDs. 6. Price and alternative options: The mentioned issues in the review could lead potential buyers to weigh their options, considering the price of the product and the availability of alternative options in the market. If the price of this product is higher than its competitors, or if potential buyers find similar products with better overall reviews or expressed satisfaction, they might choose to purchase those alternatives. In conclusion, the mentioned review would likely decrease the chances of a potential buyer purchasing the product due to concerns related to the damaged packaging, potential risks of damage to the DVD, overall quality concerns, and the impression it leaves on customer satisfaction. As a result, potential customers might be inclined to look for alternative options with better reviews or reassurances of product safety and quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. A culture's values can be mirrored by its humor. Humor has been evaluated by many great minds such as Thomas Hobbes, who, in \\"On Nature\\", disliked humor, \\"Laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden thought of feeling far better than others.\\" He thought humor to be a negative quality of human narrow-mindedness.  However, Mordechai Gordon, Ph. D of Education, insists, \\"Humor allows us to view the world from an angle that is amusing rather than serious.\\" I agree with Gordon. Learning to look at the world through humor is important.  In the United States, every four years an election occurs. Without humor as a way to express their feelings, how else would Americans keep from clawing their eyes out and going the way of lemming? Television shows like \\"The Daily Show\\" have become important parts of American culture. They are mothering the masses by metaphorically airplane-ing politics into our mouths. They make politics fun.  Of course, politics is only one type of humor. Social humor helps people through the twists and turns of the human condition. American pop culture promotes an unhealthy self- image. On the topic of self-image, Hari Kondabolu stands out. He has a joke about the popular musical group \\"The Pussycat Dolls\\", describing their hit song \\"Don't Cha\\" as a negative representation of women. He points out an obvious offence in American culture.  A study from Loyola University of Maryland has shown that humor is one determining factor for selecting a mating partner. Amongst other things, mates look for an outstanding funny bone in a potential partner.  Of course, humor is not always used for good purposes. Humor can be linked to vulgarity and racism, but, like everything else, it has potential to unite human beings by allowing us to laugh at ourselves, our failures and our connection with one another.  Though 1ife may seem tough and depressing at times, all I have to do is look in the mirror at my increased wrinkles to know that there is a comedy out there that even Chaplin wasn't aware of.  With that in mind, remember to laugh with humanity and sometimes at humanity. Answer this series of questions: 1. Is humor important in the opinion of the author? 2.

The author sees humor as a mechanism to understand and deal with the world in a less serious and more enjoyable way. 2. The study showing that we look for humor when dating was done at the Loyola University of Maryland. 3. A culture's values, attitudes, and belief systems are mirrored by its expressions of humor. 4. Thomas Hobbes, the philosopher, didn't like humor. In his writing \\"On Nature\\", he expressed his disapproval and negative outlook towards humor. 5. Hobbes thought of humor as \\"nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden thought of feeling far better than others\\". Essentially, he saw it as a sign of narrow-minded superiority and derogatory sentiment. 6. Mordechai Gordon, Ph.D of Education, said that humor helps us see things less seriously. He pointed out that humor provides an amusing perspective on life and the world around us. 7. In America, politicians are elected every four years. 8. Yes, according to the author, laughter is important in this process. Laughter, presumably induced by humor in political satire, provides a way for Americans to deal with and express their thoughts and feelings about politics. 9. \\"The Daily Show\\", an American late-night talk and news satire television program, provides an outlet for the mentioned political humor. 10. Hari Kondabolu, a public speaker and comic, made jokes about a certain song. 11. The song's name is \\"Don't Cha\\". 12. The song \\"Don't Cha\\" is by The Pussycat Dolls. 13. According to the author, humor is not always used to help. It can sometimes have negative consequences as well. 14. In the author's view, less positive aspects of humor might include it being used to promote or reinforce harmful stereotypes or offensive behavior. 15. The author suggests that humor might be linked to vulgarity and racism, implying that it can sometimes be used to either support or diffuse disparaging views or discriminatory practices. 16. In his reflection, the author sees his increased wrinkles - a sign of ageing and life experiences. 17. The wrinkles remind him of the ongoing comedy in life, a sort of humor that even legendary comedian Charlie Chaplin wasn't aware of, as per the author. 18. Besides ourselves, we should also laugh at our collective failures and our shared human condition. This suggests the author's belief in humor as a social bonding tool, uniting people through shared laughter despite, or perhaps because of, our common imperfections and mishaps."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If it's a wash-off face mask, it typically requires rinsing with water to remove it once it has dried. Peel-off masks can be peeled off and may not need water for removal, but it's still a good idea to rinse the face to get rid of any remaining residue. Overnight masks or leave-on masks usually do not require rinsing until the next morning. For sheet masks, you should not rinse your face; instead, gently pat the remaining essence into your skin. Step-by-step justification: - Determine the type of face mask - Assess the instructions for removal - Provide the appropriate response based on the face mask type 2. How many times should I use a face mask? The frequency of using a face mask depends on the type of mask and your skin type. In general, using a face mask 1-3 times a week is recommended for most people. However, if you have sensitive skin, you may want to use a mask less often, like once a week. It's essential to follow the instructions on the specific face mask product and adjust based on your skin's needs and reactions.

As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.  I am facing a new situation today: Students learned about protozoa in school this week. Dan and Jim were interested and read more on the subject. Dan read more about predatory protozoa, while Jim read more about herbivore protozoa.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which student read more about protozoa preying upon single-celled organisms? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, the correct answer to the question is that Dan read more about protozoa preying upon single-celled organisms.  To elaborate, protozoa can be classified into different functional groups depending on their feeding habits and roles in the ecosystem. Some protozoa are predators, consuming other single-celled organisms, like bacteria. These predatory protozoa help maintain the balance of bacterial populations in nature. On the other hand, herbivore protozoa primarily feed on algae, functioning as primary consumers in aquatic ecosystems. In the new situation, Dan and Jim both learned about protozoa in school and chose to investigate further into the topic. Dan decided to focus on predatory protozoa, which prey on other single-celled organisms. Thus, it is Dan who read more about protozoa preying upon single-celled organisms. Jim, on the other hand, concentrated on herbivore protozoa, which primarily feed on algae and have different ecological roles compared to predatory protozoa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which came first, University of Erfurt or monastic schools? Context: European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century. The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries.","output":"From the given context, monastic schools came first.

Robert Neville, M.D. is a scientist based in Los Angeles. As he begins to succumb to the plague himself, he injects himself with an experimental vaccine, rendering himself immune. By 1977, Neville believes he is the plague's only immune survivor. Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the deserted city of Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of \\"The Family\\", a cult of plague victims who were turned into nocturnal albino mutants. The Family seeks to destroy all technology and kill Neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for humanity's downfall. At night, living atop a fortified apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in his own home. One day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a woman who quickly runs away. He pursues her outside but later decides he is hallucinating and dismisses the sighting. On another day, the Family finally captures Neville. After a summary trial he is found guilty of heresy by the family's leader, Jonathan Matthias, a former news anchorman. Neville is sentenced to death and nearly burned at the stake in Dodger Stadium. He is rescued by Lisa, the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and Dutch, a former medical student. Lisa and Dutch are part of a group of survivors, some of whom are children. Although their youth has given them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it and will eventually succumb to mutation. Neville realizes that even if it is possible to duplicate the original vaccine, it would take years to salvage humanity. However, he believes it may be possible to extend his immunity to others by creating a serum from his own body.

Main, of Rokemarsh near Wallingford, pleaded not guilty to a further charge of arson with intent to endanger life. South Oxfordshire District Council's office, an undertakers and a thatched cottage were set alight on 15 January. At their peak, 27 crews were tackling the fires in Rokemarsh and Crowmarsh Gifford which started within 10 minutes of each other shortly after 03:00 GMT. No-one was hurt. In the first blaze, Jean Gladstone, 80, escaped unhurt from her thatched cottage on Quakers Corner in Rokemarsh. Minutes later, a second fire was reported at Howard Chadwick Funeral Service in the village of Crowmarsh Gifford. The third blaze engulfed the nearby council offices. No explanation as to why Main started the fires was given in court, though at the time there were suggestions it was in connection with a planning row. It was revealed in court that he has mental health issues. A decision on whether a trial will proceed over the count of arson with intent to endanger life will be made next month. He has been remanded in custody. Main set the fires using gas cylinders. The burnt-out wreckage of a car that ploughed in to the council building moments before it became engulfed in flames was found in the foyer. Gas canisters were found at all three fire sites as well as at Main's home. Four hundred staff worked at the offices. The fire completely destroyed the planning department and badly affected the environmental health department and housing department. Planning applications and comments submitted in the days before the fire were destroyed and had to be resubmitted The complex also housed about two-thirds of the Vale of the White Horse District Council's staff. The authorities' websites were also temporarily offline after the blaze. The funeral parlour reopened last month following Â£100,000 of repair work.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Where were sixty thousand more were sold in 2005? is inside the article: The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro – Line 5 – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost.  However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as US19,572,000.Local solutions – such as the proposed Metro extension line and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay – may improve the traffic congestion around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network.  Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) on the streets and highways of Caracas.  There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, a city should allocate 20% of its public area to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% is allocated. In 2004, fifty thousand new vehicles were sold in Caracas. In 2005, sixty thousand more were sold, and as of November, 2006, seventy thousand more had been sold.

Plot: Act 1:   Edie (early 30s, artist) arrives in the small coastal town of Sundown after her paintings are exhibited at a local art gallery. She is a free-spirited, independent woman, who is admired for her unique artistic talent. In town, Edie rents a room above the town's general store. The store's owner, Tom (mid-30s), is a serious, hard-working man who has been living in Sundown his entire life. He takes care of his disabled younger sister, Mary, who also works in the general store. Act 2: Edie and Tom start spending time together as she discovers the beauty of the town and its people, which inspires her art. They grow closer, but their opposite personalities initially seem incompatible. Edie becomes the talk of the town as she paints a beautiful mural on the side of the general store, which brings in tourists and helps business. By witnessing Tom's devotion and love for his sister, Edie begins to let her guard down, and their relationship deepens. However, the plot completes a climax when Edie is offered a significant contract by a renowned gallery in a big city. Tom is reluctant to hold her back, realizing that this could possibly be a life-changing opportunity for her. Edie and Tom have a heated argument about their future, leading Edie to choose her career over her love for Tom. Act 3: As time passes, Edie's career skyrockets, making her a famous artist. But as she interacts with the deceitful and materialistic world of high society, she starts to feel empty and lost. Tom, still in Sundown, expands his business and gains the resources needed to fully support Mary's medical needs. One summer after a few years, Edie decides to return to Sundown, hoping to find solace. She is shocked to find the town flourishing, largely due to the tourists her mural on the general store continues to attract. She learns that Tom has never stopped loving her and still follows her progress from afar. Final Scene: As the sun sets on the longest day, there's a solar eclipse that beautifully aligns with Edie's mural. The townspeople gather to watch the event. As Edie looks up at the darkened sky, she sees Tom standing next to her, looking up too. Time stops, and it's clear that they never stopped loving each other. Edie, now realizing the value of life beyond her career, decides to find a balance between her work in the big city and her life with Tom in Sundown. She reaches out to hold his hand, and he smiles down at her. As the eclipse ends and light returns, the film fades out, symbolizing the beginning of a new chapter in their lives together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Article: Play is the basic business of childhood, and more and more in recent years research has shown the great importance of play in the development of a human being.From earliest infancy  , every child needs opportunity and the right material for play, and the main tools of play are toys.The main function of toys is to suggest, encourage and assist play.To succeed in this, they must be good toys, which children will play with often, and will come back to again and again.Therefore, it is important to choose suitable toys for different stages of a child's development. In recent years research on infant development has shown that the standard a child is likely to reach, within the range of his inherited abilities, is largely determined in the first three years of his life.So a baby's ability to benefit from the right play materials should not be underestimated.A baby who is encouraged, talked to and shown things and played with, has the best chance of growing up successfully. The next stage, from three to five years old, curiosity knows no bounds.Every type of suitable toy should be made available to the child, for trying out, experimenting and learning, for discovering his own particular ability. Bricks and jigsaws and construction toys; painting, scribbling and making things; sand and water play; toys for imaginative and pretending play; the first social games for learning to play and get on with others. By the third stage of play development--from five to seven or eight years old-- the child is at school.But for a few more years play is still the best way of learning, at home or at school.It is easier to see which type of toys the child most enjoys. Until the age of seven or eight, play and work mean much the same to a child.But once reading has been mastered, then books and school become the main source of learning.Toys are still interesting and valuable, which lead up to new hobbies, but their significance has changed --to a child of nine or ten years old, toys and games mean, as to adults, relaxation and fun.

Pick them up and be sure to pick them up for your kit (not \\" for spotting \\" them). Even if you choose to catch a frog without hand-held tools, it's a good idea to switch to the forearm grip, which is where you grip your bullfrog's feet.; [B]. You can also use a pumice stone or a hand-saw if you prefer to. If you're not absolutely certain if you're catching a bullfrog, contact your local pet store, hardware store, or fish shops to see if they can help you.; [C]. Alternatively, you may want to consider other tools, such as a frog gig. A frog gig is especially good for catching larger bullfrogs.; [D]. Use hand sanitizer for washing all surface surfaces. Frog frogs will love mud and salt; go with a non-hewned skin.;. The answer should be","output":"Option C: Alternatively, you may want to consider other tools, such as a frog gig. A frog gig is especially good for catching larger bullfrogs. This traditional tool typically has several prongs or tines attached to a long pole and can be thrust into the water to capture the frog without touching it. Frog gigs are sometimes referred to as \\"frog catchers\\" and provide you with a larger range in terms of reach when compared to using your hands. Moreover, if you're in deeper waters or navigating an area with a lot of vegetation, a frog gig can make the process of catching a bullfrog much more comfortable and less complicated for you. Before deciding on whether to use a frog gig or not, make sure to check your local laws and regulations regarding the use of this tool, as some areas might have restrictions in place for the protection of the local frog population. If you are permitted to use a frog gig, ensure that you handle the bullfrogs you catch with care and respect, and release them back into their habitat if your goal is to simply observe or catch-and-release. In addition to a frog gig, another tool you could consider using is a fishing net specifically designed for capturing amphibians. Look for a net that has soft and gentle mesh material, so as not to harm the skin of the bullfrogs you catch. This option also grants you greater reach and minimizes the risk of harming the frog during the catching process. Patience and being observant are essential when attempting to catch a bullfrog. Observe the movement of the frogs in their habitat from a distance before attempting to catch them, as bullfrogs can be quite sensitive to disturbances and are generally quick to respond when sensing a threat. By taking note of their habits and patterns and combining that knowledge with the appropriate tools, you'll increase your chances of successfully catching a bullfrog while also ensuring their safety and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Our helper knew that sometimes, our skin can get little boo-boos like blisters. Blisters are small, bubbly friends that can appear on our skin and can sometimes hurt. Today, let's learn how to keep our skin smiling and prevent those boo-boos from happening! 1. Wear shoes that fit you well: Just like how Goldilocks liked her porridge \\"just right,\\" our feet love shoes that fit just right too! When our shoes are the perfect size for our feet, it means our toes can wiggle properly, and our feet feel comfortable all day long. When we wear shoes that are too small or big, our feet can get sad and might end up with boo-boos or blisters. So always remember to pick shoes that fit nicely, and your feet will be happy! 2. Keep your feet dry: Our feet love being dry and cozy! When they are wet for too long, it can make them sad and give them a higher chance of getting blisters. When you put on your socks, make sure they're dry. If you step in a puddle or your feet get sweaty, change into dry socks when you get a chance. This helps your feet feel nice and comfy! 3. Apply moleskin to tender areas: Moleskin is a soft, furry piece of fabric that our helper loves! Place it on the tender or sensitive part of your feet to help protect the skin from rubbing against your shoes. It's like giving your feet a warm, fuzzy hug! 4. Stop the action that caused the blister: If you notice your skin is starting to feel irritated or you see a small blister forming, it's time to take a break! Just like when you take a break from playing when you're tired, it's good to stop doing the action that caused the irritation. Once you've had a break, you can check to see what might have caused the blister and make sure it doesn't happen again. 5. Wear gloves when using your hands: Just like our feet, our hands also need protection from blisters. Wearing gloves helps keep our skin safe while we use our hands to do activities, like playing with toys, gardening, or even riding a bike. There are many types of gloves to pick from, so find the ones that fit your hands best, and your skin will surely thank you! By following these tips, we can keep our feet and hands happy and prevent blisters from bothering us. So, let's remember to wear shoes that fit, keep our feet dry, use moleskin for extra protection, stop activities that cause irritation, and wear gloves when needed.

What is the correct answer to this question? pick from the following. (1). electrical energy to light and heat energy (2). light energy to electrical and mechanical energy (3). heat energy to electrical and light energy (4). electrical energy to mechanical and heat energy...A:","output":"The correct answer to this question is (1). Electrical energy to light and heat energy.  Here's an expanded explanation: When an electric lamp is turned on, the energy transformation that occurs is the conversion of electrical energy into light energy and heat energy. This process involves the flow of electricity along a circuit, which is then absorbed by the lamp's filament.  Electricity is essentially a form of energy derived from the flow of electric charge. In an ideal lamp or light bulb, this electric current would entirely convert into light energy. However, no lamp is entirely efficient, and some of the electrical energy is inevitably transformed into other energy forms — mostly heat. Within the filament of the lamp, the electrical energy excites the atoms, causing them to vibrate and gain energy. The atoms then release this energy in the form of photons, which are particles of light. This is a phenomenon known as incandescence. The release of photons is what makes the lamp emit light that we can see. However, because some of the electrical energy is also transformed into kinetic energy of the atoms, you also get release of heat. That's why light bulbs become hot to the touch after they've been on for a while. Therefore, it's accurate to say that when an electric lamp is turned on, the energy transformation that occurs is from electrical energy into light and heat energy.  The other options listed: (2). Light energy to electrical and mechanical energy,  (3). Heat energy to electrical and light energy,  (4). Electrical energy to mechanical and heat energy,  are incorrect in the context of an electrical lamp being turned on.

He commanded British troops in the American War of Independence, first leading the defence of Quebec during the 1775 rebel invasion and the 1776 counteroffensive that drove the rebels from the province. In August 1783, Carleton was informed that Great Britain would grant the United States its independence. With his exit from New York imminent, Carleton asked to be relieved of his command. With this news, Loyalists began an exodus from the Thirteen Colonies and Carleton did his best to have them resettled outside the United States.  At a meeting with George Washington, among others, to arrange for the implementation of those parts of the Treaty of Paris relating to the evacuation of New York City, then commanded by Carleton and still occupied by the British Army, many Loyalists and former slaves, Carleton refused to deliver over the human property to the Americans at the time of the British evacuation. Instead, he proposed a registry so that \\"the owners might eventually be paid for the slaves who were entitled to their freedom by British Proclamation and promises.\\"  Sir Guy noted that nothing could be changed in any Articles that were inconsistent with prior policies or National Honour. He added that the only mode was to pay for the Negroes, in which case justice was done to all, the former slaves and the owners. Carleton said that it would be a breach of faith not to honour the British policy of liberty to the Negro and declared that if removing them proved to be an infraction of the treaty, then compensation would have to be paid by the British government. To provide for such a contingency, he had a register kept of all Negroes who left, called the Book of Negroes, entering their names, ages, occupations, and names of their former masters. The Americans agreed to this, but as far as can be determined, the Crown never paid compensation. The British transported about 3,000 freedmen and other Loyalists to Nova Scotia for resettlement. As the colony struggled, some of the freedmen later chose in the early 1790s to go to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where the British set up a new colony, which included the Black Poor from London.  Washington disagreed with Sir Guy's actions and wrote: \\"...the measure is totally different from the letter and spirit of the Treaty but waiving the specialty of the point, leaving this decision to our respective Sovereigns I find it my duty to signify my readiness in conjunction with you to enter into agreements, or take any measures which may be deemed expedient to prevent the future carrying away any Negroes or other property of the American people.\\"  On 28 November, the evacuation was finished, and Carleton returned to England. John Campbell of Strachur succeeded him as Commander-in-Chief, North America, although the post was then much reduced in scope.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  I am facing a new situation today: Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group has a smaller chance of getting more health problems? A:","output":"To answer the question correctly, let's break down the information step by step: 1. From the background article, we know that consuming more energy than needed can lead to obesity, which in turn increases the risk of health problems like type 2 diabetes and hypertension. \\"People who consistently consume more food energy than they need may become obese.\\" 2. In the new situation, Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while Group Yellow had a normal diet. The extra 3500 calories consumed by Group Brown can potentially cause them to gain weight, as stated in the background article: \\"An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat.\\" 3. Since Group Brown gained a lot of weight due to the extra calories consumed during the diet experiment, it is more likely that they have higher body mass indexes (BMI), increasing the chances of obesity and related health problems. 4. In contrast, Group Yellow followed a normal diet, meaning they didn't consume extra calories and are less likely to gain excessive weight, resulting in a lower risk of obesity and related health problems. So, based on the information provided, we can conclude that: A: Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting more health problems compared to Group Brown, as they followed a normal diet and didn't consume extra calories that could lead to excessive weight gain and obesity-related health risks."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

What is the answer: What dangerous type of horse race involves jumping over various fences and ditches?","output":"The dangerous type of horse race that involves jumping over various fences and ditches is known as Steeplechase. Steeplechase is a form of horse racing where both jockeys and their horses compete to cover a set distance while overcoming a series of challenging obstacles such as fences, ditches, and hedges. Originating in Ireland in the 18th century, the name 'steeplechase' is derived from a combination of two words: 'steeple' and 'chase.' In early races, church steeples were often used as visual markers, guiding horsemen across fields and over obstacles. Riders would try to reach the steeple of the next village, 'chasing' each other through a natural obstacle course. The first recorded steeplechase race took place in 1752 between the towns of Buttevant and Doneraile in County Cork, Ireland. Steeplechase races can be divided into two main types: 1. Chases: These races involve a series of fixed, artificial fences placed on a level racing surface, typically made of birch, plastic, or a combination of materials. One well-known type of chase is the Grand National, which takes place in Aintree, England, and is considered one of the most challenging steeplechase races globally, with 30 fences and a distance of about 4 miles. 2. Hurdles: Hurdle races involve a set of jumps that are placed on the same level racing surface but are comparatively smaller and more manageable for horses. These jumps are usually made of brushwood or lightweight synthetic materials and are designed to collapse under the weight of a horse if they are impacted. Steeplechase racing is considered dangerous due to the inherent risks involved for both horses and jockeys. Horses must showcase their agility, speed, and jumping prowess to successfully navigate the obstacles while maintaining a sense of balance and control. Meanwhile, jockeys must steer their horses, employing skill and strategy to achieve the best results without compromising the safety of their equine partners. In steeplechase racing, there is an increased likelihood of accidents such as falls and injuries due to the challenging nature of the obstacles. In some cases, these accidents can result in severe injuries or even fatal outcomes for both horses and jockeys. To mitigate these risks, the sport has undergone various reforms and safety improvements over the years, including the introduction of less rigid fences, improved pre-race inspections, and restrictions on race entry qualifications. In conclusion, the steeplechase is a thrilling and dangerous form of horse racing that involves overcoming various fences and ditches. With its origins in 18th-century Ireland, the sport has grown in popularity across the world and remains a popular fixture in many racing calendars. Despite the inherent risks, efforts have been made to improve the safety of the sport, ensuring that it continues to entertain and challenge both participants and spectators alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives (\\"I'm an Ordinary Man\\"). Eliza's father, Alfred P.

Step 3: Translate the reflexive pronoun In English, the reflexive pronoun \\"se\\" is often dropped, so we don't need to translate it into English. Step 4: Translate the question particle \\"Ne\\" can be translated to a question tag \\"isn't it\\" or \\"right\\" in English. Step 5: Combine the translations Putting all the translations together, we get: \\"So that we ate, right?\\" Step 6: Adjust for natural English phrasing To make the sentence sound more natural in English, a more idiomatic translation would be: \\"So that we had a meal, right?\\" Final Translation: The translation of the Czech sentence \\"Abychom se najedli, ne?\\" to English is \\"So that we had a meal, right?\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage:Journey into Mystery is an American comic book series initially published by Atlas Comics, then by its successor, Marvel Comics. Initially a horror comics anthology, it changed to giant-monster and science fiction stories in the late 1950s. Beginning with issue #83 (cover dated Aug. 1962), it ran the superhero feature \\"The Mighty Thor\\", created by writers Stan Lee and Larry Lieber and artist Jack Kirby, and inspired by the mythological Norse thunder god. The series, which was renamed for its superhero star with issue #126 (March 1966), has been revived three times: in the 1970s as a horror anthology, and in the 1990s and 2010s with characters from Marvel's Thor mythos. The title was also used in 2019 for a limited series as part of the \\"War of the Realms\\" storyline.  Links: a. Thor (Marvel Comics) b. Jack Kirby c. Norse mythology d.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: I want to crush up Jolly Ranchers into tiny pieces. How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of crushing Jolly Ranchers into tiny pieces, follow these detailed steps: 1. Preparation:    a. Gather the necessary materials, including:       - Jolly Rancher candies (choose your preferred flavors)       - A cutting board or sturdy surface       - A resealable plastic bag or parchment paper       - A rolling pin, hammer, or mallet       - A bowl or container for collecting the crushed Jolly Ranchers    b. Clean your working surface and tools using warm soapy water, and then dry them thoroughly.    c. Before working on the candies, make sure your hands are clean and dry to avoid any contamination and stickiness. 2. Pre-crushing steps:    a. Unwrap the Jolly Rancher candies and discard the wrappers.    b. Place a few candies on the cutting board or working surface.    c. Using a hammer, mallet, or the flat side of a large knife, gently tap the candies once or twice just to create a slight crack in them. This pre-crushing step can make it easier to break the candies into finer pieces later. 3. Crushing the candies:    a. Place the cracked Jolly Ranchers into the resealable plastic bag, releasing any air before sealing the bag. Alternatively, you can place the candies between two sheets of parchment paper.    b. Lay the bag or parchment paper flat on the cutting board or sturdy surface.    c. Start crushing the candies by rolling the rolling pin over the bag or parchment paper. Apply firm and even pressure, moving in different directions to ensure that all candies are evenly crushed. If you don't have a rolling pin, you can use a heavy object like a hammer or mallet. However, be careful not to hit too hard, as you may puncture the bag or paper.    d. Periodically, pause to check the progress by gently rubbing the bag or parchment paper and feeling for any large pieces. Continue crushing until you've achieved the desired size of tiny pieces. 4. Collecting and storing the crushed Jolly Ranchers:    a. Carefully open the plastic bag or unfold the parchment paper.    b. You may notice different sizes of crushed pieces, ranging from fine powder to small chunks, all of which can be used, depending on your preference and purpose.    c. Using a clean and dry spoon, scoop the crushed Jolly Ranchers into your chosen bowl or container.    d. If you won't be using the crushed candies right away, store them in an airtight container to keep them from absorbing moisture or getting clumped together. You can also store the crushed candies in the resealable bag, provided there are no puncture holes in it. Now, you've successfully crushed Jolly Ranchers into tiny pieces! These crushed candies can be used as toppings for desserts, mixed into cookie dough or cake batter, or incorporated into various arts and crafts projects. Enjoy finding creative ways to use your crushed Jolly Ranchers!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: Occupation of Madeira began in the early 1420s as a decidedly minimalist  colonists arrived with only as much as they could carry from mainland Portugal. Here is a hypothesis: Colonists of Madeira made the mistake of trying to bring everything with them. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"It would be inappropriate to simply conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true because the connection between the two statements is not strong enough. In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis, we must examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis in detail. The premise states that the occupation of Madeira began in the early 1420s and the colonists carried with them only as much as they could carry from mainland Portugal. This implies that the settlers were limited by the amount of personal belongings and tools that each person could bring, likely due to transportation constraints or the uncertainty of what resources would be available on the island. The hypothesis assumes that these colonists made a mistake by trying to bring everything with them, implying that they might have been better off if they had taken a different approach, such as prioritizing specific supplies or establishing a supply chain with the mainland. In order to conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise, we would need additional information: 1. Evidence of problems or difficulties the colonists faced as a result of bringing only what they could carry. For example, if there are historical records or accounts of colonists struggling due to insufficient tools or supplies, or facing hardships that might have been mitigated with better preparation or access to resources. 2. Information about alternative strategies that were available to the colonists at that time, which could have made their situation better. If there were other successful colonization efforts that used different approaches, this would strengthen the argument that bringing everything they could carry was a mistake. 3. Examination of the context in which the early settlers of Madeira found themselves, and whether their situation made it more likely for the minimalist approach to be a mistake. If there were specific environmental, political, or societal factors that made it particularly challenging for this group of settlers, it would be easier to argue that a different strategy would have been more helpful. Without additional supporting evidence or context, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise alone. While there might be an implicit suggestion of a shortcoming in the \\"decidedly minimalist\\" approach taken by the colonists, this statement alone does not provide enough specific evidence to prove that the hypothesis is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It says 80% of parents are concerned about kids meeting bad people online. That's because young people who largely have grown up with the Net think of it as a social outlet , say the researchers. To young people, the benefits of giving out some personal information to reach out to friends outweigh the risks. And the study shows they are so comfortable with the medium that 78% have a personal website or blog. Parents also recognize the importance of the Internet. The survey shows 91% think the Net helps their children explore their passions, and 77% think the Internet is one of the most valuable education tools teens have. But 88% think it's important to know what their kids are doing online. Findings suggest both parents and teens need more education about using online media, Steyer says.

I am not really certain how this place is getting the stellar reviews that it has. we just had a quick bite there last night and it was easily one of the worst meals that I have ever had the pleasure of paying for. While the people running the shop were lovely, it was not worth the 17 or so we paid.  I had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce. you would think that might be a nice time to let me know that they use some sort of house garlic-herb mayo instead of actual mayo. but no. So after a good bit of waiting my sub comes out with this weird speckly dressing on top of the lettuce... yes, this is that mayo - which is disgusting. I thought it was ranch and that is when he lady, with a smile, explained it was their house mayo... no, they don't use regular mayo here.   so, let me tell you about this mayo:  1. it is heavily flavored with garlic powder - which tastes seriously like chemicals on a good day and just should not be considered food in any way shape or form. Mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix? who knows. all I could taste was the overwhelming chemical, fake garlic flavor. Hey, I love garlic and cook with it daily - mind you I actually use the real stuff.   2. it is really thin... I mean thin like salad dressing, runny, thin. Um, isn't mayo supposed to be thick and spreadable? even the stuff you see at subway is thicker. this stuff tasted like really cheap, bad, ranch dressing.  So, after giving it a good effort to try to eat this \\"sub\\" - I gave up and picked off the bread on the top of the sub - the bread was pretty stellar though. still hungry I decided to try to scrap off the mayo/lettuce disaster and go for the meat and cheese. um... salt? the meat, which suspiciously looked like those thin sheets of steak-um had zero flavor. one bite and I rejected it. While we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage? I am paying almost 6 bucks for this sub. I want to see yummy chopped up steak bits like you see at even a mall sub shop. not this grey, disgusting 1980s looking flavorless \\"meat\\".  At least the bottom of the sub roll was salvageable... I ate the bread.   On to the pizza. My husband had two slices of pepperoni and my daughter had a slice of plain cheese.   Ok, pizza. well, this too was a massive disappointment. since I was still hungry after dumping the majority of my sub I tried both of their pizza slices. it reminded me of a nice store-bought frozen pizza. yes, bland. bad sauce with flavorless cheese.   My husband is a freak for pepperoni pizza and of the two slices he almost finished one of them. yes, more for the garbage. My daughter? she is three.. she isn't really a foodie (yet) but she got thru some of her cheese pizza... she actually spit some of it out but to be fair - she is three. I tried her pizza and honestly, all I could manage to somewhat enjoy was the crust which was nothing to rave about but it was tolerable.   To provide a baseline - we typically order from Rialto's and while they are not terrible they decent enough for a sub shop - pizza place.  this place... ugh. never. again. ever.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas?, using the article: The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz occurred about 1.8 million years ago at the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.The present period began about 150,000 years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000 years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.During recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245 BC ± 150 years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850 BC, 200 BC ± 100 years, 350 AD ± 300 years, 675 AD ± 50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps),[b] 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps),[b] 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"What partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas?\\" is that, during the ancestral period of Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic activity, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created between one million to two million years ago. These stratovolcanoes partially collapsed between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, resulting in the formation of large calderas measuring 5 to 10 kilometers wide. The partial collapse of these large stratovolcanoes marked the transition from the ancestral period to the older period in the history of the Nevado del Ruiz massif."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

George Zimmerman, set to stand trial in the 2012 shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, on Tuesday waived his right to a \\"stand your ground\\" pretrial immunity hearing. Zimmerman's attorneys have decided they will try this as a self-defense case. Florida's deadly force law, also called \\"stand your ground\\", was passed in 2005. It allows people to meet \\"force with force\\" if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. Under the law, a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity, is being attacked in a place he has a right to be, and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else. In a pretrial immunity hearing, a judge would have ruled whether Zimmerman's actions were protected under the \\"stand your ground\\" law; a ruling in favor of the defendant would have meant that no criminal or civil trial could proceed. Martin was shot and killed on February 26, 2012, while returning from a nearby convenience store to his father's fiancée's house in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, acknowledged that he shot the unarmed 17-year-old, but said Martin physically attacked him and he fired in self-defense. Initially, no charges were pursued, and the case soon became the center of a national controversy. Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder on April 11, 2012. During Tuesday's motions hearing, Zimmerman defense attorney Mark O'Mara told Judge Debra Nelson there was nothing in the law that required the immunity hearing to take place before Zimmerman's trial. O'Mara said the hearing could be requested after the defense has presented its case, but \\"we'd much rather have the jury address the issue of criminal liability or lack thereof.\\" Benjamin Crump, attorney for the Martin family, said Zimmerman's decision to \\"merge\\" the hearing and the trial \\"is very telling of his defense, or lack thereof.\\" \\"We believe the defense's decision to waive a pretrial hearing and to merge the 'stand your ground' hearing into the trial is to prevent putting George Zimmerman on the stand,\\" Crump said in a press release, \\"and to preclude the public and the potential jury pool from previewing the many inconsistencies in George Zimmerman's story.\\" Crump said a pretrial hearing was clearly the intent of state law because the statute \\"grants immunity from civil lawsuits, arrests and trials, if a defendant prevails.\\" Crump continued: \\"... the decision made by the defense to waive a pretrial hearing and to solely continue on to trial vindicates the many thousands of protesters who demanded George Zimmerman be arrested for the killing of Trayvon Martin. After all, to have a felony criminal trial an arrest must first be made.\\" After the motions hearing ended, prosecutors and defense attorneys were to meet in private with the judge to discuss jury issues for the June 10 trial.

While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

And the answer is?","output":"Arthroscopy refers to a minimally invasive surgical procedure performed on joints within the human body. This procedure is used to diagnose, assess, and treat various joint-related conditions. Arthroscopy involves the use of an instrument called an arthroscope, which is a small, tube-like device that contains a camera, light source, and specialized surgical tools. The arthroscope is inserted into the joint through a small incision, allowing surgeons to view and treat the affected area without needing to make a large open incision. The term \\"arthroscopy\\" is derived from the Greek words \\"arthro,\\" meaning \\"joint,\\" and \\"skopos,\\" meaning \\"to look.\\" So, literally, arthroscopy means \\"to look within the joint.\\" Although arthroscopy can potentially be performed on any joint in the human body, it is most commonly used on the following joints: 1. Knee: Knee arthroscopy is frequently used to diagnose and treat conditions like meniscal tears, ligament injuries, cartilage damage, and knee inflammation. 2. Shoulder: Shoulder arthroscopy is often used to address issues such as rotator cuff tears, impingement syndrome, shoulder instability, and labral tears. 3. Ankle: Ankle arthroscopy is commonly performed to treat conditions like ankle arthritis, cartilage damage, bone spurs, and soft tissue inflammation. 4. Hip: Hip arthroscopy is used to diagnose and treat various hip conditions such as femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), labral tears, articular cartilage lesions, and loose bodies in the joint. 5. Wrist: Wrist arthroscopy is performed to address conditions like wrist arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, ligament tears, and fractures. 6. Elbow: Elbow arthroscopy can be used to treat conditions like tennis elbow, joint instability, cartilage injuries, and bone spurs. Arthroscopy offers several advantages over traditional open surgery. These advantages include reduced pain and swelling, faster recovery and rehabilitation, minimal scarring, and a lower risk of infection. However, as with any surgical procedure, there are potential risks and complications associated with arthroscopy, such as infection, bleeding, nerve damage, and blood clots. The specific risks and benefits of the procedure will depend on the joint being treated and the individual patient's medical history and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that the man that was omitted from a friend's autobiography have a musical rivalry with? from the following article ?  While Lennon and Starr remained consistently friendly during the years that followed the Beatles' break-up in 1970, his relationships with McCartney and Harrison varied. He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 Dark Horse tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership. Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him. Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him. Lennon told Playboy, \\"I was hurt by it. By glaring omission ... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch ... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book.\\"Lennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of Saturday Night Live in which Lorne Michaels made a 3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. The pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired. Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \\"Throughout my career, I've selected to work with ... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono ... That ain't bad picking.\\"Along with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with...

The Three Stooges were an American vaudeville and comedy team active from 1922 until 1970, best known for their 190 short subject films by Columbia Pictures that have been regularly airing on television since 1958. Their hallmark was physical farce and slapstick. In films, the stooges were commonly known by their actual first names.

Additionally, every short was remastered in high definition, a first for the Stooge films. Previous DVD releases were based on themes (wartime, history, work, etc.), and sold poorly.

Remastered in High Definition and presented in chronological order, these short films now give fans the chance to appreciate the development of one of the most successful comedy teams in history.\\"  The chronological series proved successful, and Sony wasted little time preparing the next set for release. Volume Two: 1937-1939 was released on May 27, 2008, followed by Volume Three: 1940-1942 three months later on August 26, 2008. Demand exceeded supply, proving to Sony that they had a hit on their hands. In response, Volume Four: 1943-1945 was released on October 7, 2008, a mere two months after its predecessor. The global economic crisis slowed down the release schedule after Volume Four, and Volume Five: 1946-1948 was belatedly released on March 17, 2009. Volume Five is the first in the series to feature Shemp Howard with the Stooges and the final volume to feature Curly Howard. Volume Six: 1949-1951 was released June 16, 2009, and Volume Seven: 1952-1954 was released on November 10, 2009. Volume Seven included 3-D glasses for the two shorts: Spooks! and Pardon My Backfire. As of 2013, the 3-D versions of the two shorts in this volume have been removed. Volume Eight: 1955-1959 was released on June 1, 2010. This was the final volume of the Stooges collection, bringing the series to a close. Instead of two discs, Volume Eight includes three discs. It is also the final volume to feature Shemp Howard and the first and only volume to feature Joe Besser. For the first time in history, all 190 Three Stooges short subjects became available to the public, uncut and unedited.

According to a manager at the Steelyard Commons Walmart, a person paid 72,000 in layaways for close to 100 customers at that store.      As if that wasn't generous enough, the same mystery donor paid 36,000 in layaway bills at the Walmart on Leavitt Rd. in Lorain.      The identity of this Secret Santa will likely remain a mystery as Walmart says that was part of the agreement with the person.      Layaway angels, as they've been called, pop up around the holidays in other states, as well. Last year, someone in Massachusetts paid off layaway bills for hundreds of Toys 'R' Us customers. ||||| CLEVELAND - A mystery donor told Walmart employees he likes to do something special on his birthday every year.      This year, he spent his special day visiting two Northeast Ohio Walmarts and paying off the stores' entire layaway tabs.      That totaled more than 106,000.      Managers said he made it very clear he wanted to remain anonymous.      Steelyard Commons in Cleveland had the biggest layaway collection with nearly 70,000 in goods and Lorain had about 36,000. Items ranged from a pair of socks to 70-inch televisions — and tons and tons of toys.      \\"It made me happy because I know a lot of customers walked out of the store or are coming in the store very positively impacted by it,\\" said Beverly Vargo, store manager of the Lorain Walmart.      Tara Neal had paid off 10 on a 'Frozen'-themed bed for her 3-year-old daughter when she got the call Tuesday morning that her layaway gift had been paid off. More than 80 was still remaining on the balance.      With four kids at home, she said the holidays can be tough.      \\"It’s such a blessing to know there are still people out there that care. It’s like Santa, like a real Santa to me,\\" Neal said.      \\"I just cried,\\" added Cathie Cromwell, who was picking up her son's gift. \\"It’s amazing someone would have this much compassion during the Christmas season to help us. To help people who maybe wouldn’t have had Christmas.\\"      Walmart responded with the following statement:      Christmas is a time of year when many people go above and beyond to give back to their neighbors and communities. When customers anonymously pay off others’ layaway items we’re reminded of the amazing things people will do to support each other. We’re proud to be a small part of these random acts of kindness.      This isn't the first time local do-gooders have paid off layaway tabs. In 2013, someone paid off 8,800 at the Avon Walmart.      And in southern Ohio, last year, someone paid off 15,000 at a Moraine store and in 2012, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported that a former shoplifter paid off 1,000 in goods at a Lockland store.

This is especially true in the fields of advertising. Visual content and design in advertising have a very great impact on the consumers,but it is language that helps people to identify a product and keep it in mind. The choice of language to show specific messages with the intention of influencing people is of vital importance. The English language is known for its extensive vocabulary. While many other languages have only one or two words to carry a particular meaning,English may have five or six. Moreover,the meanings of these five or six words may differ very slightly and in a very subtle  way. It is important to understand the connotation  of a word. \\"Armchair\\",for example,suggests comfort,whereas \\"chair\\" causes no particular feelings. Different people sometimes interpret language in different ways. Both the mass media,when reporting news items,and marketing and advertising personnel have to consider the emotive power of the words they use. First,they make a decision about what to communicate and what to withhold .One way in which advertisers adapt language to their own use is to take compound words and use them as adjectives. Examples of these compounds are:top-quality,economysize,chocolateflavoured,featherlight and longerlasting. These compounds have become part of the English language. The language of advertising always emphasizes  why one product stands out in comparison with the others. Don't expect advertising language to be always correct in the normal sense. For example,comparatives are often used when no real comparison is made. An advertisement for a detergent  may say \\"It gets clothes whiter\\",but whiter than what? Question: What would be the best title for the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Language in Advertising\\"?","output":"Yes, the answer \\"Language in Advertising\\" would be an appropriate and suitable title for the passage.

Given the background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.  and the situation: Bob is a financial analyst. He used to work for company A. Bob noticed that company A is mostly financed by debt. Recently, he changed job and now working as a financial analyst for another company, company B. Company B has completely different culture than company A. Company B is mostly financed by equity.  Answer the following question: Would company B have or not have tax benefits of debt?","output":"Company B, which is mostly financed by equity, would not have the same tax benefits of debt that Company A has due to its high reliance on debt financing. The tax benefits of debt refer to the interest payments on debt that can be deducted from the company's taxable income, thereby reducing the amount of taxes it pays. This advantage is one of the primary reasons why companies may choose to use debt financing instead of, or in addition to, equity financing.  In Company A's case, since it is mostly financed by debt, it can take advantage of the tax shield provided by its interest payments on debt. This tax shield lowers the overall tax burden on the company, increasing its net income and potentially offering a more attractive return to investors. This benefit must be balanced against the potential costs associated with taking on more debt, such as increased financial risk, higher probability of financial distress, and potential bankruptcy costs. On the other hand, Company B being mostly financed by equity, it does not have the same tax benefits of debt as Company A. When a company raises capital through the issuance of equity, it distributes dividends to its shareholders. Unlike interest payments on debt, dividend payments are not tax-deductible for the company. This means that Company B does not get the same tax shield provided by debt, making it relatively more expensive as a means of financing. However, it is essential to note that a company with more equity financing would also have lower financial risk and a reduced likelihood of facing financial distress, bankruptcy, or other costs related to taking on too much debt. Company B's financial mix might be better aligned with its overall strategy, risk tolerance, and operational needs, even if it does not enjoy the tax benefits of debt. In conclusion, the trade-off theory of capital structure explains that companies need to find a balance between the costs and benefits of debt and equity financing according to their unique circumstances, risk profile, and business strategy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation -296n + 105n + 7380 = -72n - 3330 for n, we'll perform the following steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation.  On the left side, we have -296n and 105n. On the right side, we have -72n. Step 2: Calculate the sum of the like terms. -296n + 105n = -191n (left side) -72n remains on the right side. Now, we have: -191n + 7380 = -72n - 3330 Step 3: Add 191n to both sides to isolate the variable 'n' on one side. Add 191n to the left side: -191n + 191n + 7380 = 191n - 191n - 72n - 3330 -191n and 191n cancel out, leaving: 7380 = 119n - 3330 Step 4: Add 3330 to both sides to isolate the term with 'n' on the right side. 7380 + 3330 = 119n - 3330 + 3330 Add the numbers on the left side: 10710 = 119n Step 5: Divide both sides by 119 to solve for 'n'. 10710 ÷ 119 = 119n ÷ 119 The result is: 90 = n So, the solution to the equation is n = 90."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Recognize that you have a fear of bridges, and that it needs to be overcome. Once you bring the condition to mind, you can start to work on acclimatizing yourself to bridges by watching films, imagining bridge crossings and crossing small bridges. By watching a film with a bridge in it, you can begin to desensitize yourself to the image and feel of crossing over bridges. There are numerous films with crossing bridges as a sub-theme and many of these films even include the word “bridge” in their title. You can search film databases, cable or online networks for films with the word “bridge” in the title.  In the 1995 Clint Eastwood film “Bridges of Madison County,” a national geographic photographer is shooting a story about the covered bridges of Madison county and falls in love with a woman who lives in the area. The 1957 film “The Bridge on the River Kwai” is a British-American war film that depicts the construction of a railway bridge to transport prisoners of war. Cross a smaller sized bridge with a group of friends, a counselor, or a therapist. By starting with a small bridge, you can start developing the physical and mental stamina for larger bridges. If you have strong social support from friends and a therapist, you may be able to gradually build up your stamina for crossing bridges. If you are undergoing treatment for your condition, you should follow your therapist's recommendation on this process. It is important to maintain all of your regular school and work routines. This will give you a sense of order and balance in life. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: To overcome a fear of bridges, begin by acknowledging and confronting the phobia.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Louis Leo Holtz (born January 6, 1937) is a former American football player, coach, and analyst. He served as the head football coach at The College of William & Mary (1969-1971), North Carolina State University (1972-1975), the New York Jets (1976), the University of Arkansas (1977-1983), the University of Minnesota (1984-1985), the University of Notre Dame (1986-1996), and the University of South Carolina (1999-2004), compiling a career record of 249-132-7. Holtz's 1988 Notre Dame team went 12-0 with a victory in the Fiesta Bowl and was the consensus national champion. Holtz is the only college football coach to lead six different programs to bowl games and the only coach to guide four different programs to the final top 20 rankings. After two seasons as a commentator for CBS Sports, Holtz came out of retirement in 1999 and returned to the University of South Carolina, where he had been an assistant in the 1960s. The year before Holtz arrived, the Gamecocks went 1-10, and the team subsequently went 0-11 during Holtz's first season. In his second season, South Carolina went 8-4, winning the Outback Bowl over the heavily favored Ohio State Buckeyes. The eight-game improvement from the previous year was the best in the nation in 2000 and the third best single-season turnaround in NCAA history. It also earned National Coach of the Year honors for Holtz from Football News and American Football Coaches Quarterly. In his third season, Holtz's success continued, leading the Gamecocks to a 9-3 record and another Outback Bowl victory over Ohio State. The nine wins for the season were the second highest total in the history of the program. Under Holtz's leadership, the Gamecocks posted their best two-year mark in school history from 2000 to 2001, going 17-7 overall and 10-6 in SEC play.  After consecutive 5-7 campaigns in 2002 and 2003, Holtz finished his South Carolina tenure on a winning note with a 6-5 record in 2004. Holtz's time in Columbia saw the resurrection of Gamecock Football, as the program had only one bowl win and no Top 25 finishes in the ten years before his hire. Upon his exit, USC had posted AP Top 25 finishes in 2000 and 2001 (#19 and No. 13 respectively) and had made consecutive New Year's Day bowls for the first time in its history. Holtz finished his six-year tenure at South Carolina with a 2-4 record versus his former team, Arkansas, beating the Razorbacks in Columbia, SC in 2000 and 2004.  In 2005, the NCAA imposed three years probation and reductions in two scholarships on the program for ten admitted violations under Holtz, five of which were found to be major. The violations involved improper tutoring and off-season workouts, as well as a lack of institutional control. No games were forfeited, and no television or postseason ban was imposed. Holtz issued a statement after the sanctions were announced stating, \\"There was no money involved. No athletes were paid. There were no recruiting inducements. No cars. No jobs offered. No ticket scandal.\\" Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, an interesting aspect from the article is the impressive turnaround of the University of South Carolina's football program under Lou Holtz's leadership. As mentioned in the article, \\"In his second season, South Carolina went 8-4, winning the Outback Bowl over the heavily favored Ohio State Buckeyes. The eight-game improvement from the previous year was the best in the nation in 2000 and the third best single-season turnaround in NCAA history.\\" This turnaround earned Holtz National Coach of the Year honors and showcased his ability to revive struggling football programs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state.  - \\"Boys' Weeklies\\" is an essay by George Orwell in which he analyses those weekly story-paper publications for boys which were current around 1940. After being published in \\"Horizon\\" in abridged form, it was published alongside two of his other pieces in \\"Inside the Whale and Other Essays\\" from Victor Gollancz Ltd.  - A story paper is a periodical publication similar to a literary magazine, but featuring illustrations and text stories, and aimed towards children and teenagers. Also known in Britain as 'Boys' Weeklies', story papers were phenomenally popular before the outbreak of the Second World War.  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - A Commonwealth realm is a sovereign state that is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and shares the same person, currently Elizabeth II, as its head of state and reigning constitutional monarch, but retains a crown legally distinct from the other realms.

While specific use of the term may vary among countries, it is usually applied to text, images, or other audio-visual content on any traditional medium, including paper (newspapers, magazines, catalogs, etc.). The word publication means the act of publishing, and also refers to any printed copies.  - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster.

There were two story papers called Union Jack . The first appeared in the 1880s but was only very short - lived . The name was then used by Alfred Harmsworth in 1894 for a new halfpenny storypaper intended as a companion to the successful Halfpenny Marvel . Harmsworth considered it his moral duty to put the Penny Dreadfuls out of business , though some considered his papers to simply be \`\` halfpenny dreadfullers '' . The first issues of the Union Jack stated that it was a \`\` Library of high class fiction '' . The editorial at the end of the very first issue stated \`\` there will be nothing of the ' dreadful ' type in our stories . No tales of boys rifling their employers ' cash - boxes and making off to foreign lands , or other such highly immoral fiction products '' . The paper claimed to be offering good value by \`\` securing the very best authors '' but only presenting their stories on cheap paper , rather than \`\` wasting '' money on colourful bindings and high - quality paper .

What is the relationship between 'union jack ' and 'magazine'? The answer to this question is:","output":"The relationship between 'Union Jack' and 'magazine' lies in the historical context of British story papers. Union Jack was the name of a story paper, a type of magazine, that was published in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United Kingdom. It was aimed at children and teenagers and featured a variety of illustrated text stories. There were two story papers with the name Union Jack, the first one appearing in the 1880s and the second one launched by Alfred Harmsworth in 1894. The latter was intended as a companion to the successful Halfpenny Marvel.  Union Jack story paper sought to provide good value by presenting the works of the best authors on cheap paper but emphasized high-quality stories, excluding immoral tales that were common in the so-called Penny Dreadfuls. Despite this, the quality of the stories in the early years could be variable, and pseudonyms were often used by authors to give the impression that more people were contributing to the paper than actually were.  In summary, the relationship between 'Union Jack' and 'magazine' is based on the fact that 'Union Jack' refers to a British story paper, which is a type of magazine published in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, featuring illustrated text stories aimed at children and teenagers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what are geologists currently researching I found the following answer on Google: Geologists usually engage in studying geology . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the answer provided is generic and does not address the current research topics in the field of geology. Geologists indeed study geology, but their research spans across various sub-disciplines and focuses on specific phenomena and questions. Some of the current research topics in geology include: 1. Climate change: Geologists are researching the Earth's past climate history through the study of sedimentary rocks, ice cores, fossils, and other geological records. This information is essential for understanding the current and future impacts of climate change on Earth. 2. Natural hazards: Geologists study natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, and tsunamis to better understand their causes, frequency, and consequences on human society and the environment. 3. Earth's resources: Geologists research the formation, distribution, and extraction of natural resources such as minerals, metals, and fossil fuels like oil, coal, and natural gas. They also study the environmental impacts of resource extraction and develop sustainable alternatives to traditional resources, like geothermal energy. 4. Planetary geology: By studying the geology of other planets like Mars, the Moon, and Venus, geologists gain insights into the geological processes occurring on those planets, as well as the Earth. This research can help us understand the formation and evolution of the Solar System. 5. Paleontology: Often in cooperation with biologists, geologists study fossils, which provide essential information about past ecosystems and the evolution of life on Earth. 6. Geochronology: This research focuses on the development of methods and techniques to accurately determine the age of rocks, minerals, fossils, and sediments. The knowledge gained from dating geological materials contributes to a better understanding of Earth's history. 7. Tectonics and seismology: Geologists investigate the forces shaping Earth's crust, the formation of continents and oceanic basins, and the processes responsible for earthquakes and other seismic events. 8. Hydrogeology: Geologists research the distribution and movement of water in Earth's crust, with a focus on groundwater and its impacts on ecosystems, water supplies, and environmental issues like pollution and contamination. These are just a few examples of the wide range of research topics being explored in the field of geology. As our understanding of Earth's processes and history grows, geologists will continue to investigate new questions and improve our knowledge of the planet we live on."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 2: The Dâmboviţa River is a tributary of the Sântinica River in Romania . Do these two sentences convey the same information? Choose from: [I] no. [II] yes.","output":"[II] Yes. Both sentences, despite their different phrasing, convey the same information about the geographical dynamics between the Dâmboviţa River and the Sântinica River.  Reading the first sentence - \\"The Dâmboviţa River is a tributary of the river Sântinica in Romania\\", it means that the Dâmboviţa River flows into the Sântinica River within the geographical boundary of Romania.  The second sentence is expressing the same fact albeit within a different grammar template - \\"The Dâmboviţa River is a tributary of the Sântinica River in Romania\\". It simply restructures the original information, indicating that the Dâmboviţa River also flows into the Sântinica River within the confines of Romania. In geographical terms, a tributary is a stream or a river which flows into a main river (also known as the parent river or the main stem). The spot where the tributary and the parent river meet is known as the confluence. So, regardless of the phrasing of these sentences, the clear implication is that the Dâmboviţa River is a smaller body of water that eventually flows into the Sântinica River. Therefore, while their structures might slightly differ, both Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 communicate the identical geographical relationship between the Dâmboviţa River and the Sântinica River in Romania. They stipulate that Dâmboviţa is a tributary or a smaller river that flows into a larger one, here being the Sântinica River in Romania.

While the Vice President may spend a significant amount of time at the White House due to work and official duties, the primary residential accommodation for the U.S. Vice President is not the White House, but Number One Observatory Circle. Located on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington D.C., Number One Observatory Circle has been the official residence of the Vice President since 1974. Prior to this, Vice Presidents lived in their own private homes, or in hotels, and they received a housing allowance.

Measuring at 9,150 square feet, the house consists of approximately 33 rooms, including multiple bedrooms, a sitting area, a dining room, a lounge, and more. The house also has a secure, underground bunker for emergencies.  With a cream-colored exterior and a beautiful green lawn, the house is nestled in a peaceful, secluded area.

The White House, located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, is the primary workplace and residence for only the President of the United States. While the Vice President and other members of the administration do work out of the White House, they do not reside there.  So in conclusion, while the Vice President may visit and work in the White House frequently, they do not live there. Their official residence is at Number One Observatory Circle.

In May, monthly production hit nearly 77 million barrels in the two major regions Basra and Kirkuk. That sunk, the ministry said, to fewer than 70 million in June as daily production tumbled to less than three million barrels a day. According to the U.N., the death toll jumped from 595 killed in April to 963 in May -- and more than 1,000 were killed in July.

This approach, however, has its drawbacks; it places tremendous pressure on an already strained Iraqi government to provide sufficient infrastructure, security, and political stability to support foreign investment in the oil sector. Moreover, the escalating violence exacerbates these challenges, discouraging potential investors and hindering exploration projects.

To provide a better answer, it is important to consider the early history of comics in Europe. European comics have a long and rich history, dating back to the early 19th century. One of the first comic artists in Europe was Swiss artist Rodolphe Töpffer, who is often considered the \\"Father of European comics.\\"  Rodolphe Töpffer (1799-1846) was a Swiss teacher, writer, and artist who is credited with creating the first modern comic strips. Töpffer's works were characterized by their innovative combination of images and text, with the images being essential to understanding the narrative. The first of his comic strips was titled \\"Histoire de M. Vieux Bois\\" (also known as \\"The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck\\") and was published in the 1830s. Although there were some earlier examples of sequential art, such as William Hogarth's 18th-century series \\"A Harlot's Progress\\" and Francisco Goya's satirical prints, Töpffer's approach to combining images and text, along with his use of humor, satire, and caricature, cemented his status as a pioneer in the realm of comics. Töpffer's work inspired many other European artists to create their own comic strips, leading to the development of the \\"bande dessinée\\" in France and Belgium, the \\"fumetto\\" in Italy, and other forms of comics in various European countries. The tradition of European comics continued to evolve throughout the 20th century, with notable creators such as Hergé (the creator of Tintin) and René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo (the creators of Asterix) being some of the most celebrated names in the world of comics. In conclusion, Rodolphe Töpffer is best known for being the first comics creator in Europe, as he played a significant role in the evolution and popularization of comics in European culture. His influential work has laid the foundation for the modern comic strip and the artists who followed in his footsteps, contributing to the rich history of comics in Europe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two sentences provide different types of information about New Braunfels' downtown. Sentence 1: \\"downtown New Braunfels\\" is a noun phrase that simply provides the location without offering any opinions or descriptions about it. This sentence, or rather, a phrase, only identifies the geographical area in the city. We can only infer that New Braunfels has a downtown area from this phrase; nothing more or less. Sentence 2: \\"New Braunfels has an awesome downtown\\" is a complete sentence that contains a subjective opinion about the downtown area of the city. It suggests that the speaker or writer finds the downtown area to be enjoyable, entertaining, or impressive in some way, by using the adjective \\"awesome\\" to describe it. The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as the first sentence does not suggest any qualities or characteristics of the downtown of New Braunfels. The second sentence provides an additional perception about the downtown's features that aren't apparent from the simple mention of the location. These two sentences can be said to relate to the same subject matter, but the conclusions drawn are different.

Pleased with Andrea's ability to \\"follow my mind and keep his eyes fixed on the ultimate goal,\\" Borgia selects Andrea to accomplish an intrigue: arrange the marriage of his widowed sister, Lucrezia (whose husband he has just had assassinated for the purpose), to Alfonso d'Este, the son of the Duke Ercole d'Este of Ferrara. By doing so, Borgia will remove Ferrara as an impediment to conquest of central Italy. In being selected, however, Andrea earns the enmity of Don Esteban Ramirez (Leslie Bradley), an ambitious mercenary captain and rival. Andrea travels to Venice to sell some of his paintings to raise money for expenses. He meets the lovely Camilla di la Baglione (Wanda Hendrix), young wife of the elderly Count Marc Antonio Verano of Citta del Monte, and smitten with her, gallantly gives her a painting he was haggling to sell for a hundred ducats. Soon after, an assassin attempts to kill Andrea, but he thwarts the attack and spares the assassin to learn who hired him: the Duke Ercole d'Este. He hires the assassin, Mario Belli (Everett Sloane), as part of his own entourage. Resuming the mission, Andrea stops to visit the farm of a blacksmith's widow, reputed to be hiding gold stolen by her bandit son. She is actually his mother (Katina Paxinou), and he is in fact Andrea Zoppo, not the noble Orsini he pretends to be. The reunion is a rocky one, because the mother does not approve of her son's evil ways. Belli spies on them through a window. Andrea continues to Ferrara, where he succeeds in arranging the marriage by intimidating the duke and flattering Alfonso.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Would case B have longer or shorter wavelengths than case C?  Different wavelength electromagnetic radiations have different uses. John is a physicist. He needed to find appropriate wavelength electromagnetic radiations for his experiments. To that end, he selected three electromagnetic radiations, microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. He noted microwaves as case A, infrared as case B, and visible light as case C.  Hint: Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively. IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves. Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by \\"feel.\\" Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads, called \\"pits\\". Bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kilowatt per square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 53% is infrared radiation, 44% is visible light, and 3% is ultraviolet radiation. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, case B (infrared light) would have longer wavelengths than case C (visible light). Infrared light has a wavelength range between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, while visible light has a shorter wavelength range. It is also mentioned that infrared wavelengths are longer than that of visible light but shorter than that of microwaves. To better understand this, let's recap the electromagnetic spectrum and the order of these radiations: The electromagnetic spectrum is the complete range of electromagnetic waves in order of their increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength. The main categories of electromagnetic waves in this spectrum, in order of increasing frequency (or decreasing wavelength), are: 1. Radio waves 2. Microwaves (case A) 3. Infrared light (case B) 4. Visible light (case C) 5. Ultraviolet light 6. X-rays 7. Gamma rays As we can see, infrared light (case B) comes before visible light (case C) in the electromagnetic spectrum, which indicates that the wavelengths of case B (infrared light) are longer than the wavelengths of case C (visible light). In conclusion, based on the information given in the paragraph and the order of these radiations in the electromagnetic spectrum, case B (infrared light) would have longer wavelengths than case C (visible light)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 40-year-old runs an authentic Greek grill house, serving souvlaki and bifteki to fellow Greeks in the area. \\"You feel homesick, that's for sure,\\" Andreas admits, reminiscing about his time as a soldier based in the Greek islands, a stark contrast to his sterile German surroundings. \\"But it's better to have peace of mind, to be able to provide for my wife and kid.\\" Locally, some home comforts are provided for - there's a Greek coffee shop, a Greek taverna complete with an Olympiacos FC flag draped across the window, and a Greek grocery where Hellenic watermelons are on offer in the searing July heat. Yet despite these familiar amenities, being among the 330,000 Greek migrants in Germany during the debt crisis has been challenging. Germany's governing politicians have barely disguised their contempt for Alexis Tsipras and his anti-austerity Syriza party, while the country's most popular tabloid, Bild, has run a string of headlines in the past few years deriding Greeks for being lazy and greedy. Recent academic research has found that anti-Greek sentiment is on the rise. \\"You hear people say 'we've had enough', 'we pay for you' and things like that,\\" says Niki, who came to Offenbach from Thessaloniki in 2010 and works in Frankfurt airport. \\"It's not comfortable.\\" Perhaps unsurprisingly, Niki socialises almost exclusively with her compatriots, often playing tavli, or Greek backgammon, with two German-born Greeks in Offenbach's Greek pub. \\"I want this to end,\\" she says, referring to the ongoing negotiations between Greece and its creditors. \\"I want to go back.\\" \\"It's going to be tough for me in Greece, but I prefer to be there with my people in my country, instead of staying here and listening to all this...\\" She breaks off, wary of issuing an expletive. \\"You can put a beep here.\\" Despite acknowledging the efficiency of Frankfurt's infrastructure, and the relative stability of its economy, Niki has few kind words for her German neighbours. \\"We might be poor but we still live - they do not know how to live,\\" she says. \\"I'm not going to take [any lessons] from German lifestyle to Greece. We're totally different.\\" A little further down Offenbach's Frankfurter Strasse, I come across Valerios, a 25-year-old who came here from Drama, a remote mountainous region in northern Greece, two years ago, and is now doing a vocational course while working in a hotel. While he and his friend Pavlos, a builder who has been in Germany for four years, tuck into a kebab, Valerios says he, too, is acutely aware of how his country is perceived by some Germans. \\"They say we are so lazy, that we don't like to work,\\" he says, \\"and this comes from the media.\\" Just a few miles away, the sleek skyscraper that houses the European Central Bank looms large. In the next few days it will seal the fate of Greece's banks, which are already teetering on the brink, by deciding whether to continue supplying emergency funding to the country's lenders. But few of the Greeks in Offenbach have much confidence in the ECB or in the eurozone's leaders. Most would have voted 'no' in Sunday's referendum. \\"Let's go back to drachmas - it will be better,\\" says Valerios, who wants to return to Greece when he finishes his studies. Pavlos agrees: \\"By now, it's better to leave the eurozone.\\" Andreas, however, would prefer Greece to stay in the euro. If it doesn't, he worries that the country could become \\"the Cuba of Europe\\" over the next few years. \\"In my heart I was going to say 'no' [to a deal with creditors] because I'm Greek and we're proud of being able to stand on our feet,\\" he says. \\"But if they just cut some slack to the Greeks - I would definitely say 'yes'.\\" Regardless, Andreas has no plans to leave Offenbach. \\"Your child is getting supported - they have really good education systems here,\\" he says, hugging his toddler. \\"It's not like in Greece.\\" \\"I really want my son to graduate from university here - I want him to do what I couldn't do.\\" What was that article about?","output":"This article is about a man named Andreas who runs a Greek grill house in Germany.

Some people in Germany do not like the Greek people, and the Greek people do not like how they are treated. The European Central Bank will decide the future of Greece's banks soon, but many Greek people in Germany think Greece should go back to using their old money, the drachma.

A large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen. Long before Elia Kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies (not good ones), he made this better than average drama. Watching it you begin to notice how many decent, good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated. Contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large... preferably large, and unsubtle, and scandalous. Kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director. (um. No thanks)  His future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot. The plague is coming! But here's an atypical Richard Widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope; here's an almost watchable Barabra bel Geddes, with her bathos turned way down (well, for her); they're a couple and they share some nicely-written scenes about big crises and smaller ones. Here's an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships-crew; here's a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment. These are the small-scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life; something Hollywood, in its greed, now studiously avoids. These are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them. It's a personable, human-scaled film, not the grotesque, overscaled production that he and others (David Lean) will later popularize, whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as Pirates of the Caribean and Moulin Rouge. I just watched it twice and I'll be damned if I could tell you what Jack Palance is seeking in the final scenes, but it doesn't seem that important to me as a viewer. This reminds me of both No Way Out a Poitier noir with Widmark as the villain, and Naked City, which you should really get your hands on. Now, what is this review like? Choices: A). negative; B). positive;","output":"This review is B). positive.

A-Teens (stylized as A*Teens) were a Swedish pop music group from Stockholm, Sweden, formed by Niklas Berg in 1998 as an ABBA tribute band called ABBA Teens and later renamed A-Teens. The band members were Marie Serneholt, Amit Sebastian Paul, Dhani Lennevald and Sara Lumholdt. The band's debut album became a success around the world and in 2001 it was reported that the band had sold 6 million albums worldwide. After six years together, the band announced they would take a break in 2004 after the release of their Greatest Hits album. In 1998, Marie, Sara, Dhani, and Amit were musically united as the ABBA Teens. However, the group's name was changed to the A-Teens to avoid litigation. This choice allowed the band more freedom in creating their own style of music.  In early 1999, the band started the recording process of what would be their debut album, The ABBA Generation, consisting purely of ABBA covers reinterpreted with a modern pop and electronic flair to appeal to a new generation of young pop fans. Their first single, \\"Mamma Mia\\", topped the charts in over ten countries including their home country Sweden where it stayed at number one for eight consecutive weeks. The album hit the peak position in Sweden & Chile and became a top ten hit throughout the world. Further singles enjoyed similar success ensuring top ten placings across the globe, and the album overall sold more than 3 million copies worldwide, being certified Gold or Platinum in over 22 different countries.  The band's music video for \\"Dancing Queen\\" features a plot very similar to the 1985 John Hughes film The Breakfast Club. In addition, the principal seen in the music video was played by Paul Gleason, the same actor who was the principal in the film. The single reached ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone, being certified Gold.  In early 2000, the band embarked on a U.S. promotional tour, and on the verge of the release of their album in the United States, the band was invited to tour with Britney Spears that summer in her U.S. Tour. They also made several appearances on Disney and Nickelodeon to promote their music. The band's debut became a hit in North America, where the album reached seventy-one on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart being certified Gold in September 2000, but its sales reached the million mark in 2001.  That month, the A-Teens won a Viva Music Award for Best International Newcomer, competing with the likes of Christina Aguilera and Blink-182, and also the band announced what would be the lead single from their second album and their first to be an original song, \\"Upside Down\\", which would also become their signature song. The song was released to Swedish radios on 23 October 2000, and was later unleashed worldwide. When the single was commercially released, it reached number two in Sweden and was later certified 2x Platinum. The song became the band's biggest hit when it reached the top ten in several countries and when the single was released in the United States. The physical single reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 Single Sales Chart, selling over 500,000 copies in three weeks and being certified Gold.

Answer:","output":"In this situation, several outcomes could occur depending on the severity of Skylar's condition and the actions taken by Casey and others around them. Here's a detailed answer outlining various scenarios: 1. Mild reaction: It's possible that Skylar experienced a momentary drop in blood pressure or sugar levels, causing him to momentarily lose consciousness. In this case, after a few minutes, Skylar might regain consciousness, although he might feel slightly disoriented or weak. Casey should ensure that Skylar is in a comfortable position with his head elevated and legs raised slightly. Offering a small meal or sugary drink to Skylar might help his recovery in case of a blood sugar dip. If Skylar recovers fully without any further complications, they should still closely monitor him for any signs of distress, and he should avoid further alcohol consumption. 2. More serious reaction: If Skylar doesn't regain consciousness soon or shows signs of a more severe reaction, such as difficulty breathing, seizure, or signs of an allergic reaction (swelling, rashes, etc.), this could indicate a more serious issue. Casey should call emergency services immediately and provide essential information about Skylar's condition, including any known allergies or medical conditions, and that they were consuming alcohol at the time. 3. Alcohol poisoning: If indications point to alcohol poisoning, immediate medical attention is necessary. Signs of alcohol poisoning include confusion, vomiting, irregular breathing, and seizures. Casey should call for an ambulance and provide first aid while waiting for emergency services to arrive. Keeping Skylar on his side to avoid choking on vomit and monitoring his breathing are critically important. Once at the hospital, medical professionals will provide necessary treatment such as IV fluids, breathing support, or administration of activated charcoal to help absorb any remaining alcohol in Skylar's system. 4. Drug interaction: If Skylar unknowingly consumed a substance or medication that led to an adverse reaction with alcohol, it could cause serious health issues. This situation requires urgent medical attention. Casey should mention to the medical team any substances they suspect may have been ingested by Skylar to ensure prompt and appropriate treatment. 5. Underlying medical condition: A previously undiagnosed health issue may have caused Skylar's collapse. This could range from a heart condition or neurological issue to a metabolic disorder. In this case, it is vital that Skylar receives medical attention for proper diagnosis and management. In any scenario, it is essential that Skylar receives prompt care and attention. Casey should remain vigilant in observing Skylar's condition and be prepared to act accordingly based on his symptoms and needs. It is always better to err on the side of caution and seek professional advice to ensure Skylar's safety and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Mystery Incorporated, which is just one of the many iterations of the franchise. Scooby-Doo was first created in 1969 by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, originally developed for the Hanna-Barbera animation studio. The first series featuring Scooby-Doo and the gang was titled \\"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\\" which debuted on CBS on September 13, 1969, and ran for two seasons until 1970. This initial series introduced the core group of characters (Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne, and Velma) solving mysteries and encountering various spooky occurrences, often resulting in the unmasking of the villain. Throughout the years, the Scooby-Doo franchise has spawned numerous television series, films, and spin-offs. These adaptations often introduce new characters and storylines, with some focusing on members of the gang individually or bringing in popular guest stars. Some of the most notable Scooby-Doo franchise entries include \\"The Scooby-Doo Show\\" (1976-1978), \\"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\\" (1979-1980), \\"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\\" (1988-1991), \\"What's New, Scooby-Doo?\\" (2002-2006), \\"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\\" (2010-2013), and \\"Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?\\" (2019-present). In addition to television series, the Scooby-Doo universe has also been expanded through various direct-to-video films, such as the \\"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\\" (1998) and \\"Scooby-Doo and the Witch's Ghost\\" (1999). The franchise also ventured into live-action films, with the release of \\"Scooby-Doo\\" (2002) and \\"Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed\\" (2004), featuring a cast of well-known actors portraying the characters in a live-action setting. In summary, Scooby-Doo was created in 1969, with the original series \\"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\\" marking the beginning of this beloved franchise.

The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off.  Paragraph: Jake and his brother Jordan both have to go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled. Jake is allergic to the anesthetic unfortunately, so he has to have the procedure done without it. Jordan isn't allergic, so he is able to get his tooth pulled after an anesthetic is injected.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes? Answer:","output":"Jake will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes. The reason for this is that Jake is allergic to the anesthetic, which means he cannot receive the injection. As a result, there will be no anesthetic agent present in his gum or membrane structure to cause a shift in how ions move across the cell membrane. Since ion movement is not disrupted, nerve impulses will continue to be transmitted, and Jake will likely sense pain during the tooth extraction procedure. On the other hand, Jordan, who is not allergic to the anesthetic, will receive an injection before having his tooth pulled. The anesthetic will enter his gum and become part of the membrane structure, causing a disruption in ion movement across the cell membrane. This disruption prevents nerve impulses from being transmitted, and Jordan will not sense pain until the anesthetic wears off."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So the equation becomes: -263 * g + 164 * g = 0 Now, let's combine the 'g' terms on the left side: (-263 + 164) * g = 0 This simplifies to: -99 * g = 0 Now, to get 'g' by itself, let's divide both sides of the equation by -99: g = 0 / -99 Since 0 divided by any number is 0, we find: g = 0 So our solution is g = 0.

Answer:","output":"Princess Myat Paya Lat was born on 4th October 1883 in the Royal Palace to King Thibaw and Queen Supayalat in Mandalay, Burma. Her native name was Myat Paya Lat. As a member of the Burmese royal family, she was of Burmese nationality. Unfortunately, there is no readily available image of her, but given her royal status, it is likely that formal portraits were taken during her lifetime. On 20th February 1917, Myat Paya Lat married Khin Maung Lat Raja Sahib, who was the private secretary to ex-King Thibaw. He was also an officer in the Indian Police and a nephew of King Thibaw, making him a relative of Princess Myat Paya Lat. Khin Maung Lat Raja Sahib was the son of the \\"Duke and Duchess\\" of Ngape and Mindat. The wedding took place at the Collector's Bungalow in Ratnagiri, Bombay, India. Princess Myat Paya Lat did not have biological children, but she adopted the son of her Nepalese maidservant. This child would become her heir and a member of her immediate family. After the death of her father, King Thibaw, in 1916, Princess Myat Paya Lat became the most senior member of the Burmese royal household. Her father, Thibaw, was the last king of Burma before the country was annexed by British forces in 1885. As a result, the royal family was exiled to India, where they lived for several decades. Myat Paya Lat passed away on 4th April 1956 in Kalimpong, India. Kalimpong is a small town in the Indian state of West Bengal, which was her place of death. It is not expressly mentioned in the bio, but her religious affiliation was likely to be Theravada Buddhism, as it was the predominant religion in Burma at the time, particularly among the royal family. In summary, Princess Myat Paya Lat was born on 4th October 1883 in Mandalay, Burma, to King Thibaw and Queen Supayalat, making her a Burmese national. She married Khin Maung Lat Raja Sahib and adopted the son of her Nepalese maidservant. After her father's death in 1916, she became the most senior member of the Burmese royal household.

Write a text based on \\"israeli minister backs w. bank settlement expansion\\" Text:","output":"Title: Israeli Minister Supports Expanding West Bank Settlements: Analyzing the Implications Introduction Recent reports have indicated that an Israeli minister has vocalized strong support for expanding the West Bank settlements. This news has generated controversy, as the expansion of settlements in this region has long been a contentious issue between Israelis and Palestinians. In this analysis, we will delve into the minister's supporting arguments, and we will also discuss potential implications on the peace process between Israel and Palestine. Israeli Minister's Stance on West Bank Settlement Expansion The Israeli minister, reportedly, argued that the expansion of settlements in the West Bank is a strategic move for Israel. The minister posited that doing so would strengthen Israel's security and sovereignty, ultimately guaranteeing a stronger Israeli presence in the West Bank. Moreover, the minister cited an increase in Israel's population and the subsequent need for new housing and infrastructure development as the underlying argument for expansion. It was highlighted that the West Bank presents an ideal location for accommodating Israel's growing population. Potential Implications on the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process However, the proposition of expanding settlements in the West Bank has ruffled quite a few diplomatic feathers, with concerns that this development could have severe ramifications. Notably, the expansion of Israeli settlements jeopardizes the possibility of a two-state solution, which has long been the cornerstone of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine. The Palestinian Authority has repeatedly called for a halt in settlement expansion, arguing that it undermines the establishment of a viable, independent, and contiguous Palestinian state. Therefore, supporting the expansion of settlements in the West Bank could alienate Palestinians from the peace process, and further deteriorate the already strained relations between the two nations. International Reactions and Consequences Several international players, including the United Nations, European Union, and the United States, have raised concerns over Israeli settlement expansion into the West Bank as well. The international community has affirmed their support for a two-state solution and considers the expansion of settlements in the West Bank to be illegal under international law. Therefore, proceeding with the expansion of settlements could result in diplomatic fallout between Israel and its allies. In the long run, Israel could find itself isolated from the international community in the face of persistent insistence on expanding settlements. Conclusion While the Israeli minister's backing of the West Bank settlement expansion may appeal to some domestic constituents, it is crucial to consider the broader implications of such an action. The potential derailment of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, coupled with decreasing international support, should be thoroughly analyzed before any definitive steps are taken. The complexity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict warrants a cautious and sensitive approach to resolving its underlying issues. Encouraging the expansion of West Bank settlements may provide short-term advantages, but the long-term consequences — particularly regarding the prospect of peace in the region — should be prioritized for a lasting and meaningful resolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The garden, a vital space designed to provide comfort and respite for children suffering from terminal illnesses, was the scene of a senseless crime. The thieves callously slashed the wires and ripped down the cherished garden decorations before fleeing the scene, showing a complete disregard for the vulnerable children who rely on the hospice's services. The appalling theft was discovered when staff arrived for work the next day, greeted by the sight of their once-beautiful garden in shambles. The importance of the garden at Julia's House cannot be overstated; it provides a serene and joyful space where children who are gravely ill can escape the confines of their wards to enjoy precious moments in nature. To see this haven defiled by thieves was a devastating blow to the staff, who work tirelessly to provide the best possible care and emotional support to families in their darkest hours. Julia's House Children's Hospice is a vitally essential service for families in the region. The compassionate staff work tirelessly to provide specialized care for children suffering from terminal illnesses, offering respite and end-of-life care in a peaceful and nurturing environment. This senseless act of vandalism is a stark reminder that even the most noble of causes can become the unsuspecting targets of violent criminals, leaving children and their families to suffer the cruel consequences of their actions. The community was outraged and heartbroken upon learning of the cruel theft, rallying together to offer their support and raise funds for the reparation of the Hospice's garden. This show of solidarity echoes a simple yet powerful message: even in the face of such heartlessness, the resilience and love of the community can shine through and bring people together in the name of a common cause. It is crucial now, more than ever, for those touched by the story to come forward and offer their support. The children and families who rely on Julia's House are already facing insurmountable challenges; it is essential that their sanctuary is restored, and the thoughtless actions of these thieves do not overshadow the joy and solace that the hospice provides. As authorities search for the perpetrators, the community remains united and hopeful that justice will be served. Until then, Julia's House Children's Hospice is striving to rebuild their garden area, ensuring that the priceless moments of joy and laughter that emanate from its grounds can continue to be experienced by the children in their care. In the shadow of this deplorable act, the community has shown that they will not be deterred from their mission to support Julia's House and the families who rely on them.

Question: \\"What was the basis of the beef that the NAACP had?\\"  Context: \\"On August 18, 1970, the NAACP filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken, charging de facto public school segregation. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city's school district.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The basis of the beef that the NAACP had was the de facto public school segregation in Michigan, particularly in the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties.

Here's why: 1. First sentence: \\"Brighton Beach railway station is located on the Sandringham line in Victoria, Australia, and serves the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Brighton.\\" This sentence tells us that the Brighton Beach railway station is on the Sandringham line and that it's located in Victoria, Australia. It serves a suburb of Melbourne called Brighton.  2. Second sentence: \\"Sandringham Railway Station is located on Brighton Beach line in Victoria, Brighton, and serves south-eastern Australia, suburbs of Melbourne.\\" This sentence completely changes many elements of the information compared to the first sentence. Here the subject is Sandringham Railway Station instead of Brighton Beach Railway Station. It suggests that the Sandringham station is on the Brighton Beach line (which contradicts the Sandringham line mentioned in the first sentence). It also states that the station is in Brighton, Victoria specifically, which is not clearly said in the first sentence. Then it suggests the station serves the entire south-eastern part of Australia and suburbs of Melbourne more broadly, while the first sentence indicates the station specifically serves the suburb of Brighton in Melbourne.

Hubert participated in his inaugural Dakar Rally in 1979. This was the second edition of this prestigious off-road endurance event, which has since become an iconic race in the world of motorsports. Known for its grueling nature and challenging terrain, the Dakar Rally tests the limits of both man and machine as competitors traverse various landscapes, such as deserts, mountains, and dunes. In the 1979 edition, Hubert got his first taste of the extreme demands that the rally would place on him, both physically and mentally. This experience would undoubtedly contribute to his later successes. In the following years, Hubert continued to race in the Dakar Rally, honing his skills and building a strong rapport with his BMW R80GS motorcycle. The BMW R80GS was a powerful endurance racing machine developed by the German brand, designed for off-road competitions. Its technical specifications made it a perfect companion for Hubert in his quest for Dakar Rally glory. His persistence would pay off in 1981 when Hubert emerged victorious in the race riding his trusty BMW R80GS. This was a significant achievement for both Hubert and BMW, as it showcased the capabilities of their endurance racing motorcycle and demonstrated the impressive resilience of the rider. Two years later, in 1983, Hubert once again piloted his BMW R80GS to victory in the Dakar Rally, proving that his initial triumph was not a fluke. This second win established Hubert as one of the top competitors in the event, earning him a place in the annals of Dakar Rally history. The back-to-back victories also cemented the formidable partnership between Hubert and his BMW R80GS, making them a force to be reckoned with in the world of endurance racing. In conclusion, Hubert's impressive record in the Dakar Rally began with his first participation in the 1979 event, which was the second-ever edition of this challenging race. His determination, grit, and skill would eventually lead him to two memorable wins in 1981 and 1983 while riding his BMW R80GS motorcycle. These victories solidified his status as a fierce competitor in the realm of endurance racing and highlighted the incredible bond between man and machine in one of the most unforgiving motorsport events worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

If you are overweight, you might want to consider talking to your doctor about a healthy weight loss plan. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you periods be shorter and lighter overall.  Regardless of weight, women who live sedentary lifestyles tend to have longer periods. Moderate physical activity, in the form of 45 minutes to an hour of exercise a day, can result in shorter periods. Exercise can come in the form a sport you enjoy, a brisk walk, cardiovascular exercise, or jogging.  Be careful about overdoing it. Sometimes, excessive exercise can cause menstruation to stop altogether. This can be dangerous, especially if you're not getting the proper nutrients while working out. You should always consult your doctor before adjusting your workout routine. While the effects of diet on menstruation are debated, some studies do indicate a low fat diet full of healthy carbohydrates might result in shorter periods.  A diet rich in complex carbohydrates, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, while low in sugar and alcohol can reduce symptoms like cramping and mood swings associated with menstruation. It may also shorten the overall length of your menstrual cycle.  A few studies exist that indicate a low fat diet may also shorten menstrual periods, at least to a small degree.  As weight loss can lead to shorter periods, altering your diet if you're overweight may help with weight loss and therefore reduce period length. However, you should always talk to your doctor before making any decisions about losing weight. Disrupted or limited sleep contributes to stress, which can lead to longer, painful periods. Getting on a regular, healthy sleep schedule can help you better regulate your emotions.  Losing even a few hours of sleep can lead to increased stress, anger, and anxiety. All of these things can manipulate hormone levels and lead to a heavier, longer period.  Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, including weekends. Your body will adjust to this schedule and you'll settle into a regular sleep schedule. When you wake up, set the alarm for the time you actually plan on being awake. Using the snooze button can lead to interrupted, unpleasant sleep that can leave you tired throughout the day. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a good diet, and getting enough sleep can help make periods shorter and lighter for girls and women.

A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate.

Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  Paragraph: Beth and Sally are both on the high school basketball team and are about to play a match against their rival school.

The speaker uses phrases such as \\"uh,\\" \\"you know,\\" \\"I think,\\" \\"I guess,\\" and \\"what they call it.\\" These expressions point towards the speaker's lack of confidence, certainty, or knowledge about the subject they are discussing, in this case, the eclectic style of music. The hypothesis \\"The speaker does not know about the eclectic type of music\\" stems from these linguistic cues that suggest the speaker's limited knowledge or understanding of the topic. However, it is crucial to note that the speaker does seem to have some awareness about the concept of eclectic music. They acknowledge that it involves drawing from various sources and combining elements to form a unique or new style of music. Hence, the speaker may have a basic idea or limited understanding of what eclectic music is, but they lack the expertise or a deeper understanding of the concept. What this tells us about the hypothesis \\"The speaker does not know about the eclectic type of music\\" is that it might be partially accurate. The speaker most likely has a rudimentary understanding of eclectic music but lacks a comprehensive grasp of the topic. Their uncertainty and vague descriptions suggest that they need further information to accurately and confidently discuss eclectic music.  It is important to recognize that knowledge exists on a continuum, ranging from complete ignorance to expert-level understanding. In this case, the speaker seems to reside somewhere in between those two extremes, demonstrating some awareness of eclectic music but not enough to discuss it confidently. Additionally, their unsure language might also indicate communication difficulties rather than a lack of knowledge. So, while the hypothesis may be partially valid, it would be more accurate to say that the speaker has a limited understanding of eclectic music rather than implying they have no knowledge about it at all."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - A psychologist is a professional who evaluates and studies behavior and mental processes (see also psychology). Typically, psychologists must have completed a university degree in psychology, which is a master's degree in some countries and a doctorate in others. This definition of psychologist is non-exclusive; in most jurisdictions, members of other professions (such as counselors and psychiatrists) can also evaluate, diagnose, treat, and study mental processes. Some psychologists, such as clinical and counseling psychologists, provide mental health care, and some psychologists, such as social or organizational psychologists conduct research and provide consultation services.  - The central nervous system (CNS) is the part of the nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord. The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from, and coordinates and influences the activity of all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animalsthat is, all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfishand it contains the majority of the nervous system. Many consider the retina and the optic nerve (2nd cranial nerve), as well as the olfactory nerves (1st) and olfactory epithelium as parts of the CNS, synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia. Following this classification the olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the environment, which opens up for therapeutic treatments.  - Psychotherapy is the use of psychological methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, to help a person change and overcome problems in desired ways. Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual's well-being and mental health, to resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions, and to improve relationships and social skills. Certain psychotherapies are considered evidence-based for treating some diagnosed mental disorders.  - Arthur Janov (born August 21, 1924) is an American psychologist, psychotherapist, and the creator of primal therapy, a treatment for mental illness that involves repeatedly descending into, feeling, and experiencing long-repressed childhood pain. Janov directs a psychotherapy institute called the Primal Center in Santa Monica, California. Janov is the author of many books, most notably \\"The Primal Scream\\" (1970).  - Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, or bumping the \\"funny bone\\". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: \\"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.\\" In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition.  - The Primal Scream . Primal Therapy : The Cure for Neurosis is a 1970 book by Arthur Janov , the inventor of Primal therapy .  - Santa Monica is a beachfront city in western Los Angeles County, California, United States. Situated on Santa Monica Bay, it is bordered on three sides by the city of Los Angeles  Pacific Palisades to the north, Brentwood on the northeast, Sawtelle on the east, Mar Vista on the southeast, and Venice on the south. The Census Bureau population for Santa Monica in 2010 was 89,736.  - Primal therapy is a trauma-based psychotherapy created by Arthur Janov, who argues that neurosis is caused by the repressed pain of childhood trauma. Janov argues that repressed pain can be sequentially brought to conscious awareness and resolved through re-experiencing the incident and fully expressing the resulting pain during therapy. In therapy, the patient recalls and reenacts a particularly disturbing past experience usually occurring early in life and expresses normally repressed anger or frustration especially through spontaneous and unrestrained screams, hysteria, or violence. Primal therapy was developed as a means of eliciting the repressed pain; the term \\"Pain\\" is capitalized in discussions of primal therapy when referring to any repressed emotional distress and its purported long-lasting psychological effects. Janov criticizes the talking therapies as they deal primarily with the cerebral cortex and higher-reasoning areas and do not access the source of Pain within the more basic parts of the central nervous system.

A drug company learned the hard way last November when online mothers found an ad targeting moms to be offensivedl , which result in a hot debate on the micro-blogging site Twitter.The company had to take the video ad down from its website and apologized for any offense caused. The online survey also found that mothers aren't going to the doctor as often.Instead they are using the Internet to find out what is wrong with their children and, when they do go to the doctor, asking which drug they should use rather than for a diagnosis.In online communities children's health issues are the leading topic of interest rating as high as 91 percent followed by childhood development tips at 79 percent and product reviews at 72 percent.

Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods.

The first question is asking how to use a device called an HDMI splitter to connect two monitors. An HDMI splitter takes one HDMI signal (like from your laptop), and splits it into more signals so you could show the same thing on two screens. Think about it like splitting a piece of cake into two pieces to share. The second question is asking about connecting a specific laptop, an HP laptop, to two monitors, but it doesn't say how. This could be done with an HDMI splitter like the first question suggested, but it could also be done with other methods, like using different types of ports or even wireless connections. So, while they're very similar, they're asking slightly different things. It's like asking how to paint a picture with blue paint, versus asking how to paint a specific picture — one is more general, the other more specific."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Victoria said it was important to be a good citizen but Mary said it didn't matter.","output":"Victoria said it was important to be a good citizen, but Mary said it didn't matter. Victoria believed that being a good citizen was essential for building a strong, thriving society where everyone could work together harmoniously. She argued that good citizens were the foundation of any successful nation, as they played their part in maintaining order, respecting the rights of others, and contributing to their community's well-being. On the other hand, Mary held a different perspective. She felt that being a good citizen was not a priority, as the government and various institutions were in place to deal with societal issues. Mary argued that if each person focused on their individual goals, they would eventually contribute positively to the larger community as a result of their personal achievements. In essence, Mary viewed individualism as the key to a prosperous society rather than a collective effort based on being a good citizen. Despite their differing viewpoints, Victoria and Mary often engaged in healthy discussions to better understand each other's beliefs. Victoria explained that being a good citizen involved several key aspects, such as: 1. Civic responsibility: This includes voting, staying informed about political issues, and engaging in constructive dialogue with others. By doing so, citizens contribute to solutions that benefit society as a whole.   2. Abiding by laws and regulations: Laws are created to ensure public safety and maintain order. Good citizens respect these regulations, understanding that they are in place for the greater good. 3. Paying taxes: Good citizens contribute financially to public services and infrastructure that support everyone in society. 4. Volunteering and supporting community initiatives: Through hands-on efforts, good citizens take part in initiatives that address challenges faced by their community. 5. Environmental stewardship: Good citizens recognize the importance of taking care of the planet and strive to reduce their environmental impact. 6. Empathy and respect for others: A good citizen treats all individuals with kindness, regardless of their background, race, religion, or beliefs. Mary understood Victoria's points but maintained that individuals should take care of their personal interests first. She argued that doing so would create a chain reaction where people, when working towards their best interests, inadvertently contribute to the betterment of society as well. Mary believed that focusing on personal growth, career, and happiness was the best way for someone to make a positive impact on society. As their conversations continued, both Victoria and Mary learned from one another. Victoria began to appreciate the potential for individual achievements in driving societal progress, while Mary started to acknowledge the importance of some collective efforts in upholding a stable and prosperous community. In the end, despite their contrasting perspectives, their friendship and respectful discourse only served to enrich their understanding of what it means to be a good citizen. The discourse between Victoria and Mary highlights the complexities and nuances that exist in the concept of being a good citizen. What one person perceives as the best way to contribute to society may differ significantly from another's point of view. Ultimately, the conversation between these two friends serves as a reminder of the importance of open dialogue and a willingness to learn from others' perspectives, resulting in a more well-rounded understanding of what it truly means to be a good citizen."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How much you'll need for each of these expenses will depend on the value of the property and your business model. Start by compiling money from your savings and investment accounts. (2) is incorrect because creating a spreadsheet of popular hotels in the area does not directly help to determine how much money to save for purchasing a hotel. It can be useful for market research and understanding the competition, but it does not provide the financial information needed to save for purchasing a hotel. (3) is incorrect because this option talks about the hotel running out of money before being purchased, which is not relevant to the buyer's process. Furthermore, deducting money from down payments is not a practical approach to keep the business running. Instead, a proper cash flow management and contingency plan is necessary. (4) is incorrect because focusing on making money within the first few months might not be realistic, given the initial operating expenses and potential challenges of a new business. It's important to be prepared for a longer period before expecting profits, and to have a solid financial plan that accounts for all the necessary expenses and potential unforeseen costs.

Mantua is the ancestral city where the male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled, first as marquesses, then after 1540 as dukes, in vassalage to the Holy Roman Empire. Monferrato was a duchy since 1574 on the eastern side of Piedmont, and an Imperial fief since the eleventh or twelfth century. The Gonzagas had enlarged their realm with Monferrato after receiving it in dowry from the wife of duke Frederick II Gonzaga. On 22 September 1612, Francis IV, Duke of Mantua and Monferrato died at the age of 26. His death occurred only a couple of months after the death of his father Vincent I, Duke of Mantua. He left only a three-year-old daughter, Maria of Mantua. Francis IV also had two younger brothers who, both being cardinals, could not marry and were thus ineligible to succeed to Mantua's throne. Nonetheless, Francis' two brothers, Ferdinando I  and Vincenzo II , eventually did become Dukes of Mantua. Despite marrying, following the resignation of Ferdinando and the expulsion of Vincenzo from the Sacred College of Cardinals, neither produced any legitimate children. A crisis erupted when Vincenzo II died on 26 December 1627 at the age of 33, the same day that his niece Maria Gonzaga's marriage with Charles de Nevers was celebrated. Nevers was the eldest son and heir of Charles, Duke of Nevers, Rethel and Mayenne. Moreover, he was the head of the cadet branch of the House of Gonzaga, and after Vincenzo II, heir male of the Duchy of Mantua.

A trader named Trader A was working for Bank A. He noticed country M has pegged its currency to a fixed price while country N did not do that. He opted to trade country M currency. Across the aisle his colleague trader B was working for bank B. He traded country N's currency.  But I can use this background: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1]  What is an answer for this question: Would country M's currenccy be traded or not traded in the balck market? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, it is likely that country M's currency would be traded in the black market. This is because the fixed exchange rate set by the government may not accurately represent the true value of the currency, leading to the creation of a parallel market with higher exchange rates. The discrepancy between the official and black market rates could incentivize traders to engage in illegal transactions, trading country M's currency in the black market for stronger currencies at more favorable rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages.

They may have learned about pie making from the Greeks. These pies were sometimes made in\\"reeds  \\", which were used for the purpose of holding the filling ( ), and were not eaten. The Romans spread the word about pies around Europe and the word\\"pie\\"became a popular word in the 14th century. The first pie recipe   was also published by the Romans. Pies first appeared in England as early as the twelfth century. The early pies were mostly meat pies. There was actually more crust than filling. Often these pies were made from fowl ( ) and the fowl's legs were left to hang over the side of the dish and used as handles. Fruit pies were probably first made in the 1500s. It is said that Queen Elizabeth I made the first cherry pie. Pie came to America with the first English settlers. The early settlers cooked their pies in long narrow pans. As in the Roman times, the early American pie crusts were often not eaten, but simply used to hold the filling during baking(@&*).

An upcoming Pasadena, California location is the first to bear the Dunkin’ only branding, but will be the first of multiple locations included in the trial.      “While we remain the number one retailer of donuts in the country, as part of our efforts to reinforce that Dunkin’ Donuts is a beverage-led brand and coffee leader, we will be testing signage in a few locations that refer to the brand simply as “Dunkin’,” according to a company statement.      The company does not consider this a departure from current branding.      “We have been referring to ourselves simply as Dunkin’ in our advertising for more than a decade, ever since we introduced our ‘America Runs on Dunkin’ campaign,” said the spokesperson.      The trial run on the rebranded name may become part of a larger redesign that is set to roll out during mid-late 2018, and Dunkin’ Brands plans to determine “Dunkin’s” permanence at that time.      The move reinforces comments made by chairman and CEO Nigel Travis during the company’s second quarter earnings call last week.

It is an adaptation of the 1986 non-fiction book \\"Wiseguy\\" by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese. The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate Henry Hill and his friends over a period from 1955 to 1980. Can we infer the following? Goodfellas didn't exist in the 70's","output":"You are correct in asserting that the Goodfellas movie did not exist in the 1970s because the film was released in 1990. However, the story it is based on had its roots in the experiences of mob associate Henry Hill, who lived through the events portrayed in the film from 1955 to 1980. Goodfellas was adapted from Nicholas Pileggi's 1986 non-fiction book \\"Wiseguy.\\" Pileggi spent several years interviewing and researching the life of Henry Hill, a former mob associate who later became an FBI informant. The story follows Hill and his friends' involvement in the Lucchese crime family and their various activities related to organized crime during the period between the 1950s and the 1980s. While the film itself didn't exist during the 1970s, the events and characters depicted in the storyline had real-life counterparts who committed organized crime activities during that time. Still, it wasn't until Pileggi's book and Scorsese's adaptation that their story reached a broader audience. In summary, Goodfellas as a film did not exist in the '70s, but the true events and experiences of the people it is based on were taking place during that time. The movie offers a vivid portrayal of mob life and culture from that era, presenting a snapshot of the criminal underworld that did exist in some form during the 1970s, albeit not as a cinematic production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is certain, however, is that around 120,000 years ago, at least, the modern Homo sapiens first appeared and lived contemporaneously with the Neanderthal for at least 90,000 years, until the Neanderthal disappeared 30,000 years ago. Can we infer the following? Neanderthals were hunched and stupid.","output":"While it is true that modern Homo sapiens and Neanderthals lived contemporaneously for a significant period of time and that the Neanderthal species disappeared around 30,000 years ago, it is not accurate to simply label Neanderthals as \\"hunched and stupid.\\" This characterization is based on outdated misconceptions and does not reflect the current understanding of Neanderthal biology, culture, and cognitive abilities. 1. Neanderthal posture: The belief that Neanderthals were hunched over comes from early interpretations of their remains. Since then, our understanding of their anatomy has evolved. It is now evident that while Neanderthals had a more robust body structure and some skeletal differences compared to modern humans, they were not as significantly hunched as previously thought. Their posture was not too dissimilar from that of Homo sapiens. Neanderthals had broader hips, shorter limbs, and a more barrel-shaped torso, which were likely adaptations to help them cope with the cold climate they lived in. 2. Neanderthal intelligence: The idea of Neanderthals being less intelligent than Homo sapiens is also an outdated stereotype. Recent research reveals that Neanderthals were, in fact, quite intelligent, with cognitive abilities similar to those of modern humans. Some of their accomplishments include: a. Tool-making: Neanderthals created sophisticated tools, such as the Mousterian stone tools, which show a mastery of various techniques, including the Levallois technique for knapping stone flakes. b. Hunting: Neanderthal hunting strategies were advanced and effective. They were skilled at stalking, ambush, and cooperative hunting of large animals, including mammoths and bison. c. Language and communication: Some researchers believe that Neanderthals possessed the capacity for complex language and communication. This view is supported by the discovery of a hyoid bone, a crucial component of the vocal apparatus, in Neanderthal remains. The presence of this bone suggests that they had the anatomical capabilities for speech. d. Art and culture: Evidence for Neanderthal symbolic behavior and artistic expression has been discovered in recent years. For example, in several caves in Europe, there are signs of Neanderthal art, such as geometric patterns and handprints. Additionally, in a Spanish cave, researchers found perforated shells, which may have been used as jewelry by Neanderthals. e. Complex social structures: Neanderthal living sites demonstrate spatial organization, with designated areas for specific tasks and activities. Additionally, there is evidence of Neanderthal compassion, as they buried their dead and cared for the wounded and elderly members of their communities. In conclusion, the notion of Neanderthals being hunched and stupid is no longer supported by the scientific community. New evidence shows that they were intelligent beings with a high degree of cognitive abilities, culture, and sophistication, similar to that of the contemporary Homo sapiens. As our understanding of human evolution and prehistory continues to advance, it is important to reassess and update our perspectives on the Neanderthal species."},{"instruction":"Pick one category for the following text.

Funny but it's the small things I recall best about her, like the way her hair reeked of bonfires and how that little old checkered dress of hers rode right up her thigh with no help from me. After we'd finished our business we'd head over the trout farm and I'd hunker down and poach us up a couple of rainbows for our tea. That Mitzi Barker, she was thin as an ear of barley and I always figured a good nosh-up was the least I could do for her troubles. Question: The narrator and Mitzi would eat trout: Options:  A. Never.  B. after they had relations.  C. not enough information  D. before they would have relations.  === The correct answer is","output":"B. after they had relations.   The narrator mentions that after they had finished their business (or relations), they would go to the trout farm where he would catch a couple of rainbow trout for their meal. He did this because he noticed how thin Mitzi Barker was and felt that a good meal was the least he could provide for her troubles. So, they would enjoy the trout meal post their rendezvous. Therefore, option B is the correct one."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

When a second child arrives, parents are more relaxed. The second child has to compete  with the first-born for the parents' attention and love.

I thought that \\"Scary Movie\\" although not a great movie was very good and funny. \\"Scary Movie 2\\" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid. The Exorcist/Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. Now, I'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all. But bad comedy is still bad comedy. Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes drag out way to long. Also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying. The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless. Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie. For example, the 'creaming' I guess you would call it of Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in \\"Scary Movie\\" because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her. But this time around it was out of place and not funny. The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around. The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film. Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie. But I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film. The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film. Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes. Choose your answer.

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"Binignit is a traditional Filipino dessert that features a delightful combination of flavors and textures, offering a sumptuous treat for those with a sweet tooth. The data provided here gives us information about two main components of this delicious dessert. The first piece of information outlines that the main ingredient in Binignit is sweet potato. Sweet potatoes are nutritious root vegetables that are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They are also an exceptional source of beta-carotene, which gives them their vibrant orange color. In the preparation of Binignit, sweet potatoes are usually peeled, cut into bite-sized pieces, and cooked until soft and tender. The natural sweetness of these root vegetables lends a delightful flavor to the dessert, pairing well with the other ingredients. The second piece of data tells us that Binignit also includes coconut milk as an important ingredient. Coconut milk is a creamy, rich liquid obtained by grating the flesh of mature coconuts and soaking it in water, then straining out the solid particles. The resulting milk is a versatile ingredient commonly used in various cuisines, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. When used in Binignit, coconut milk imparts a slightly sweet and nutty flavor to the dish, as well as a luxurious, velvety mouthfeel. From this data, we can surmise that Binignit is a dessert with a base that primarily consists of sweet potatoes and coconut milk. This tasty treat is often simmered over low heat until the sweet potatoes are cooked to a soft consistency, allowing the different flavors to meld together harmoniously. Beyond the two main ingredients mentioned, Binignit may also incorporate other elements such as ripe bananas, saba bananas, taro, jackfruit, glutinous rice balls, tapioca pearls, and sugar to further sweeten and enhance the dish. In conclusion, the data provided gives a glimpse into the central components of Binignit, a traditional Filipino dessert characterized by its main ingredient, sweet potatoes, and the inclusion of coconut milk. This delightful dessert typically combines additional flavors like bananas, jackfruit, and tapioca pearls to create a satisfyingly sweet and comforting treat enjoyed by many across the Philippines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you're nervous about you and this person reconnecting, others can offer a great buffer. Invite several mutual friends over to your house for a game night, or out to an event in your town. Use the group activity to chat your acquaintance and remind them how much fun you can be. A group activity lowers the pressure that can be present in a one-on-one interaction. This is a smart route to take if you're unsure about why the person is losing interest in you. You can tease out information without any unnecessary tension. Don’t complain to your friend or start calling them more often to make up for their lack of contact. This behavior will annoy them, and they will probably start avoiding you even more.  Don’t jump to conclusions. Your friend may just be busy. Act normal and see if the situation clears itself up. It will probably take several attempts and conversations before you can restore your friendship. Keep reaching out to them occasionally, but give them the time and space that they need. When you’re around the person, act friendly and cheerful. Don’t be passive-aggressive, even if you’re feeling miffed about their lack of contact. Tell them you’re glad to see them, but don’t act like your happiness depends on their attention. You may want to think of a few topics to discuss ahead of time. This will help the conversation flow naturally. For example, you might discuss new hobbies, summer plans, favorite TV shows, or family news. Summary:","output":"To reconnect with a friend you haven't heard from in a while, reach out to them through a call or email, keeping the tone casual and expressing that you miss them. Suggest meeting up for an activity you both once enjoyed or trying out something new together. Be open to their suggestions and try group activities to ease tension and rebuild your bond. Avoid complaining or being too clingy, and give them time and space. Act normal and friendly when you're around them, making it clear that you're happy to see them, but not overly dependent on their attention. Be patient and remember that it may take several attempts before your friendship is restored."},{"instruction":"Title: Bland and Biased Product review: I would have strong hesitations suggesting this book.

We achieve this by subtracting 335 from both sides of the equation. 67*q + 335 - 335 = 0 - 335 The equation now becomes: 67*q = -335 Step 3: Solve for q by dividing both sides by 67. 67*q / 67 = -335/67 This simplifies to: q = -5 So the solution for the equation -103*q + 170*q + 335 = 0 is q = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: napkin Available choices:  -can clean a  counter top   -are tougher than counter top","output":"Option 1 - Can clean a counter top:  Napkins are versatile household items that have various applications, including cleaning counter tops. Here's how you can use a napkin to clean a counter top effectively: 1. Gather your materials: To clean a counter top using a napkin, you will need a napkin (either paper or cloth) and a cleaning solution (either homemade or store-bought). 2. Prepare the cleaning solution: You can mix a simple homemade solution by combining equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle or use your favorite store-bought cleaning product suitable for the counter top material. 3. Spray the solution: Generously spray the cleaning solution onto the counter top, ensuring that it's evenly distributed. For more stubborn stains or spills, let the solution sit on the surface for a few minutes to help dissolve any dirt or grime. 4. Fold the napkin: Fold the napkin in half or quarters to provide a clean surface for wiping. This will enable you to maximize the effectiveness of the napkin without having to use multiple napkins. 5. Wipe the counter top: Gently, but firmly, use the folded napkin to wipe the counter top using straight, uniform strokes. Apply more pressure around stained areas and be sure to cover the entire surface of the counter top. 6. Rinse the napkin: As you wipe, your napkin will become dirty. Rinse it under running water or dip it into a bucket of clean water before wringing it out and continuing with the cleaning process. 7. Buff the counter top: After you've successfully wiped the entire counter top and removed any spills or stains, use a dry, clean section of the napkin or a separate clean napkin to buff the surface, leaving it streak-free, dry, and shiny. 8. Dispose of the napkin or wash it: If you used a paper napkin, discard it after use. If you used a cloth napkin, wash it in a washing machine or by hand to ensure it's clean and ready for future use. By using a napkin to clean your counter tops, you can maintain a clean, hygienic, and visually appealing kitchen space while reducing your reliance on disposable wipes or paper towels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This ceremony marked the transition from child to adult status and the assumption of adult responsibilities. The age of participation varied throughout history and depended on factors such as sex, political climate, and social status. Most participants were aristocratic children between the ages of 10 and 20, and most descriptions of genpuku focus on the male ceremony rather that the female ceremony due to the exclusion of women from politically important court positions and warrior status. Important changes in clothing and hairstyle typically denoted this transition, for both men and women. Youth and children were often synonymous, and a period of adolescence was not often present throughout the periods in which traditional genpuku flourished. The etymology of the word, which is atypical, reflects the major points of genpuku ceremonial format; in this case \\"gen\\" ()means \\"head\\" and \\"fuku\\" () means \\"wearing\\".

Given the question: I can use this background: Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years.  Now, I have a new situation: Two medical students had to study about viruses that cause cancers in humans. Brady studied about hepatitis viruses, while Dean studied about human papillomaviruses and Herpesviridae.  Answer this question please: Which student read less about liver cancer? The answer is:","output":"Dean read less about liver cancer. Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the background. - Hepatitis viruses can lead to liver cancer. - Human papillomaviruses cause cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. - Herpesviridae: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma; Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Step 2: Analyze the students' topics of study. - Brady studied about hepatitis viruses. - Dean studied about human papillomaviruses and Herpesviridae. Step 3: Compare the focus of each student's study topic related to liver cancer. - Brady's topic (hepatitis viruses) is directly related to liver cancer. - Dean's topics (human papillomaviruses and Herpesviridae) do not have a direct connection to liver cancer. Step 4: Determine which student read less about liver cancer based on their study topics. - As hepatitis viruses are directly connected to liver cancer and neither human papillomaviruses nor Herpesviridae has a direct relation to liver cancer, we can conclude that Dean read less about liver cancer compared to Brady."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q: Passage: Hoping to rebound from their Monday Night loss to the Packers, the Broncos flew to Ford Field for a Week 9 interconference duel with the Detroit Lions.  In the first quarter, Denver trailed early as Lions kicker Jason Hanson managed to get a 43-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Broncos continued to struggle as Hanson gave Detroit a 53-yard field goal, while QB Jon Kitna completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Mike Furrey.  The Lions would end the half with Hanson kicking a 38-yard field goal.  Even worse, starting QB Jay Cutler (3/4 for 20 yards) would leave the game with a lower left leg injury. In the third quarter, Detroit continued to destroy Denver as DE Dewayne White returned a fumble 3 yards for a touchdown, while Kitna completed a 49-yard TD pass to WR Shaun McDonald.  In the fourth quarter, the Lions finished their job as NT Shaun Rogers returned an interception 66 yards for a touchdown, while RB T. J. Duckett got a 3-yard TD run.  The Broncos prevented a shutout when QB Patrick Ramsey completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley. This would be the second time this year that the Broncos lost by at least 37 points. A:","output":"1. Question: What was the total field goal distance that Jason Hanson achieved in the first half of the game?    Reasoning: To answer this question, one needs to locate the 2 instances of Hanson's field goals in the passage and add up the distances. This requires numerical reasoning.    Answer: 43 yards + 53 yards + 38 yards = 134 yards  2. Question: How many yards did Shaun Rogers and Dewayne White collectively return for touchdowns?    Reasoning: This question requires identifying two separate parts of the text, identifying the yardage for each player's touchdown, and then adding those figures together. This is considered numerical reasoning.    Answer: 3 yards for Dewayne White + 66 yards for Shaun Rogers = 69 yards 3. Question: How many points did the Lions score solely from touchdowns, if a touchdown counts for 6 points?    Reasoning: Identify all instances where the Lions scored a touchdown, count the occurrences, and then multiply by 6 for the final score. This involves locating four separate parts of the text, numerically adding and multiplying.    Answer: 15-yard TD pass + 3 yards returned for a touchdown + 49-yard TD pass + 66 yards returned for a touchdown + 3-yard TD run = 5 touchdowns * 6 points = 30 points 4. Question: How many yards were covered in the two longest plays mentioned in the last two quarters?    Reasoning: Identify the two longest plays mentioned in the last two quarters by locating these pieces of information, identify the respective yardages, and then add these numbers together.    Answer: 66 yards returned for a touchdown (by Shaun Rogers) + 49-yard TD pass (to Shaun McDonald) = 115 yards 5. Question: How many yards were covered by Hanson's longest field goal and Kitna's longest TD pass?    Reasoning: To answer this question, one needs to locate the longest field goal of Hanson and the longest TD pass from Kitna in the passage and add up the distances. This requires numerical reasoning.    Answer: 53 yards (Hanson's field goal) + 49 yards (Kitna's TD pass) = 102 yards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Zambezi River, one of the largest rivers in Africa, flows across the eastern part of the continent. Originating in Zambia, the Zambezi River progresses through or borders six countries – Zambia, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique – before it ends up in the Indian Ocean.  Cahora Bassa is one of the three major dams on the Zambezi river, the other two being the Kariba Dam, situated between Zambia and Zimbabwe, and the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam, located in Zambia. The dam takes its name from the river’s name in the local language, which translates to \\"finish the job\\". The Cahora Bassa Dam is located in the Tete Province of Mozambique, near the country’s border with Zimbabwe. Apart from being the largest structure of its kind in Mozambique, it stands as one of the largest in Southern Africa. The immense wall, which runs 171 meters (560 ft) tall and 303 meters (994 ft) thick at the base, spans across the river for about 2,820 meters (about 1.75 miles). Behind the dam, the vast reservoir extends for approximately 250 kilometers (155 miles), and has the capacity to store up to 55.8 billion cubic meters of water.  Construction of the dam began in 1969 during Portuguese colonial rule and was completed in 1974, despite the ongoing Mozambican War of Independence. Built primarily for the purpose of electricity generation, the Cahora Bassa Dam holds a hydroelectric power station with five turbines which got installed by 1979. The power station has a total installed ability of 2,075 megawatts. Its primary function is to generate electricity, which is mainly exported to neighboring South Africa along a 1,400 kilometer-long power line. However, it also serves various secondary purposes like irrigation for agricultural lands, flood control, and improving year-round navigability for commercial traffic on the Zambezi River downstream. Nevertheless, it's important to acknowledge that while the Cahora Bassa Dam has brought developmental benefits to the region, it has also brought controversy due to environmental, social, and economic impacts on local communities and wildlife."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Abstract: Targeting mitotic exit has been recently proposed as a relevant therapeutic approach against cancer. By using genetically engineered mice, we show that the APC/C cofactor Cdc20 is essential for anaphase onset in vivo in embryonic or adult cells, including progenitor/stem cells. Ablation of Cdc20 results in efficient regression of aggressive tumors, whereas current mitotic drugs display limited effects. Yet, Cdc20 null cells can exit from mitosis upon inactivation of Cdk1 and the kinase Mastl (Greatwall). This mitotic exit depends on the activity of PP2A phosphatase complexes containing B55α or B55δ regulatory subunits. These data illustrate the relevance of critical players of mitotic exit in mammals and their implications in the balance between cell death and mitotic exit in tumor cells..

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Select from:  A). put it out.;  B). make it bigger.;...I think the answer is","output":"A). put it out. To extinguish a fire, one must remove one or more elements of the fire triangle - heat, fuel, and oxygen. There are several methods to accomplish this, and the specific method chosen often depends on the type and size of the fire. Here are some common fire-extinguishing methods: 1. Smothering: This technique involves cutting off the fire's oxygen supply. Smothering can be done by covering the fire with a non-flammable material, like a fire blanket, wet cloth, or even soil. In the case of small fires, this can sometimes be done by simply placing a lid on a burning pot. 2. Cooling: Removing heat from the fire can help decrease its temperature and intensity. This can be done using agents like water or foam. Water is the most widely used cooling agent, as it cools the fire through convective heat transfer and absorbs heat when it turns into steam. 3. Starving: This method involves removing the fuel source from the fire. It can be done by either removing flammable materials away from the scene or creating a firebreak to prevent the fire from spreading. Starving a fire is more often used in larger fires, such as forest fires. 4. Interrupting the chemical chain reaction: Some fire extinguishing agents work by disrupting the chemical reaction that sustains the fire. These agents, such as dry chemical powders and clean agents (like Halon or FM-200), inhibit combustion by breaking the chain reaction on a molecular level. 5. Using fire extinguishers: Fire extinguishers are designed for various types of fires and use different extinguishing agents, including water, dry chemical powders, carbon dioxide, and foam. It's important to use an appropriate fire extinguisher for the specific type of fire. For example, a Class A fire extinguisher is designed for ordinary combustible materials, while a Class B fire extinguisher is meant for flammable liquids and gases. Option B). make it bigger is not a reasonable method to extinguish a fire, as increasing the fire's size will only cause more damage, pose a higher risk to people and surrounding property, and consume more resources to ultimately put it out. In conclusion, the most reasonable method to extinguish a fire is to put it out using techniques such as smothering, cooling, starving, interrupting the chemical chain reaction, or employing a suitable fire extinguisher. The specific technique used will depend on the size, type, and location of the fire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

They move much more slowly than a mountain stream. These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake. Question: When does deposition occur?

This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake.

His buddy Paul was more focused on the feeding habits of other insects that eat a lot of food. But I can use this background: A few insects, such as mayflies and some moths, never eat. That’s because their lives are over in just a few hours or days. Once these insects become adults, they lay eggs, and then die. On the other hand, some insects are very healthy eaters.
