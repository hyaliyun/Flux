Here is a hypothesis: Insects are the majority of the population at the wooden bridges and reed beds. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"The premise presented explains the landscape of an area along a water's edge with footpaths, wooden bridges, and reed beds. It indicates the presence of a rich diversity of bird and water life, but it doesn't specifically mention insects or their population size.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, posits that insects are the majority of the population at the wooden bridges and reed beds. Assuming that the premise is true, it is not automatically guaranteed that the hypothesis is equally true. This is because the premise and the hypothesis are dealing with slightly different variables. The premise is focused on setting an environmental backdrop, addressing the physical aspects of this environment and highlighting the presence of bird and water life. However, it does not delve into a closer evaluation of the smaller fauna that inhabits the area, specifically the insect population. The hypothesis is more focused on a fundamental aspect of the ecosystem that is not explicitly addressed in the premise — the population of insects. Insects are a crucial part of any ecosystem and are indeed often abundant near water and reed beds. However, without concrete information correlating the premise to the insect population, it's not possible to definitively conclude the hypothesis is also true. The argument could be more solid if some linkage was established between the premise and the hypothesis, for example, if the premise mentioned anything about the biodiversity or the insect population in that area specifically. In conclusion, based on the information given, if the premise is true, it does not necessarily follow that the hypothesis is also true. The conclusion about the insect population requires additional supporting evidence not provided in the premise.

Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work.  The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

(Vincent Groves is a suspected serial killer in Denver whose crimes are being reinvestigated using DNA technology to solve cold cases that have remained unsolved for 30 years.) The dark cloud of suspicion surrounding the alleged serial killer Vincent Groves has once again gathered momentum, as authorities in Denver turn to advanced DNA technology to unravel the mysteries of numerous cold cases dating back nearly three decades. Through the diligent efforts of forensic experts, these long-standing unsolved murder cases may finally be linked to Groves, providing a degree of closure for the families of the victims. Step 2: Explain who Vincent Groves is and what he is accused of. (Vincent Groves was a convicted murderer, and police suspect him of being involved in various killings in the Denver area.) Vincent Groves, now deceased, was a convicted murderer who served time in prison for two distinct killings. However, over the years, law enforcement officials have grown increasingly convinced that Groves is responsible for the deaths of many more victims in the Denver area. Step 3: Discuss the role of DNA technology in solving the cold cases. (Explain that forensic scientists are using DNA technology to analyze evidence from old crime scenes to find possible links to Vincent Groves.) In a bid to solve the string of unsolved murders, forensic scientists are turning to cutting-edge DNA technology to meticulously analyze evidence collected from the old crime scenes. This painstaking process has opened the possibility to unmask links between these cold cases and the suspected serial killer Vincent Groves, implying that justice may not be far off. Step 4: Describe the potential impact of the investigation on the families of the victims. (Highlight how the ongoing investigation and possible resolution of the cases may offer some closure and satisfaction to the victims' loved ones.) The renewed investigation has instilled a glimmer of hope in the hearts of the victims' families, who have long waited for answers and justice for their loved ones. Confirming Groves' involvement in these murders may offer a sense of closure and alleviate some of the anguish that has haunted the grieving families for decades. Step 5: Conclude the article by summarizing the importance of technology and efforts of the authorities. (Emphasize the significance of using advanced technology to solve cold cases and the relentless efforts of the authorities to pursue justice.) The adoption of innovative DNA techniques by forensic experts and the unwavering determination of the Denver authorities demonstrate their commitment to solving these age-old mysteries, even as time continues to pass.

But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood.

For such information, it's best to keep an eye out for official announcements from Fergie, her management, or her record label regarding her upcoming projects and producer collaborations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Brian Massumi (born 1956) is a Canadian social theorist, writer and philosopher, He is widely known for his English-language translations of A Thousand Plateaus, a 1980 philosophy book by French authors Gilles Deleuze and who, respectively a philosopher and a psychoanalyst? A:","output":"Brian Massumi, born in 1956, is a highly respected Canadian social theorist, writer, and philosopher who gained significant recognition for his English-language translations of \\"A Thousand Plateaus,\\" a seminal 1980 philosophy book written by two notable French authors – Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was a French philosopher widely acclaimed for his work in the field of continental philosophy, influencing various subjects such as literature, art, and social theory. His work traverses a broad spectrum of philosophical themes, including metaphysics, aesthetics, epistemology, and ethics. Among his most significant works are \\"Difference and Repetition\\" (1968) and \\"The Logic of Sense\\" (1969), which address issues of identity, representation, and language. Deleuze often collaborated with other intellectuals, the most notable partnership being with Guattari. Félix Guattari (1930-1992) was a psychoanalyst, political militant, and philosopher who co-founded the École Freudienne de Paris with psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan in 1964. Guattari's work delved into various intellectual disciplines, such as linguistics, anthropology, and political theory. He developed the concept of \\"schizoanalysis,\\" a critical method aimed at challenging the traditional psychoanalytic view of mental health and illness. Guattari is also known for his work as an activist for various leftist causes throughout his life. The collaboration between Deleuze and Guattari commenced in the late 1960s, resulting in a profound friendship that generated innovative theoretical contributions to contemporary philosophy, political thought, and cultural criticism. Their joint works include \\"Anti-Oedipus\\" (1972) and \\"A Thousand Plateaus\\" (1980), both of which form two volumes of their magnum opus, \\"Capitalism and Schizophrenia.\\" These works are emblematic of their profound critique of psychoanalysis, capitalism, and various societal structures. \\"A Thousand Plateaus\\" adopts a non-linear, experimental approach to writing, incorporating a rhizomatic structure that allows for multiple points of entry and interpretation. This innovative style reflects the book's core philosophical themes, such as multiplicity, deterritorialization, and the emphasis on becoming rather than being. The book's overarching objective is to present an alternative vision of thought that fosters creativity, freedom, and resistance to various forms of oppression. Brian Massumi's English translation of \\"A Thousand Plateaus\\" played a pivotal role in bringing the groundbreaking work of Deleuze and Guattari to a broader audience, thus amplifying its impact on various academic disciplines. In addition to his translation work, Massumi has made substantial contributions to fields such as semiotics, cultural theory, and political philosophy. Through his exploration of topics such as affect, experience, and perception, he has continued to develop the ideas initiated by Deleuze and Guattari, further cementing their place in contemporary social theory and philosophy. In conclusion, Brian Massumi's translation of \\"A Thousand Plateaus,\\" authored by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, not only enhanced the accessibility and understanding of the French philosophers' groundbreaking collaboration but also contributed significantly to the development of contemporary social theory, literature, and cultural critique. The works of these three scholars, built upon a solid theoretical foundation and innovative explorations of thought, continue to inspire generations of academics and readers across various disciplines."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nigerian unions resumed talks with the government Saturday following days of national protests over corruption and soaring fuel prices in Africa's largest oil producer. The two sides met ahead of a promised labor shutdown of the Nigerian oil industry. In solidarity with protesters, the oil union has threatened to stop production if the government does not reinstate subsidies that will return the cost of fuel to previous levels. A decision to halt production would affect global oil prices; Nigeria is the world's eighth-largest exporter. Throngs of protesters have rallied to demand government accountability and a return of fuel subsidies ended on January 1, a move that doubled gas prices and sent the cost of other goods skyrocketing. \\"This is not the first time the subsidy has been removed in Nigeria. For two decades, every single government has done this,\\" said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the nation's finance minister. \\"There is a very short memory. It has always resulted in resistance and a strike and so on.\\" A deal had not been reached to avert the shutdown as talks stretched into early Sunday. While negotiations remained ongoing, one union leader said oil workers will resume their strike Monday. Earlier, labor unions urged protesters to take a break from their five-day strike Saturday and Sunday to stock up on food and water supplies. Stores and supermarkets shut down as part of the national strike were set to reopen over the weekend to allow protesters to get supplies, said Folorunso Oginni, chairman of the nation's oil union, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria. Despite the strike suspension, the deadline to shut down oil production is still in effect unless the government and labor unions reach an agreement, he said. The protests -- dubbed \\"Occupy Nigeria\\" -- have galvanized the continent's most populous nation. Nigerians accuse their leaders of corruption and misusing oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty. The government has said the removal will free funds to improve the country's infrastructure. But there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure -- Nigeria is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. \\"It is to now to try to move this forward regain the people's trust. They cannot say because of mistakes in the past the country should not move forward,\\" the finance minister said Friday. In addition to the protests, the government faces another crisis -- religious attacks that have heightened fears of sectarian violence in parts of the country. CNN's Vladimir Duthiers, Kim Chakanetsa and Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.

This could make the prices of fuel go up all over the world because Nigeria is one of the places that gives lots of fuel to other countries. The government says they'll try to fix some of the problems, but many people don't trust them to do it because the government has sometimes been dishonest.

Cue the DJ to drop the beat and let people sing along once you've coached them on the chorus. If you want people to be into the music, you've got to be into it to. Move around, feel the beat, and look like you're excited to be on stage. If you stand stock-still at the mic stand and look like you're bored, people will look the same way in the crowd. If you're well prepared, you should feel confident in your abilities and in your music, so you can throw yourself into putting on the best possible show you can for the people. It's time to shine. Give them a performance they'll never forget.  Make sure you've got all your lyrics memorized and have practiced using the mic so you can be confident that all the technical aspects of the performance are going to go off without a hitch. It's hard to perform with confidence if you're trying to remember all the words. It's always important to do a mic check before performing. Part of the work of performance is being there before the show to make sure everything is set up and working as planned. Don't be a fake rock star and blow off the pre-show responsibilities. Be a professional. Always go on stage sober and well-rested. Save the partying for after the show. It'll be hard to get into your music if you're mush mouthed, too quiet, or muddy in the mix. Rap shouldn't sound like one of the adults from old Peanuts cartoons. Put your vocals up front and make sure it's loud enough to be heard from all corners of the room. If you have trouble keeping your voice up while you perform, practice reading magazines and books out loud to get your voice naturally into a louder register. It might annoy your roommates, but it'll be worth it to amp up your performance to where it needs to be. Both at your shows and online, be active about interacting with your growing fanbase. The MC will be the face of the crew, so you need to take the publicity side of the rap game seriously. Stay out after your gigs to meet people and sell any merch that you have, being friendly and available. Encourage people to come out to the gigs on social media and respond to people personally on Twitter and Facebook. Rappers, maybe more so than any other group of musicians, are known for taking control of their social media and working it to its fullest potential.

Some of these fish will be caught and sold, ending up in aquariums around the world. Is the industry putting populations of the fish at risk? Scientists who have studied the Big Island fishery say it is well managed. Rules put in place more than 15 years ago have helped to protect the fish. Along 35% of the coastline, for example, fish collecting is banned. Two years ago, the state cut the number of fish species for the aquarium trade from hundreds to just 40.

By Alex Greig PUBLISHED: 21:17 EST, 12 December 2013 | UPDATED: 21:18 EST, 12 December 2013 The mother of a man who died in a prison fire after being sent back to Honduras despite receiving a stay of deportation is suing the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement for his death. Nelson Javier Avila-Lopez, 20, arrived in the U.S. seeking asylum in 2008 to escape gang members who were trying to recruit him. He was ordered deported when he missed a hearing in Immigration Court, but his attorney Joseph Huprich filed an emergency motion and Avila-Lopez was granted an emergency stay of deportation. Ana Lopez says","output":"her son's life was cut tragically short due to the negligence and misconduct of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to the lawsuit filed by Lopez and her attorney, multiple oversights and failures in the process ultimately led to the unnecessary death of her young son. Nelson Javier Avila-Lopez was initially placed in ICE detention upon arrival in the U.S., where he awaited his immigration court hearing. It was at this point, however, that the first failure occurred. Lopez claims that her son was not provided with adequate notice of his scheduled court date, thus resulting in his inadvertent absence from the hearing. Consequently, the court ordered his deportation based on his failure to appear. This unfortunate misunderstanding prompted Avila-Lopez's attorney, Joseph Huprich, to file an emergency motion for an immediate stay of deportation, highlighting the danger his client faced if returned to Honduras. Following a swift review of the case, the court granted the emergency stay, sparing Avila-Lopez from potential harm at the hands of his initial persecutors. Despite the court-ordered stay, due to what can only be considered as a grave error on the part of ICE detention facility staff, Avila-Lopez was deported back to Honduras. This horrifying instance of miscommunication led to him being imprisoned in a facility known for its dangerous and inhumane conditions. It was here that he lost his life in a prison fire, a tragedy that could have been easily avoided had ICE properly heeded the court's decision. Ana Lopez's lawsuit against ICE seeks justice for her son's wrongful death, holding the responsible parties accountable for their negligence in managing his case. She hopes the suit will expose the flaws in the immigration detention and deportation system, ultimately leading to increased transparency, improved communication, and enhanced safeguards to protect the lives of those held under ICE custody. In order to achieve these goals, Lopez and her attorney are requesting a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding her son's deportation and subsequent death. They are also calling for comprehensive reforms and increased oversight to ensure such tragedies are not repeated in the future. In the wake of the lawsuit, the case of Nelson Javier Avila-Lopez has attracted national attention and reignited an ongoing debate surrounding the treatment of asylum seekers in the United States. Advocates for change argue that this heartbreaking story is emblematic of a larger issue in the country's immigration system and are urging lawmakers to revisit the policies and practices that contributed to the untimely death of this young man seeking refuge from danger."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Skylar told her friends how much she disliked her math class that day.

But here's the current math: what's less than nothing? And if you do even less than nothing, at what point does it become completely counterproductive and silly? Have you noticed lately that real ideas are out of vogue? A serious GOP committee chairman makes a big — and, yes, controversial -- proposal to reform the tax code. Here's how his ultimate leader, House Speaker John Boehner, reacts when asked about parts of the plan: \\"Blah, blah, blah blah.\\" No kidding. The President, who once endorsed an idea to change the way Social Security benefits are calculated as a way to curb its growth, has now said \\"Never mind.\\" It won't be in his budget, for fear that his liberal base would desert him over it. Republicans, who started the year saying that immigration reform should be on the agenda, are now saying, as the speaker put it, the President can't be \\"trusted\\" to implement any serious measure. And Democrats say the President can't be trusted to do a trade agreement without angering the important constituency of organized labor, so bye-bye \\"fast track\\" trade bill. Bill to help veterans fails Truth is, it isn't about trust at all. It's about winning in 2014. And an important part of winning, it seems, is to paper over all dissent within your own party in order to present a united front to the voters. So the election will be this: Us or them? Obamacare or no Obamacare? Do you like me better? Do you like government? Do you like poor people or rich people? That's our debate -- the sum total of our big ideas right now. Not wanting to start any fights within your own party. Unity above all heading into the midterm elections. So maybe Congress should just close up shop and leave town because nothing is going to happen for the next nine months. Just turn off the lights. Both parties are making the same political calculation for the same reason: They can't afford to have any internal debate lest they seem less than united against the enemy. Turns out that the permanent campaign is still alive and well. Here's the glitch in this narrative: Voters, it turns out, actually want some solutions to problems. They want to see the deficit go down; they want to find a way to fix immigration. A majority (63%) is worried the country is on the wrong track. And, according to a new CBS/New York Times poll, eight in 10 Americans are fed up with Washington. Somehow, voters haven't gotten the message that Congress -- in its steadfast intent to accomplish nothing -- is just trying to appeal to them. But remember what happened to Mitt Romney's campaign. Romney lost for lots of reasons, but one of them was sticking too long to the assumption that if people were unhappy with the direction of the country and the other guy, that would be enough to win. It wasn't. The candidate mattered. And ideas mattered, too. The \\"big\\" GOP idea this time is to bash Obamacare, relentlessly, endlessly, in a continual loop. Sure, it's unpopular, but what about if it starts working for people? What if people are sick of hearing about it now that the website is working? And what if people are more inclined to mend it than end it? If Obamacare is the only trick in the bag, it might not be enough. Then there's the Democrats' income inequality refrain. It's not new, it can work, and sure, it unites the Democrats. But by taking almost everything of substance off the table, it's the President's legacy and record of achievement that gets compromised, along with the voters. The truth is this: It's a tight political fight. Polls right now show that the public, by a small 42%-39% margin, would back Republicans for office in the 2014 midterm elections. They're not thrilled with the President's job performance. They have soured on the President personally, and they can barely stomach the Congress. So what's the political solution? No substance, no ideas, no serious debate that might actually engage voters. Each side suits up, armed with its slogans and its bromides. And we inevitably re-elect the Congress we hate.

Article: There are three different ways to store fish. Two ways to store fish for future use are canning and freezing. Two other methods are drying and smoking. Today we have the first of the two reports describing, step by step, how to prepare dried fish.    Begin with the fish that are just out of water. If the fish are small, leave their heads on. Cut off the heads if the fish are longer than twenty centimeters or weigh more than one hundred fifteen grams.    Now clean the freshly caught fish. Cut off the scales and cut open the stomach. Remove everything inside. Then wash the fish in clean water and rub salt into them. Next, put the fish in a container with a solution of three hundred grams of salt and one liter of water. This will remove the blood from the meat. Keep the fish in the salt water for about thirty minutes. After that, wash them again in clean water. Next, put the fish in a solution that has more salt in the water. The water should be salty enough so that the fish float to the top. If the fish sink to the bottom of the container, add more salt to the water. Cover the container with a clean piece of wood. Place a heavy stone on the wood to hold it down. Leave the fish there for about six hours. After that remove them from the salt water and place them on a clean surface. Cover the fish with a clean piece of white cloth and let them dry. Another method of preparing fish is called dry salting. Wooden boxes or baskets are used for drying salting. After cleaning the fish, put a few of them on the bottom of the box or basket. Cover them with salt, then put more fish on top. Cover them also with salt. Continuing putting fish and salt in the container until it is full. Do not use too much salt when using the dry salting method. You should use one part salt to three parts fish. For example, if you have three kilograms of fish, you should use one kilogram of salt. Remove the fish after a week or ten days. Wash them in a mixture of water or a small amount of salt and let them dry. We have talked a lot about...

United States presidential election, 2004 One elector in Minnesota cast a ballot for president with the name of \\"John Ewards\\"  [sic] written on it. The Electoral College officials certified this ballot as a vote for John Edwards for president. The remaining nine electors cast ballots for John Kerry. All ten electors in the state cast ballots for John Edwards for vice president (John Edwards's name was spelled correctly on all ballots for vice president). This was the first time in U.S. history that an elector had cast a vote for the same person to be both president and vice president; another faithless elector in the 1800 election had voted twice for Aaron Burr, but under that electoral system only votes for the president's position were cast, with the runner-up in the Electoral College becoming vice president (and the second vote for Burr was discounted and re-assigned to Thomas Jefferson in any event, as it violated Electoral College rules). Q: What is different in comparison between the 1800 electoral system and the system in place in 2004?","output":"Imagine if you and your friends are picking team leaders and helpers. In the 1800 electoral system, everyone voted for two people they wanted to be team leaders. The person with the most votes would be the main team leader (president), and the person with the second-most votes would be the helper (vice president). However, this system caused some problems, like when two people got the same number of votes. To fix this, they changed the way of voting by 2004. Now, everyone votes separately for the team leader (president) and the helper (vice president). This way, there is less confusion, and everybody knows who is chosen to be the team leader and the helper."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the word \\"come\\" mean the same thing in \\"Come out of the closet!\\" and \\"He comes from humble origins.\\"?","output":"No, the word \\"come\\" does not mean the same thing in the phrases \\"Come out of the closet!\\" and \\"He comes from humble origins.\\" In these two contexts, \\"come\\" carries different meanings, which can be categorized into different senses or uses. Let's discuss and contrast the meanings of the word \\"come\\" in these two examples: 1. \\"Come out of the closet!\\": In this context, the word \\"come\\" functions as an imperative verb, which is a form of command or a request for someone to do something. Here, the speaker asks or urges someone to \\"come out\\" – literally, they are asking the person to leave an enclosed space such as a closet, but the phrase is often used figuratively, especially when referring to someone revealing their true identity, usually in the context of sexuality or LGBTQ+ matters. This idiomatic expression is conveying the idea of opening up about one's true identity, orientation, or desires, and it is a call to action for the listener to disclose their hidden truth. 2. \\"He comes from humble origins.\\": In this context, \\"comes\\" is used in its present simple form and serves as a stative verb. Stative verbs describe unchanging situations or conditions rather than actions or events. In this case, \\"comes from\\" alludes to a person's background or the place, situation, or circumstances from which they originate. \\"Humble origins\\" refers to modest, unprivileged, or low social and economic beginnings. So, this phrase is highlighting that the person comes from a humble background and emphasizes their roots or their upbringing. This usage of \\"come\\" does not involve any active task, request, or imperative command, like in the first example. In summary, the word \\"come\\" has different meanings in these two phrases. In \\"Come out of the closet!\\", \\"come\\" represents an imperative command for someone to reveal their hidden truths, whereas in \\"He comes from humble origins.\\", \\"come\\" denotes a reference to a person's humble background or upbringing. These different meanings depend on the specific context of the word use and showcase the versatility of the term \\"come\\" in the English language."},{"instruction":"Background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia.

Here's a detailed breakdown of what Jordan should have done: 1. Reflect on his actions: Jordan should have taken a moment to analyze his actions that led to the teacher's emotional response. This self-reflection would help him to understand whether his behavior was intentional or unintentional. 2. Empathize with the teacher: After recognizing his actions, Jordan should have put himself in the teacher's shoes and tried to understand the pain and distress he might have caused her. Empathy is crucial in acknowledging one's actions and their impact on others. 3. Apologize to the teacher: Upon realizing the hurtful nature of his actions, Jordan should have taken responsibility for them and sincerely apologized to the teacher. An honest apology has the potential to mend strained relationships and demonstrate maturity and accountability. 4. Listen to the teacher's perspective: After apologizing, Jordan should have given the teacher an opportunity to express her feelings and thoughts on the situation. Engaging in active listening would show respect for her opinion and allow both parties to better understand each other's perspectives. 5. Discuss and learn from the incident: In order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, Jordan should have discussed the incident openly, listened to the teacher's suggestions, and demonstrated his willingness to learn from the situation. 6. Seek guidance from a counselor or school authority: If the issue was still unresolved or had escalated further, Jordan would have been wise to consult with a school counselor, principal, or other appropriate authority figure. This would help facilitate a conversation around the incident and potentially offer guidance or mediation between Jordan and the teacher. 7. Identify ways to make amends: Jordan should have considered possible ways to make amends for his actions, such as writing a heartfelt letter, offering to help the teacher with her tasks, or performing acts of kindness for her and others in the school community. Such actions can show genuine remorse and a willingness to take positive steps toward personal growth. In conclusion, Jordan should have taken the necessary steps to right his wrongs and make amends with the teacher before leaving the room. This would not only demonstrate maturity and responsibility but also help build a healthy, respectful relationship between him and the teacher, which would ultimately contribute to a more positive learning environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: uh-huh what what do you what do you use for bait for crappie and bass Hypothesis: It's too bad you've never been fishing. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Available choices:  (A). yes.  (B). it is not possible to tell.  (C). no. And the answer is:","output":"(C). no.  The hypothesis, \\"It's too bad you've never been fishing,\\" is not entailed by the premise, which is asking about the type of bait used for crappie and bass. The premise simply conveys a desire to know the appropriate choice of bait for these two fish species, and does not necessarily suggest that the individual has no prior experience with fishing.  Now, to answer the question about bait for crappie and bass, let's dive into the details. Fishing for crappie and bass requires knowledge of their behavior and preferred habitats, as well as understanding the most effective bait types for each species. Although different baits may be used successfully for both fish, there are some baits that tend to perform better for each species. For crappie: Crappie are generally more active and found in larger numbers near underwater structures, such as submerged trees, vegetation, and even sunken artificial habitats. They primarily feed on smaller fish, insects, and crustaceans. Here are some popular bait options for crappie fishing: 1. Live Minnows: Live minnows are one of the most popular and effective baits for crappie, as they are an essential part of their natural diet. Rigging a live minnow beneath a slip bobber or using a jighead can yield excellent results. 2. Jigs: Small jigs in various colors and styles can also be highly effective for crappie. Colors like chartreuse, black, and white tend to work well, but it's essential to experiment with different color patterns and jigging motions to find the most successful combination. 3. Insect imitations: Crappie may also be enticed by artificial lures that imitate insects and small aquatic invertebrates. Soft plastic lures like tube baits, grubs, and shad tails often prove fruitful, as do small spinners and beetle spins. For bass: Bass are aggressive predators that are attracted to a wide variety of bait, depending on their mood and environmental conditions. Commonly found in areas with cover and structure, they prey on smaller fish, crawfish, and insects. Some popular bait choices for bass fishing include: 1. Soft Plastic Lures: Soft plastic lures like worms, craws, and creature baits are among the most versatile and effective baits for bass fishing. Texas-rigged soft plastics work great in heavy cover, while a Carolina-rigged worm can be the go-to setup in open water environments. 2. Crankbaits: Crankbaits mimic the movement and vibration of small fish in the water, attracting bass and provoking strikes. They come in various diving depths and colors, which should be chosen based on the current fishing environment and conditions. 3. Spinnerbaits and chatterbaits: These baits combine an attractive flash from a spinning blade with the added enticement of a soft plastic trailer that wiggles and swims like an injured prey. They work exceptionally well in areas with dense vegetation and underwater structures, where other lures might become snagged. 4. Topwater lures: Topwater lures like poppers, frogs, and walkers create commotion on the water's surface and can incite violent, explosive strikes from bass, especially during early morning and late evening hours. In conclusion, the best bait for crappie and bass will largely depend on the specific environment, the time of day, and the prevalent prey species in the area. Good angling practices dictate that you experiment with different bait options to determine which combination works best in each situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Police barricaded Istanbul's main Taksim Square and used water cannons to disperse crowds on Saturday to prevent demonstrators from entering Gezi Park, the site of protests for more than a month. Interior Minister Muammer Guler said the government won't permit \\"illegal\\" demonstrations in the park. \\"We will not and cannot permit demonstration or marches in those places,\\" the minister said. \\"Without it being a demonstration or a protest march, they can use Gezi Park as they please. We will not allow tents. \\"Right now in Istanbul there is a search and a push for ways to have illegal gatherings. Our police is not permitting this,\\" Guler said. Witnesses who spoke to CNN by phone reported use of water cannons and tear gas on Istiklal Street, one of the main arteries leading to Taksim Square. The 6th Administrative Court in Istanbul overruled some parts of the Taksim development project, including plans to rebuild old barracks in Gezi Park. Taksim Solidarity, an umbrella platform of activists and civil society groups, put out a call after ruling for people to gather in Gezi Park, which has not been open to the public since June 16. European Union, Turkey avoid rupture in relations. \\"We are going to our park to deliver the court decision by hand, which cancels the project aimed to disidentify, depopulate and concretize Gezi Park, to the ones who shut the park down to the people,\\" said Taksim Solidarity in a written statement. \\"We are going to our park to open its doors to its real owners, so to everyone again.\\" \\"They are in the smaller streets trying to prevent people from even reaching Istiklal,\\" said Irem Koker, an eyewitness. CNN witnessed several men being detained by police. One demonstrators said \\"this is a police state,\\" as water cannons were being used to disperse the crowd. Some residents exploded in anger at the police barricades. \\"This is the fourth entrance [to Taksim] that I've been stopped at. I have a 12-year-old child waiting for me,\\" said a woman to a police officer blocking her way across what is normally one of the city's busiest transit hubs. She was dressed in the trenchcoat and headscarf popular among conservative Turkish Muslim women. \\"Until now I used to pray for you,\\" she told the police officer. \\"Now that has all changed.\\" As clashes continued in streets and back alleys of Istanbul's historic Beyoglu district, Istanbul's governor, Huseyin Avni Mutlu, responded to an amateur video that went viral on Turkish social media Saturday night. The video showed men armed with a large round sword and a stick attacking pedestrians in Istanbul's Talimhane district, which is adjacent to Taksim Square. One of the men with a machete is seen in the video beating a woman once with the blade and then kicking her in the small of the back. The amateur video also showed several police officers physically trying to separate the two men from the people they were attacking. An eyewitness told CNN he and several other anti-government protesters took shelter in a building in Talimhane when they saw the men shown in the video attacking demonstrators. \\"There were two guys in the middle of the street. We saw them from afar. They have these things that looked like swords, not knives but like rounded swords. They were running, swinging swords and kicking people,\\" the eyewitness said, on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. \\"I think they were out there to scare people. To give the message 'we're out here.' It wasn't like they were hiding the swords.\\" Mutlu said the suspected attackers had been detained by police. \\"The two people with swords and sticks that were part of the events that took place after the illegal protest in Taksim have been detained and are being processed,\\" Mutlu wrote on his official Twitter account. \\"Our security officer was wounded while trying to apprehend the attacker armed with a sword who was seen in videos,\\" Mutlu said. The Istanbul governor said that Gezi Park will open to the public Sunday, but that Taksim Solidarity's call for a demonstration is not legal and will not be permitted. \\"It is not legal to gather in Taksim. I cannot let you gather where the law says you cannot,\\" Mutlu told reporters on Saturday. \\"We are not going to allow this illegal gathering. The police will make the necessary warnings,\\" he said. After more than an hour of skirmishes between police and demonstrators, calm returned to Istiklal Street.

Based on Brian Selznick's book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, it is about a boy who lives alone in the Gare Montparnasse railway station in Paris in the 1930s. A co-production between Graham King's GK Films and Johnny Depp's Infinitum Nihil, the film stars Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Jude Law, Helen McCrory, and Christopher Lee. Hugo is Scorsese's first film shot in 3D, of which the filmmaker remarked, \\"I found 3D to be really interesting, because the actors were more upfront emotionally. The film currently holds a 94% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes based on 206 reviews, with an average score of 8.3/10. The site's main consensus reads, \\"Hugo is an extravagant, elegant fantasy with an innocence lacking in many modern kids' movies, and one that emanates an unabashed love for the magic of cinema.\\" Metacritic gave the film an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 41 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".  Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"Hugo is unlike any other film Martin Scorsese has ever made, and yet possibly the closest to his heart: a big-budget, family epic in 3-D, and in some ways, a mirror of his own life. We feel a great artist has been given command of the tools and resources he needs to make a movie about--movies.\\" Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor gave it a \\"B+\\" grade and termed it as \\"an odd mixture: a deeply personal impersonal movie\\" and concluded that \\"Hugo is a mixed bag but one well worth rummaging through.\\" Christy Lemire said that it had an \\"abundant love of the power of film; being a hardcore cinephile (like Scorsese) might add a layer of enjoyment, but it certainly isn't a prerequisite for walking in the door\\" besides being \\"slightly repetitive and overlong\\". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune rated it three stars and described it as \\"rich and stimulating even when it wanders\\" explaining \\"every locale in Scorsese's vision of 1931 Paris looks and feels like another planet. The filmmaker embraces storybook artifice as wholeheartedly as he relays the tale's lessons in the importance of film preservation.\\" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said that \\"visually Hugo is a marvel, but dramatically it's a clockwork lemon\\".  Hugo was selected for the Royal Film Performance 2011 with a screening at the Odeon, Leicester Square, in London on 28 November 2011 in the presence of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall in support of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund. Richard Corliss of Time named it one of the Top 10 Best Movies of 2011, saying, \\"Scorsese's love poem, rendered gorgeously in 3-D, restores both the reputation of an early pioneer and the glory of movie history--the birth of a popular art form given new life through a master's application of the coolest new techniques\\". James Cameron called Hugo \\"a masterpiece\\" and that the film had the best use of 3D he had seen, surpassing even his own acclaimed films. How did they use it for 3D?","output":"Hugo is a movie made by Martin Scorsese in 2011. It's a big, exciting story about a boy named Hugo who lives alone in a train station in Paris in the 1930s. The movie is based on a book called The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. This movie is special because it's the first movie Martin Scorsese made using 3D technology. 3D movies make it seem like you're watching the story happen in real life, with things popping out of the screen towards you. It's like you're there in the world of the movie. Scorsese used 3D in Hugo to make everything look more real and magical, making the people and the places in the movie stand out. It also helped the actors show their emotions more clearly. Other filmmakers, like James Cameron who made 3D movies too, think the 3D in Hugo looked even better than in their own films.

Importance Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reflects past glucose concentrations, but this relationship may differ between those with sickle cell trait (SCT) and those without it. Objective To evaluate the association between SCT and HbA1c for given levels of fasting or 2-hour glucose levels among African Americans. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study using data collected from 7938 participants in 2 community-based cohorts, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study and the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). From the CARDIA study, 2637 patients contributed a maximum of 2 visits (2005-2011); from the JHS, 5301 participants contributed a maximum of 3 visits (2000-2013). All visits were scheduled at approximately 5-year intervals. Participants without SCT data, those without any concurrent HbA1c and glucose measurements, and those with hemoglobin variants HbSS, HbCC, or HbAC were excluded. Analysis of the primary outcome was conducted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine the association of SCT with HbA1c levels, controlling for fasting or 2-hour glucose measures. Exposures Presence of SCT. Main Outcomes and Measures Hemoglobin A1c stratified by the presence or absence of SCT was the primary outcome measure. Results The analytic sample included 4620 participants (mean age, 52.3 [SD, 11.8] years; 2835 women [61.3%]; 367 [7.9%] with SCT) with 9062 concurrent measures of fasting glucose and HbA1c levels. In unadjusted GEE analyses, for a given fasting glucose, HbA1c values were statistically significantly lower in those with (5.72%) vs those without (6.01%) SCT (mean HbA1c difference, −0.29%; 95% CI, −0.35% to −0.23%). Findings were similar in models adjusted for key risk factors and in analyses using 2001 concurrent measures of 2-hour glucose and HbA1c concentration for those with SCT (mean, 5.35%) vs those without SCT (mean, 5.65%) for a mean HbA1c difference of −0.30% (95% CI, −0.39% to −0.21%). The HbA1c difference by SCT was greater at higher fasting (P = .02 for interaction) and 2-hour (P = .03) glucose concentrations. The prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes was statistically significantly lower among participants with SCT when defined using HbA1c values (29.2% vs 48.6% for prediabetes and 3.8% vs 7.3% for diabetes in 572 observations from participants with SCT and 6877 observations from participants without SCT; P<.001 for both comparisons). Conclusions and Relevance Among African Americans from 2 large, well-established cohorts, participants with SCT had lower levels of HbA1c at any given concentration of fasting or 2-hour glucose compared with participants without SCT. These findings suggest that HbA1c may systematically underestimate past glycemia in black patients with SCT and may require further evaluation.

In 1948, the point-contact transistor was independently invented by German physicists Herbert Mataré and Heinrich Welker while working at the Compagnie des Freins et Signaux, a Westinghouse subsidiary located in Paris. Mataré had previous experience in developing crystal rectifiers from silicon and germanium in the German radar effort during World War II. Using this knowledge, he began researching the phenomenon of \\"interference\\" in 1947. By June 1948, witnessing currents flowing through point-contacts, Mataré produced consistent results using samples of germanium produced by Welker, similar to what Bardeen and Brattain had accomplished earlier in December 1947.

Please answer the following question: It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because  Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by  Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to  Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies.  Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.  Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of  Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the  Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case,  Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge.  Question: \\"What type of region might a floodplain develop into if a river floods often?\\" Answer: \\"Very flat\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer to the question is not correct. The question asks: \\"What type of region might a floodplain develop into if a river floods often?\\" The answer to this question, based on the provided information, is not simply \\"very flat.\\" While it is indeed true that floodplains are often flat due to the spread of floodwater, the question is asking about the potential development of floodplains due to frequent flooding. Instead, a more appropriate and detailed answer might be:  A floodplain that frequently experiences flooding might develop into a region characterized by nutrient-rich soil due to the sediment left behind by the floodwater. The sediment that the floodwater carries and subsequently deposits enriches the soil of the floodplain. This makes it an ideal place for plant growth and agriculture, as seen in the example of the Nile River valley. The regular flooding by the Nile River brings sediment that turns the surrounding floodplain into a productive agricultural area, despite it being in the middle of a desert. The floodplain could also develop natural levees along the river banks. Levees are raised strips of sediment that the floodwater deposits close to the river's edge. These occur naturally and can act as a protective barrier, potentially reducing the impact of future floods. Over time, frequent floods can lead to the growth of these levees and further change the physical characteristics of the floodplain region.  Hence, a floodplain subjected to regular flooding might develop into a highly fertile agricultural region with potentially significant natural levee formations along the riverbanks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Problem:Context: The film depicts the construction and ultimate demolition of a metaphorical wall. Though the film's symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation.Pink (Bob Geldof), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \\"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\\". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944.The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \\"Money\\" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants.As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror.Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \\"worms\\". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform.The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo-Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \\"Waiting for the Worms\\". The scene is inter-cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose-step across ruins.Pink screams \\"Stop!\\" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd's \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" from The Final Cut album and \\"5:11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity)\\" from Roger Waters' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking.In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink's wife and mother), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.The film concludes with three children cleaning up a pile of debris after an earlier riot. It is unknown whatever has happened to Pink, leaving the viewer to decide.   Question: Who sang \\"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\\"?

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What formation was the youngest of the Supai Group? ?  An unconformity of 15 to 20 million years separates the Supai Group from the previously deposited Redwall Formation. Supai Group was deposited in late Mississippian, through the Pennsylvanian and into the early Permian time, some 320 million to 270 million years ago. Both marine and non-marine deposits of mud, silt, sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to the Texas Gulf Coast of today.  Around this time, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rose in Colorado and New Mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to the Grand Canyon area.Supai Group formations in the western part of the canyon contain limestone, indicative of a warm, shallow sea, while the eastern part was probably a muddy river delta.  This formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan-colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft (around 200 m). Shale in the early Permian formations in this group were oxidized to a bright red color.  Fossils of amphibian footprints, reptiles, and plentiful plant material are found in the eastern part and increasing numbers of marine fossils are found in the western part.Formations of the Supai Group are from oldest to youngest (an unconformity is present at the top of each): Watahomigi (see 5a in figure 1) is a slope-forming gray limestone with some red chert bands, sandstone, and purple siltstone that is 100 to 300 feet (30 to 90 m) thick. Manakacha (see 5b in figure 1) is a cliff- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and red shale that averages 300 feet (90 m) thick in Grand Canyon. Wescogame (see 5c in figure 1) is a ledge- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 100 to 200 feet (30 to 60 m) thick. Esplanade (see 5d in figure 1) is a ledge- and cliff-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 200 to 800 feet (60 to 200 m) thick. An unconformity marks the top of the Supai Group.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. The type of tree you grow should be reliant on the environment where you'll be keeping it. Your region's climate and your home environment should both be taken into account when you're deciding which species of tree to grow. To be on the safe side, select a species that is indigenous to your part of the world.  Deciduous species such as Chinese or Japanese elms, magnolias, oaks, and crabapple trees are good selections if you'd like to grow your bonsai outside. Just be sure to pick out a species that can grow to full size in your region.  If you prefer coniferous trees, junipers, pines, spruces, or cedars all make excellent choices. If you want to grow a tree indoors (or if you live in a hot climate), consider a tropical species. Jade, snowrose, and olive trees may be grown as bonsais. Planting a bonsai tree from seed is a slow but rewarding process. If you plant a tree, you'll have to allow it time to take root and grow strong before you can begin trimming and training. Depending on the species of tree you grow, this could take up to five years. Many find the extra wait and effort to be worth it since seeds are so inexpensive and the grower is able to control the tree at every stage of growth. To grow a bonsai from seed, take the following steps:  Buy a package of bonsai tree seeds. Soak them overnight before planting them in soil with good drainage and the right nutrient composition for your tree species. Plant the tree in a training container (as opposed to a ceramic display container, which is only used once the tree has been trained and reached maturity). Give the planted tree the correct amount of sun, water, and a consistent temperature, again dictated by the specific species of tree. Allow the tree to become sturdy and strong before you begin to train it. This method of acquiring a bonsai tree is highly valued, since caring for a bonsai tree you find in the wild requires a lot of skill and knowledge. If collecting a tree that has had its start in nature appeals to you, consider the following factors:  Select a tree with a sturdy trunk, but one that is still quite young. Older trees won't adapt well to being placed in a container. Choose a tree with roots that spread evenly in every direction, rather than growing laterally or entangled with the roots of other trees. Dig around the tree and extract a large amount of soil along with the roots. This will prevent the tree from dying of shock when it is moved to a container. Plant the tree in a large training container. Care for it according to the needs of the particular species. Wait about a year for the roots to get used to the container before you begin training it. This is the easiest way to begin the art of bonsai, but it is also the most expensive. Bonsai trees that have been grown from seed and partially trained have already received a lot of time and care, so they are usually quite pricey. Look online and in local nurseries and plant shops for a bonsai tree to bring home with you.  If you buy a partially-trained bonsai from a shop, talk with the person who trained it about its specific needs. When you bring the bonsai home, give it a few weeks to adjust to the new setting before you begin working with it.","output":"Choose a tree species suitable for your environment and grow a bonsai from seed, find one in the wild, or buy a partially-trained one, considering factors such as climate, tree attributes, and caretaking steps specific to the tree species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was common practice for my mother to send me off soul-searching with a proverb. Of the many interactions I had with my mother those many years ago, one stands out with clarity. I remember the occasion when Mother sent me to the main road, about twenty yards away from the farmhouse, to invite a passing group of seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container along and collect dry cow dung   for making a fire. I was then to prepare the meal for the group of work-seekers. The thought of making an open fire outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that high heat, was enough to upset even an angel. I did not manage to hide my feelings from my mother, and after serving the group, she called me to the balcony, where she usually sat to attend to her sewing  . Looking straight into my eyes, she said, \\"Tsholofelo, why were you so unhappy when I requested you to prepare a meal for those poor people?\\" Despite my attempt to deny her allegation  , and using the heat of the fire and the sun as an excuse for my alleged behavior, Mother, giving me a firm look, said, \\"A foot has no nose.\\" It means, \\"You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you.\\" Had I denied the group of people a meal, it may have happened that, in my travels some time in the future, I found myself at the mercy of those very individuals.

In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - SEED is a block cipher developed by the Korea Information Security Agency (KISA). It is used broadly throughout South Korean industry, but seldom found elsewhere. It gained popularity in Korea because 40-bit encryption was not considered strong enough, so the Korea Information Security Agency developed its own standard. However, this decision has historically limited the competition of web browsers in Korea, as no major SSL libraries or web browsers supported the SEED algorithm, requiring users to use an ActiveX control in Internet Explorer for secure web sites.  - In botany, a drupe (or stone fruit) is an indehiscent fruit in which an outer fleshy part (exocarp, or skin; and mesocarp, or flesh) surrounds a shell (the pit, stone, or pyrene) of hardened endocarp with a seed (kernel) inside. These fruits usually develop from a single carpel, and mostly from flowers with superior ovaries (polypyrenous drupes are exceptions). The definitive characteristic of a drupe is that the hard, \\"lignified\\" stone (or pit) is derived from the ovary wall of the flowerin an aggregate fruit composed of small, individual drupes (such as a raspberry), each individual is termed a drupelet and may together form a botanic berry.  - Pan de coco , literally \`\` coconut bread '' in Spanish , is a rich sweet roll with a coconut filling .  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - The Arecaceae are a botanical family of perennial climbers, shrubs, acaules and trees commonly known as palm trees (owing to historical usage, the family is alternatively called Palmae). They are flowering plants, a family in the monocot order Arecales. Currently 181 genera with around 2600 species are known, most of them restricted to tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate climates. Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged at the top of an unbranched stem. However, palms exhibit an enormous diversity in physical characteristics and inhabit nearly every type of habitat within their range, from rainforests to deserts.  - The coconut tree (\\"Cocos nucifera\\") is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family) and the only species of the genus \\"Cocos\\". The term coconut can refer to the whole coconut palm or the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word. The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word \\"coco\\" meaning \\"head\\" or \\"skull\\", from the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features.

It's a 7-inch Tegra 3 tablet running Android Jelly Bean, and it's set to hit Australia in July.      Update: Turns out that this leak was spot on. The Google Nexus 7 built by Asus is a reality, with all the specifications listed here revealed days before this morning's I/O keynote by Gizmodo Australia. Check out the Nexus 7 and read how it all unfolded in our live blog.      Gizmodo Australia has today viewed a training document detailing exactly what's going to be in the new tablet and how much it's going to cost.      As rumoured, Google's going to announce a 7-inch, Nexus-branded tablet called the Nexus 7. According to the leak, it's built by Asus, with a 1.3Ghz quad-core Tegra 3 processor, GeForce 12-core GPU and 1GB of RAM with two different storage variants: 8GB and 16GB.      The Nexus tablet will also feature NFC and run Google Wallet (probably only in the US) and Android Beam.      The screen is an IPS display with a 178-degree viewing angle, running a resolution of 1280x800. The device will also sport a 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera. The battery will also give you nine hours worth of operation.      The 8GB model will set you back US199 and the 16GB will cost US249. No word in the document on local prices.      The leaked document also says that the device will be the first to run Jelly Bean, the new version of Android. Details are scarce on Jelly Bean, but the slides tell us that Google will handle operating system updates from now on, which could address the fragmentation problem. We aren't sure if this statement means that Google will handle all handset updates from Jelly Bean onwards, or if it just means it will handle it for the Nexus 7 going forward. Based on the various arrangements with other manufacturers and telcos around the world, it's likely to be the latter. We'll know more come Google I/O.      Update: The document says that the Nexus 7 will run Android Jelly Bean, but makes no mention of the version number. We understand that the device will be version stamped with Android 4.1, rather than leaping ahead a generation and stamping it as 5.0. Wired had suggested after spotting a leaked benchmark that this would be the case.      Rumours about Google working on a Nexus-branded tablet with Asus have been swirling for a while. Even as far back as May, a report emerged of a super cheap Tegra 3-powered device was coming at the Google I/O developer event, which is now only days away.      The first clue was when Asus demonstrated the awesome cheap and wonderfully cheerful Eee Pad MeMO 370T at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, before delaying the unit indefinitely.      Since then, rumours about a home-grown tablet from Google have been few and far between, but this is the first time we've seen anything official regarding specs.      Apple has already played its announcement cards around iOS 6, Microsoft has announced Surface and Windows Phone 8, and Google risks being left behind without its own bespoke tablet product. June is one hell of a month to be following what's new in tech.      Priced at sub-US200, the Google's Nexus 7 will become Amazon's biggest problem post-launch, threatening the market share of the hugely successful Kindle Fire. The Fire runs a highly modified version of the Android operating system and prevents users from wandering outside the customised Amazon environment. The Nexus brand, however, has always been associated with the purest form of the Android operating system Google has to offer, meaning that it's likely going to be a better experience. Google is also banking on the fact that the screen is better than the Fire's, with a higher resolution and 10-point touch capability.      Of course, this could all prove to be an elaborate fake. We've seen them before and we'll see them as long as there's a rabid tech-loving public that will queue up around the block for value this good.      We'll bring you the news as we hear it about this tablet, and if it really is the Nexus 7, I'm looking forward to this year's Google I/O. Follow Gizmodo Australia on Twitter for further updates. ||||| Computerworld - A 199 Nexus 7 tablet from Google would raise the stakes for Amazon's Kindle Fire and Barnes & Noble's Nook tablet, which sell at a similar price and screen size.      But since the 7-in. touchscreen device is reportedly a quad-core tablet with other costly hardware, the Nexus 7 might also in some ways compete with the popular Apple iPad or perhaps the Microsoft Surface tablets unveiled last week. The iPad starts at 499; pricing for the Surface has not yet been announced.      To offer high-end features at a low cost with the Nexus 7, Google seems to be acknowledging that the Android strategy of having third-party companies make tablets hasn't worked. And that means Google must take aggressive pricing steps to make up the difference.      \\"If Google wants to jump-start the Android tablet market, which has been weak to date, then a low-priced, high-quality device could do that,\\" said Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates. \\"Google certainly has an incentive to make the Android tablet a competitive product in the market, and maybe driven more by wanting to capture a bigger share of the pie, than by supporting its OEMs (Original Equipment Makers).\\"      Google could be subsidizing the Nexus 7 to the tune of hundreds of dollars per tablet, some analysts said. Even so, \\"getting revenues is the name of the game for Google, and right now the OEMs are driving very little revenue to them on Android-based tablets,\\" Gold said.      The big payback to Google from selling a 199 tablet would come from the sales of apps and the ads that Google sells for its search tool, analysts noted. \\"Considering that the tablet ecosystem war is getting heated now with Microsoft having a bigger role, Google might feel the need for a more aggressive [pricing] strategy,\\" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner.      She said that 40 million iPad sales in 2011 at a cost of 499 or more show there's room for Android sales, especially at lower prices. \\"You would think that 40 million would not seem impossible for the combination of all the vendors supporting Android,\\" she said.      IDC said iPads accounted for 59% of tablet sales globally in 2011. Among Android tablets, Samsung had 6.3% of the market, and Asus took 2.5%. Amazon had 6.9% of the market with its Android variant and Barnes & Noble had 4.9%.      \\"Google has to be more than a little frustrated that the first mainstream hit Android tablet is the Kindle Fire,\\" said Tom Mainelli, an analyst at IDC. \\"Google is desperate to get some market traction for Android tablets and the Google ecosystem that supports them.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"Google's flagship I/O Conference announced the Nexus 7, a 7-inch Tegra 3 tablet running Android Jelly Bean, set to be released in Australia in July.

Bachman in 1949 made it possible for a great variety of record companies to get into the business of making long playing records. The business grew quickly and interest spread in high fidelity sound and the do-it-yourself market for pickups, turntables, amplifier kits, loudspeaker enclosure plans, and AM/FM radio tuners. The LP record for longer works, 45 rpm for pop music, and FM radio became high fidelity program sources in demand. Radio listeners heard recordings broadcast and this in turn generated more record sales. The industry flourished. What aided in records sales in the 1950s?","output":"In the 1950s, record sales were helped by a few things. First, the invention of the Columbia LP, which allowed more music to fit on a single record. This made it easier for different companies to make long playing records. Second, people became interested in high quality sound, so they started buying more records with better audio. They also started building their own music systems with pickups, turntables, and speakers. Lastly, when people heard music on the radio, they liked it and wanted to buy those records too.

In the Arizona desert, truck driver Martin \\"Rubber Duck\\" Penwald is passed by a woman in a Jaguar XK-E, which leads to an encounter with a state trooper. Proceeding on his way, Rubber Duck runs into fellow truck drivers Pig Pen/Love Machine and Spider Mike, when another \\"trucker\\" informs them over the C.B. that they are okay to increase their speed. The \\"trucker\\" turns out to be Sheriff \\"Dirty Lyle\\" Wallace, a long-time nemesis of the Duck, who extorts them for 70 each.  The truckers head on to Rafael's Glide-In where the Duck's sometime girlfriend, Violet, works as a waitress. Melissa, the driver of the XK-E, is also there; the car broke down and she had to sell it and some of her belongings in an effort to leave Arizona, as she's due in Dallas for a job. The Duck offers Melissa a ride; Violet is unimpressed and ushers him away to give him a special birthday present. While away, Wallace shows up at the Glide-In checking plates.

Piece A she simply puts on her desk to use later, and Piece B she slowly passes through the coil of wire.  and a hint : Our knowledge of electromagnets developed from a series of observations. In 1820, Hans Oersted discovered that a current-carrying wire produced a magnetic field. Later in the same year, André-Marie Ampere discovered that a coil of wire acted like a permanent magnet and François Arago found that an iron bar could be magnetized by putting it inside of a coil of current-carrying wire. Finally, William Sturgeon found that leaving the iron bar inside the coil greatly increased the magnetic field.  Please answer this question : Which piece of iron is more magnetized? Answer:","output":"Piece B is more magnetized. This is because it was passed through the coil of wire with electricity running through it. Based on the historical knowledge provided, when a current-carrying wire is coiled, it acts like a permanent magnet, and if an iron piece is placed inside or passed through that coil, it gets magnetized. This phenomenon was discovered by François Arago and built upon by William Sturgeon, who found that having the iron bar inside the coil increases the magnetic field. In this situation, Kelsey passed Piece B through the coil of wire, which caused it to be magnetized, whereas Piece A was simply placed on her desk without any interaction with the magnetic field, so it remains less magnetized."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the first sentence, \\"The rate of production at the factory is skyrocketing,\\" the word \\"rate\\" refers to the speed or efficiency at which something is being produced. In this context, \\"rate\\" denotes a measurable metric of performance. 2. In the second sentence, \\"He works at a great rate,\\" the word \\"rate\\" can be understood to mean the speed, pace, or efficiency at which someone works.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards ? from the following article ?  In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony.

Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as jurists or legal theorists (including legal philosophers and social theorists of law), hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems, and of legal institutions. Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems in two rough groups:  - The Quran (; ', literally meaning \\"the recitation\\"; also romanized Qur'an or Koran\\"') is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (\\"Allah\\"). It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature. The Quran is divided into chapters (\\"surah\\" in Arabic), which are then divided into verses (\\"ayah\\").  - Fiqh is Islamic jurisprudence. While \\"Sharia\\" is believed by Muslims to represent divine law as revealed in the Quran and the \\"Sunnah\\" (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), \\"fiqh\\" is the human understanding of the \\"Sharia\\"\\"sharia\\" expanded and developed by interpretation (\\"ijtihad\\") of the Quran and \\"Sunnah\\" by Islamic jurists (\\"Ulama\\") and implemented by the rulings (\\"Fatwa\\") of jurists on questions presented to them.  - Sabzevar County is a county in Razavi Khorasan Province in Iran. The capital of the county is Sabzevar. At the 2006 census, the county's population (including portions of the county later split from it to form Joghatai County, Jowayin County, Khoshab County, and Davarzan County) was 429,187, in 116,891 families; excluding those portions, the population was 273,898 in 75,668 families. The county has four districts: Central District, Davarzan District, Rud Ab District, and Sheshtomad District. The county has four cities: Sabzevar, Davarzan, Rud Ab, and Sheshtomad.  - Ulama (', singular ', \\"scholar\\", literally \\"the learned ones\\", also spelled \\"ulema\\"; feminine: \\"alimah\\" (singular) and \\"uluma\\" (plural)) are \\"those recognized as scholars or authorities\\" in the \\"religious hierarchy\\" of the Islamic religious studies. They are the guardians of legal and religious tradition in Islam. Often they are \\"Imams of important mosques, judges, teachers in the religious faculties of universities\\". The term may also include the body of Muslim Islamic scholars trained in the whole body of Islamic law and in other Islamic disciplines; but it may also be used to include the village mullahs and imams on the lowest rungs of the ladder of Islamic scholarship, inasmuch as they correspond most closely to the class of the scribes or rabbis in Judaism.  - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian  (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders.  - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - The Arab world ('; formally: '), also known as the Arab nation (\\"\\"), consists of the 22 Arabic-speaking countries of the Arab League.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is a news article: Some people just cannot do anything right. Take the world’s greatest playwright, William Shakespeare. Centuries after he made his name, he is being blamed for bringing misery to millions. Not, as some might expect, from being forced to study his works at school, but for suffering stigma over unsightly skin.      In what is a departure from the numerous studies looking at everything from leprosy to skin cancer, medical experts are claiming that Shakespeare’s success has resulted in a painful legacy for people will skin disease.      The playwright is the subject of new research being revealed to hundreds of doctors during the annual conference of the British Association of Dermatologists.      The rash of Shakespearean insults based on people’s appearance, whether it is King Lear branding his daughter Goneril “an embossed carbuncle” or a prostitute calling a soldier a “scurvy companion” in Henry IV part II, is cited as a cause of the continuing persecution of people for the way they look.      In a paper entitled \\"Is Shakespeare to blame for the negative connotations of skin disease?\\", British researchers from the universities of Nottingham, Leicester and Derby claim that Shakespeare reflected the Elizabethan obsession with flawless pale skin, and while he “may not have accepted Elizabethan society’s negativity towards skin disease, it can be argued that his success has led to its perpetuation”.      Dr Catriona Wootton, a dermatologist at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, and co-author of the study, said: \\"Elizabethan London was a melting pot for diseases such as plague, syphilis and smallpox. Many of the diseases of the time involved lesions or sores on the skin, so skin imperfections were seen as a warning sign for contagious disease.” Shakespeare used these “negative undertones to his advantage, employing physical idiosyncrasies in his characters to signify foibles in their behaviour,” she added.      A spokesperson for the British Association of Dermatologists said: “Much of the Elizabethan stigma over disfiguring skin disease still persists today. Even now, many examples exist in films and literature where visible disfigurements are used to represent villainy or malice. Nobody is suggesting that we edit Shakespeare but maybe we should ensure that new films and books don't reinforce this stereotype.\\"      But fans of the playwright are rallying to his defence. Stuart Hampton-Reeves, head of the British Shakespeare Association, told The Independent: “Shakespeare was a product of his era so we cannot expect him to confirm to modern attitudes and it is far-fetched to blame modern day prejudices on Shakespeare's works.”      And Professor Michael Dobson, the director of Birmingham University’s Shakespeare Institute, said: “Has any writer in history ever suggested that the symptoms of skin disease are attractive? And have audiences for the last 400 years really been coming out of theatres saying ‘Ah yes – I’d nearly forgotten – pox is to be avoided. What a genius Shakespeare was!’ Next week: has the fairy tale of Snow White been creating a misleadingly favourable impression of dwarfism?”      Pox, carbuncles and plague: Shakespeare's lack of skin care      Some of Shakespeare’s most memorable lines are insults over people’s appearance. Take King Lear for instance, when the beleaguered monarch berates his daughter Goneril: “Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle”.      From phrases like “scurvy knave” used in Romeo and Juliet, to “a pox upon him” in All's Well That Ends Well and “foul moles and eye-offending marks” in King John, skin problems are referenced throughout Shakespeare’s plays.      In Henry IV part I, a man with a red nose is dubbed “an everlasting bonfire-light” and “knight of the burning lamp”. And in Coriolanus, Marcius (Coriolanus) curses his enemies: “Boils and plagues Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd.”      Herpes is alluded to in A Winter’s Tale: “If I prove honey mouthed let my tongue blister”. While in A Midsummer's Night Dream, a blessing to young couples includes the line: “Never mole, hare-lip nor scar... shall upon their children be”. ||||| Shakespeare may be partly to blame for the social stigma associated with disfiguring skin conditions, say experts.      They point to memorable insults in his plays that refer to skin blemishes and scarring, reflecting an Elizabethan obsession with flawless pale complexions.      One of the most graphic occurs when King Lear launches into his scheming daughter Goneril, declaring: ''Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle''.      Other examples include use of the phases ''a pox upon him'' in All's Well That Ends Well and ''scurvy knave'' in Romeo and Juliet, while in Henry IV part one a man's red nose is described as ''an everlasting bonfire light''.      Marcius Coriolanus wishes ''boils and plagues'' upon his enemies, and a young couple in A Midsummer's Night Dream are exhorted to have children with ''never mole, hare lip nor scar..''      Dermatologist Dr Catriona Wootton, from Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, who took part in a language analysis of Shakespeare's plays, said: ''Rat-infested and with open sewers, overcrowding and sexual promiscuity, Elizabethan London was a melting pot for diseases such as plague, syphilis and smallpox.      ''Many of the diseases of the time involved lesions or sores on the skin, so skin imperfections were seen as a warning sign for contagious disease. This was not limited to signs of infection, but to any blemishes or moles, which were considered ugly and signs of witchcraft or devilry.      ''Shakespeare uses these negative undertones to his advantage, employing physical idiosyncrasies in his characters to signify foibles in their behaviour.''      The researchers argue that the Bard's colourful language has helped to perpetuate negative attitudes towards imperfect skin.      Nina Goad, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said: ''It is interesting to note that much of the Elizabethan stigma over disfiguring skin disease still persists today. Over the last few decades dermatologists have tried to address the effect this can have on patients. However, even now, many examples exist in films and literature where visible disfigurements are used to represent villainy or malice.      ''This is particularly concerning when such films are aimed at children, who learn that beautiful, flawless people are kind and trustworthy, and scarred or blemished people are to be feared.      ''Nobody is suggesting that we edit Shakespeare, but maybe we should ensure that new films and books don't reinforce this stereotype. Many skin patients require psychological support to deal with the visual aspect of their disease.''      The findings were presented at the British Association of Dermatologists' annual conference in Glasgow.      ends ||||| A new study by British dermatologists draws a connection between the bad attitude shown towards skin conditions in Shakespeare's works and the way we think of it today.      Do we have a negative view of acne because of the writings of Shakespeare?      A study by dermatologists in the UK recently examined whether our culture views skin blemishes negatively because of the amount of negative writings in Shakespeare’s plays about skin conditions.      “While Shakespeare may not have accepted Elizabethan society’s negativity towards skin disease, it can be argued that his success has led to its perpetuation,” the study reads.      The dermatologists note that many of the Bard’s works include people insulting others by mentioning skin conditions or by trying to curse someone with a skin affliction. A character says he wishes “a pox upon” another character in “All’s Well That Ends Well,” while in the text of “King John,” one character says that if another was “patch’d with foul moles and eye-offending marks, then I should not love thee, nor thou become thy great birth, nor deserve a crown.” However, they write that the playwright does say in “Hamlet” that those with skin conditions are not evil because of them, writing, “that for some vicious mole of nature in them, as in their birth – wherein they are not guilty, since nature cannot choose hisorigin – their virtues else, be they as pure as grace, as inﬁnite as man may undergo, shall in general censure take corruption from that particular fault.”      Fear of those with skin conditions arose from the dangers of diseases like the plague, write the dermatologists.      “Tell-tale cutaneous signs heightened the fear of contagion,” they wrote.      According to the Telegraph, British Association of Dermatologists member Nina Goad urged that the attitude not be passed down to future generations.      “Even now, many examples exist in films and literature where visible disfigurements are used to represent villainy or malice,” she said. “This is particularly concerning when such films are aimed at children, who learn that beautiful, flawless people are kind and trustworthy, and scarred or blemished people are to be feared. Nobody is suggesting that we edit Shakespeare, but maybe we should ensure that new films and books don't reinforce this stereotype.”      However, some are doubtful of the dermatologists’ connection between Shakespeare and fear of skin afflictions. Guardian writer Alison Flood wrote that she found the conclusion “a stretch.”      “It sort of assumes we might not have noticed that skin diseases aren't exactly the most pleasant thing in the world, if it wasn't for Mercutio gasping ‘A plague on both your houses,’” she wrote. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A study by British researchers suggests that William Shakespeare's plays have contributed to the social stigma associated with disfiguring skin conditions.

From the days of 78 rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Façade, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague Constant Lambert.       In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the Façade Suites, the Partita, Belshazzar's Feast, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.Almost all Walton's works have been recorded for commercial release. EMI published a \\"Walton Edition\\" of his major works on CD in the 1990s, and the recording of the Chandos Records \\"Walton Edition\\" of his works was completed in 2010.

Its provincial capital is Halifax. Nova Scotia is Canada's second-smallest province, with an area of , including Cape Breton and another 3,800 coastal islands. As of 2011, the population was 921,727, making Nova Scotia the second most-densely populated province in Canada with almost .  - Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election.  - The Nova Scotia Legislature, formally, known as the General Assembly, consists of the Crown represented by a Lieutenant Governor and the House of Assembly, is the legislative branch of the provincial government of Nova Scotia, Canada.

He founded the pioneering band Death in 1983. Schuldiner is often referred to as \\"The Godfather of death metal\\", and his obituary in the January 5, 2002 issue of UK's Kerrang! magazine said that \\"Chuck Schuldiner was one of the most significant figures in the history of metal.\\" Schuldiner was born on May 13, 1967, on Long Island, New York to a Jewish father of Austrian descent and a mother from the American South, a convert to Judaism. Both of his parents were teachers. In 1968, his family moved to Florida.  Schuldiner was the youngest of three children: he had an older brother named Frank and an older sister named Bethann. He started playing guitar at the age of 9; his 16-year-old brother had died and his parents bought him a guitar, thinking it would help with his grief. He took classical lessons for less than a year in which his teacher taught him \\"Mary had a Little Lamb\\", which he did not like very much, and almost stopped completely, until his parents saw an electric guitar at a yard sale and bought it for him. The young Schuldiner immediately took to the instrument. After getting amps, he never stopped playing, writing and teaching himself. Schuldiner was known to spend the weekend in the garage or his room playing his guitar, but was limited to three hours on weekdays when school was in session. Schuldiner first played in public in his early teens.  Schuldiner was originally inspired by Metallica, Iron Maiden, Kiss and classical jazz, among others. He was particularly interested in the metal movement known as NWOBHM - New Wave of British Heavy Metal - and cited bands of that genre among his favorites. He frequently cited French band Sortilege as his personal favorite metal group. Slayer, Celtic Frost, Possessed, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond and Metallica were later influences he would apply more to his own band. Later in his career, Schuldiner frequently cited progressive metal bands such as Watchtower, Coroner and Queensryche as influences. The official Schuldiner website, Empty Words, quotes Schuldiner's mother making the claim that he enjoyed all forms of music except country and rap. He also enjoyed jazz and classical music in addition to metal and British alternative acts such as Lush.  Schuldiner performed well in school before becoming bored with education, and eventually dropped out. He later regretted this decision. He has stated that if he had not become a musician, he would have liked to have become a veterinarian or a cook.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was he raised in NY or did they move somewhere else","output":"Chuck Schuldiner was born in Long Island, New York, but when he was a little kid, around 1 year old, his family moved to Florida."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have this equation: 0 = -3*c + 164*c - 6923 First, we're going to combine the c terms. So, -3*c and 164*c can be added together like this: -3*c + 164*c = 161*c Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = 161*c - 6923 Next, we want to get c all by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we will add 6923 to both sides: 0 + 6923 = 161*c So now we have: 6923 = 161*c Now, we need to get c by itself. To do that, we will divide both sides by 161: 6923 ÷ 161 = c When you divide 6923 by 161, you get: c ≈ 43 So, the answer is c ≈ 43.

The 31-year-old's new deal means both he and Hamilton are under contract until the end of the 2018 season. Rosberg leads the 2016 championship by one point from Hamilton going into Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix. The pair are dominating F1, having won nine of the opening 10 races, but their relationship is a fractious one, punctuated by a number of on-track clashes. Rosberg said the new contract was a \\"special moment for me\\", adding: \\"I look forward to the future.\\" In a statement, Mercedes said:  \\"Nico has been a core member of the Silver Arrows since the team returned to the sport in 2010 and has played a crucial role in the team's success in that time.\\" Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff told BBC Sport: \\"Contract negotiations are never a formality because it is important for the driver and the team. It took a couple of months and we signed it last night. \\"I am in for long-term stability especially with the regulations change. I am a faithful person and if it functions well with your wife you need to stay with your wife.\\" Wolff also said he had no concerns about Rosberg and Hamilton's contracts expiring at the same time. \\"It means they will try to outperform each other and you have to think to the younger generation,\\" he said. \\"For me, there is more opportunity than risk in having both run out at the same time.\\" BBC Sport's chief F1 writer Andrew Benson: Rosberg's new deal is no surprise given it has been telegraphed by both team and driver for some time. He is also leading the world championship - and Mercedes could not afford to let a man who might win it leave at the end of the season. The former Williams driver, who has 19 F1 wins in his career, has had a sometimes difficult relationship with Briton Hamilton, but it is a relationship Mercedes feel they can control. The driver line-up is perfect for them. In Hamilton, they have arguably the fastest driver in F1. In Rosberg, they have a man who can win when Hamilton hits trouble and who is  good enough to beat him on merit from time to time. Retaining both drivers gives the team stability ahead of 2017, when a new set of regulations will dramatically change the cars. It's the obvious choice. Rosberg's deal means all three top teams have confirmed driver line-ups for 2017. Red Bull are retaining Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen, while Ferrari have confirmed Kimi Raikkonen as partner for Sebastian Vettel. The only active world champion without a drive at this stage is Britain's Jenson Button, whose McLaren contract expires at the end of this season. McLaren are likely to promote their Belgian reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne to partner double world champion Fernando Alonso, although chairman Ron Dennis told BBC Sport two weeks ago they would not decide until September. Button also has interest from Williams, who are likely to drop Brazilian veteran Felipe Massa. Finn Valtteri Bottas is under option and is likely to be retained. What was that article about?","output":"This article is about a German race car driver named Nico Rosberg who signed a new contract to stay with his team, Mercedes, until the end of 2018. This means that Nico and his teammate, Lewis Hamilton, will both be with the team for the same amount of time. They're both really good drivers and they've won a lot of races together, but sometimes they don't get along very well on the track. Their boss, Toto Wolff, thinks it's a good idea to have them both signed for the same amount of time because it keeps things balanced and it gives the team a chance to plan for the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them. Question: How structured was Jenny's life in school? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"Jenny's life in school was highly structured.

Throughout the show's ten seasons, Rachel's love interests, friendships, career, and personal growth were central storylines.

Page is determined to secure Willoughby's participation in a prestigious fishing tournament, only to discover that Willoughby is a phonyâhe's never fished in his life.

What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the two people who begin a duel on a forest planet? from the following article ?  The film begins with the opening credits of a typical Star Wars fanfilm entitled \\"Bond of the Force\\". Gregory plays Jacen Solo, and Jennifer plays the offscreen voice of Jaina Solo. Jacen is on a forest planet searching for Anakin Solo, but only encountering a Sith Lord named Darth Katai, played by Zarth. The two begin to duel, and it is an intense battle...until Greg misses his cue, incurring the wrath of writer-director Tom \\"Servo\\" Harrison. Tom gets into a fight with his friends, and they walk out on him. After a monologue based on High Fidelity, with Star Wars in the place of rock music, Tom reflects back a few months to the genesis of the fanfilm project. Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth are seen hanging out at Excalibur Games, a hobby shop, playing the Star Wars pants game. Tom is revealed to be an employee at the store, working for store credit while he has his money saved up for film school. He claims the only downside to the job is the trekkies—specifically, two irate, Star Wars-hating ones named James and Stewart. The two enter the store, arguing over a discrepancy between the film Star Trek Generations and the Technical Manual. While waiting for Tom to get their new Star Trek cards, Stewart accidentally spills soda on a set of comics that Greg's boss ordered. Tom demands they pay for the damaged goods, and the Trekkies overpay him before leaving the store in a rush. Tom realizes that they can sell the undamaged books to Greg's boss for full price and pocket the money from the Trekkies. At Greg's suggestion, Tom combines the money with his remaining store credit and buys model lightsabers, which prompts the idea in his mind of making a Star Wars fanfilm.","output":"In the given text, the two people who begin a duel on a forest planet are Gregory, who plays the character Jacen Solo, and Zarth, who plays the character Darth Katai."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Street art can be found on buildings, street signs and even dustbins from Tokyo to Paris to New York City. This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries  are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray  their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel  against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture. It is supported by websites, artist groups, books and magazines. Question: According to the writer, the artists love street art because  _  . - they enjoy travelling around the city - they want to express their feelings freely - they enjoy learning different cultures - they want to let more people know them A:","output":"According to the writer, the artists love street art because they want to express their feelings freely. The text specifically states \\"What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits\\". This implies that artists appreciate the unbounded liberty street art provides for showcasing their thoughts, emotions, perspectives, and creativity without any major restrictions. While other possible options like travel around the city, learning different cultures or gaining public recognition through their art might be part of some artists' experiences, the text clearly emphasizes the primary reason as the freedom of self-expression."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Commanded by Sultan Mehmed III, the army marched through Edirne, Filibe , Sofia and Niš to arrive at Belgrade on 9 August. On 20 August, the army crossed the River Sava by bridge and entered the Austrian territory of Siren. A war council was called at Slankamen Castle, and it was decided that they would begin a siege on the Hungarian fort of Eger . The fort controlled the communication routes between Habsburg Austria and Transylvania, all of whom were in revolt against the Ottoman suzerainty. However, news soon arrived that the Austrians had besieged and succeeded in taking over the Castle of Hatvan and had killed all the Ottomans housed there, including the women and children. The Ottoman Army started a siege on the fort of Eger on 21 September 1596, and by 12 October the castle had capitulated. As a retaliation to the Hatvan castle massacre, the defenders of this castle were all executed. Not long after, Ottoman command received the report that a mixed army of Austrians and Transylvanians were advancing towards the Ottoman expeditionary force. A war council was conducted under Grand Vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. It was decided that the Ottoman Army should march out of the Erlau castle so as to meet the Austrians at a suitable battle terrain. The Sultan thought that the Ottoman army should disengage and return to Istanbul; it was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to engage the enemy forces. The most realistic troop strength figures seem to be 40,000-50,000 for the Christian and 80,000-100,000 for the Muslim army. The Christian army had 10,000 Austrians, 4,000 Germans, 3,000 reiters, 13,000 Hungarian light cavalry and 10,000 Transylvanians, for a total of 40,000 men.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Defend yourself verbally when attacked, provoked, or sidelined and take care of yourself when someone tries to put you down, box you in, or even hurt you physically.  Don't just stand there smoldering; it's far better to speak your mind. Even if the end result doesn't change, you've demonstrated to yourself and others that you won't stand for disrespect. More often than not, a polite but firm clarification of the disrespectful comment or behavior will be enough to draw attention to the need for it to change, especially where there is an audience. For example: \\"Excuse me but I was next in line and I'm in just as much of a hurry as the person who pushed in.\\" Avoid whispering, mumbling, or speaking too quickly. The tone of your voice and the speed of your delivery are an important part of clarifying what you want and how confident you're feeling. Naturally, the manner in which you defend yourself will depend on the situation and if someone is volatile, always put your safety first. You should never resort to outright aggression in the process of standing up for yourself. Being aggressive, or even violent, is counter-productive and will not win you any friends.  Acting aggressively -- verbally or otherwise -- is like acting out your pain in full technicolor. It's not a constructive way to get what you want and will simply turn people against you. You are far more likely to achieve a positive result if you approach any issues as calmly and objectively as possible. You can still stand your ground and be firm and assertive without having to raise your voice or get angry. Be wary of taking passive aggressive responses toward people and situations.  Passive aggressive responses are ones in which you begrudgingly do things against your will and end up filled with resentment and anger, hating people who \\"make\\" you feel this way, feeling depressed and helpless. This negatively affects your relationships and can take a huge toll on your physical and emotional health. Most of all, a passive-aggressive approach to life will never enable you to stand up for yourself. Another way of standing up for yourself is to take the negatives thrown at you and transform them into good things.  In the process of turning attacks inside out to find the good, you'll often find that feelings of jealousy or insecurity are at the root of the attack. For example:  If someone claims you're bossy, rather than letting it cause you to shrink some more, take this as evidence that you're a natural leader, able to manage people and projects well, and a proactive change agent. If someone claims you're shy, take it as a compliment that means you're not ready to jump on the latest bandwagon but like to reflect over the consequences first and then make up your mind. If someone says you're too sensitive or emotional, let this be a sign that you've got a big heart and aren't afraid to let everyone see it. Or maybe someone suggested you're not career-minded enough – for you, that confirms you're living a stress-free life that will help you to live longer. No matter how hard you try to increase your confidence, there will be days when you feel that you're backsliding.  Rather than seeing this as a defeat in your attempt to learn to stand up for yourself, see it for what it is – a day or so where things went temporarily off-track before you feel better and bounce back. Some tricks to help the bounce-back process include: Fake it till you make it. Even if you don't feel confident, act as if you do. Be consistent in your approach. People will grow to expect that the person you are now is a person who stands up for himself. Expect some people to find your more assertive stance challenging. It can take time to reshape the patterns you've formerly established with people who used to walk all over you. In some cases, you'll find you no longer want to be a part of their lives; take it as it comes. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article talks about how to defend yourself when someone is mean or not nice to you.

Answer the following question: The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades.  On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

Article: The New York Times announced Wednesday that it intended to charge frequent readers for access to its website, a step being debated across the industry that nearly every major newspaper has so far feared to take. Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011. Executives said they were not bothered by the possibility of absorbing barbs  for moving cautiously. \\"There's no prize for getting it quick,\\" said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. \\"There's more of a prize for getting it right.\\" Question: What is the main idea about the passage?

Given the background: Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.  and the situation: Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data.  Answer the following question: Which researcher studied less about abrasion? The answer to this question is:","output":"Manny. In the provided context, Manny researched environments that have never been glaciated. Abrasion is a process closely associated with glaciated landscapes, as it is caused by the grinding of a glacier against the underlying rock, producing sediment known as glacial flour. Danny, who studied glaciated environments, would therefore be more likely to study the effects of abrasion. In contrast, Manny, studying non-glaciated environments, would encounter less of this phenomenon in his research. Therefore, Manny studied less about abrasion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.  Question: \\"Where did Mohamed Atta reside while in Germany?\\" Answer: \\"He stayed with his father\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, this answer is not correct.

Plot title: Tobruk Movie plot: In September 1942, Rommel's Africa Korps is only 90 miles (144Â km) from the Suez Canal, but running dangerously low on fuel. The British approve a plan to destroy German fuel bunkers at Tobruk in an attempt to cripple Rommel's attack. The author of the plan, Canadian born Major Donald Craig (Rock Hudson) had been captured by Vichy French forces. As his expertise is considered essential to the success of the raid, Craig is rescued by Captain Kurt Bergman (George Peppard) of the Special Identification Group (SIG) and some of his men, German Jews serving with the British. They then join up with commandos of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG), under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Harker (Nigel Green), at Kufra in south-eastern Libya. Colonel Harker explains they have eight days to get to Tobruk and destroy the fuel depot and German field guns protecting the harbour, before a scheduled amphibious landing and a bombing raid on the city by the RAF. They are to drive there through enemy territory posing as POWs escorted by the SIG pretending to be guards. Once they reach Tobruk they would then link up with a full Naval and RAF assault on the city and their primary objective, Rommel's underground fuel bunkers. Craig is highly skeptical of the operation, claiming that \\"Staff has a genius for sitting on its brains and coming up with perfect hindsight\\", stating that when he originally submitted the plan they could have blown up the fuel bunkers with only a handful of men before questioning how they were supposed to get through well established German defences now. While warning Craig not to let personal differences of opinion interfere with the operation, Colonel Harker also reveals that he was the genius with perfect hindsight who convinced Staff to approve Craig's original plan which would now be \\"maximum effort, land, sea and air\\".

As a strong supporter of the \\"Italian road to socialism,\\" Natta's political ideology and actions aligned with the core principles and objectives of socialism in the context of Italy during the 20th century. As a close ally of Enrico Berlinguer, who was the Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) from 1972 to 1984, and an influential figure in shaping the direction of socialism in Italy, Natta played a significant role within the party and its secretariat. Some of his key actions, such as his 1969 report that led to the expulsion of the Manifesto group (a radical faction within the PCI) and his subsequent election as party secretary following Berlinguer's death in 1984, further solidified his commitment to Italian Socialism. The \\"Italian road to socialism\\" aimed to achieve a socialist society in Italy, adapted to the country's unique political, cultural, and social context. This involved the development of socialist ideas and policies that focused on social reform, wealth redistribution, social justice, and workers' rights in a manner specifically tailored to the Italian context. Natta's significant role in the Italian Communist Party and his close association with Berlinguer, who was a driving force in shaping the Italian road to socialism, further supports the conclusion that Natta was indeed a supporter of Italian Socialism. In summary, based on the information provided and the context in which Natta operated within the Italian Communist Party, it is reasonable to conclude that Alessandro Natta was a strong supporter of Italian Socialism. His political affiliations, actions, and loyalty to key figures within the socialist movement all align with the principles and objectives of Italian socialism during the 20th century."},{"instruction":"Question: Why does Jim go looking for the Prospector?

In subsequent, unconnected scenes, we see the wanted Larsen gun down two lawmen who recognize him, taking their food and dog team, and discovering McKay's lucky strike claim. Meanwhile, back at the cabin, the starving Big Jim starts to hallucinate that the smaller Lone Prospector is a giant chicken, and eventually attacks him by shotgun and knife.

Fulfilling our desire to watch a couple get engaged on television after only weeks of knowing each other? Yes. Shocking? Not at all. Predictable? Very much so. If you haven't seen Monday's finale, stop reading now to avoid spoilers. was left with two men: . The episode started with a dramatic introduction of JoJo and her predicament. She strolled up and down the beaches of Thailand to explain that when she's with Robby, she thinks of Jordan, and vice versa – all over the course of approximately 12 outfit changes. Then it was time for JoJo to meet up with her family, and everyone watching silently rejoiced because JoJo's mom, Soraya, was finally back on TV. We'd been dreaming of this day ever since she \\"I think I love both of them. I haven't told either one of them that yet – neither of them know how I feel.\\" JoJo's mom knows what's up. The first guy to meet JoJo's family was Jordan, who was introduced to the legendary Soraya, dad Joseph, JoJo's two brothers and her sister. This whole meeting started off kind of how you might imagine it would be if you engineered a guy in a lab to create the ideal specimen to bring home to Mom and Dad. Jordan even brought everyone in the family a \\"silly hat\\" because one of his family traditions is to \\"embarrass each other\\" and then they all tried on the hats and had a grand old time. Things got serious, however, when Soraya took Jordan aside. It was rather difficult to understand what she was trying to say most of the time but she basically made it clear she felt Jordan might be a playboy. \\"You're an attention-catcher. You catch a lot of attention of a female.\\" Jordan, for his part, held his own as best as he could – even when Soraya put him on the spot and commanded him to give his word that he would never break JoJo's heart. Soraya is kind of like Cersei from but really foreign, and it's fantastic. Jordan sat down with JoJo's dad, Joseph. The two had a fairly decent chat – except Jordan made the huge mistake of not explicitly asking for Joseph's blessing and his daughter's hand in marriage. (A formality we learn JoJo made extremely clear was very important to her.) Right off the bat it was obvious that JoJo's entire family was vibing on Robby – perhaps more than they were with Jordan. Robby had definitely been rehearsing for this meeting his entire life and pulled out all the stops. When confronted by Soraya with the same tough questions she had for Jordan, Robby went above and beyond to make it clear he was 100 percent ready to propose. There's just no way he didn't have that speech prepared for weeks. Meanwhile Soraya kept talking about princesses and queens and how she wanted Robby to make JoJo a \\"queen of his heart.\\" The Cersei comparison never felt more appropriate. Then Robby took Soraya and Joseph aside and formally asked them for JoJo's hand in marriage by making Even though most of America shudders when Robby calls JoJo \\"Joelle,\\" JoJo's parents were completely transfixed – to the point where they both actually cried. Robby, take a bow. Anyway, then Robby left and JoJo was left alone with her family to discuss the two men, at which point they all basically admitted they were totally #TeamRobby. JoJo was very distraught by this information – and when she found out that Jordan asked for her parents' blessing, she was shocked. She eventually called them out for being so pro-Robby, at which point they all tried to backtrack, but it was still really obvious how they felt and JoJo cried a lot. For their last day together before the final rose ceremony, JoJo and Robby went to the beach. JoJo and Robby made out on the beach, JoJo and Robby made out in the ocean, JoJo and Robby made out underwater – you get the picture. Then they talked about what their future together would look like, and Robby launched into a creepy-detailed fantasy story, something about how they were in the living room with their dog and accidentally burned their meat loaf and the kids were upstairs etc. You lost us at \\"meat loaf,\\" Robby. For the evening portion of their date, JoJo came over to Robby's hotel room and Robby went on about how much he loved her, which appears to be their main topic of conversation. Robby even brought out a bunch of pictures of the two of them and JoJo loved every second of this very public display of adoration. The man knows what he's doing, we'll give him that. Next, JoJo spent the day with Jordan on a boat. They went kayaking through some grottos and then settled down on a beautiful, tucked away little beach because Jordan always gets the best dates. Of course, JoJo was still reeling over the fact that Jordan hadn't asked for her parents' blessing – so she called him out about it and demanded to know why. Jordan basically didn't have an answer for her and after some fumbling over his words – and constant interruptions from a clearly irritated JoJo, he said it had to do with the fact he wasn't sure if JoJo was going to pick him in the end. \\"I don't know if it's me,\\" he told her. \\"There are two of us left.\\" JoJo wasn't having any of this and the more upset she got, the more flustered Jordan became – like, he saying the wrong things, forcing JoJo to wonder whether he was actually ready to commit. The conversation carried on into the evening portion of their date, where JoJo jumped right back into the fact that she just couldn't believe Jordan messed this one up so royally by not asking for her parents' blessing. Jordan said a few more of the wrong things (like using the word \\"if\\" when referring to himself getting down on one knee), but he seemed to manage to semi-reassure her that he was committed, 100 percent, and didn't want to lose her. \\"I know you love me.\\" The next day it was finally time for JoJo to make her decision – but first, each man had to pick out a Robby went first and said a whole bunch of nauseating things (i.e. \\"My heart is exploding with love out of my chest\\") and then he wrote her a long love letter because Robby just really wants to be Noah Calhoun from Jordan also picked out a ring – but more importantly, he needed to do damage control for his major screw-up and call JoJo's parents. Soraya and Joseph both gave them their blessing to propose to JoJo, and Jordan wrote JoJo a note to let her know that he wasn't a complete lost cause. As she was getting ready, JoJo received the guys' letters and she basically just lost it. Like, she could not stop crying. \\"I don't feel right. I don't like that,\\" she said between sobs after reading Jordan's letter. \\"It's like, everything I want. I needed to hear this. I needed to know that my family was able to give their blessing. I believe in him.\\" Then she read Robby's note and started crying all over again. \\"These are the things I want to hear before I get engaged to someone,\\" she said. \\"This is the kind of love that I want to have. I can't keep going back and forth. I can't keep doing this to myself. I feel like I'm like, having a panic attack.\\" Finally, the moment we'd all been waiting for arrived: JoJo stood on a gorgeous beach, waiting for her runner-up to arrive so she could break up with him â¦ and out came Robby. \\"This is crazy, it's a good crazy,\\" Robby said, taking her hands. \\"It's the kind of crazy that kept me searching for this forever love that I found in you. â¦ My heart yearns for you, and I undoubtedly and wholeheartedly am in love with you. It's a love that you only hear about in fairy tales and stories. I want to be with you forever. I will love you forever. â¦ I promise to love you 'til the day I die.\\" At this point, JoJo started tearing up and interrupted him. \\"I can't let you get down on one knee,\\" she said. \\"I can't let you do that because I don't want to take that moment from you.\\" \\"What is it?\\" Robby asked. (HOW HAVE YOU NOT CAUGHT ON YET, ROBBY?) \\"Robby, I woke up this morning wanting it to be you,\\" JoJo said. \\"Every day I've been wanting it to be you. I fell in love with you, but for some reason my heart is somewhere else. You have made me feel the type of love that I've always dreamt of feeling. The type of love that I honestly didn't believe existed.\\" \\"I don't know. It's not the love, that's the thing,\\" JoJo replied. \\"I know that you will love me until the day that you die, and you deserve the type of love that you have given me. Robby, I didn't want this. You don't get how badly I wanted it to be you.\\" As for Robby's reaction? For someone who had been telling JoJo how in love with her he was for the last 4 weeks, he seemed weirdly pretty chill with all of this. \\"All I want is for you to be happy,\\" he said. \\"Hopefully in the end you are.\\" She walked him back to the car and it was so awkward. Why were they still holding hands? JoJo could not stop crying. Robby basically didn't shed a single tear, but he kept wiping his face with a handkerchief. It's probably humid in Thailand. Then Robby got in the car and gave his runner-up exit interview – only problem was he mumbled the whole thing into his damn handkerchief and we have no idea what he was saying. After saying goodbye to Robby, JoJo said the only thing getting her through it was the thought of seeing Jordan. He walked up to meet her on the beach – at the exact same spot she had dumped Robby just moments before – and the two embraced. \\"I love you so much,\\" Jordan started. \\"I fell in love first with just us, the person I could be right away with you. How comfortable, and confident, and how you challenged me, continued to challenge me to be the best version of myself and I love that. You made me believe that love doesn't need to have scripts, there's not one way to draw it up. There are moments like this where I'm holding your hands and I'm looking in your eyes and I know.\\" \\"I'm so unbelievably in love with you,\\" he continued. \\"You're my best friend. You're my soul mate. I'm going to keep you safe. I'm going to protect you. I'm going to wake up every morning and choose you over and over and over again 'til you tell me I can't.\\" At this point JoJo interrupted him – but only to finally say those three little words back for the very first time. \\"Jordan, I love you so much,\\" she said. \\"I've been waiting to tell you that I love you. I love you so much. I didn't want you to get down on one knee until I told you that.\\" JoJo Fletcher and Jordan Rodgers on the cover of PEOPLE Then, finally, it happened: \\"I love you so much.

Determine the meanings of each word or phrase:    - පුප්ඵුසීය (pupphusiya) = flowery    - කපාටය (kapaṭaya) = archway    - පිහිටියේ (pihiṭiyē) = located at    - පුප්ඵුසීය (pupphusiya) = flowery (repeated word)    - ධමනියේ (dhamaniyē) = path    - පාදම (pādama) = first step    - තුළ (tḥula) = within    - ය (ya) = go (imperative form of the verb) 4. Use the context to construct the translated English sentence:    \\"Go within the first step of the flowery path located at the flowery archway.\\" So, the answer is: \\"Go within the first step of the flowery path located at the flowery archway.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is Leon's diet? Movie title: The Midnight Meat Train Movie plot: The film opens with a bald man with a briefcase sitting in a moving subway car. As the lights flicker he hears a noise, causing him to stand up. As he walks towards the source of the sound, the next subway car, he slips and falls in a large pool of blood. He then peers through the window to the next car and sees a figure chopping up a bloody corpse. Leon (Bradley Cooper) is a vegan amateur photographer who wants to find unique spots of the L.A. cityscape to shoot and, at the advice of his contractor Susan (Brooke Shields), heads into the city's subway system at night. He is criticized constantly by other photographers for fleeing danger before shooting a full reel. One night, in a decision to break this trend, he saves a woman from a gang that is abusing her. The next day, he discovers this girl has gone missing. Leon is intrigued by the mystery, and begins to investigate newsreels about similar disappearances. His investigation leads him to a butcher named Mahogany (Vinnie Jones), whom he suspects has been killing subway passengers for the past three years. Leon attempts to turn some of the photos he has taken of Mahogany in to the police, but they refuse to believe him and, instead, cast suspicion on his own motives in photographing the victims. Leon's involvement quickly turns into a dark obsession, upsetting his waitress girlfriend Maya (Leslie Bibb), who is as disbelieving of his story as the police chief. Leon takes matters into his own hands, entering the subway train at midnight, only to witness a shocking bloodbath, as the butcher kills several passengers, then hangs them on meat hooks. Passing out on the subway floor, he awakes the next morning in a slaughterhouse with strange markings carved into his chest. A concerned Maya and her friend Jurgis (Roger Bart) begin to examine the photos Leon has been taking of Mahogany, leading them to the killer's apartment. After breaking into the butcher's home, Jurgis is captured, and brutally killed. Maya goes to the police, but finds that they are as unwilling...

Joe Barton (R-TX) has been mostly lampooned for apologizing to BP for the White House’s alleged “shakedown” of the company to create a 20 billion escrow fund, some conservatives have been willing to defend the congressman.      Today, Kentucky Republican Senate nominee Rand Paul — the tea party darling who has himself faced criticism for defending BP — offered his sympathies to Barton, saying he knows “what it is like to be piled on.” While Paul stopped short of endorsing Barton’s point of view, he suggested that the criticism of Barton was “over the top,” and said that Barton “should be given the chance to explain himself”:      “I don’t know about that,” Paul said, when asked about Barton’s statement during an appearance on WVLK-AM radio on Friday. “I don’t want to pile on him. … I know what that feels like. What I will say is I have never liked the tone of the president when he said things or his administration says things like he is going to put the boot on the throat of BP.” [...] “I’m not really in a position to know about what they should do to [Barton] personally. I do know what it is like to be piled on,” he said. “I do know that people sometimes can go over the top and I think he should be given the chance to explain himself.“      Paul joins a host of conservative pundits who have come to Barton’s defense, praising his “courage” and “legitimate point[s].” Meanwhile, the right-wing media’s fearless leader, radio host Rush Limbaugh, threw his weight behind Barton yesterday as well. As the Washington Post’s Dave Weigel noted, “Discussing Barton’s comments, Limbaugh repeatedly called the fund a ’shakedown,’ [and] worried that it was a plot by Obama to ‘redistribute that money to ACORN.’” Limbaugh said the “shakedown” showed the Obama “regime” was behaving like “a branch of organized crime”:      LIMBAUGH: Joe Barton apologized to BP executives on behalf of himself, the American people, for the shakedown. … The United States government may as well be a branch of organized crime the way that it is being conducted and the way it’s doing business, and the way it’s looking out for itself and no one else. … Organized crime. It’s the closest thing I can think to analogize what’s happening here. And even these guys that are being shaken down, they’re paying protection money, and it isn’t enough. It isn’t enough.      Though Barton eventually apologized for his apology, Paul and a large swath of the right’s punditry appear set on defending Barton’s outrageous position. Responding to callers who challenged him for “defending BP,” Limbaugh explained that he was “trying to defend the US Constitution, the American way of life, American exceptionalism, [and] what it was that made this country great.” Many Gulf residents would likely disagree that apologizing to the company that ruined their economy and ecology made this country great. ||||| Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) is under fire from the White House and the Beltway media for his statement to BP today: “I’m only speaking for myself. I’m not speaking for anyone else, but I apologize. I do not want to live in a county where anytime a citizen or a corporation does something that is legitimately wrong, [it is] subject to some sort of political pressure that, again, in my words, amounts to a shakedown.”      Barton should have been apologizing to the American people, not BP, but other than that he is 100% correct. What happened in the White House yesterday was a “shakedown” of Godfather-like proportions. Lets review:      1) BP agreed to pay 20 billion over four years to an “independent” party; 2) BP immediately identified 20 billion in U.S. assets that could be liquidated should BP not be able to pay on time; 3) BP received no assurances that the ultimate economic damages would not be higher; 4) BP is still liable for all individual and state claims in court; 5) The fund is completely separate from any environmental damages, which the Obama administration says could top 30 billion; 6) BP paid another 100 million for workers made unemployed by President Obama’s indefinite ban on offshore oil drilling; 7) BP received no assurance that the White House would not ask for more money if the ban becomes permanent.      All of this was “negotiated” while Attorney General Eric Holder, who has already threatened BP with criminal prosecution, stood in the corner. And what did BP get in return? A single statement from the President saying he did not want to drive BP into bankruptcy. Of course he doesn’t. The mob can’t collect from a bankrupt business. Clinton administration Deputy Attorney General turned BP lawyer Jamie Gorelick let slip what the game is really all about: “We know what it looks like when a company is driven into bankruptcy. The claims that come first are the creditors, then the employees, then the environmental claims, and then the likes of shrimpers. This would not be a good result for anyone.” Well, not anyone who expects the law to be followed.      Yesterday’s White House victim was not BP. It was the rule of law. Just as the Obama administration junked the bankruptcy code last year to protect their union allies, they are doing the exact same thing this time for their environmental ones. |||||","output":"Republican Congressman Joe Barton faced backlash for apologizing to BP in response to the White House's alleged \\"shakedown\\" of the company, which had established a 20 billion escrow fund.

Kentucky Republican Senate nominee Rand Paul expressed his sympathy for Barton and called for public restraint on judgment.

So how can we know what food is healthy? Unluckily, a lot of food that looks good may have pollution. Where is the pollution from? It has something to do with how people produce food: growing it on the farm, processing  it in factories, and making it ready for you to eat. Here's what happens: Most farmers use chemicals  to stop their crops from getting sick. Many of these chemicals remain in the food that you eat. Some people believe this may cause cancer. These chemicals may also pollute water and air, and kill animals and even people by accident. Most drinks are just flavored water  . Every drink coming in plastic bottles which you then throw away means a waste. Sugary drinks make you fat. In the factories, much of what you eat and drink gets messed. Often things are put into food to make it delicious and look good but they might be harmful to people. And some food like meat often gets polluted by bacteria.

What does a dead body smell like after it's started to decompose? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Decomposition: How long does it take for a dead body to start smelling? Decomposition is a complex process that varies depending on several factors, including the environment, temperature, humidity, and the presence of insects, bacteria, and other organisms. It's essential to understand that the timeline for decomposition is not constant, and it may vary significantly from case to case. However, one can provide a general overview and estimate when discussing when a dead body might start smelling. In ideal conditions, a dead body will start decomposing relatively quickly after the time of death. As the body stops circulating blood and bacteria starts breaking down the tissues, producing various chemicals and gases as byproducts, such as putrescine, cadaverine, and indole, which contribute to the characteristic smell of a decomposing body. Internal organs usually start breaking down after 24-48 hours, producing a foul odor as they begin to decay. The process accelerates after the first three days, particularly if the body is exposed to a warm and humid environment. This is when the first signs of external decomposition begin to appear, and the smell becomes much more noticeable. This timeframe may be prolonged in colder environments, as the decomposition process is much slower in cooler temperatures. Additionally, a body is more likely to start smelling when left exposed to air, compared to one that's been wrapped or covered. What does a dead body smell like after it's started to decompose? A decomposing dead body emits a strong, unpleasant odor that is often described as a mix of rotting meat, feces, and a pungent, sweet-moldy smell. This distinctive and unbearable smell is due to the action of bacteria and the release of various decomposing byproducts. The primary chemicals responsible for the odor are cadaverine, putrescine, and skatole, which are the result of amino acid degradation. As decomposition progresses, more chemicals and gases like hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, and volatile organic compounds may contribute to the smell. It is important to understand that the entire decomposition process is dynamic, meaning that the specific smell may change over time as the body goes through different phases of decay. Do those questions have the same meaning? No, those two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question asks how long it takes for a dead body to start smelling, focusing on the timeframe of when the decomposition process will produce an odor. The second question, however, is describing what a dead body smells like after it has started decomposing, focusing on the characteristics and description of the smell itself. While both questions are related to the decomposition process and the resulting odor, they address different aspects of the topic and seek different types of information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Several of these places have since returned to their original names, such as Podgorica, formerly Titograd (though Podgorica's international airport is still identified by the code TGD), and Užice, formerly Titovo Užice, which reverted to its original name in 1992. Streets in Belgrade, the capital, have all reverted to their original pre–World War II and pre-communist names as well. In 2004, Antun Augustinčić's statue of Broz in his birthplace of Kumrovec was decapitated in an explosion. It was subsequently repaired. Twice in 2008, protests took place in Zagreb's Marshal Tito Square, organized by a group called Circle for the Square (Krug za Trg), with an aim to force the city government to rename it to its previous name, while a counter-protest by Citizens' Initiative Against Ustašism (Građanska inicijativa protiv ustaštva) accused the \\"Circle for the Square\\" of historical revisionism and neo-fascism. Croatian president Stjepan Mesić criticized the demonstration to change the name.

The reviewer has expressed strong dissatisfaction with the movie, citing issues in various aspects such as acting, special effects, sound, and lighting, even going as far as mentioning it as one of the top 10 worst movies ever. The only redeeming quality mentioned was the presence of good nude scenes, but this alone does not make the review positive. The reviewer also feels that the crew and actors need more training in their respective fields to improve their skills, and suggests a redo of the movie by a different team. This further reinforces the idea that they were deeply disappointed with the movie, and as such, the review is unquestionably negative in tone and content."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: Oct 9 celebrates what famed explorer, who brought the first Europeans known to have set foot in North America?","output":"October 9th celebrates Leif Erikson, a famed Norse explorer who is credited with bringing the first Europeans known to have set foot in North America. Leif Erikson Day commemorates his achievements and serves as a tribute to his exploratory spirit. Leif Erikson was born around 970 A.D. in Iceland and was the son of Erik the Red, the founder of Greenland's first Norse settlement. Erikson was believed to have grown up in Greenland, and it is likely that his curiosity about the lands lying to the West was influenced by his father's earlier explorations. While many people associate the discovery of America with Christopher Columbus, there is substantial evidence that points to Leif Erikson and his fellow Norsemen landing on the continent almost five centuries earlier. Around the year 1000 A.D., Leif Erikson embarked on a voyage based on stories he had heard from a merchant sailor named Bjarni Herjolfsson, who claimed to have spotted new lands far to the west. Sailing westward from Greenland, Erikson and his men first arrived at a rocky, barren land they named Helluland, which is believed to be modern-day Baffin Island in Canada. Next, they sailed southward to a heavily forested and more hospitable land, which they called Markland, possibly referring to the Labrador coast of Canada. Finally, continuing along the coast, they reached a place with a mild climate and fertile lands teeming with salmon and grapes, which they named Vinland. It is now widely believed that Vinland corresponds to the northern tip of Newfoundland, Canada. The Norse expedition established a temporary settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows, a site that has been extensively excavated and preserved as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Though the Norse settlements in North America didn't last long due to various factors, including conflicts with indigenous peoples and limited support from Greenland and Iceland, Leif Erikson's journey to North America marked a significant moment in the history of exploration. The Norse sagas, or stories, documenting his adventures were passed down orally before they were eventually written down in the 13th and 14th centuries, several hundred years after Erikson's time. In the United States, Leif Erikson Day was first observed on October 9th, 1929, after an initial push by Rasmus B. Anderson, a Norwegian-American teacher, and diplomat, who sought to establish the day to honor Erikson's accomplishments. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson officially established October 9th as Leif Erikson Day through a congressional resolution, and it has since been celebrated annually with proclamations from U.S. presidents and activities that aim to raise awareness about the explorer and his contributions to the history of exploration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"A young man sitting behind a table with a microphone in front of him.\\" This tells us that there is a young man, he is sitting behind a table, and there is a microphone in front of him. Hypothesis: \\"A man is in a chair.\\" This states that there is a man sitting in a chair. Now, let's see if the premise tells us whether the hypothesis is true: 1. The premise states there's a young man, which we can assume to be a man. So there's a match in identifying the subject. 2. The premise mentions that the young man is sitting, and the hypothesis states that the man is sitting in a chair. Although the premise doesn't explicitly mention a chair, it's reasonable to assume that he is most likely sitting on a chair while positioned behind a table. Considering these points, we can conclude that the premise provides enough information to suggest that the hypothesis is likely true. However, it's essential to note that the chair's presence isn't directly mentioned in the premise, making it an inference rather than a definitive confirmation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"In the given process, if more light energy is absorbed by the chlorophyll in a plant, it will directly impact the production of sugar, as light energy is a crucial factor in the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process through which plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. The process can be summarized through the following chemical equation: 6CO2 (carbon dioxide) + 6H2O (water) + light energy -> C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 (oxygen) Here, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, the green pigment present in the chloroplasts of plant cells. This energy is then utilized to perform various steps involved in photosynthesis, including the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Considering the described process, it is evident that an increase in the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll directly impacts a step of the process, i.e., the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose. As a result, more sugar will be produced in the plant. When more light energy is absorbed, the rate at which the plant is able to carry out photosynthesis increases, thereby accelerating the utilization of carbon dioxide and the production of glucose. This additional glucose can then be used by the plant to fuel various cellular processes, growth, and reproduction. Additionally, the extra glucose can also be stored by the plant in the form of starch for use during periods of low light or when the plant's energy demands are higher. In conclusion, an increase in the amount of light energy absorbed by chlorophyll directly impacts a step of the process (conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose), leading to enhanced production of sugar in the plant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As an artist, Francis Bacon was a late starter. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including diaphanous forms, flat backgrounds, and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are \\"aesthetically pleasing\\", they lack \\"a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless\\". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings \\"suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns\\". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, \\"I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.

The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. Our math problem looks like this: -30*p + 13*p + 19*p + 30 = 0 First, we will add the numbers that have \\"p\\" with them. So, let's add -30*p, 13*p, and 19*p together. -30*p + 13*p + 19*p = (-30 + 13 + 19) * p = 2 * p Now the equation looks like this: 2*p + 30 = 0 Next, let's move the 30 to the other side of the equal sign by subtracting it. We will do the subtraction like this: 2*p - 30 = 0 Now, we have 2*p = -30 To find the value of \\"p\\", we need to divide both sides of the equation by \\"2\\". This is how we do it: 2*p / 2 = -30 / 2 When we do the division on each side, we get: p = -15 So, there you have it! The value of \\"p\\" is -15.

Find all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element. We need to find the elements of A starting from index i (3) and go up to index j (10). However, since Python lists are 0-indexed, and j is exclusive, we'll go up to (j-1), which is 9. The required elements are: ['783', 'j', '4557', 'a', 'A', 'D', 'b'] 2. Reverse the order of the elements we found. To reverse the order of the elements, we can use the Python list slicing feature with a step parameter of -1. Reversed elements: ['b', 'D', 'A', 'a', '4557', 'j', '783'] 3. Concatenate the reversed elements to output the resultant string. Now, we need to concatenate these elements to form the output string.

Possible answers:  (A). negative  (B). positive","output":"Based on the context provided in the tweet and the available options, we can analyze this tweet's sentiment as follows: Characteristics that may lead to a negative sentiment: 1. The mention of getting \\"thrown out of pub\\" implies an undesirable and possibly embarrassing experience, which could be viewed as a negative event. 2. The individual is unable to say goodbye to Richard directly; instead, they must send a message via social media. This can indicate that they may have been removed from their friend's company abruptly, which could lead to feelings of disappointment or sadness. 3. The mention of the \\"Bubblegum Army\\" could be interpreted as a sarcastic or mocking remark about the group of friends, depending on the relationship between the individuals involved. Characteristics that may lead to a positive sentiment: 1. The tweet's tone could be interpreted as light-hearted or humorous since it is being shared on social media. The use of \\"thrown out\\" and the reference to the \\"Bubblegum Army\\" could be seen as playful, suggesting that the individual is not taking the situation too seriously and chooses to make light of it. 2. Asking the recipient to say goodbye to Richard and his group of friends may indicate that there is a certain level of camaraderie and bonding within this group. Considering the different aspects of this tweet, it appears that the negative elements (being thrown out of the pub and the inability to say goodbye directly) outweigh the positive aspects (potentially light-hearted tone). Therefore, I would select option (A) negative as the sentiment of this tweet. This assessment ultimately lends itself to the conclusion that the tweet's overall sentiment leans more towards negativity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How to find half of any number  Multiply the number by 5 (five), then move it a decimal point to the left.  6 (six) times 5 is 30, for instance, so put the decimal point in between the 3 and the 0. That would just be 3!  Divide each number by 2 if you have two even digits.","output":"To determine the most logical next event, it is important to first understand the context. If we are discussing the topic of finding half of any given number, the next logical event would revolve around providing a more detailed explanation and additional methods for finding half of a number. Here, I will provide a comprehensive understanding of finding half of any number and different methods that can be employed: 1. The most straightforward method: Divide the given number by 2. This is the most common and simplest approach to find half of a number. Simply dividing the given number by 2 will give you the correct result. For example, to find half of 8, you would divide 8 by 2, which equals 4. This method works for all numbers, including even, odd, fractions, and decimals. 2. The mentioned method: Multiply the number by 5 and move the decimal point to the left. This method works specifically for whole numbers that are divisible by 2. While this method may not be suitable for all numbers, it does work for some and can be a fun alternative approach. For example, to find half of 6, you would multiply 6 (six) by 5, which equals 30. Then, move the decimal point one place to the left to get 3.0, or simply 3. 3. The \\"two even digits\\" method: Divide each digit by 2 (specific condition). This method is only applicable when dealing with a two-digit whole number where both digits are even. In this case, you can divide each digit by 2 and place them next to each other to find half of the number. For example, to find half of 64, you would divide 6 by 2, which equals 3, and 4 by 2, which equals 2. The result is 32. However, this method is not applicable to numbers with odd digits or numbers with more or fewer than two digits. 4. Use a calculator or an app. Many calculators and smartphone apps are available that can help you find half of any number easily and quickly. This is especially useful when dealing with large, complex, or decimal numbers. 5. Convert fractions to decimals and vice versa. For finding half of a fraction, either perform the division by 2 directly on the fraction or convert the fraction to a decimal and then divide by 2. To convert back to a fraction, you can use various techniques, like the common denominator method, or use an online fraction-to-decimal converter for convenience. In conclusion, the most logical next event after discussing this specific method of finding half of a given number would be to elaborate on different methods for finding half a number or providing examples and scenarios where these methods are useful. Understanding multiple methods can be beneficial for different situations and help develop a well-rounded understanding for various mathematical contexts."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This made him realize that his oar moved slower through the (A) choppy water or (B) calm water  Choose the answer between \\"choppy water\\" and \\"calm water\\". The answer is:","output":"To find the answer, we need to analyze the statement carefully. Step 1: Understand the information provided - Milo's oar heats up more when rowing through choppy water compared to calm water. Step 2: Relate the heating of the oar to motion - The heating of the oar is likely caused by friction between the oar and the water. The more significant heating in choppy water suggests there is more friction due to turbulence in the water. Step 3: Determine the relationship between friction and motion - An increased amount of friction suggests more resistance to movement. Therefore, the object (in this case, the oar) would move slower due to greater resistance. Step 4: Apply the relationship to the given options - (A) Choppy water: More heat, more friction, slower movement - (B) Calm water: Less heat, less friction, relatively faster movement Based on the analysis, the answer is \\"choppy water,\\" as the oar moves slower through choppy water due to greater friction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Let's break it down word by word and phrase by phrase: 1. \\"Особенно для тех\\" - this phrase translates to \\"especially for those\\" and refers to the people who prefer outdoor activities. 2. \\"Кто предпочитает\\" - this means \\"who prefer\\" and connects the target group to their preference. 3. \\"Активный отдых на свежем воздухе\\" - this translates to \\"outdoor activities\\" or, more literally, \\"active rest in the fresh air.\\" 4. \\"Наш ресторан\\" - this means \\"our restaurant\\" and emphasizes that the establishment belongs to the speaker. 5. \\"Предлагает\\" - this translates to \\"offers\\" and is used to inform the reader or listener about the special feature in question. 6. \\"Несколько туристических ужинов\\" - this means \\"several tourist-style dinner menus\\" and highlights the multiple options for those who enjoy outdoor activities. So the whole sentence, \\"Особенно для тех, кто предпочитает активный отдых на свежем воздухе, наш ресторан предлагает несколько туристических ужинов,\\" conveys the same idea as the original English sentence, while adapting to the conventions and natural flow of the Russian language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","output":"The Greek government is calling for a dialogue on ways to improve the education system, which currently ranks last among education indices in the Eurozone. The Greek government recognizes the urgent need to address the shortcomings of its education system, as it lags behind its Eurozone counterparts in educational indices. To tackle this issue, numerous steps could be implemented to ensure substantial improvements in educational quality and outcomes for the Greek youth. Firstly, one of the primary concerns is the limited availability of resources and funding for educational institutions across the country. Addressing this issue requires an increased commitment to financial investment in education by the Greek government and potential support from Eurozone partners. In addition, partnerships with private and international organizations could be explored to bring about innovative funding models to sustainably finance improvements in education. Secondly, there is the issue of outdated curriculum and pedagogical practices. The Greek government should encourage and facilitate a comprehensive review and update of the education curriculum, incorporating 21st-century learning priorities such as digital literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Moreover, ensuring that schools in Greece are equipped with modern teaching tools, technologies, and resources will be crucial for moving the education system forward. Thirdly, the professional development of teachers needs to be given high priority. Qualitative improvement in education can be nurtured by offering training and development opportunities to educators, including coaching, workshops, and mentorship programs. Incentivizing professional growth and collaboration within the teaching community will foster the exchange of best practices, improve teaching quality, and ultimately benefit the students. An emphasis should be placed on promoting social inclusiveness and equal access to quality education for all Greek children, regardless of their socio-economic background or geographic location. Policies should be designed to break down barriers in accessing education and fully integrate marginalized or disadvantaged groups into the education system. Furthermore, fostering a strong connection between education and the Greek labor market is essential for equipping the country's youth with marketable skills and increasing their employability. This could be done by integrating vocational training and career guidance into the curriculum, emphasizing the importance of lifelong learning, and promoting collaboration between educational institutions and industry sectors. Finally, the Greek government should focus on better allocating resources and finding innovative ways to enhance overall efficiency in the administration of the education system. Streamlining the management process and consistently evaluating the system's performance using clearly defined metrics can drive targeted improvements. In conclusion, improving the Greek education system requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses financial investment, curriculum modernization, teacher professional development, social inclusiveness, labor market alignment, and efficient resource allocation. Through a collaborative effort between the Greek government and its Eurozone partners, meaningful and sustainable improvements can be achieved for the long-term betterment of the education system in Greece and, ultimately, the future of its citizens."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update.

It's the ugliest, most alien-looking, fatal and pervasive monster in the seas. Garbage patches have been getting a lot of attention lately. These are areas on the seas where currents and winds tend to concentrate floating garbage.      Do you remember when this one hit the headlines? It's not so gigantic, at four meters long, but it was observed 3,380 meters down in the Pacific Ocean near Oahu. It's pretty big to have gone unseen before its May 2001 discovery. So what else is out there? It's pretty clear marine biologists have only just begun discovering what lives in the deep sea. The more time they spend searching, the more they will find. But none would dispute that the nastiest sea monster to ever rise out of the sea is ... (drum roll please) ...      How about giant, ship-destroying squid and octopi? These monsters were old hat even to the easily freaked-out. Most folks figured they were historical exaggerations. That's until some very large and unusual squids started washing up or being hauled in by marine biologists in recent years. Colossal squid are meters long, pretty amazing beasts. Still, they have never been known to lift ships out of the water. And since were on the topic of squids ... Giant Squid Photos      Another possibility is that merfolk were inspired by fish with roughly human-looking faces, like this fellow. First Face? Prehistoric Fish Was a Jaw-Dropper Some fish can look humanoid. That would be enough to get superstitious sailors started.      The manatee has often been called the source of mermaid myths. It's a mammal, so it breathes air. But who would ever mistake a manatee for a sleek and beautiful mermaid? Could it be love-starved sailors with poor eyesight? There was no shortage of these fellows in the days before optometrists.      Mermaids and mermen have always been the stuff of fantasy. Where did the fantasies come from? There are some standard answers to this question, which have always seemed rather inadequate. For instance ... (next slide, if you please) ... Mermaids Exist! And They Are Seismically Sensitive      There are also other, newfound \\"sea serpents\\" our sea-going ancestors never imagined. This one was spotted by a satellite coiling off the south coast of Japan's Hokkaido island. What do we know about it? 1) It's arguably one of the largest organisms on Earth, 2) It swallows ships, engulfs islands and generally does what it wants, and 3) We're darned lucky it's made of plankton. Monster Goldfish Found in Lake Tahoe Research into such massive blooms and the individual plankton cells that comprise them has revealed surprising cooperation among the microorganisms. They appear to operate like more than just floating individual cells. They live and die for the greater good, it seems. So they may be, in fact, a gigantic watery superorganism. Now that's a cool monster for you: You can swim in it and never know you've been in the belly of a beast.      Maybe it's the oarfish. It looks too monstrous to be true. It can grow many meters long, has strikingly bright silver scales, scarlet fins and some ornate headgear that more than explains why some call it a roosterfish. If only it were a reptile, it'd be a true sea serpent. Alas. It is a fish. A very weird and beautiful fish, but still a fish. Is the Loch Ness Monster Dead?      Sea monsters are truly global. This one from Japan serves as the villain for the classic maiden in distress, who awaits rescue by her hero. The poor monsters are almost always cast as the bad guys. And so they usually end hacked to pieces; fish food. But is there any truth behind these sea serpent tales? Ancient Sea Monsters Were Black      We all enjoy a tall tale. Cultures with seafaring traditions are especially ripe in what seem like the tallest sea monster tales of all: hydra, kraken, sirens, scylla, leviathans, assorted serpents and mermaids. Usually the stories are never confirmed and usually baseless. Then again, some of the tales are based on something, or so we are learning as marine scientists plumb the depths and discover some pretty weird creatures. The bottom line: There really are bizarre, unexpected, totally startling monsters found in the seas. And the very worst of these is the most unexpected. VIDEO: Real Life Sea Monsters      A motorboat-sized beast that was at the top of its food chain 170 million years ago is Scotland's first known native marine reptile.      The formidable ocean predator, described in the latest issue of the Scottish Journal of Geology, might have munched on dinosaurs and sharks, since both also lived at or around what is now the Isle of Skye. The predator was an ichthyosaur, meaning an extinct marine reptile that had a pointy head, four flippers and a vertical tail. Together, these features made such animals look like sinister dolphins.      A group of paleontologists working in Scotland studied the remains of the newly discovered ichthyosaur, named Dearcmhara shawcrossi. Dearcmhara --[/i ]pronounced jark vara -- is Scottish Gaelic for \\"marine lizard.\\" The species is one of just a handful ever to have been given a Gaelic name.

DNews Video      \\"Believe it or not, this is the first distinctly Scottish marine reptile species that has ever been described, and our paper is the first paper on ichthyosaurs from Scotland,\\" project leader Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences told Discovery News.      Remains of the animal were found at the Isle of Skye's Bearreraig Bay, where amateur collector Brian Shawcross found them. Instead of keeping or selling them, which often happens, Shawcross donated the specimens to the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. This allowed researchers to study them, determine their significance and piece together what this animal looked like in the flesh.      \\"It would have been roughly 14 feet long or so, and probably would have fed on fish and marine invertebrates,\\" Brusatte said.      Much of Skye was under water 170 million years ago. Skye was joined to the rest of the U.K. then, and was part of a large island positioned between land masses that gradually drifted apart and became Europe and North America.      Sharks in the region during the marine reptile's lifetime were generally smaller and more primitive than today's sharks, so it's possible that Dearcmhara ate them.      As for dinos, Brusatte said, \\"Dinosaurs did live in other parts of Scotland at the same general time as this ichthyosaur was living in the water. We know this from other rare fossils from Skye -- bones, teeth and footprints of very different type of dinosaurs, including big long-necked sauropods and carnivorous theropods.\\"      If any waded or fell into the shallow, warm seas where Dearcmhara lived, they likely would have been dinner for the stealthy ichthyosaur.      Nick Fraser of National Museums Scotland is excited by the discovery, and what it means for his country.      \\"Scotland is well noted for its geology and geologists, including perhaps the most famous of all, James Hutton (often dubbed the Father of Modern Geology, although he lived from 1726 to 1797),\\" Fraser told Discovery News. \\"However, it is not widely noted in the public realm for its fossils, which is unfortunate, as it boasts some incredibly important localities and specimens.\\"      He explained that remains for prehistoric fishes and very early reptiles from the Triassic have been found in Scotland.      \\"Admittedly, there are not the huge rock exposures in Scotland that permit the excavation of spectacular death-beds of dinosaurs as you might find in the American West,\\" Fraser said. \\"Yet, even some of the fragmentary remains that we do find are often of great scientific importance, and that is certainly the case with the Skye Jurassic fossils.\\"      Fraser said that the remains represent a time period, the Middle Jurassic, which is rather poorly known worldwide in the fossil record. Evidence, however, from surrounding periods suggests that animal life then, in the seas and on land, was incredibly rich and diverse.      \\"Skye now seems set to play something of a starring role in shedding light on this window in time,\\" Fraser said.      Both he and Brusatte also have a message for amateur fossil collectors in Scotland.      \\"If you find fossil vertebrate specimens in Scotland, those of us in the scientific community would love to work with you,\\" Brusatte said. \\"If you work with us and donate your fossils to a museum, you might also get a new species named after you!\\" ||||| A handful of ancient bones found on the Isle of Skye more than 50 years ago belonged to a new species of marine predator, scientists have discovered.      The prehistoric reptile – the first ichthyosaur from Scotland to be described in the scientific literature – measured nearly 14 feet from snout to tail.      Unique and distinct features on the animal’s main fin bone suggest that it had different musculature from other ichthyosaurs, which may have made it a stronger swimmer.      A local fossil enthusiast, Brian Shawcross, found the fossilised bones at Bearreraig Bay in 1959 and donated them to the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. But the pieces, belonging to the back, tail and fin, were not recognised as a new species until paleontologists surveyed the remains recently.      To express their gratitude to Shawcross – and to encourage other private collectors to donate their own fossils to science rather than sell them on eBay – the researchers have named the new species after the enthusiast. Officially named Dearcmhara shawcrossi, the species is one of few to have a Gaelic name; the first part is pronounced “jark vara”, and means marine lizard. The species is described for the first time in the Scottish Journal of Geology today.      “It’s not the prettiest specimen in the world. You can hold all of the bones in one hand. But it’s the first time we’ve recognised a distinctly Scottish prehistoric marine reptile,” said Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh.      The reptile dates from the middle Jurassic, about 170m years ago, when Skye was home to lagoons and partly submerged. Ichthyosaurs were among the top marine predators, sharing the seas with long-necked plesiosaurs, and feeding on abundant fish and other marine reptiles.      Despite the remains of the ichthyosaur being so scant, Brusatte said that distinct features on the upper fin bone suggested the Scottish species was new to science. One end of the bone has a large, triangular projection, where muscle would have been attached. Another unique feature is a deep pit on the same bone, which was probably linked to ligaments. “These two distinct features are very strong evidence that it’s a new species,” said Brusatte. “They have something to do with musculature. Maybe they made it swim faster. We just don’t know.”      Ichthyosaurs had four strong fins and lived over a period of 150m years. The more primitive forms, such as the Scottish specimen, were typically smaller, but these gave way to larger creatures with bigger eyes, which became the dominant marine reptiles around the world until they became extinct in the Cretaceous.      Brusatte said that paleontologists were now surveying all fossils from Skye, and called on private collectors to share their specimens. “What people find may be really important and it would be great if there was a way to preserve them for posterity. They are part of Scotland’s heritage,” he said.      • This article was amended on 16 January 2015 because an earlier version said the ichthyosaur measured nearly 14m from snout to tail. This has been corrected to say nearly 14 feet.       ||||| The newly identified prehistoric marine reptile Dearcmhara shawcrossi, a member of a group called ichthyosaurs that swam the world's oceans at the same time that dinosaurs ruled the land, is depicted in this handout illustration provided by Todd Marshall.      Scotland has its very own prehistoric marine reptile - and, no, we're not talking about Nessie, the mythic Loch Ness monster.      Scientists have announced the discovery of the fossil remains of a dolphin-like seagoing reptile on Scotland's Isle of Skye that lived about 170 million years ago and was about 14 feet (4.3 meters) long.      The creature, named Dearcmhara shawcrossi, is a member of a group called ichthyosaurs that were among the dominant marine reptiles when dinosaurs ruled the land. Ichthyosaurs, some of which reached monstrous proportions rivaling all but the largest of today's whales, thrived for more than 150 million years until disappearing about 95 million years ago.      Dearcmhara, a moderate-sized ichthyosaur, swam in warm, shallow seas during the Jurassic Period, eating fish and squid. Its remains are incomplete but the shape of a bone in its front flippers suggests it may have been an especially strong or fast swimmer, the researchers said.      \\"It is from Scotland, and is the first uniquely Scottish marine reptile ever discovered and studied,\\" said University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte, one of the researchers in the study published on Monday in the Scottish Journal of Geology.      \\"Many other marine reptile fossils have been found in Scotland, but the vast majority of these have disappeared into private collections or been sold. This new specimen finally breaks the impasse: it was found by a private collector who did a great thing, donated it to a museum and worked with scientists,\\" Brusatte added.      Amateur fossil hunter Brian Shawcross found the fossils on a beach in the northern part of the Isle of Skye in 1959 and donated them in the 1990s, researchers said. The genus name Dearcmhara (pronounced \\"jark vara\\") is Scottish Gaelic for \\"marine lizard.\\" The species name honors Shawcross.      \\"It is important to emphasize how grateful we are that Brian donated the bones he found all those years ago,\\" added paleontologist Neil Clark of the University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum, which received the fossils.      The discovery sheds light on a span of the Jurassic regarded as nearly a black hole in the marine reptile fossil record, Brusatte said. Scotland is one of the few places with fossils from that time.      Other fossils indicate Dearcmhara lived alongside members of another branch of marine reptiles called plesiosaurs, known for long necks and paddle-like flippers. The elusive Nessie is commonly portrayed as looking like a plesiosaur.      (Reporting by Will Dunham in Washington; Editing by Eric Beech) ||||| Abstract      Fossils of Mesozoic vertebrates are rare in Scotland, particularly specimens of marine reptiles such as plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs. We describe a suite of ichthyosaur fossils from the Early to Middle Jurassic of Skye, which to our knowledge are the first ichthyosaurs from Scotland to be described and figured in detail. These fossils span approximately 30 million years, from the Sinemurian to the Bathonian, and indicate that ichthyosaurs were a major component of Scottish marine faunas during this time. The specimens include isolated teeth that could represent the most northerly known occurrences of the widespread Sinemurian species Ichthyosaurus communis, a characteristic component of the famous Lyme Regis faunas of England, suggesting that such faunas were also present in Scotland during the Early Jurassic. An associated humerus and vertebrae from Toarcian–Bajocian-aged deposits are named as a new genus and species of basal neoichthyosaurian, Dearcmhara shawcrossi. The taxonomic affinities of this taxon, which comes from a critical but poorly sampled interval in the fossil record, suggest that non-ophthalmosaurid neoichthyosaurians dominated European assemblages around the Early–Middle Jurassic boundary, and were later replaced by ophthalmosaurids, whose radiation likely took place outside Europe. Many of these specimens were collected by amateurs and donated to museum collections, a co-operative relationship essential to the preservation of Scotland’s fossil heritage. |||||Summary:","output":"Scientists have discovered a new species of ichthyosaur, a dolphin-like marine reptile, on Scotland's Isle of Skye.

Given the following passage  \\"In 1969 the Cubs, managed by Leo Durocher, built a substantial lead in the newly created National League Eastern Division by mid-August. Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1⁄2 game in front. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.

San Diego (CNN) -- President Obama's critics have the right to be upset by his decision to shield from deportation, at least temporarily, some groups of undocumented immigrants. But they don't have the right to twist the facts, use inflammatory language and create confusion. They're the ones who are most confused. They don't appear to have the foggiest idea how the process would work. That's their own fault. They should have paid closer attention two years ago, the last time the administration did something like this, with the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Simply put, Obama is using the executive power granted to him by the Constitution to reshuffle the immigration enforcement deck and prioritize deportations so that, for instance, the undocumented parents of U.S.-born citizens get a temporary \\"deferred\\" status and thus can't be removed for three years. If it's the latter, a large number of undocumented immigrants -- media reports have put the potential figure at 5 million, although the actual figure is likely to be much lower, given the response to","output":"the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program -- would be able to come out of the shadows, register with the government, and work legally without fear of deportation for a three-year period. This would enable them to contribute to the U.S. economy, pay taxes, and further integrate into American society. Critics argue that this move would encourage more undocumented immigrants to enter the country, but the reality is that this deferred status is temporary and does not offer a pathway to citizenship or even permanent residency. Therefore, it is not an incentive for further illegal immigration. As the story unfolds, we would likely see various reactions and consequences that stem from Obama's decision to implement this executive action: 1. Legal challenges: Opponents of the action are likely to mount legal challenges in an attempt to overturn the decision. However, given the fact that the executive branch is responsible for enforcing immigration laws, and that past presidents have also exercised executive action relating to immigration, it is uncertain whether these challenges would ultimately succeed. 2. Political backlash: The decision is sure to fuel political debates and further polarize the issue of immigration. While some may view the move as a compassionate and pragmatic approach to address the situation of undocumented immigrants, others may see it as executive overreach and a disregard for the rule of law. 3. Impact on the undocumented immigrants: Those who qualify for deferred status would experience a significant change in their lives. The ability to work legally can help them secure better jobs, improve their living conditions, and access better educational opportunities for their children. Additionally, their families would feel more secure, knowing that they would not be separated due to deportation. 4. Economic implications: The temporary legal status of millions of immigrants could potentially contribute to the U.S. economy. These individuals would be more likely to pay taxes, open bank accounts, and contribute to the growth of various industries. Some studies have predicted positive economic impacts from similar moves in the past. 5. Future reforms: This executive action might prompt Congress to finally tackle comprehensive immigration reform. While the temporary nature of this action underscores the need for permanent solutions, the increased attention on the issue could pressure lawmakers to act on bipartisan legislation. In the end, the story would witness President Obama's decision having significant consequences for the individuals affected, the political landscape, and the U.S. as a whole. The precise long-term impact would depend on the response of Congress and how subsequent administrations choose to address immigration. Ultimately, though, the story highlights the complexity of the immigration issue and the importance of finding humane and realistic solutions for those living in the country without proper documentation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Siam Park City Water Park in Thailand is home to the world's largest wave pool certified by Guinness World Records, and Siam Park (Tenerife) in Spain is home to the biggest man made waves (about 3 meters (9.8 ft)) in the world.  - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public.  - The American Museum of Natural History (abbreviated as AMNH), located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, is one of the largest museums in the world. Located in park-like grounds across the street from Central Park, the museum complex comprises 28 interconnected buildings housing 45 permanent exhibition halls, in addition to a planetarium and a library. The museum collections contain over 33 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains, and human cultural artifacts, of which only a small fraction can be displayed at any given time, and occupies more than . The museum has a full-time scientific staff of 225, sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year, and averages about five million visits annually.  - The Upper West Side, sometimes abbreviated UWS, is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, that lies between Central Park and the Hudson River and between West 59th Street and West 110th Street. The Upper West Side is sometimes also considered by the real estate industry to include the neighborhood of Morningside Heights.  - In physics, a standing wave  also known as a stationary wave  is a wave in a medium in which each point on the axis of the wave has an associated constant amplitude. The locations at which the amplitude is minimum are called nodes, and the locations where the amplitude is maximum are called antinodes.  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae.

Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If the Sun's gravity is less strong, this would result in a reduced force pulling its mass inward. Consequently, there would be less pressure on the Sun. The decreased pressure would likely cause a reduction in the rate of nuclear reactions, as hydrogen atoms would not fuse together as effectively. This reduction in nuclear reactions would lead to a decrease in the amount of energy produced, which in turn would impact the emission of different kinds of light.

He just sat in the passenger seat as I drove, relaxed, mouth hanging slightly open, looking at me the way someone examines a menu but can't decide on the chicken or the veal. The desert sky was on fire when the city came into view. Cerberus turned away from me and stuck his head out from the side of the jeep, his giant tongue flapping in the eighty mile an hour wind while I dialed Luna's number. The dog pulled his head back in, then rested his chin on top of the overhead roll-bar, his fur blowing back along his head like the spines of a porcupine. \\"Hello?\\" \\"Hey, Luna.\\" \\"Dingo! Are you there yet?\\" \\"No, not yet. I'm just outside the city.\\" Vegas flashed and blinked under the starless sky. \\"You get in touch with Mr. Waciejowski?\\" \\"Sure did. He's at the Denny's near the Excalibur. He's trying to stay away from the blackjack tables.\\" \\"Yeah, good for him. He has the box?\\" I could hear Luna stuffing something disgustingly healthy in her mouth. \\"Mmm hmm.\\" \\"He hasn't opened it, has he?\\" She swallowed. \\"Nah. I told him it was filled with old photos.\\" Cerberus shifted in the seat and scratched behind his neck with such force that the whole Jeep shook; a rather unsettling motion at 80 miles an hour. \\"Hey Luna, I've got a question for you.\\" I looked over to see the dog's nostrils flared out in the wind while his lips blew back and revealed his frightening set of teeth. \\"This, uh, this animal spirit guide you had me try to find. Do they ever show up, you know, in person?\\" Question: When did Cerberus scratch his neck? Options:  A. not enough information  B. After getting to Vegas.  C. After Dingo called Luna.  D.

Greg Tenorly and Cynthia Blockerman had been through quite an ordeal together--being hunted by police for the murder of her abusive husband while they ran from the real killer. But all that was behind them now. All charges against them had been dropped, and Cynthia's husband had been buried. And the rumors would have died down eventually if they had gone their separate ways. They could feel the stares as they walked to their table. Greg had requested the most private booth, way in the back. Coreyville Pasta House was the oldest Italian restaurant in town. And still the best. Mama Castilla had run the place for over thirty years. She had taken over for her grandfather in 1973. A sign on the wall said so. Cynthia ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo. Greg went with his favorite, the Chicken Parmesan. Both ordered iced tea and salad. The bread and olive oil with roasted garlic and pepper came with every meal. Greg could not resist great bread. And this was the best. He tore off a chunk as soon as the waitress delivered it. Cynthia would wait for the salad. \\"So we're finally on a real date,\\" said Greg. \\"Yeah. So how does it feel?\\" \\"Kinda weird and scary and...wonderful.\\" Cynthia smiled and Greg momentarily forgot all about the amazing aroma in the restaurant. All he wanted to do was kiss her. But that would have to wait. So, his hunger came rushing back. Cynthia's mood turned serious. \\"I don't want to spoil our date, but I've got to tell you something.\\" Greg wondered if he had done something wrong. He could fix it--whatever it was. \\"I've asked Mom to move in with me.\\" \\"Why? I thought she was happy living in Marshall.\\" \\"She was.\\" \\"What do you mean? What happened?\\" \\"The other night a friend of hers was murdered. And the woman lived on her street. They killed her nurse too.\\" Question: How long did Greg and Cynthia probably know each other?

Add punctuation: What is the difference between NonReversible and Reversible Temperature Labels","output":"What is the difference between Non-Reversible and Reversible Temperature Labels? Non-reversible and reversible temperature labels are two different types of temperature indicators used for monitoring and measuring temperature changes. The primary difference between them lies in their ability to indicate temperature changes and whether they can return to their original state once the temperature has reached a certain level. Non-Reversible Temperature Labels: Non-reversible temperature labels, also known as irreversible temperature labels, are designed to provide a permanent record of temperature changes. These labels feature a temperature-sensitive material that changes color or shape when exposed to a specific temperature threshold, usually in the form of a stripe, dot, or other visual indicator. Once the temperature-sensitive material has undergone a change, it is unable to return to its original state. This makes non-reversible temperature labels particularly useful in situations where a record of temperature peaks is needed, such as ensuring that a material or product has been exposed to high temperatures during sterilization or heat treatment, or to monitor cold chain conditions for perishable goods. Advantages of Non-Reversible Temperature Labels: 1. Permanent record: Provides a clear and lasting indication of temperature changes, which is helpful for quality control and compliance purposes. 2. Wide temperature range: Non-reversible labels can be designed for various temperature thresholds, making them suitable for a range of applications. 3. Ease of use: The simplicity and visual nature of the labels make them easy to read and interpret. Reversible Temperature Labels: Reversible temperature labels, on the other hand, are designed to change their appearance or characteristics in response to temperature fluctuations and then return to their original state once the temperature returns to its initial level. These labels are typically made using materials such as liquid crystals or other thermochromic substances. The reversible nature of these temperature labels allows them to be used in applications where continuous monitoring and real-time feedback of temperature changes are essential. They can be particularly helpful for monitoring temperature fluctuations in equipment, products, or environments, where maintaining a consistent temperature is crucial for performance, safety, or product quality. Advantages of Reversible Temperature Labels: 1. Reusability: Their ability to return to their original state after a temperature change makes them cost-effective for long-term or continuous monitoring applications. 2. Real-time monitoring: Provides instant feedback on temperature fluctuations, allowing for quick adjustments to be made if necessary. 3. Customizable: Can be designed with a precision temperature range to suit specific applications and industries. In summary, the key differences between non-reversible and reversible temperature labels are their response to temperature changes and their ability to either permanently record or continually monitor temperature fluctuations. Non-reversible temperature labels provide a lasting indication of temperature peaks, making them ideal for situations where a permanent temperature record is needed. Reversible temperature labels, however, offer continuous monitoring and real-time feedback on temperature changes, making them suitable for applications where maintaining consistent temperatures is critical."},{"instruction":"This article: Romance was released internationally on 19 November 1991, and sold over 400,000 copies in its first 10 days.

Voice your boundaries with someone you'll see often. Stop answering the person's calls, emails, and other messages. Remove the person from your phone and social media accounts.\\"","output":"Title: Establishing Boundaries: How to Tackle Unhealthy Relationships and Protect Your Well-Being Introduction Personal boundaries are crucial for maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle. It's essential to be able to voice one's boundaries and convey them with confidence. However, naming and addressing unhealthy behaviors can be challenging, especially in recurring relationships. This article aims to discuss ways to identify and address inappropriate behavior, establish boundaries in the process, and protect one's well-being in various situations.  Identifying the Behavior & Acknowledging Its Inappropriateness The first step in establishing boundaries is to identify the behavior that is causing discomfort. Unhealthy behaviors can take multiple forms such as jealousy, manipulation, guilt-tripping, constant criticism, or controlling behavior. Acknowledging that this behavior is wrong and has a negative impact on your life is essential in building the confidence needed to address the situation. This realization often leads to feeling empowered and ready to set personal boundaries. Asking the Person to Stop Contacting You If the person's behavior is aggressive or you find yourself continuously hurt by their actions, it's essential to make a firm, clear, and direct request for them to stop contacting you. State clearly that you will no longer tolerate the distressing behavior and demand that they cease any form of communication. Be assertive, yet respectful, as it not only displays your determination to protect yourself but also ensures that you maintain the moral high ground. Voicing Your Boundaries with Someone You'll See Often When dealing with someone you'll regularly encounter, such as a coworker, family member, or neighbor, the situation can be more delicate. In these cases, establishing a dialogue to voice concerns and set healthy boundaries is key. Adopt a non-judgmental, calm, and assertive tone while explaining how the person's behavior is impacting you. Set limits on what you consider acceptable behaviors and the consequences should these boundaries be violated. Asserting oneself can lead to a better understanding and subsequently, a healthier relationship. Stop Answering the Person's Calls, Emails, and Other Messages Once the boundaries have been established, it's crucial to maintain firmness and consistency. Ignoring the individual's calls, texts, emails, and other messages can be an effective way to nullify the negative impact of unwanted communication. By doing so, you are taking control of the situation and signaling the importance of respecting your boundaries. Moreover, this enables you to distance yourself from the unhealthy relationship and focus on your well-being. Removing the Person from Your Phone and Social Media Accounts In today's world, virtual connections and social media play a significant role in maintaining relationships. Blocking or unfriending the person from social media platforms can serve as a concrete step in reinforcing the established boundaries. It not only cuts off a platform for their negative behavior but also allows you to recover from the stress and move on with your life. By removing their presence from your daily routine, you also create room for positive relationships and self-growth. Conclusion: Asserting personal boundaries protects your well-being, reinforces your self-worth, and sets the stage for developing healthier relationships. Keep in mind that you have the right to distance yourself from anyone causing you distress, regardless of their relation to you. By identifying inappropriate behavior, asking the person to stop contacting you, voicing your boundaries with someone you'll see often, and ultimately cutting off all forms of communication, you can regain control over your life and ensure your relationships are fostering support and growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any mitigating factors exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty – either death or life in prison, either with or without parole.

Movie title: The Mummy Movie plot: In Thebes, Egypt, 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep has a love affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti I. When the Pharaoh discovers the affair, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun assassinate him. Imhotep flees, while Anck-su-Namun kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the resurrection ritual is stopped by Seti's bodyguards, the Medjai. Imhotep's priests are all mummified alive, while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai, the worst of Egyptian curses, buried alive with flesh eating scarab beetles. Imhotep is sealed away in a sarcophagus at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis and kept under strict surveillance by the Medjai to prevent Imhotep's return. In 1926, Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister Evelyn, a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, an intricate box and map, which leads to Hamunaptra. Jonathan reveals he stole the box from an American adventurer, Rick O'Connell, who encountered the city while in the French Foreign Legion. Rick makes a deal with Evelyn to lead them there if they release him from prison.

But instead we used my new credit card to pay for the plane tickets since we bought it as a bundle of 5 and it came out to 3942. So basically i hit my mark. Then the next day we were talking about the trip and one of my friends said oh we can use the points you got towards all our train tickets and my other friends agreed. Then I said no because those are my points. I told them from the beginning they could sign up for this deal and they all just ignored me. Then they said how I was shady and greedy for not wanting to share the travel points and that it's because of their collective effort that I was able to obtain the points in the first place. But I mentioned that I could've just bought visa gift cards which was my original plan and they just kept saying that I was sketchy. Then one of them said if you're really going to be this greedy then just refund the tickets and I'll buy mine on my own. So I refunded the tickets and decided that I didn't want to spend 2 weeks in a foreign country with these guys if they were really going to be this petty. A:","output":"In this situation, it is not entirely clear-cut whether the author, nobody, everybody, or other is wrong, as it depends on individual perspectives on the ethical aspects of the situation. However, I will attempt to analyze the situation and provide a yes or no answer for each party involved. 1. AUTHOR: Is the author wrong? NO. The author shared the information about the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card and its sign-up bonus with their friends. The author's friends chose not to participate in the deal. It is understandable that the author would want to use the points they earned individually for their own expenses. The author's original plan was to buy visa gift cards to reach the 4,000 spending requirement, so their friends' involvement is not vital for them to obtain the bonus points. 2. NOBODY: Is no one in the situation wrong? NO. While there may be a lack of clear communication and understanding between the friends, this does not necessarily mean that nobody is wrong in the situation. Both the author and their friends could have handled the situation better, so it is not accurate to say that nobody is wrong. 3. EVERYBODY: Is everyone in the situation wrong? YES. All parties involved could be considered to have some level of fault. The author's friends could have been more open to considering the credit card deal provided by the author. However, the author could have also been more explicit in stating up front that the points earned from booking the tickets would not be shared. The situation may have been resolved differently if communication was clearer from all parties. 4. OTHER: Is someone other than the author or their friends wrong in the situation? NO. The situation described does not involve any other party besides the author and their friends, so it is not possible to attribute any wrongdoing to someone other than those involved in the situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Teacher:You are supposed to identify the category of a high-school level math question. There are five possible categories (1) algebra (2) arithmetic (3) measurement (4) numbers, and (5) probability. Use the following guidelines: (1) 'algebra' questions will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable (2) 'arithmetic' questions will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root or value of expressions involving brackets (3) 'measurement' questions are questions that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit (4) 'numbers' questions will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM etc. (5) 'probability' questions will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question must belong to only one category. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Let s(z) = -z**3 + 4*z**2 + 7*z + 2. Let g be s(5). Suppose -3*h + 155 + 526 = 0. Let b = 323 - h. What is the highest common divisor of g and b? Student:","output":"First, let's break down the given problem into smaller parts and analyze each part to understand which category it belongs to. 1. The problem is given a function s(z) = -z**3 + 4*z**2 + 7*z + 2. 2. We are asked to find the value of g, where g = s(5). 3. We are given an equation -3*h + 155 + 526 = 0. 4. We are asked to find the value of b, where b = 323 - h. 5. Finally, we are asked to find the highest common divisor of g and b. Now let's analyze which category each part falls under: 1. The function s(z) contains letter variables (z) and requires us to find the value of g, which indicates that this part is related to 'algebra'. 2. Finding the value of g is a computation based on the given function and input (5), which is also related to 'algebra'. 3. The equation -3*h + 155 + 526 = 0 contains letter variables (h) and requires us to find the value of h, which is again related to 'algebra'. 4. Finding the value of b is a computation involving both numbers and variables (323 - h), which is also related to 'algebra'. 5. The highest common divisor of g and b is a concept related to 'numbers', as it deals with divisors, GCD, etc. Overall, the main idea of this question revolves around solving algebraic expressions and then applying a concept from the 'numbers' category. Since the majority of the problem requires working with algebraic expressions, I would categorize this high-school level math question as (1) algebra."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

Movie title: The King Movie plot: The city of Kozhikode is victimized by a massive communal riot against the slums, costing the lives of 12 people. Madhu Kumar (Appa Haja), a wildlife photographer, had witnessed a group of criminals transporting explosives through the local forest check post, so he calls up the local police commissioner Shankar (Devan) and passes the information. Shankar asks him to wait for his officers to pick him up. But instead of the police, it was the same goons who came for Madhu, resulting in his death. While having the police to fight against the rioters, the aggressive and belligerent, yet honorable and incorruptible district collector Joseph Alex IAS (Mammootty) is suspicious of Shankar's activities and decides to investigate the case. He is assisted by ASP Prasad (Ganeshan), one of the sincere officers who admires Joseph for his arrogant way of dealing politicians and officials. Also tagging along with Alex is the young assistant district collector Anuradha Mukerji IAS (Vani Viswanath), whose freecare style conflicts against Alex's strict behavior because of her tragic childhood. It later turns out that Anura's behavior was rooted from a horrible experience of when her father continuously cheated on her mother a lot, and that her mother prayed to her to no avail, which is why Anura pretended to be a freak to ease her pain. Upon learning this, Alex decides to warm up to her. The next day, Alex is brought over to a personal hearing with the state minister John Vargeese (Kollam Thulasi), who berates him over his behavior while attempting to stop the riots. However, Alex stands up by berating Varghese for his belief to using his power to hurt others. Meanwhile, Madhu's father (Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair) reaches out to Prasad for filing a man missing complaint, resulting Prasad in discovering the body of Madhu in a decomposed stage with his camera, but the film is missing. As the investigation heats up, the local Member of Parliament Jayakrishnan (Murali) is struggling over the issues over the damaged area. However,... Answer:","output":"The leader behind the massacre of Madhu in the movie titled \\"The King\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the plot provided. However, it can be inferred that there are several characters who could potentially have a hand in Madhu's death directly or indirectly. These characters include: 1. Police Commissioner Shankar (Devan): Shankar is the main suspect in orchestrating the massacre since he was the one Madhu had contacted after witnessing criminals transporting explosives. Instead of sending his officers to pick up Madhu as promised, the same goons involved in the crime showed up, leading to Madhu's death. This indicates a high possibility that Shankar is involved in the entire ordeal, or at least in leaking the information about Madhu to the criminals. 2. State Minister John Vargeese (Kollam Thulasi): John Vargeese is an influential political figure who may have been involved in the communal riots and the transport of explosives. He could be directly or indirectly involved with the individuals responsible for the massacre. His confrontation with District Collector Joseph Alex IAS (Mammootty) displays his resentment towards Alex's attempt to fight against the riots, potentially revealing his involvement in the chaos. 3. Local Member of Parliament Jayakrishnan (Murali): Jayakrishnan is another politician who may have some connection with either the riots or the individuals who caused Madhu's death. His struggle with addressing the aftermath of the damaged area could hint at his unwillingness to take full responsibility or could be a cover-up for his potential connections with the criminals. 4. Criminals transporting explosives: The actual goons who killed Madhu while transporting the explosives are the direct culprits behind Madhu's death. However, they might have been acting upon the orders from a higher authority, which could be one of the mentioned characters above or someone else not explicitly mentioned in the provided plot. To sum up, it is not explicitly clear who is the leader behind the massacre of Madhu in \\"The King,\\" but the characters listed above may have connections or several levels of involvement leading up to his death.

Kinnaird died in 1923, and his family kept it in their possession, out of view, until putting it up for auction in 2005. It was duly sold at Christie's auction house on 19 May 2005 for £420,000 (£478,400 including auction fees and taxes). The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia, surpassing the £254,000 paid for the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy in 1997. The successful bidder was David Gold, the then joint chairman of Birmingham City; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country, Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation. Accordingly, Gold presented the trophy to the National Football Museum in Preston on 20 April 2006, where it went on immediate public display. It later moved with the museum to its new location in Manchester. In November 2012, it was ceremonially presented to Royal Engineers, after they beat Wanderers 7–1 in a charity replay of the first FA Cup final.

SAO PAULO, Brazil (Reuters)  -- The main runway at Brazil's busiest airport reopened Friday, 10 days after a passenger jet skidded off its rain-slicked surface and crashed, killing almost 200 people in the country's worst aviation disaster. At least 12 people also were killed on the ground when the Tam Airlines plane rammed into a cargo terminal. Authorities opened the recently repaved runway at Sao Paulo's Congonhas Airport even though it has not yet been entirely grooved to drain rainwater and prevent planes from slipping when they touch down. Landings will be restricted in wet weather until the surface is completely grooved, which could take weeks. In the meantime, flights arriving in heavy rains will touch down on the backup runway at Congonhas or be diverted to the city's Guarulhos International Airport. The main runway at Sao Paulo's Congonhas was reopened after being inspected by new Defense Minister Nelson Jobim, who was appointed Wednesday to overhaul Brazil's ailing aviation sector. The defense ministry and the air force oversee airports and air traffic in Brazil. The runway, one of the shortest in the country, has been at the center of a fierce debate over air safety since an Airbus A320 carrying 187 people crashed in a botched landing attempt on July 17. The plane, flown by Brazilian carrier TAM Linhas Aereas, barreled off the landing strip in the rain and rammed into a cargo terminal and gas station, bursting into flames. Everyone on board and at least 12 more on the ground were killed in the accident. Authorities are investigating if the runway, which is known for being slippery, was unsafe for landing in the rain. Investigators also are trying to determine if possible pilot error and mechanical problems contributed to the crash. Air travel in Brazil descended further into chaos after the accident, the second major aviation disaster in the country in 10 months. In September, 154 people were killed when a Boeing 737 clipped wings in midair with a private jet and crashed in the Amazon jungle. The closure of the main runway at Congonhas after the TAM crash forced airlines to cancel hundreds of flights and caused a ripple effect of delays around the country. Since then, revolts at ticket counters have become routine and some airlines have even urged passengers to travel by bus. Air travel was slowly starting to return to normal Friday, with fewer delays and cancellations around the country, according to Brazil's airports authority Infraero. At Congonhas, however, 40 percent of all flights were canceled Friday morning before the runway reopened. E-mail to a friend. Copyright 2007 Reuters.

Write a summary based on this article: Gary Cohn and Donald Trump Getty Images/Pool      President Donald Trump on Thursday praised his top economic adviser Gary Cohn, who announced his resignation on Tuesday, and said he could return to the White House in the future.      \\"This is Gary Cohn's last meeting of the Cabinet, with the Cabinet, and he's been terrific,\\" Trump said at a Cabinet meeting. \\"He may be a globalist, but I still like him. He's seriously a globalist, there's no question. But you know what? In his own way he's a nationalist because he loves this country.\\"      Reports have suggested Cohn may be considered for a major role in the future and is open to coming back. Prior to Cohn's departure, Trump spoke to Cohn about becoming chief of staff.      \\"He's going to go out, make another couple hundred million, and then he's going to maybe come back,\\" Trump said. \\"You're going to come back right?\\"      \\"Absolutely,\\" Cohn replied.      \\"We'll be here another seven years hopefully, and that's a long time, but I have a feeling you'll be back,\\" Trump continued. \\"I don't know if we can put him in the same position though, he's not quite as strong on those tariffs as we want him.\\"      Cohn was on of the major voices in the administration speaking against the newly announced tariffs on steel and aluminum. The former Goldman Sachs executive has argued that the tariffs will end up hurting the US economy. ||||| President Donald Trump in a Thursday Cabinet meeting offered little clarity on his upcoming tariffs announcement and joked that his outgoing economic adviser Gary Cohn was a \\"globalist\\" who could one day return to the administration.      Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      The president said he’s going to be “very fair” and “very flexible” on tariffs and reiterated he wants a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum.      But he then laid out a considerable amount of potential wiggle room for some countries.      “I’ll have a right to go up or down depending on the country and I’ll have a right to drop out countries or add countries,” Trump said. “I just want fairness, because we have not been treated fairly by other countries.”      Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images      The administration had already said Wednesday evening that Canada and Mexico would be initially exempted in whatever tariffs the president announces, although Trump said that could change depending on the results of negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.      In a tweet earlier this morning, Trump said the U.S. must show quote \\"great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military.\\"      During the president's remarks on 'flexibility,' Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross clinked their water glasses. The two had been on opposite sides of this tariff fight – Mattis pushing for exemptions for national security while Ross has backed the tariffs, dismissing talk of retaliation by allies and the potential for lost jobs.      Trump also used the meeting as a farewell to Cohn, who announced his plans to resign this past Tuesday after failing to convince the president not to implement tariffs.      \\"He may be a globalist, but I still like him,\\" the president said of Cohn, who was seated just behind him.      The president also teased a potential revolving door return in Cohn's future.      \\"He's going to go out and make another of couple hundred million, and then he's going to maybe come back,\\" Trump said, though he added he didn't expect Cohn to return to his same position considering the tariffs fight. ||||| GOP angst is reaching new heights with Gary Cohn’s departure from the White House, as congressional Republicans lose a key check on Donald Trump’s proclivity for protectionism.      The outgoing economic adviser to Trump is one of Hill Republicans’ most accessible conduits to the White House. He’s worked closely with them on tax reform, banking deregulation and, most critically, pushing back against new tariffs — an argument that Cohn clearly lost.      Story Continued Below      Republican leaders are still pushing to limit the scope of new tariffs on aluminum and steel. But at a crucial moment in their fight against a president from their own party, they’re about to be down a key ally. And with no prominent free traders left in the White House, Republicans worry Trump might take even more drastic measures like withdrawing from NAFTA and end up hobbling the economy in an election year.      “He’s got a sound and needed voice at the White House to counter some of the other voices and I hate to see him leave,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). “Importantly, he was around to be whispering in the president’s ear. And he won’t be now.”      “He’s a voice of reason on economic issues and a big picture guy who paid a lot of attention to what some of these policy decisions and implications are for the larger economy,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). “I don’t know who replaces that.”      The most reliable politics newsletter. Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.      That very question — who will replace Cohn? — perplexed a group of House conservatives during a closed-door Republican Study Committee meeting Wednesday. RSC Chairman Mark Walker (R-N.C.) had invited House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) to discuss the proposed tariffs with the group, and lawmakers fretted that they have no one to turn to in the West Wing to talk Trump down.      \\"We need an advocate in 'the circle,' because it seems like the people who are influencing Trump right now are more pro-tariff, like Peter Navarro,\\" Walker said, recounting the meeting. Navarro is one of Trump's top trade officials and helped convince the president to embrace his hawkish views on trade.      On Wednesday afternoon, the RSC released a formal statement finding that \\"tariffs on imported goods are a tax.\\" Soon after, 107 House Republicans led by the Ways and Means Committee sent a letter to Trump urging him to carefully tailor any tariffs to avoid shocks to the economy.      In interviews with a half-dozen Republicans in the aftermath of Cohn’s resignation announcement, the anxiety in the Republican Party was plain: If the tariffs get out of hand, a trade war could commence and cripple the U.S. economy as well as the GOP’s electoral prospects.      As Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) deadpanned, “A depression wouldn’t be a good thing.”      “I certainly agreed with him with his stance on the tariff issue, so I hate to him go as an adviser,” Johnson said. He worries that the GOP’s efforts to boost the economy through deregulation and tax cuts could be undone in a matter of days. “I’d hate to see that undermined by the uncertainty by potential trade wars. I don’t see how people win trade wars.”      Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who has been personally trying to dissuade Trump from instituting new tariffs, even said he thinks he might be able to convince Cohn to change his mind and stay.      “It’s a bad thing, because he’s one of the best people I’ve seen in government the whole time I’ve been here,” Hatch said. “I actually think we might be able to get him back.”      That Republicans are now begging for Cohn to stay represents a remarkable shift. Many in the GOP viewed Cohn, a registered Democrat, with skepticism when Trump tapped him to lead the National Economic Council last January. Now, they view him as an angel on Trump’s right shoulder countering an economic protectionist devil — Navarro — on the left.      But Hatch’s effort to convince Cohn to stay seems like a long shot. And without Cohn, there is no obvious avenue for the GOP’s myriad free traders to turn. Cohn was a crucial asset for the White House’s work with Capitol Hill, easy to reach and easy to negotiate with, according to Republican aides.      Cohn also was one of the few Trump officials that actually did have some sway with the minority party.      “He’s been the voice of reason in the administration and I’m sad to see him go,” said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.).      In Cohn’s place, Republicans are concerned that Navarro’s influence will become more acutely felt as the president tries to renegotiate NAFTA. Thune said Navarro is giving Trump “bad advice.”      “I’m not a fan of his policies. I think he’s a protectionist,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), who has been leading the effort on Capitol Hill to keep the United States in NAFTA.      Some Republicans are hoping there are still a few voices inside the administration to provide a counterweight to Navarro, not to mention Trump, who’s also a longtime trade skeptic.      “I have a lot of confidence in [budget chief] Mick Mulvaney,” Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) told MSNBC when asked about any concerns he has following Cohn’s departure. “Mick used to be a free-trader.”      In an interview in the Capitol Wednesday, Republican Rep. Peter King of New York tried to list a few potential replacements for Cohn but seemed to be unsatisfied with his own answers other than Larry Kudlow, a free-market economist and TV personality.      “I would have said [Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared] Kushner, but I don’t know,” King said. Treasury Secretary Steven “Mnuchin? He seems to be going out of his way to talk about NAFTA, how they could change the tariffs for Canada and Mexico. He might be more sympathetic. I don’t know. I’m trying to think. Mick Mulvaney?”      For now, Republican senators have been taking their views on trade to Chief of Staff John Kelly, Thune said, but that might not be enough to persuade Trump. If the party wants to have any hope of limiting the scope of Trump’s oft-threatened trade war without the help of Cohn, it might have to be through the president himself.      “The president’s also very accessible. He’s actually in some ways easier to get ahold of” than Cohn, Corker said. “So if you want to voice something, you can voice it directly to him.” ||||| Trump: I still like Cohn and he may come back to the White House 1:11 PM ET Fri, 9 March 2018 | 01:36      President Donald Trump said Thursday that White House chief economic advisor Gary Cohn's departure from his administration may be temporary.      \\"This is Gary Cohn's last meeting of the Cabinet.

Article: He was once the most famous Disney character in existence, the first animated creature to entertain a nation of children while Mickey Mouse was but a twinkle in the eye.      Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, the long-eared precursor to Mickey , is to become a star once again after a long-lost Disney film was discovered.      A frame from a rare, long-lost, Walt Disney animated film Sleigh Bells (1928) featuring the first ever Disney character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit Photo: BFI National Archive/Walt Disney Animation Studios      Sleigh Bells, a six-minute-long animation, was first broadcast in 1928, but has long disappeared from public memory after all copies were lost.      Next month, a fully-restored version of the film is to be screened for the first time in decades, after a researcher spotted it among one million items in the BFI National Archive.      It is understood to have been donated to the extensive archive in the early 80s, as part of a collection of film stock from a closing Soho laboratory.      No-one, however, noticed its significance, and it was entered into the archive’s database and left before anyone realised it was the only surviving copy in the world.      Earlier this year, an American researcher, who was looking for lost titles, typed the name of the film into a new online database at the BFI, and was astonished to find it was in its stocks.      The long-lost film, the last surviving record of Sleigh Bells, will now show Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in all his glory.      Fans of Disney will recognised the character’s close similarities with Mickey Mouse, with just a long pair of ears to distinguish the two.      His creators, Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, went on to create Mickey, following a contractual disagreement with Universal, for whom they had created the Oswald films.      A spokesman for the BFI said: “Oswald the Lucky Rabbit was invented by Walt Disney in 1927 and was loved for his mischievous and rebellious personality.      “A number of other films do survive but Sleigh Bells has been, until now, a lost film, unseen since its original release.”      Robin Baker, head curator at BFI National Archive, said, “What a joyful treat to discover a long-lost Walt Disney film in the BFI National Archive and to be able to show Sleigh Bells to a whole new audience 87 years after it was made.      “The restoration of this film will introduce many audiences to Disney’s work in the silent period – it clearly demonstrates the vitality and imagination of his animation at a key point in his early career.”      Andrew Millstein, president of Walt Disney Animation Studios, added, \\"The Oswald shorts are an important part of our Studios' history, and we have been working with film archives and private collectors all around the world to research the missing titles.”      The world premiere of the new restoration of the film, by Walt Disney Animation Studios, will take place at BFI Southbank on December 12 as part of a programme It’s A Disney Christmas: Seasonal Shorts. ||||| Story highlights Rare film dates back to 1928 -- the same year Mickey Mouse was created      A researcher re-discovered the \\"holy grail\\" of Disney films while browsing an online catalog      \\"Sleigh Bells\\" has been digitally remastered and will premiere in December      (CNN) Mickey Mouse is Walt Disney's most popular cartoon character and a staple of almost every childhood in the western world.      But, had a business deal gone differently, would Oswald the Lucky Rabbit -- the first Disney character ever created -- have been the star of Disneyland and present in every toddler's toy collection?      A rare and long-lost silent film, \\"Sleigh Bells\\" from 1928, has just been rediscovered in the British Film Institute (BFI), which stars Oswald, the Disney star who never was.      \\"Sleigh Bells\\" was made by Walt Disney and fellow animator Ub Iwerks, but the rights to the character Oswald were owned by Universal. Following a contractual disagreement, Disney and Iwerks stopped making Oswald films and went on to create Mickey Mouse.      \\"There's a good argument to be made that had Walt Disney not fallen out with Universal over contracts, he would have gone on to make 100 more Oswald films and Mickey Mouse may never have been created,\\" Justin Johnson, an Animation Programmer at BFI told CNN.

On his eleventh birthday Harry discovers from a mysterious stranger, Rubeus Hagrid, that he is actually a wizard, famous in the Wizarding World for surviving an attack by the evil Lord Voldemort when Harry was only a baby. Voldemort killed Harry's parents, but his attack on Harry rebounded leaving only a lightning-bolt scar on Harry's forehead and rendering Voldemort powerless. Hagrid reveals to Harry that he has been invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After buying his school supplies from the hidden London street, Diagon Alley, Harry boards the train to Hogwarts via the concealed Platform 9Â¾ in King's Cross Station. On the train Harry meets Ron Weasley, a boy from a large but poor pure-blood wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch born to non-magical parents. Once they arrive Harry and all the other first-year students are sorted between four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Because Slytherin is noted for being the house of darker wizards and witches, Harry convinces the Sorting Hat not to put him in Slytherin. He ends up in Gryffindor along with Ron and Hermione.

Product review: this book was okay, but it wasn't the best book i have ever read. its basically a cheesed-up romance novel about a 12-year-old. its a bit unbelievable and unrealistic, but it got exciting at the end of the book. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"This review can be considered to depict the product in a primarily unflattering light, although it does have some positive aspects, such as the excitement towards the end of the book. The reviewer's critique focuses on several negative elements, which makes the overall tone less than favorable.  First, the reviewer uses the phrase \\"way too sappy\\" in the title, indicating that the story may be overly sentimental or emotional, which can be a turn-off for some readers. This characterization sets the tone for an uncomplimentary evaluation of the book. Second, the reviewer states that the book is \\"basically a cheesed-up romance novel about a 12-year-old,\\" drawing attention to the plot being possibly unrealistic and potentially not engaging for an adult reader. Using the word \\"cheesed-up\\" suggests that the story may be excessively corny, cliched, or exaggerated, hence impacting the perceived quality of the book negatively. Third, the reviewer labels the book \\"unbelievable\\" and \\"unrealistic,\\" which are strong adjectives that contribute to an unflattering description of the book. These words imply that the plot and characters may lack depth, plausibility, or relatability, making it difficult for readers to connect with the story. On the other hand, the reviewer mentions that the book was \\"okay\\" and \\"got exciting at the end\\" which adds some positive aspects to the review. These statements acknowledge that there were some enjoyable moments in the book, and the excitement towards the end may be enticing for potential readers. In conclusion, while this review does mention a couple of positive points, the overall tone and critique lean towards an unflattering depiction of the product. The main focus is on the book's sappiness, unrealistic nature, and overly romanticized plot, which may deter readers from considering it a worthwhile read."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: No one cares about the old Clinton scandals any more Once upon a time, back in the early 1990s, there was a thing called \\"Travelgate.\\" It was a relatively new use of the now-omnipresent \\"-gate\\" suffix (but still a stupid one). The essence of the scandal was that the then-first lady had demanded the firing of staff in the White House travel office, replacing them with people she knew. The first lady at issue was Hillary Clinton, of course. And yet, today no one seems to care about Travelgate -- or any of the myriad other Clinton White House scandals, real or imagined. Google gives us a nice little tool for peeking into America's mind. Called Google Trends, it evaluates interest in a search term over time, letting us see how much or how little interest the public has in knowing more about a topic. So for Travelgate, the most interest came in early 2007, right when Hillary Clinton's last presidential campaign was ramping up. The scale on the graphs that follow is from zero -- no search interest -- to 100, the most interest in the most popular term over the course of the time period. If you compare Travelgate to \\"Clinton body count,\\" you can see that the latter is much more popular than the former. (\\"Clinton body count\\" is the evergreen idea that Bill Clinton had a variety of people killed for whatever reasons. In an interview with the Post last month, the people at the rumor-debunking site Snopes said that \\"Clinton body count\\" was a perennial topic of interest.) (Oh, also? It's untrue.) OK. But now let's overlay Whitewater, the granddaddy of Clinton White House scandals. Google has to parse out whether people are interested in \\"Whitewater\\" the Clinton scandal or \\"whitewater\\" the fun summertime activity. The line below shows only the former -- or Google's best guess to that end. Notice by now how small the peaks of Travelgate have gotten. And then if we overlay a really popular topic -- \\"Troopergate\\" -- all of the previous topics fade into almost nothingness. (\\"Troopergate\\" was a rumored scandal involving the alleged procurement of women for Bill Clinton by Arkansas state troopers. Pushed by David Brock, who is now one of Clinton's most stalwart defenders, it was retracted.) That 2008 spike has nothing to do with Clinton, though. Instead, it was about Sarah Palin, then a vice presidential candidate and who had trooper issues of her own that, naturally and insufferably, earned the \\"troopergate\\" moniker. Again, Google only knows what its robots can figure out, and the two trooper bloopers intermingle. Regardless, that spike serves as a good baseline moving forward. Because here's what happens when you compare \\"Troopergate\\" to \\"Lewinsky.\\" (This graph switches from monthly to weekly data, by the way.) And here, when you overlay \\"Benghazi.\\" Remember how big \\"Troopergate\\" was compared to Whitewater and Travelgate, etc.? Those wouldn't even appear as any more than a flat line here. If you look just at the last three months, you can see what's piquing people's interest. Lewinsky -- the only holdout from the old Clinton days -- mixes with Benghazi (which includes non-Clinton related searches) and \\"Clinton email,\\" which refers to the controversy over the former secretary of state's personal server. Included in here are Troopergate and \\"Clinton body count,\\" by the way -- but each is just a flat yellow line. There are good reasons for people not to search for old Clinton scandals, including that most of them centered on Hillary Clinton's husband, not her. But also because her opponents have quickly found other, more recent things with which to bash her. And those, Google data would suggest, have done a better job of capturing Americans' attention. Philip Bump writes about politics for The Fix. He is based in New York City.","output":"In the early 1990s, Travelgate was a scandal involving then-First Lady Hillary Clinton, who had demanded the firing of staff in the White House travel office and replaced them with her own acquaintances. However, the scandal and other Clinton White House controversies have seemingly faded from public memory. Google Trends, a tool that evaluates interest in a search term over time, reveals that interest in Travelgate peaked in 2007, when Clinton's previous presidential campaign was gaining momentum. Comparing Travelgate to other Clinton scandals such as \\"Clinton body count\\" and Whitewater shows less search interest in the former. Conversely, newer controversies like the Benghazi incident and the Clinton email scandal garner much more attention. An explanation for the waning interest in older scandals could be that they were centered on Bill Clinton instead of Hillary, or that her opponents have found more recent events to criticize her for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The marches across the bridge led to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and today the bridge is a symbol of nonviolent victory for change!      Unfortunately, the bridge is STILL named after a man who served as Grand Dragon of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan, was a Confederate General, and was later elected as a United States Senator.      The bridge was the site of “Bloody Sunday”. On March 7, 1965, hundreds of nonviolent protesters attempted to march from Selma to Montgomery for their right to vote. But as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were met by Alabama state troopers and deputized civilians who were armed with billy clubs, tear gas, and cattle prods and attacked the marchers and drove them back to Brown Chapel Church.      How could a landmark that holds so much significance for the civil rights movement be named after a man who not only supported slavery, but held one of the highest positions within the Ku Klux Klan?      It's time for the state of Alabama, the city of Selma, and the National Park Service to remove a KKK leader's name from the historic bridge.      Selma and the Voting Rights Movement altered the course of history forever, and Selma has done too much for this country to remain unchanged. Selma is currently 80% African American, with a black mayor and majority African American local city officials. The name Edmund Pettus is far from what the city of Selma should honor. Let’s change the image of the bridge from hatred and rename it to memorialize hope and progress.      Please sign our petition calling on Selma and Alabama leaders and the National Park Service to rename the Edmund Pettus Bridge. ||||| A petition calling on political leaders to rename Selma's iconic Edmund Pettus Bridge has garnered more than 149,500 signatures, just shy of its organizers' goal of 150,000 names.      The bridge is one of the great physical icons of the U.S. civil rights movement, serving as a monument to the struggle for equality under law that came to a crescendo during the historic march on Selma in 1965.      Its place in the lore of American history holds firm 50 years after Bloody Sunday took place on the span, shocking people around the globe who watched the events unfold on live TV.      But many people are unaware that the bridge -- which was the centerpiece of a performance by Common and John Legend tied to the film \\"Selma\\" at this year's Oscars and will be visited by multiple U.S. presidents for a ceremony Saturday -- is also the center of a major controversy.      Edmund Pettus is known as the namesake of a bridge renowned throughout the world as a symbol of equality and racial justice. But it is named for an Alabama senator, confederate general and judge who also held a less honorable title: Grand Dragon of the state's Ku Klux Klan chapter.      That fact is behind the online petition, which calls on the U.S National Park Services, Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley and Selma Mayor George Patrick Evans to take the necessary steps \\"to remove a KKK leader's name from the historic bridge.\\"      The petition, posted on Change.org by the activist group Students UNITE less than two weeks ago, states that \\"the marches across the bridge led to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and today the bridge is a symbol of nonviolent victory for change! Unfortunately, the bridge is STILL named after a man who served as Grand Dragon of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan, was a Confederate General, and was later elected as a United States Senator.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, holds great significance in American history as a symbol of nonviolent victory for change and the site of the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" march in 1965.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.  - Charlotte Burton (May 30, 1881  March 28, 1942) was an American silent film actress.  - Henry Otto (August 8, 1877  August 3, 1952) was an American silent film actor, director, producer, and screenwriter.

While surfing television channels over the weekend,a scene from a family classic of last year portraying the now-so-familiar sorry state of retired parents being ill-treated by their children and families caught my attention. I wondered why the description of this relationship had not changed much over the many years! Even though the same movies and soaps accurately capture several other social changes around us -- from value systems to new found economic freedom to the importance of technology and the changing approach to consumerism   -- are these creative efforts far from the truth in telling us that an average retiree is still struggling?  Look around and you will agree that the post-retired lifestyle for an ex-salaried class people is often a pale shadow of their last working years. Even self employed people, who have handed over the responsibility to the next generation, are no exception. Did the average middle class not save enough through his working years?  Socially, we already know that the Indians are taught the benefits of start saving early on in life. Household savings data supports this social behavior -- India has the highest rates of savings among various economies and is far ahead of the west. Yet, tragically, a lifetime of savings does not seem to provide enough for a comfortable retirement!  A closer look at the pattern of what we do with our financial savings may tell us a bit more. Over half of households' financial savings is put into a \\"safe\\" deposit, followed by large portions in insurance, pension, provident funds and the rest in physical currency. Less than a tenth goes into \\"risky\\" assets   like stocks. While there might be nothing, in particular, worrisome in this investment pool, one has to consider inflation  . The real value of savings, over a few decades, may actually be lower than the starting point. What's the best title of the text?

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was replaced by Jon Coghill?  Fanning first met Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug in a University of Queensland economics class in 1989. At the time of the meeting, Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends John Collins and Steven Bishop, who would become the band's foundational bass guitarist and drummer, respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that \\"It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.'\\"In 1992, current guitarist Darren Middleton was invited to join Powderfinger by Fanning and Haug, after they were impressed by his work in Brisbane band Pirate. Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining Jon Coghill who had replaced Bishop as drummer. The line-up of Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, and Coghill then remained unchanged.Throughout the late 1990s, Powderfinger rose to prominence throughout Australia, receiving several accolades and achieving highly successful record and concert ticket sales. As the most vocal and prominent member of the band, the popularity for the group elevated Fanning as a powerful individual in the public view of the Australian music industry. Fanning was called upon by film-maker Gregor Jordan in 2003 to perform the folk song \\"Moreton Bay\\" (named after the bay of the same name in the Brisbane area) and his own original composition \\"Shelter for My Soul\\" in Jordan's film Ned Kelly. Fanning then enlisted Jordan to film Powderfinger's first live DVD, These Days: Live in Concert.","output":"The first name of the person who was replaced by Jon Coghill is Steven.

Given the question: Out of boredom, two scientists from the New Contagious Diseases Research Centre devised themselves a new game. One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.

A: excited to be free  B: depressed about losing her father  C: happy about what Jan did A:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the context and question The context states that Jan killed Alex's father due to an affair. The question is asking how Alex would feel about the situation, presenting three possible options. Step 2: Assess the emotional impact of the situation Killing someone in the family could cause a significant emotional impact on the remaining family members, especially if the person killed is a parent. The emotional response can be complex, taking into account the nature of the cause (e.g., an affair) and the relationships between everyone involved. Step 3: Evaluate each answer choice based on the context A - Excited to be free: This option implies that Alex would be relieved by their father's death because of the affair. However, it is not clear that Alex was directly impacted by the affair or if they would feel joy/relief about their father's death. B - Depressed about losing her father: This option acknowledges the potential of a strong emotional reaction to losing a parent. Despite the reason for the murder, it's likely that Alex would still feel a sense of grief and loss for their father. C - Happy about what Jan did: This option suggests that Alex is supportive of Jan's actions and may be more focused on the betrayal of the affair than the loss of their father. However, it assumes that Alex would feel strongly enough about the affair to justify their father's death. Step 4: Select the best answer based on the contextual analysis Taking into account the emotional impact of losing a parent and the complex nature of grief and relationships involved in the situation, B: Depressed about losing her father, seems to be the most reasonable answer.

Firstly, let us break down the phrase to better understand its meaning. 1. \\"Deftly manages\\": This part of the phrase is positive, as it implies skill or mastery. In this context, it's referring to the way the film approaches the subject of mental illness; it is the method of handling that is being praised. The use of \\"deftly\\" implies that the work was done with care, precision, and expertise, which suggests that the film displays a high level of craft and understanding. 2. \\"To avoid many of the condescending stereotypes\\": This portion of the phrase is also positive because it indicates that the film does not rely on problematic or harmful portrayals of mental illness. Condescending stereotypes are not only insensitive but also can reinforce stigma and misunderstanding surrounding mental health issues. By avoiding these stereotypes, the film demonstrates a more respectful and nuanced approach to the subject matter, which is commendable and appreciated by the audience. 3. \\"That so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill\\": This part of the phrase acknowledges that there is a common issue in films that deal with mental illness. It suggests that many movies fail to offer a sensitive and accurate portrayal of mental illness, often resorting to clichés or even mockery. By stating that the film in question has managed to avoid these pitfalls, the phrase becomes an endorsement of the film's thoughtful and responsible approach to the topic. In conclusion, the phrase \\"deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill\\" is a positive statement. It praises the film's handling of mental illness because it successfully steers clear of harmful stereotypes and misconceptions. This careful and respectful approach implies that the filmmakers have put in the effort to understand the complexities of mental health and choose to prioritize empathy and accuracy in their representation.

Q:Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake.  Two neighboring cities are situated in a volcanic area with lots of earthquakes. Park city is situated near a very active volcano, while Hill city is situated 50 miles north.  Which city experiences fewer continuous strings of earthquakes? A:","output":"Hill city is likely to experience fewer continuous strings of earthquakes. Step 1: Review the given information: - Earthquakes occur more frequently and in greater size near a volcano before an eruption - Continuous strings of earthquakes may indicate an impending volcanic eruption - Park city is situated near a very active volcano - Hill city is situated 50 miles north of Park city Step 2: Compare the locations of the two cities: - Park city is located close to an active volcano, which means it's more susceptible to frequent earthquake activity and continuous strings of earthquakes - Hill city, located 50 miles north of Park city, is farther away from the active volcano Step 3: Determine which city experiences fewer continuous strings of earthquakes: - Since Hill city is farther from the active volcano compared to Park city, it's less likely to experience continuous strings of earthquakes that are associated with an impending volcanic eruption Conclusion: Based on the given information, Hill city is likely to experience fewer continuous strings of earthquakes compared to Park city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the names of the five Middle French prose works?  Up to c. 1210, continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art. The answer to this question is:","output":"The five Middle French prose works that form the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle) are: 1. Estoire del Saint Grail 2. Estoire de Merlin 3. Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot) 4. Queste del Saint Graal 5.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll in a plant - The light energy is used to convert carbon dioxide - The plant uses nutrients in the soil - The plant uses carbon dioxide in the air to produce glucose - The plant uses the glucose to give itself energy A:","output":"The final step in this process is the release of oxygen and the storage or utilization of energy-rich glucose molecules for the plant's growth, maintenance, and reproduction. To fully understand this, let's first provide an overview of the entire process, known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. This process can be divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (or Calvin cycle). The process occurs as follows: 1. Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and other pigmented molecules within specialized structures called chloroplasts found in the plant cells. 2. The absorbed light energy is then used to generate energy-rich molecules like ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) in a series of light-dependent reactions. 3. Meanwhile, the plant absorbs carbon dioxide in the air through tiny openings called stomata, present on the surface of leaves and stems. 4. The plant also absorbs essential nutrients and minerals such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium from the soil through its root system. 5. The ATP and NADPH produced earlier, along with the absorbed carbon dioxide, are now utilized in the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) to produce glucose molecules. This occurs in the stroma of the chloroplasts. 6. The glucose molecule is a versatile energy source for the plant. It can be immediately used to power various metabolic processes, such as cellular respiration, which helps the plant generate more ATP for growth, maintenance, and reproduction. The final step of this process is twofold:  - The release of oxygen (O2) as a byproduct of the light-dependent reactions, where the oxygen molecules are produced from the splitting of water (H2O). The released oxygen diffuses out of the plant through the stomata and into the atmosphere, making photosynthesis a critical process for the sustenance of life on Earth, as it replenishes our atmosphere with fresh oxygen. - The storage or utilization of the produced glucose to support the plant's energy needs, either for immediate use or stored as starch in various plant parts such as roots, stems, or leaves for later use. The stored glucose can also be transported to other parts of the plant where energy is required or converted into other complex molecules like cellulose or lignin, which are essential for the structural integrity of the plant. In summary, the final step in the process of photosynthesis involves the release of oxygen into the atmosphere and the storage or utilization of glucose molecules to meet the plant's energy requirements for growth, maintenance, and reproduction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...  I am facing a new situation today: Dan is a geneticist and studied two villages from 2,000 years ago. Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which village didn't display an observable Allee effect? The answer is:","output":"Village A didn't display an observable Allee effect. Step 1: Understand the Allee effect. Based on the background article, the Allee effect refers to the decrease in fitness of a species due to a reduction in population size, which can lead to a loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding depression, and accumulation of deleterious mutations. Step 2: Compare the population dynamics of Village A and Village B. Village A had a large population that grew over the years, while Village B had a small and declining population. As the Allee effect occurs when a species' population size reduces, we should look for the village that didn't have declining population numbers. Step 3: Identify the village without an observable Allee effect. Since Village A had a growing population, it is less likely that they experienced the Allee effect, as the genetic diversity in this village would have been maintained or even increased by a higher number of individuals in the gene pool. Consequently, Village A didn't display an observable Allee effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide array of characters, some human, some animals, all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story, and who has an appreciation for history and animals. One thing I forgot to mention, but that I feel is important, is that the animals in this film do not talk. This was a really nice vacation from the Lady And The Tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to.

Question: who played dumbledore in harry potter I found the following answer on Google: Rowling stated she chose the name Dumbledore, which is an Early Modern English word for \\" bumblebee \\", because of Dumbledore's love of music: she imagined him walking around \\"humming to himself a lot\\". Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","output":"No, the answer you've found seems to give some interesting information about the origin of the character's name, Albus Dumbledore, in the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling, but it doesn't answer your original question about the actors who played this character in the movie adaptations.  In the film series of Harry Potter, two actors portrayed the character Albus Dumbledore.  The late Richard Harris played the role of Albus Dumbledore in the first two movies, \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" (2001) and \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" (2002). Known for his grand presence and distinctive voice, Richard Harris brought a very serene and wise version of Dumbledore to life in the early films. After Richard Harris passed away in 2002, from the third movie onwards, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" (2004) to the final movie \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2\\" (2011), the role was taken over by Michael Gambon. Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore was a bit more active and whimsical, yet also portrayed the complexity and shades of Dumbledore’s character.

Obama wanted clarification on how, when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility.","output":"Title: NATO Allies to Send More Troops to Afghanistan; Announcement to Follow Thanksgiving Introduction In a recent development, it has been announced that NATO allies will be asked to send more troops to Afghanistan. This announcement is set to be made after the Thanksgiving holiday, and will be a crucial decision by Western governments in their fight against terrorism and insurgency in the region. This comes after President Obama met with key members of his national security team on Monday night to discuss the ongoing situation in Afghanistan and future plans for the U.S. military presence. NATO Allies' Involvement 1. Request for more troops: The United States and NATO allies have been fighting against terrorism in Afghanistan for almost two decades, and the situation remains critical. As part of the ongoing efforts to stabilize the country, NATO members will be asked to send additional troops and support to Afghanistan. 2. Role of NATO allies: The enlistment of more troops from NATO allies would play a crucial role in strengthening the ongoing efforts to combat terrorism and to create a more secure environment in the region. More troops on the ground would provide additional resources and expertise, enhancing the capability of the NATO-led coalition forces to carry out operations more effectively. The United States' Role 1. Obama's meeting with the national security team: Recognizing the importance of the situation in Afghanistan, Obama met with his national security team on Monday night to discuss possible strategies and approaches. Sources reveal that President Obama wanted clarification on how and when the United States troops would transfer responsibilities to local forces. 2. Turning over responsibility: A key aspect of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan is the timeline for turning over responsibilities to Afghan security forces. With a clear plan in place, the U.S. and NATO allies will be better placed to ensure a smooth transition of power and to support Afghan forces in maintaining peace and security. Conclusion The announcement to request more troops from NATO allies to be sent to Afghanistan shows the commitment of Western governments in their fight against terrorism and insurgency. The reinforcement of troops coupled with the eventual transfer of responsibility to local forces will hopefully lead to a more secure Afghanistan, paving the way for peace, stability, and development for the Afghan people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We want to find the value of 'g' in the equation: 9279 = -789*g - 27155 + 1718. 2. First, let's add 27155 to each side to get rid of the negative number. It's like giving someone 27155 more candy on each side of the balance.     9279 + 27155 = -789*g + 27155 - 27155 + 1718     36434 = -789*g + 1718 3.

This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity.

Although both are commonly referred to as rubbing alcohol and serve as topical antiseptics, there are key differences between the two that set them apart from each other. Isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) is also known as 2-propanol or IPA. Its chemical formula is C3H8O. It is synthesized from propylene, a petroleum byproduct. Isopropyl alcohol has a strong alcohol odor and evaporates quickly. It is known to be less harmful to human tissues than ethyl alcohol, making it a preferred choice for healthcare professionals. Isopropyl alcohol is widely used in disinfecting, sterilizing medical equipment, hand sanitizers, cleaning electronic devices, and removing adhesive residues. Ethyl alcohol (ethanol) has a chemical formula of C2H6O. It is made by fermenting sugars and starches from plant materials, such as corn, wheat, or sugarcane. Ethyl alcohol is also the alcohol found in alcoholic beverages. It has a milder odor and is less volatile than isopropyl alcohol, making it less irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. Ethyl alcohol is used in a wide variety of applications, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, perfumes, cleaning solutions, and even as an alternative fuel. In summary, isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol are not the same.

Background: Gaius Julius Caesar (; 12 or 13 July 100 BC - 15 March 44 BC), known by his cognomen Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Context: In 60 BC, Caesar sought election as consul for 59 BC, along with two other candidates. The election was sordid - even Cato, with his reputation for incorruptibility, is said to have resorted to bribery in favour of one of Caesar's opponents. Caesar won, along with conservative Marcus Bibulus.  Caesar was already in Crassus' political debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds for a decade, so Caesar tried to reconcile them. The three of them had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (\\"rule of three men\\"), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia. Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, who was the daughter of another powerful senator.  Caesar proposed a law for redistributing public lands to the poor--by force of arms, if need be--a proposal supported by Pompey and by Crassus, making the triumvirate public. Pompey filled the city with soldiers, a move which intimidated the triumvirate's opponents. Bibulus attempted to declare the omens unfavourable and thus void the new law, but he was driven from the forum by Caesar's armed supporters. His bodyguards had their ceremonial axes broken, two high magistrates accompanying him were wounded, and he had a bucket of excrement thrown over him. In fear of his life, he retired to his house for the rest of the year, issuing occasional proclamations of bad omens. These attempts proved ineffective in obstructing Caesar's legislation. Roman satirists ever after referred to the year as \\"the consulship of Julius and Caesar.\\"  When Caesar was first elected, the aristocracy tried to limit his future power by allotting the woods and pastures of Italy, rather than the governorship of a province, as his military command duty after his year in office was over. With the help of political allies, Caesar later overturned this, and was instead appointed to govern Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) and Illyricum (southeastern Europe), with Transalpine Gaul (southern France) later added, giving him command of four legions. The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one. When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province. Question: Did anything else interesting happen in this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are several interesting events and aspects in this article worth highlighting: 1. The election of Caesar as consul in 59 BC, which was marked by corruption and bribery. Even Cato, a politician with a reputation for integrity, resorted to bribery to support one of Caesar's opponents, illustrating the intense competition and how the political climate had deteriorated. 2. The formation of the First Triumvirate, an informal alliance between Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey, which effectively allowed them to control Roman politics. The Triumvirate was further solidified through two strategic marriages – Pompey marrying Caesar's daughter Julia, and Caesar marrying Calpurnia, the daughter of another influential senator. 3. Caesar's support for a controversial law on land redistribution that aimed to provide land to the poor in Rome, which was also backed by Pompey and Crassus. This policy demonstrates Caesar's ability to navigate the political landscape by earning the support of powerful allies and appealing to the masses. 4. The intense opposition faced by Caesar and the Triumvirate, as demonstrated by the incident involving Marcus Bibulus, who was violently driven from the forum and forced to retire to his house for the remainder of the year. This incident shows the fierce political rivalries and the intimidation tactics employed by various factions during this period. 5. The initial decision to allot Caesar the responsibility of managing the woods and pastures of Italy after his consulship, in an attempt to curtail his power. This move was ultimately unsuccessful, as Caesar managed to gain a more prominent role as the governor of Cisalpine Gaul, Illyricum, and Transalpine Gaul, commanding four legions. 6. Finally, Caesar's narrow escape from prosecution underscores the precarious and treacherous nature of Roman politics during this time. Despite facing potential legal consequences for irregularities during his consulship, Caesar leveraged his political allies and new role as a governor to secure immunity and further advance his career. Overall, this article provides a fascinating account of Julius Caesar's rise to power amidst a turbulent and complex political landscape. The formation of the First Triumvirate, strategic marriages, controversial policy proposals, and the intense rivalries between different political factions illustrate the intricate and often brutal nature of Roman politics during Caesar's time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And guess what? Although it omits or glosses over many chapters of Jobs' life, it's not bad. This is the first dramatic feature film to focus solely on the longtime Apple CEO, who died in 2011. A second Steve Jobs movie, written by Aaron Sorkin and adapted from the best-selling Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson, is due as early as next year.","output":"The story of the first Steve Jobs biopic, \\"Jobs,\\" ends by offering audiences a glimpse into the various successes and tribulations of Jobs' early career and culminating with the launch of the original iPod in 2001. The film serves as a stepping stone for further projects and discussions about the life and legacy of Steve Jobs, as it paves the way for a second biopic, written by Aaron Sorkin and adapted from Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography. While \\"Jobs\\" primarily centers around the early years of Steve Jobs' life, it leaves out several significant aspects of his life and career, such as his relationship with his daughter Lisa, his battle with cancer, and his eventual return to Apple to transform it into the global powerhouse it is today. However, the film does an excellent job of showcasing Jobs' innovative spirit, relentless drive, and genius mind that shaped our modern digital world. As the first dramatic feature film to focus solely on Jobs, \\"Jobs\\" serves as an inspiration for the upcoming Sorkin biopic, which will likely delve deeper into the complex character of Jobs and explore aspects of his life that were either omitted or glossed over in the first film. The Sorkin adaptation is anticipated to portray a more comprehensive view of Jobs' legacy, capturing the essence of his extraordinary life and his impact on the technology industry. In the end, the story of \\"Jobs\\" is a stepping stone for a larger dialogue about the legacy of this influential figure in the world of technology. It demonstrates the ongoing fascination with his life and his unparalleled contributions to the tech industry that continue to reverberate in today's society. The discussions, debates, and projects inspired by the first biopic will only serve to deepen the understanding of Steve Jobs as a person and an icon. While \\"Jobs\\" may only be a piece of the puzzle in comprehending the entirety of Steve Jobs' life, it succeeds in providing an engaging portrayal of his early career and emphasizing the importance of his vision in revolutionizing modern technology.

Each mole has been planted by the rival organisation to gain an advantage in intelligence over the other side. The more the moles become involved in their undercover lives, the more issues they have to cope with. The prologue opens with the introduction of triad boss Hon Sam, who sends a number of young gangsters to the police academy as moles, among whom include a young Lau. Concurrently, a young Chen joins the police force but is seemingly expelled from the academy even though he manages to impress Superintendent Wong Chi-shing. In reality, Chen has become an undercover agent reporting only to Wong. Over the course of ten years, Chen experiences great stress from his undercover work while Lau quickly rises through the ranks in the police department. The film begins with a meeting between Chen and Lau in a hi-fi store without either of them knowing the other's identity. Wong and his team interrupt a deal between Hon Sam and a Thai cocaine dealer after receiving a tip-off from Chen using Morse code. However, Lau alerts Hon, giving him enough time to order his minions to dispose of the cocaine, eliminating solid evidence of the drug deal. After the incident, Wong and Hon are both aware that they each have a mole within their respective organisations, placing them in a race against time to root out the other mole.

It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a 0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump. Seriously.” I really don’t know if this is the most “cheapskate” thing, on just CRAZY fiscal responsibility. But if I had to pick, this would get my vote… resources: Splinter - The truth hurts What was sent to the celebrities? - something very personal and private - something very rare - not enough information - something with very small value A:","output":"In 1990, the writers at Spy Magazine came up with an interesting prank to test the theory that every person has a price. They wanted to see what would happen if they sent small checks to celebrities and observe who would actually cash them. To do this, they needed to create a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account and send the checks without arousing suspicion. The recipients, including Donald Trump, Cher, and Henry Kissinger, were told that the checks were refunds for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988, but the specific reason for the overcharge was never mentioned. Initially, 58 checks worth 1.11 each were sent out to various well-known personalities. Of the 58 people, 26 cashed the checks, with Trump being one of them. Spy Magazine then sent follow-up letters and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people who cashed the initial checks, curious to see who would take more free money. Thirteen of them, including Donald Trump, deposited the checks into their bank accounts. Finally, the magazine sent 13 more checks, each for 0.13, to the remaining 13 people to observe their reactions. Only two people cashed them – a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi and Donald Trump. This is an amusing anecdote about Trump, that whether it showcases extreme frugality or merely attention to details, it managed to put Trump among only two people out of the initially targeted 58 to cash in all three checks — even if the value of the last one was only 13 cents. So, in response to the question about what was sent to the celebrities, the answer is that they were sent small-value checks with a cover story suggesting that they were refunds for an unspecified overcharge that occurred in 1988. The purpose of this prank was to observe which celebrities would cash the checks and ultimately determine their level of frugality or affinity for free money, no matter how small the amount."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","output":"There is a sentiment that flexibility in remuneration could help in some way. This statement suggests that having a more adaptable approach to payment or compensation received for work could be beneficial in certain situations. In various industries, workflow and productivity may fluctuate, and adopting a flexible remuneration strategy may help to accommodate these changes. There are several ways that flexible remuneration could be advantageous: 1. Motivation and productivity: Implementing a flexible pay structure could encourage employees to work harder and be more productive. For example, offering performance-based bonuses, commissions, or profit-sharing options might give workers a greater sense of ownership and commitment to their role and the overall success of the company. 2. Attracting and retaining talent: People have different financial needs and preferences. A flexible remuneration approach allows employees to tailor their compensation to better suit their personal and financial situations. This can be an appealing aspect for prospective employees and might help in retaining current workers. 3. Cost-efficient: Flexible remuneration could prove cost-effective for employers in times of economic uncertainty or during downturns. For instance, companies could opt for reduced salaries combined with other forms of compensation to adjust the cost of labor without laying off staff. This strategy helps maintain morale and keeps a skilled workforce intact during tough times. 4. Adaptability: Markets, industries, and technologies are ever-evolving, and businesses need to adapt to these changes to stay competitive. By incorporating flexibility in remuneration, organizations can pivot quickly in response to shifting demands. This adaptability could be crucial in overall organizational growth and success. In conclusion, there is indeed a sentiment that flexibility in remuneration could help in some way. By enhancing motivation and productivity, attracting and retaining top talent, optimizing costs, and maintaining adaptability, a flexible compensation system may be a crucial tool for organizations navigating today's dynamic business landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Young and Innocent Movie plot: Christine Clay (Pamela Carme), a successful actress, argues passionately with her jealous ex-husband Guy (George Curzon), who makes particular reference to Robert Tisdall, a young man staying near her at her retreat on the English coast. Christine slaps him several times across the face, but he hardly reacts, choosing instead to depart without a word. The next morning, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney) happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore. He runs to get help and call the police, but two young swimmers arrive just in time to see him racing away from the corpse. A belt from his raincoat, which had just recently gone missing, is found next to the body, further implicating him in her strangling. He is subsequently arrested and becomes the main suspect, partly because of a large sum of money Christine left to him in her will, a gift he was unaware of. Tisdall is grilled all night by Scotland Yard detectives until he faints. He is brought round by the aid of Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam), daughter of the local police Chief Constable and who was one of the women who witnessed him running away from Christine's dead body. Tisdall from there is taken directly into court for his formal arraignment. Saddled with a completely incompetent barrister, Tisdall doubts if his innocence will ever be established. He elects to take advantage of a crowded courthouse and make his escape, wearing the barrister's eyeglasses as a disguise. After his escape, Tisdall finds Erica Burgoyne on the road pushing her car, which has run out of gas, and convinces her to give him a ride in her Morris car. Though she is initially fearful and unsure about her passenger, Burgoyne eventually becomes convinced of his innocence and elects to help him in any way that she can. They are eventually spotted together, forcing both to stay on the run from the police. Tisdall tries to prove his innocence by tracking down the stolen coat to show that it still has its belt.

In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD.

A:","output":"A: The last step of the process after cells are killed by bacteria is typically an immune response from the body to fight off the infection and repair the damaged cells. This involves the activation of various immune cells such as white blood cells (specifically, phagocytes and lymphocytes) and the release of proteins called antibodies. The immune cells work together to neutralize and remove the bacteria, while the release of cytokines and other chemical signals help to promote inflammation and tissue repair. Ultimately, if the immune system is successful, the affected area begins to heal, and the body returns to a healthy state.

Meanwhile Mr.Salinger had been drafted and was stationef for a while in Tiverton,Devon,the setting of \\"For Esme--with Love and Squalor,\\"probably the most deeply felt of the \\"Nint Stories\\".On June,6,1944,he landed at Utah Beach,and he later saw action during the Battle of the Bulge.In 1945 he was hospitalized for\\"battle breakdown\\"and after recovering he stayed on in Europe past the end of the war.He married a German woan doctor,very briefly.

Question: What kind of dog is Willie? Title: Patton Movie plot: General George S. Patton (George C. Scott) addresses an unseen audience of American troops, (based on his speech to the Third Army). The film version of the speech is heavily condensed, with much of the original vulgarity removed. Following the humiliating American defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass in 1943, Patton is placed in charge of the American II Corps in North Africa. Upon his arrival, he enforces discipline amongst his troops, e.g. fining a cook 20 for not wearing his army issue leggings. Patton is then summoned to a meeting with Air Marshal Coningham of the Royal Air Force, where he claims that the American defeat was caused by lack of air cover. Coningham promises Patton that he will see no more German aircraft - but seconds later the compound is strafed by Luftwaffe planes. Patton then defeats a German attack at the Battle of El Guettar; his aide Captain Jenson is killed in the battle, and is replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Codman. Patton is bitterly disappointed to learn that Erwin Rommel, Commander of the German-Italian Panzer Army, was on medical leave due to having diphtheria, but Codman reassures him that: \\"If you've defeated Rommel's plan, you've defeated Rommel\\". After success in the North Africa campaign, Patton and Bernard Law Montgomery plan the Allied invasion of Sicily. Patton's proposal to land his Seventh Army in the northwest of the island with Montgomery in the South-East (therefore potentially trapping the German and Italian forces in a pincer movement), initially impresses their superior General Alexander, however Eisenhower rejects it in favour Montgomery's more cautious plan, which places Patton's army in the South-East, covering Montgomery's left flank. Whilst the landing is successful, the Allied forces become bogged down, causing Patton to defy orders and push his army northwest to Palermo, and then to the port of Messina in the northeast, narrowly beating Montgomery to the prize, although several thousand German and Italian troops are able to flee the island.

Math Problem Solve 1183 + 272 + 505 = 49*y for y.","output":"Let's break down the given math problem step-by-step: Step 1: Firstly, we need to find the sum of the three numbers 1183, 272, and 505. 1183 + 272 + 505 --------- 1960 (This is the sum of the three numbers) Step 2: Now that we know the sum of the numbers, we need to plug it into the rest of the equation. We have: 1960 = 49*y Step 3: To find the value of y, we need to isolate the variable y. We can do that by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is 49. 1960 = 49*y 1960/49 = 49*y/49 Step 4: Divide 1960 by 49. 1960 ÷ 49 = 40 Step 5: Simplify the equation. 40 = y So, the value of y is 40. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the solution once again: 1. Calculate the sum: 1183 + 272 + 505 = 1960 2. Plug the sum into the equation: 1960 = 49*y 3. Isolate the variable y by dividing both sides by 49: 1960/49 = 49*y/49 4. Divide 1960 by 49: 1960 ÷ 49 = 40 5.

Of which country is Vientiane the capital?","output":"Vientiane is the capital and largest city of Laos, a country situated in Southeast Asia. Laos is officially known as the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and shares borders with China to the north, Cambodia to the south, Vietnam to the east, Myanmar to the northwest, and Thailand to the west and southwest. Vientiane is located on the northeastern bank of the Mekong River, which forms a natural border between Laos and Thailand. The history of Vientiane dates back to at least the 11th century when it was just a small trading post. By the 13th century, the settlement had grown to become the administrative center of the Lan Xang Kingdom until it was eventually chosen as the capital in the 16th century by the Kingdom's ruler, King Setthathirath. Vientiane was chosen due to its strategic location near the confluence of the Mekong River and one of its major tributaries, the Nam Ngum. It was considered a key junction for trade and communication, both crucial for managing the kingdom. Over the years, Vientiane has been shaped by its history and the influence of the various political entities that have controlled the city, ranging from the Lan Xang Kingdom to the French colonial period and beyond. Today, it is a vibrant city with a melting pot of cultural influences, including traditional Lao, Thai, Vietnamese, and French, each of which has left indelible marks on the cuisine, architecture, and language of the city. Some of the landmarks and important historical sites in Vientiane include the Pha That Luang, a large golden Buddhist stupa that dates back to the 16th century and is considered the most important national monument in Laos. Another notable landmark is Patuxai, a war memorial inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in France, which commemorates the Lao people who fought for independence from French colonial rule. Vientiane's economy is largely driven by agriculture, tourism, and the service and manufacturing sectors. The city serves as the hub for trade and commerce within Laos and is an important center for industry, education, and diplomacy. The government in Vientiane is focused on infrastructure development and has recognized the importance of attracting foreign investment to boost the economy. However, the country still faces significant challenges, such as poverty, inadequate healthcare, and lack of access to education, particularly in rural areas. In conclusion, Vientiane is the capital and largest city of Laos, with a rich history and a unique blend of cultural influences. It is a significant center for trade, commerce, and diplomacy in the region and features numerous historical landmarks and sites that offer visitors a glimpse into the city's extraordinary past."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who, along with their wife, had 7 of their children reach adulthood? from the following article ?  Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Yuck.DON'T BUY THIS PHONE! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"This review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the phone system by emphasizing numerous issues they have encountered. In the beginning, they mention they were initially attracted to the product due to the convenience it offered. However, the high cost of the base unit and the extra handset seemingly do not match the quality and performance they expected. The reviewer goes on to list specific problems they experienced, such as conversations breaking up and difficulty in being heard by the person on the other end of the line. They also mention the issue of holding the phone without touching the back, which seems to affect the call quality. Additionally, the stickiness of the buttons, which is not related to user negligence but to the product's quality, adds to their negative experience. The frustration of the reviewer is evident as they are considering looking for new phones after investing a considerable amount of money into the current system. They explicitly advise others not to buy this phone, reinforcing the unflattering and negative portrayal of the product. In conclusion, this review paints a very unflattering picture of the product, highlighting various problems encountered by the user that ultimately led to their dissatisfaction.

Article: Nuclear power's danger to health, safety, and even life itself can be summed up in one word: radiation. Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things.  At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being immediately by killing masses of cells in vital organs. But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no levels of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed immediately. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.  This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the victim being aware at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die for cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents.        Radiation can hurt us. We must know the truth. Question: Which of the following statements is true? Options: A: Nuclear radiation can cause cancer to human beings. B: Nuclear radiation can be safe to human beings if its level is low. C: Nuclear radiation can be detected by human senses. D: Nuclear radiation is just like common radio waves.

Between 1650 and 1850 the population increased by 0.75 billion people going from 0.25 billion to one billion. From 1930 to the end of the century the population rose from two billion to over six billion. In just a third of the time the population rose by more than five times what it did before. It is expected that this trend in the changing population will continue and could even heighten. The growing population requires increasing amounts of energy. These energy demands and other supplies require production, which almost always involves the emission of greenhouse gases. The more the population increases the more greenhouse gases that are produced and the greater the increase in temperature. The burning of fossil fuels is one of the best-known causes for global warming. The major reason for fossil fuels contributing so much to global warming is the release of carbon that occurs during the burning of fossil fuels. When people burn fossil fuels, they release large amounts of carbon by way of the release of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide in the air then leads to global warming. Another source of carbon dioxide comes from _ . In forests there is a large amount of carbon that is stored in the trees and other plants. This carbon is out of the atmosphere because the trees consume the carbon from carbon dioxide. When people cut down trees, they are frequently burned. This burning releases the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that was stored in organic matter. Even when new trees are planted, it can take up to one hundred years to make up for the carbon that was released. It is commonly thought that because trees absorb more carbon dioxide, the atmosphere experiences positive effects.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.  Question: \\"What problem did Barnes understand before he became governor?\\" Response: \\"That there are more than enough laywers\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The problem that Barnes understood before he became governor was the inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system for millions of Americans too poor to afford legal representation, resulting in a lack of equal access to justice.

Stopping the fire caused much fire and demolition damage in the lawyers' area called the Temple. Pepys walked all over the smouldering city, getting his feet hot, and climbed the steeple of Barking Church, from which he viewed the destroyed City, \\"the saddest sight of desolation that I ever saw.\\" There were many separate fires still burning themselves out, but the Great Fire was over. The following Sunday, rain fell over the city extinguishing the fire. However, it took until the following March before embers stopped reigniting.Pepys visited Moorfields, a large public park immediately north of the City, and saw a great encampment of homeless refugees, \\"poor wretches carrying their good there, and every body keeping his goods together by themselves\\". He noted that the price of bread had doubled in the environs of the park. Evelyn also went out to Moorfields, which was turning into the main point of assembly for the homeless, and was horrified at the numbers of distressed people filling it, some under tents, others in makeshift shacks: \\"Many [were] without a rag or any necessary utensils, bed or board ... reduced to extremest misery and poverty.\\" Evelyn was impressed by the pride of these distressed Londoners, \\"tho' ready to perish for hunger and destitution, yet not asking one pennie for relief.\\" Fears were as high as ever among the traumatised fire victims, fear of foreign arsonists and of a French and Dutch invasion. There was an outbreak of general panic on Wednesday night in the encampments at Parliament Hill, Moorfields, and Islington. A light in the sky over Fleet Street started a story that 50,000 French and Dutch immigrants had risen, widely rumoured to have started the fire, and were marching towards Moorfields to finish what the fire had begun: to cut the men's throats, rape the women, and steal their few possessions.

Summarize: This was how Charles Bartram, a 23-year-old former colliery worker from Doncaster, described his experience of the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916. It is one of more than 500 remarkable first-hand accounts of the World War One battle donated to the Imperial War Museum, the \\"vast majority\\" of which have never been seen before. Anthony Richards, head of documents and sound at the museum, says it is \\"quite amazing\\" to have come across so much previously unseen material about a battle that ended 100 years ago this week. What makes these testimonies \\"incredibly unusual\\" he says, is that they talk so candidly about killing in hand-to-hand fighting - and often the remorse felt afterwards. \\"It's very unusual for people from World War One to talk about the actual act of killing.  It's usually skirted around.\\" It was an \\"uncomfortable\\" subject for returning soldiers, he says, and memoirs and letters tended to avoid it. But these accounts have some graphic details. John Kirkham of the Manchester Battalion described how he could not shake off the memory of striking a German soldier with a club with metal spikes. \\"It sank deep into his forehead. In the scuffle, his helmet flew off, and I saw that he was a bald-headed old man. I have never forgotten that bald bead, and I don't suppose I ever will, poor devil.\\" The accounts were gathered more than 40 years ago for a classic history of the Somme, written by Martin Middlebrook. But much of the material was never published and only this summer was given to the museum. This might have been the only time that soldiers recorded their feelings. \\"You ask me to tell you about things I saw, you will be the only person I have ever told this to. The reason, they would never believe me,\\" recorded Robert Payne of the Royal Garrison Artillery. This soldier won the Military Medal, but his account includes stories of \\"self-inflicted wounds, several cases of madness\\" and a \\"poor chap\\" who threw down his gun and refused to move. There are other accounts of an officer with shell shock having to be physically restrained by his \\"burly batman\\". Despite the violence of the conflict, these stories are deeply humane and lacking in any self-glorification. George Mayne, a 19-year-old Royal Fusilier describes a sense of \\"bewilderment\\" and feeling \\"woolly headed\\" as he went over the top and charged across no man's land. When he stormed into the opposing trench he found a dying German soldier, calling for his mother and for water. \\"I am glad to this day that I gave him a drink from my precious water,\\" he wrote. There were moments of bleak humour too. Tom Short, a 19-year-old with the London Rifle Brigade, had charged a trench spotted by aerial reconnaissance, to find that the \\"trench\\" was only two feet deep. Horribly exposed, Tom faced a German bayonet charge and thought that it was all over. \\"In a split second before the moment of connecting my stomach with a bayonet, at which I was nearly passed out in terror, a terrific shout of \\"halt\\" came from somewhere and knowing how disciplined the German soldier is, the bod coming at me slid flat on his back, his rifle shot straight up in the air and his legs shot between mine. It appears a German officer gave this order.\\" These were young men - and some were younger than they should have been. George Rudge was only 17 at the Battle of the Somme and had given a false age when he enlisted. \\"It seemed to me that everyone around me had been killed or wounded for I was the only one of my regiment I could see,\\" he wrote, describing the advance. He recalled his feelings about shooting the enemy. \\"This was the first time I had killed anybody, as far as I know, and when things quieted I went and looked at a German I knew I had shot, and I remember thinking that he looked old enough to have a family and I felt very sorry.\\" He was in no doubt \\"we were just meant to be sacrificed, as we ran into a wall of steel\\" and talks of advancing with a \\"chap who had the bottom of his jaw blown off and still kept going forward till he dropped\\". None of this was known to the soldier's own family. His grandson, George Ward, who lives in St Ives in Cambridgeshire, says they knew their grandfather had fought in World War One, but not that he had served on the first day of the Somme. \\"He was very private when it came to that,\\" said Mr Ward. \\"All he said was: 'I was in a battleâ€¦ Change the subject.' He wouldn't talk about it.\\" \\"It was just too horrific to talk about. They just tried to forget it. But it was there in their mind all the time.\\" Mr Ward says his grandfather's health suffered after the war from being gassed and he also had a breakdown. Looking for the first time at his grandfather's account, he says \\"it's very emotional\\". It's difficult not to be struck by the immense courage of these youngsters. Frank Graves describes the machine guns and watching lines of men being \\"cut down like grass from a scythe\\". But there was compassion for those overcome by fear. John Kirkham, who had had his arm shattered by a bullet and returned to his own lines, reported seeing \\"two unfortunate boys\\" who had been \\"terrified\\" and who he was convinced had been summarily shot for cowardice. It was also physically and mentally exhausting. Reginald Moore of the Northamptonshire Regiment, who had gone over the top at 07:30 and had been engaged in the battle all day, describes how it \\"caught up with me\\" when night fell. \\"I started to shake and tremble and they had to put another fellow with me until I was calm again. \\"That sir was 1 July, I was 18 years.\\" Do you have any family memories of the Somme?

Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals, expatriates, and tourists. The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey, which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine.

The wood fibers can break down, causing the structure of the wood to weaken and lose its strength. This can lead to increased warping and cracking, which further compromises the integrity of the wood. The constant cycle of absorption and evaporation of rainwater stresses the wood, making it less resistant to damage from insects and other environmental factors.

Please answer the following question: -  Adult mushrooms produce spores - Release them into the air by process of sporulation - Spores are carried by the wind - Land in a hospitable growing environment - The spores germinate into the soil - The mushroom starts growing  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the mushroom's life cycle takes place after the mushroom has progressively grown and matured in its new environment, following the previous steps of spore production, release, dispersal, germination, and growth. This final step involves fruiting body formation and culmination. When the mycelium network (which is formed by the germination and growth of spores into the soil) has developed to a certain extent, it starts to aggregate into more densely packed structures. This is triggered by a combination of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light conditions, as well as various chemical signals secreted by the growing mycelium. These densely packed structures eventually differentiate into primordia, which are the first visible stage for the formation of mushroom fruiting bodies. As the primordia develop and grow, they shape into the recognizable form of a mushroom, complete with stem, cap, and gills or pores, depending on the species. The exact characteristics of the fruiting body will vary from species to species, and may include features such as a ring around the stem, a veil over the gills, or specialized structures for spore dispersal. The mature fruiting body is designed to optimize the release of spores for reproduction. It positions the cap and gills or pores in such a way that spores can be effectively dispersed by the wind, animals, or other means, depending on the specific adaptation of the mushroom species. In some species, special mechanisms exist to facilitate spore dispersal, such as a gelatinous substance that attracts insects or a rain splash mechanism which releases spores when the mushroom is hit by raindrops. Once the fruiting body has effectively released its spores into the surrounding environment, the life cycle of the mushroom is considered to be complete, and the process can begin anew with the potential germination of the dispersed spores in a suitable habitat. Over time, the fruiting body will usually decay and return nutrients to the soil, thus contributing to the continuous cycle of growth and decomposition in the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If more gas is added to a rigid container, the gas pressure increases. The identities of the two gases do not matter. John Dalton, the English chemist who proposed the atomic theory, also studied mixtures of gases. He found that each gas in a mixture exerts a pressure independently of every other gas in the mixture. For example, our atmosphere is composed of about 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with smaller amounts of several other gases making up the rest. Since nitrogen makes up 78% of the gas particles in a given sample of air, it exerts 78% of the pressure. If the overall atmospheric pressure is 1.00 atm, then the pressure of just the nitrogen in the air is 0.78 atm. The pressure of the oxygen in the air is 0.21 atm.  and the situation: Mike is a high school student who loves science and as a hobby studies various chemistry, biology and physics experiments. Currently, Mike has a container in his garage that is filled with two different gases. A large portion of the gas is Mologen and a smaller portion is the gas Hamogen.

Please answer the following question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2.

Movie plot: In 1917, Baby Jane Hudson is a vaudevillian child star while her sister Blanche Hudson is not famous and overlooked by their father. By 1935, both sisters are movie actors, but Blanche has achieved stardom, while Janeâs films have flopped, leading Jane to drink heavily. One night, returning from a party, one of the sisters gets out of the car to open the gate leading up to the house, while the other attempts to run her over. The resulting accident leaves Blanche paralyzed. In 1962, a wheelchair-bound Blanche (Joan Crawford) and a bitter, irritable Jane (Bette Davis) are living together in Blanche's mansion. Because she is wheelchair-bound, Blanche rarely leaves her bedroom on the second floor and becomes close with her cleaning woman, Elvira (Maidie Norman). Elvira believes that Jane is exhibiting symptoms of mental illness and becomes concerned for Blanche's well-being, but Blanche defends her sister. Later, when Blanche informs Jane she may be selling the house, Jane's mental health begins to deteriorate further. During an argument, she removes the telephone from Blanche's bedroom, cutting Blanche off from the outside world. Later, Jane begins denying Blanche food, killing her pet parakeet and serving it to her on a platter. Later, when Jane leaves the house to put an advertisement in the paper, Blanche tries to get the attention of her neighbor, Mrs. Bates (Anna Lee), by writing a note pleading for help and throwing it out her bedroom window. Jane returns in time to notice the note and prevents Mrs. Bates from seeing it. When Jane reads the note, the two sisters quarrel again. The next time Elvira comes to clean the house, Jane initially pays her and gives her the day off, but when Elvira returns later on, Jane abruptly fires her and sends her away. Meanwhile, Edwin Flagg (Victor Buono) sees Jane's newspaper advertisement for a piano player and arrives at the mansion, where he is officially hired by Jane to help her in her delusional plan to regain her childhood stardom. While Jane drives Edwin home,...

I recently had a dealsaver for 10 for 20 worth of pizza. On 7/7 I called to inquire about specials. She named a list of several and I took her up on one. Upon ordering I informed them that I have a dealsaver and the female informed me that I couldn't order any specials as I cant combine coupons. The dealsaver isn't technically a coupon nor is the specials--they are specials vs coupons. The female then placed the same order and the total jumped 17 from 30 to 47. It was evident that I was missing out on 17 worth of specials for a 10 savings. I explained to the female that again I wasn't combining coupons and she reluctantly agreed bringing my total again down 17. Upon showing up at my door, the receipt which had already been charged, was again back up 17. I called and asked to speak to the manager and explained to him that I wasn't combining coupons, simply taking them up on their specials--not to mention a dealsaver shouldn't constitute a coupon. The manager was extremely rude, not in the least understanding, and didn't have any objection to me sending the pizza back. I reluctantly did so despite having several unhappy and hungry people awaiting the pizza. I politely said prior to sending the pizza back that I had cleared up the issue prior to placing the order but again the manager was not understanding.   All this aside the pizza is not very good and wouldn't dream of ordering without a dealsaver. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","output":"This review would be described as having a negative sentiment.

Options: - urban area - amusement park - house - business district - shopping center A:","output":"A: Business District When you are dressed in a suit and you put your car in a parking lot, the most suitable area you would be entering would likely be a business district.  A business district, also known as a central business district (CBD), is an area characterized by a high density of commercial establishments, offices, and significant economic activity. The area is typically located in the central part of a city or urban area and is where many businesses, including large corporations and financial institutions, have their offices and headquarters. It is common for individuals working in these areas to dress in a professional manner, which includes wearing a suit.  In contrast, the other options listed are generally less formal or have a different dress code than a suit: 1. Urban Area: Urban areas boast a large and diverse population, with various residential, commercial, and industrial establishments, including some business districts. However, urban areas also encompass a wide range of other venues, like parks, schools, and other public spaces, where a suit may not be the typical attire. 2. Amusement Park: This is a place for entertainment and leisure, where people would generally dress in casual or comfortable clothing to enjoy the attractions such as roller coasters, Ferris wheels, and games. Wearing a suit would be considered irregular in this context. 3. House: Depending on the occasion, people may dress differently when attending an event or gathering at a house, but in most circumstances, casual attire is fitting. A suit is usually more formal than necessary for visiting someone's home unless it is a formal event. 4. Shopping Center: A shopping center typically has various retail shops, food establishments, and entertainment venues. While some people may dress up for a shopping trip, the majority of individuals dress in casual or semi-formal attire. Wearing a suit at a shopping center would not necessarily be out of place, but it would not be the typical attire compared to a business district. Given these options, a business district best aligns with the scenario of being dressed in a suit and parking your car in a parking lot, as it is where one would typically be expected to dress in such professional attire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The movie portrays the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; \\"cucchiaio\\" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No-one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone. He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack's surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon. However, in this scene Jack also notices a strange sign on the arm of his attacker. Jack travels to the far East where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji, (\\"Silver spoon\\" in Japanese), an immortal and unstoppable being. After this, Jack is shown traveling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again.

Rooms are decorated with memorabilia and gifts, the original furniture and books, as well as honours and medals that Churchill received. Lady Churchill's long-time secretary, Grace Hamblin, was appointed the first administrator of the house. Earlier in her career, Miss Hamblin had undertaken the destruction of the portrait of Churchill painted by Graham Sutherland. The picture, a gift from both Houses of Parliament on Churchill's 80th birthday in 1954, was loathed by both Churchill and Lady Churchill and had been stored in the cellars at Chartwell before being burnt in secret.The opening of the house required the construction of facilities for visitors and a restaurant was designed by Philip Jebb, and built to the north of the house, along with a shop and ticket office. Alterations have also been made to the gardens, for ease of access and of maintenance. In 1987, the Great Storm caused considerable damage, with some twenty-three trees being blown down in the gardens. Greater loss occurred in the woodlands surrounding the house, which lost over 70% of its trees.Chartwell has become among the National Trust's most popular properties; in 2016 some 232,000 visitors came to the house.

John calls the police, but a search of the old house turns up nothing. The next morning, Ellen notices a freshly planted bed of flowers in the garden of the old house, that was not there before. She calls the investigating detective, Inspector Walker (Bill Dean), and suggests that the body of the murder victim she witnessed may be buried there. Inspector Walker then questions the caretaker of the old house, Mr. Appleby (Robert Lang), who confirms that he planted the flowers the night before during the storm, but refuses to let the police search the garden or dig up the flowers he just planted. Ellen is revealed to be recovering from a mental breakdown that occurred after her unfaithful first husband, Carl, was killed a few years earlier in an auto accident with his paramour. Ellen was traumatized by having to identify the bodies in the local morgue. Inspector Walker confides to John that Ellen may be mentally ill and suggests rest and a doctor. Ellen continues to maintain that she saw a murder in the deserted house, but there is no proof and John remains skeptical. Ellen's visiting friend Sarah Cooke (Billie Whitelaw) is equally skeptical and tries humoring Ellen by suggesting that she sees what she thinks she sees because of her recent breakdown. When both Ellen and Sarah see a man enter the old house the following night, they call the police, who find Mr. Appleby wandering around with a flashlight and arrest him for trespassing.

Egypt, the UAE deny the reports, but the U.S. says it understands they did strike. Amid the threat of ISIS, some regional powers fear extremists in Libya, says H.A. Hellyer. Libyans are caught between supporters of Islamist groups, those who fear them, he says.","output":"Title: The Unraveling Crisis in Libya: The Involvement of UAE, Egypt, and the Rising Fear of Extremism Introduction The political instability in Libya has been a major concern for the global community. As the country deals with extensive political unrest, violence, and the emergence of extremist groups, the situation on the ground is becoming increasingly complex. Amid this crisis, The New York Times recently reported that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt have launched air strikes in Libya. Although both countries deny these claims, the United States maintains that it understands they indeed took part in these actions. The involvement of regional powers can be traced back to the crippling fear of terrorism and the rise of extremist groups such as ISIS in the region. In this article, we will delve into the challenges faced by Libya and the role of the UAE, Egypt, and other regional powers in addressing these issues. UAE and Egypt's involvement: An attempt to counter extremist influence Despite the denial from Egypt and the UAE regarding their involvement in Libyan air strikes, corroborating sources have indicated that both countries did play a role in military actions. Analysts and experts, including H.A. Hellyer, believe that regional powers like the UAE and Egypt are becoming increasingly concerned about the growth of extremist groups in Libya. The instability in the country has led to a power vacuum, which extremist groups such as ISIS have exploited to establish a foothold. As a result, countries like Egypt and the UAE may seek to contain the spread of extremism by launching air strikes that target these terror organizations. Their involvement reflects a broader regional effort to combat the rise of terrorist groups in unstable regions, which pose a significant threat to global security. The plight of the Libyans: Caught in a power struggle The ordinary Libyans are the most affected by this crisis. They find themselves trapped between different factions, including supporters of Islamist groups and those who fear their extremist ideologies. The constant struggle for power and territory has left the country fragmented, with rival governments and militias claiming authority. Resolution: A call for regional and international cooperation The situation in Libya requires a concerted effort from regional and international actors to halt the spiral of violence and instability. As regional powers like the UAE and Egypt become more involved in the conflict, it is imperative that they coordinate their efforts with other countries in the region and with the international community. A unified and comprehensive strategy to support the establishment of a stable and functioning Libyan government is needed. This approach should prioritize addressing the root causes of instability, including political grievances, economic challenges, and social divisions that have fueled the rise of extremist narratives. Conclusion The crisis in Libya is a complex one that demands the attention and cooperation of the regional powers and the international community. The involvement of the UAE and Egypt in the conflict highlights the extent of concern over the growing influence of extremist groups in the region. It is crucial to find a political solution that bolsters the legitimacy of a central Libyan government while also addressing the underlying factors that have given rise to the threat of terrorism. Only through a collaborated effort can the tide be turned and peace be restored to the beleaguered nation of Libya."},{"instruction":"Как в UIPath экспортировать проект в json?","output":"В UiPath Studio вы можете экспортировать проект в формате JSON, используя следующие шаги: 1.

Son père, nommé Georges, est présenté comme un homme plutôt effacé et en retrait de la vie familiale. Il est souvent absent ou occupé par ses activités professionnelles, ce qui laisse Sido, la mère de Colette, assumer la plupart des responsabilités familiales. Colette semble avoir une vision mitigée de son père. D'un côté, elle reconnaît sa gentillesse et son estime pour lui ressort à certaines occasions. Par exemple, elle se souvient de lui lui chantant des berceuses quand elle était enfant, ou des rares moments de complicité qu'ils partageaient. Colette mentionne également la fascination de son père pour les arts, ce qui a influencé son propre intérêt pour la créativité.

Pat used hypnotic sessions disguised as meditation to condition Dave into a state of subservience. During an after-work gathering, Pat proudly reveals Dave's condition as her subservient footslave to their colleagues, leaving them astonished. This situation raises several concerning issues. Firstly, the unauthorized use of hypnosis for personal gain is a breach of trust and a violation of Dave's autonomy. Additionally, the revelation of Dave's subservience in front of colleagues without his consent is embarrassing, dehumanizing, and emotionally damaging. If faced with such a distressing situation, there are several potential actions to consider: 1. Dave should seek support: Dave should reach out to trusted friends, family, or professionals to discuss what he experienced and seek emotional support during this challenging time. 2. Report the incident to HR or management: Dave should consider reporting the situation to his company's Human Resources department or management team. They have an obligation to ensure a safe and respectful work environment, and this incident clearly violates those principles. 3. Consult legal advice: Dave may want to consult an attorney to understand his rights and explore potential legal actions against Pat or the company, depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction. 4. Document and gather evidence: It is crucial for Dave to gather any evidence he can to support his claims. This may include emails, messages, or any other records that could validate his experience and help him during potential investigations or legal proceedings. 5. Seek professional help: If Dave suspects he has been under the influence of hypnosis or manipulation, he might want to consider seeking help from a licensed therapist or psychologist who specializes in trauma or mind control to process his experiences and restore his mental well-being.

ООП принципы: ООП - это аббревиатура от объектно-ориентированного программирования (Object-Oriented Programming). Это подход к программированию, который использует \\"объекты\\" - данные, представленные полями (часто называемыми атрибутами или свойствами), и код, представленный процедурами (часто называемыми методами). ООП основывается на нескольких ключевых принципах: - Абстракция: Сокрытие сложности реализации и представление объектов в удобных для работы категориях. - Инкапсуляция: Сокрытие внутренних данных объекта от прямого доступа извне, предоставление методов для безопасного взаимодействия с этими данными. - Наследование: Создание новых классов на основе существующих с возможностью расширения или изменения функционала. - Полиморфизм: Возможность работать с несколькими типами так, будто это один и тот же тип, или использовать один и тот же интерфейс для различных базовых форм реализации. 2. SOLID принципы: SOLID - это акроним, составленный из начальных букв пяти принципов объектно-ориентированного программирования и проектирования. Они направлены на то, чтобы сделать систему более понятной, гибкой и поддерживаемой: - Single Responsibility Principle (Принцип единственной ответственности): Каждый класс должен иметь только одну причину для изменения. - Open/Closed Principle (Принцип открытости/закрытости): Классы должны быть открыты для расширения, но закрыты для модификации. - Liskov Substitution Principle (Принцип подстановки Барбары Лисков): Объекты в программе должны быть заменяемы на экземпляры их подтипов без изменения правильности выполнения программы. - Interface Segregation Principle (Принцип разделения интерфейса): Не следует заставлять клиента зависеть от интерфейсов, которые он не использует. - Dependency Inversion Principle (Принцип инверсии зависимостей): Модули высокого уровня не должны зависеть от модулей низкого уровня. Оба типа модулей должны зависеть от абстракций. 3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Принцип DRY гласит, что \\"каждый кусочек знания должен иметь единое, несомненное и авторитетное представление внутри системы\\". Это означает, что следует избегать дублирования кода, чтобы изменения в любой части системы не требовали изменений во множестве мест, что упрощает поддержку и развитие. 4. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Принцип KISS призывает к сокращению сложности системы насколько это возможно, утверждая, что \\"простота должна быть ключевым целевым показателем при дизайне\\", и \\"не следует умножать сущности без необходимости\\". Простые системы легче понять, разрабатывать и поддерживать. Каждый из этих принципов играет важную роль в разработке качественного ПО и является ключевым навыком для Python-разработчика, а также для программистов, использующих любые другие языки программирования и технологии."},{"instruction":"Твой код презентации не работает, не запускается, выдает ошибку. исправь его, пожалуйста","output":"Примите мои извинения за предоставленный сбойный код.

While freezing the tea can preserve psilocin to some extent, the subsequent drying or curing process typically involved in making gummies or candies could lead to psilocin degradation. Psilocin is sensitive to heat, light, and oxygen, which can cause it to degrade over time. While freezing the tea can slow down degradation, transforming it into a solid form like gummies or candies may expose it to more factors that degrade psilocin. To maximize psilocin preservation, it is suggested to minimize exposure to heat, light, and oxygen. This could involve using cold processes, like making gummies at low temperatures or encapsulating the psilocin tea in a protective coating.

En revanche, l'Univers est un système à grande échelle qui englobe des galaxies, des étoiles, des planètes et bien d'autres entités. L'échelle de l'Univers est bien plus vaste que celle d'un automate cellulaire. 2. Complexité : Les automates cellulaires ont généralement des règles de transition et d'interaction relativement simples, tandis que l'Univers est régi par des lois physiques complexes et variées, telles que la gravité, l'électromagnétisme, l'interaction nucléaire forte et faible, etc. Ces lois donnent lieu à une grande diversité de phénomènes et de comportements, allant de la formation des galaxies à l'évolution des étoiles et à l'émergence de la vie. 3. Déterminisme vs Stochastique : Les automates cellulaires peuvent être soit déterministes (où les règles de transition sont entièrement prévisibles) soit stochastiques (où les transitions sont probabilistes). Dans l'Univers, bien que certaines lois physiques fondamentales soient déterministes, d'autres phénomènes peuvent être soumis à l'aléatoire quantique et ne peuvent être prédits qu'avec une certaine probabilité, comme dans le cas de la mécanique quantique. 4. Évolution : Les automates cellulaires sont souvent étudiés pour leur capacité à produire des motifs et des évolutions dynamiques à partir d'états initiaux donnés. L'Univers, quant à lui, a suivi une évolution complexe sur une échelle de temps de l'ordre de 13,8 milliards d'années, depuis le Big Bang jusqu'à sa structure actuelle. Son évolution est marquée par des phénomènes tels que la formation de galaxies, l'expansion de l'espace, la formation d'étoiles et de planètes, et l'émergence de la vie. En somme, bien que certains aspects de l'Univers puissent présenter des similitudes avec un automate cellulaire, il est important de noter les différences majeures en termes d'échelle, de complexité, de déterminisme/stochastique et d'évolution, qui font de l'Univers un système unique et distinct d'un automate cellulaire."},{"instruction":"que signifie \\"discrète de cellules\\" ?","output":"\\"Discrète de cellules\\" signifie que la grille est composée d'un ensemble fini ou dénombrable de cellules distinctes. Ces cellules ne se chevauchent pas et ne sont pas continues. Chaque cellule occupe un emplacement spécifique dans la grille et est séparée des autres cellules par des frontières claires. Dans le contexte d'un automate cellulaire, cela signifie que l'espace de jeu est divisé en unités discrètes, généralement carrées ou hexagonales, où chaque cellule a une position fixe et une taille déterminée. Chaque cellule peut prendre différents états et interagir avec ses voisines selon les règles prédéfinies. Les états et les interactions des cellules peuvent changer au fil du temps en fonction de ces règles. Cette discrétisation de l'espace est une simplification souvent utilisée pour modéliser et analyser des systèmes complexes, tels que la dynamique des automates cellulaires, où les états et les interactions des cellules discrètes permettent d'observer des motifs, des évolutions et des comportements collectifs émergents."},{"instruction":"pourquoi Einstein a t il dit : \\"Dieu ne joue pas aux dés\\"?","output":"Albert Einstein a prononcé la phrase célèbre : \\"Dieu ne joue pas aux dés\\" dans le contexte de la physique quantique. La physique quantique est une branche de la physique qui étudie les phénomènes à l'échelle microscopique, tels que les particules subatomiques. À cette époque, la physique quantique était en plein essor et présentait des caractéristiques apparemment aléatoires et probabilistes. Selon la théorie quantique, les résultats des mesures effectuées sur de petites particules peuvent être décrits avec des probabilités plutôt qu'avec une certitude absolue. Cela a été formulé par le principe d'indétermination d'Heisenberg, qui définit des limites fondamentales à la précision avec laquelle certaines paires de propriétés, comme la position et la vitesse d'une particule, peuvent être mesurées simultanément. Einstein, avec d'autres physiciens, dont notamment Erwin Schrödinger, ne se sentait pas à l'aise avec cette interprétation probabiliste de la réalité. Il croyait en une compréhension déterministe et fondamentale du monde, où tout pourrait être calculé avec une précision absolue. Ainsi, lorsqu'Einstein a prononcé la phrase \\"Dieu ne joue pas aux dés\\", il exprimait son scepticisme vis-à-vis du caractère aléatoire de la physique quantique et son désir d'une réalité fondamentalement déterministe. Il suggérait que les lois de la nature devaient être basées sur des principes déterministes et non sur des interactions aléatoires ou probabilistes. C'est une déclaration philosophique qui reflète sa vision scientifique et son désir de trouver une théorie unificatrice de la nature."},{"instruction":"Pouvez vous me réexpliquer ça, mais plus simplement : \\"Cela a été formulé par le principe d’indétermination d’Heisenberg, qui définit des limites fondamentales à la précision avec laquelle certaines paires de propriétés, comme la position et la vitesse d’une particule, peuvent être mesurées simultanément.\\"","output":"Le principe d'indétermination d'Heisenberg est une idée de la physique quantique qui dit que, lorsque nous mesurons certaines propriétés d'une particule, comme sa position et sa vitesse, il y a une limite à la précision avec laquelle nous pouvons effectuer ces mesures en même temps. En d'autres termes, il n'est pas possible de connaître exactement et simultanément la position et la vitesse précises d'une particule donnée. Plus nous essayons de mesurer précisément l'une de ces propriétés, plus l'incertitude dans la mesure de l'autre propriété augmente. Cette idée remet en question l'idée traditionnelle selon laquelle nous pouvons mesurer avec une certitude absolue toutes les caractéristiques d'une particule à n'importe quel moment donné. Au lieu de cela, les mesures quantiques sont soumises à des limites fondamentales d'incertitude. Cette notion d'indétermination d'Heisenberg a été un point de désaccord pour Einstein, car il préférait une vision déterministe où tout dans l'univers pourrait être connu précisément. C'est pourquoi il a exprimé son scepticisme en disant que \\"Dieu ne joue pas aux dés\\", c'est-à-dire que le hasard ne devrait pas être une caractéristique fondamentale de la réalité."},{"instruction":"Qu est ce que la réduction quantique ?","output":"La \\"réduction quantique\\" est un terme utilisé en physique quantique pour décrire un phénomène où l'état quantique d'un système passe d'une superposition de plusieurs états possibles à un seul état spécifique lorsqu'une mesure est effectuée. Selon la théorie quantique, avant une mesure, une particule peut exister dans une superposition d'états différents, c'est-à-dire une combinaison linéaire de ces états. Cela signifie que, par exemple, une particule peut être à la fois dans un état \\"A\\" et dans un état \\"B\\" en même temps, avec des probabilités associées à chaque état. Cependant, lorsqu'une mesure est réalisée pour déterminer une propriété spécifique de la particule, telle que sa position ou sa vitesse, la superposition se \\"réduit\\" instantanément à un seul état. Cela signifie que la particule est observée dans un état bien défini, correspondant à l'un des états possibles de sa superposition précédente. Le processus de réduction quantique est souvent considéré comme énigmatique, car il n'est pas actuellement expliqué par les lois de la physique quantique, mais plutôt observé expérimentalement. La réduction quantique est souvent associée à la question philosophique de l'interprétation de la nature de la réalité et de la signification des mesures dans le cadre de la physique quantique."},{"instruction":"Simplement, qu est ce qu une \\"combinaison linéaire\\" ?","output":"Une \\"combinaison linéaire\\" est une opération mathématique qui consiste à additionner les multiples de différents éléments. Dans le contexte de la physique quantique, une combinaison linéaire est utilisée pour décrire l'état quantique d'un système qui peut exister dans plusieurs états à la fois. Par exemple, considérons deux états quantiques possibles, notés |A⟩ et |B⟩. Une combinaison linéaire de ces états serait de la forme α|A⟩ + β|B⟩, où α et β sont des coefficients complexes et représentent les amplitudes de probabilité associées à chaque état. Ces coefficients sont utilisés pour décrire la contribution relative de chaque état dans la superposition. Les coefficients α et β peuvent être des nombres réels ou complexes, et ils peuvent avoir différentes valeurs en fonction des conditions du système et de la mesure spécifique qui est réalisée. Les carrés des amplitudes de probabilité, c'est-à-dire |α|^2 et |β|^2, donnent les probabilités respectives de trouver le système dans chaque état lorsque la mesure est effectuée. Ainsi, une combinaison linéaire dans le contexte quantique permet de représenter l'état d'un système comme une superposition de plusieurs états possibles, donnant lieu à des phénomènes tels que l'interférence quantique et l'indétermination jusqu'à ce que la mesure soit effectuée."},{"instruction":"Peux tu simplifier ce paragraphe \\"Par exemple, considérons deux états quantiques possibles, notés |A⟩ et |B⟩.

Ces coefficients sont utilisés pour décrire la contribution relative de chaque état dans la superposition.\\"","output":"Bien sûr ! Une combinaison linéaire est un moyen de combiner deux états quantiques possibles, notés |A⟩ et |B⟩. On utilise des coefficients complexes, α et β, pour représenter les chances relatives de chaque état. La combinaison linéaire prend alors la forme α|A⟩ + β|B⟩. Les coefficients α et β montrent simplement combien chaque état contribue à la superposition. En d'autres termes, imaginez que vous ayez un état dans lequel un chat est soit mort |A⟩, soit vivant |B⟩. La combinaison linéaire pourrait être α|A⟩ + β|B⟩. Les coefficients α et β décrivent les chances relatives que le chat soit dans l'un ou l'autre état. Par exemple, α pourrait être plus grand si le chat est plus susceptible d'être mort, tandis que β pourrait être plus grand s'il est plus susceptible d'être vivant. Cette combinaison linéaire permet de représenter la possibilité que le chat soit à la fois mort et vivant jusqu'à ce que nous l'observions et que la superposition se réduise à un seul état lorsque nous réalisons une mesure."},{"instruction":"would you pls write a service for the game \\"Ball-Match 3D\\"?","output":"Sure!

Please use british english language and include todorvs narratology theory, character development and more relevant things please","output":"Jumanji (2017) and The Walking Dead TV series are two distinct works of art that belong to different genres - one being an adventure-comedy film and the other a post-apocalyptic horror drama series. However, upon closer inspection, it is possible to identify certain similarities and differences between the two, particularly in terms of Todorov's narratology theory, character development, and other relevant aspects. Beginning with Todorov's narratology theory, both Jumanji (2017) and The Walking Dead exhibit a clear shift from an initial equilibrium to a disrupted state, followed by a struggle to restore balance. In Jumanji, the main characters find themselves trapped in a video game, causing chaos and endangering their lives, while in The Walking Dead, a zombie outbreak destroys civilization, leading survivors to battle for survival amidst a bleak and hostile world. Both narratives involve a similar structure of disturbance, recognition of dilemma, and a pursuit of resolution, with the final equilibrium in each story differing due to the nature of their respective genres. Regarding character development, Jumanji (2017) primarily focuses on the growth and transformation of its protagonists within the context of their video game avatars. Each character begins with a fixed set of stereotypes but gradually develops and breaks these molds as they gain self-awareness and understand the value of teamwork. On the other hand, The Walking Dead explores a wider range of character development due to its ensemble cast and episodic nature. The series delves into the complexities of human nature, examining how individuals navigate survival, morality, and personal growth in the face of extreme circumstances. Another notable difference lies in the overall tone and atmosphere. Jumanji (2017) adopts a light-hearted and comedic approach, using humor to alleviate tension, while The Walking Dead thrives on the intense and oppressive atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world. The film focuses on providing entertainment through witty dialogue, funny situations, and action-packed sequences, while the series emphasizes the psychological and emotional impact of constant danger and loss. Furthermore, the visual aesthetics of both Jumanji (2017) and The Walking Dead contribute significantly to their storytelling. The film utilizes vibrant and visually stunning CGI effects to create the immersive world of the video game, presenting a contrast between the lush landscapes and the perilous challenges the characters face. In contrast, The Walking Dead opts for a more gritty and realistic visual style, utilizing practical effects and detailed set design to depict a decaying and desolate world plagued by both zombies and human conflicts. In conclusion, Jumanji (2017) and The Walking Dead TV series share certain similarities and differences in terms of Todorov's narratology theory, character development, and other relevant aspects. While both narratives follow the structure of disturbance, recognition, and resolution, their final equilibriums differ due to their distinct genres. Additionally, character development varies between the film's avatar-driven growth and the series' exploration of human nature amidst a post-apocalyptic landscape. The tone and atmosphere further distinguish these works, with Jumanji emphasizing humor and entertainment, while The Walking Dead hones in on the psychological and emotional impact of survival. Lastly, their visual aesthetics contribute significantly to the storytelling, with Jumanji utilizing CGI effects and The Walking Dead relying on practical effects and detailed set design."},{"instruction":"Привет!","output":"Привет!

Эмили Бронте родилась 30 июля 1818 года в Торнтоне. Эмили была пятым ребёнком в семье бедного священника ирландского происхождения Патрика Бронте и его жены Марии Бренуэлл. Мать умерла, когда Эмили было три года. Большую часть своей жизни Эмили провела в деревне Хоэрт (Уэст-Йоркшир). Некоторое время вместе со старшими сёстрами она училась в благотворительной школе в Кован-Бридж. Эпидемия, разразившаяся в школе и унёсшая жизни двух её сестёр, Марии и Элизабет, потрясла шестилетнюю Эмили и отразилась на всей её последующей жизни и творчестве. Особенно близкие родственные и творческие отношения связывали Эмили с младшей сестрой Энн. Подобно брату Бренуэллу и Шарлотте, сочинявшим романтические повести «ангрианского цикла», Эмили и Энн создали свой воображаемый мир, Гондал, источник их поэтического вдохновения. Несколько месяцев в 1835 году Эмили проучилась в Роухедской школе, но вскоре вернулась в Хоэрт из-за тоски по дому. В 1837 году она служит учительницей в предместье Галифакса Лоу-Хилле, а в 1842 году вместе с Шарлоттой уезжает в Брюссель для продолжения образования. После возвращения из Брюсселя, Эмили покинет Хоэрт лишь однажды — в 1845 году Энн организует для неё и себя короткую поездку в Йорк. В 1846 году выходит поэтический сборник «Стихотворения Каррера, Эллиса и Эктона Беллов». Стихи Эмили — «Эллиса» — получают довольно высокую оценку критики. В 1847 году был опубликован её роман «Грозовой перевал», который впоследствии принес ей славу. При жизни Эмили этот роман остался практически незамеченным. Как и её сестра Энн, Эмили Бронте почти не имела близких отношений с людьми вне семейного круга. Её переписка почти полностью утрачена. Более того, в своём письме Эллен Насси она с иронией заметила, что «похоже, никогда в жизни не писала нормальных писем». Страница из дневника Эмили, на которой изображена она с сестрой Энн, 1837 год В настоящее время особенно высоко оценивается её поэзия. Стихотворения «Воспоминание», «Узник» и другие принесли ей славу талантливой поэтессы. В сентябре 1848 года Эмили простудилась на похоронах брата и 19 декабря 1848 года умерла от туберкулёза.","output":"Эмили Джейн Бронте была известной английской писательницей и поэтессой.

Voici quelques citations qui les évoquent : 1. \\"La terre des bêtes est à peu près la seule propreté absolue qui subsiste en ce monde\\" (p. 7). Cette citation souligne la pureté et l'innocence de la nature, en contraste avec la corruption et l'immoralité de la société. 2. \\"La trajectoire effrayant des souris, les ressorts nerveux des fourmis, la sérénité indéchiffrable de la Chevêchette n'ont valu que pour lui\\" (p. 45). Ici, la nature est décrite comme un spectacle fascinant, qui captive et enchante le protagoniste. 3. \\"A leur chant des mésanges venaient se mêler celui des grives, des merles, de tirelire aigre des si belles fauvettes\\" (p. 72). Dans cette citation, les chants d'oiseaux divers représentent la beauté et la vivacité de la nature, créant une atmosphère poétique et joyeuse. 4. \\"La neige insistait à rendre la pureté aux bois, à la terre et aux bêtes\\" (p. 97). Ici, la neige est décrite comme un élément purificateur, qui efface les traces des humains et rend la nature immaculée. 5. \\"J'étais entourée de chien à aboyer, de charrettes de manants, de compagnons remis de leur vin blanc, d'une sellette de marchande à peine éveillée, et des bêtes reculent et hument en vain\\" (p. 161).

VAE состоит из двух основных компонентов: энкодера (encoder) и декодер (decoder). Энкодер преобразует входные данные в некоторое представление в скрытом пространстве (латентном пространстве), а декодер позволяет генерировать новые данные из этого скрытого представления. VAE отличается от обычного автоэнкодера тем, что использует вероятностную модель для генерации данных. Вместо простого сопоставления входного и выходного сигналов энкодера и декодера соответственно, VAE моделирует латентное пространство с помощью гауссовского распределения. Более конкретно, VAE предполагает, что данные генерируются из некоторого гауссовского распределения в латентном пространстве. В процессе обучения VAE минимизирует стоимостную функцию, которая состоит из двух компонентов: потери восстановления (reconstruction loss) и потери регуляризации (regularization loss). Потеря восстановления измеряет разницу между входной и выходной информацией, и обеспечивает правильную генерацию данных. Потеря регуляризации считает дивергенцию Кульбака-Лейблера (KL divergence) между предсказанным гауссовским распределением и стандартным гауссовским распределением в латентном пространстве. Регуляризационная потеря помогает контролировать структуру и многообразие генерируемых данных. VAE может быть использован для различных задач, включая генеративное моделирование данных, анормальное обнаружение, импутацию (заполнение пропущенных значений) и сжатие данных."},{"instruction":"autoencoder в DeepFake","output":"Autoencoder в контексте DeepFake используется для генерации фальшивых видео, в которых лица людей заменяются на лица других людей. Autoencoder - это глубокая нейронная сеть, представляющая собой комбинацию энкодера и декодера, которая позволяет автоматически извлекать и кодировать информацию из изображений и затем восстанавливать изображения обратно. Процесс создания DeepFake с использованием autoencoder включает несколько шагов: 1. Обучение энкодера: Сначала энкодер обучается извлекать важные признаки из исходных изображений, таких как расположение глаз, форма лица и другие детали. Он создает векторное представление (кодирование) для каждого лица. Это представление содержит сжатую информацию о ключевых особенностях лица. 2. Генерация кодов: Затем процесс генерирует коды (скрытые представления) для лиц, которые нужно заменить в видео, используя энкодер. Эти коды представляют лица, которые будут вставляться в исходное видео. 3. Обучение декодера: Декодер обучается преобразовывать коды, полученные на предыдущем шаге, обратно в изображения лиц. Таким образом, декодер генерирует фальшивые изображения лиц, которые будут использованы для замены оригинальных лиц в видео. 4. Интеграция в видео: Фальшивые изображения лиц, созданные декодером, интегрируются в исходное видео с помощью методов анимации лиц, таких как автоотслеживание лица и расположение ключевых точек. Это позволяет создать реалистичную смену лиц в видео. Однако стоит отметить, что DeepFake может использоваться для создания фальшивых видео и распространения неправдивой информации, поэтому важно осознавать его потенциальные негативные последствия и использовать его с осторожностью и этичностью."},{"instruction":"Dota 2 addon.

Bil je izjemno očarljiv in vsi prebivalci dežele so se mu radi družili. Imel je dolge, sijoče kodre temne barve, ki so se lesketali, ko je bil na soncu. Zlezel je po vrsti srca vseh, od malih ptic do velikih medvedov. Toda Vili ni bil zadovoljen le z enim občudovalcem ali občudovalko.

Individuals with diabetes often have reduced blood circulation and nerve damage in their feet, which can lead to foot problems and complications. Elastic or tight socks can restrict blood flow and cause discomfort or even injury to the feet. Diabetic socks are designed with non-binding tops and loose-fitting materials to prevent constriction and allow for better circulation. They also have seamless interiors to reduce friction and prevent blisters or irritation. Additionally, these socks often have moisture-wicking properties to keep the feet dry and prevent fungal infections. By eliminating elastic and providing a more comfortable fit, diabetic socks aim to promote foot health and reduce the risk of complications for individuals with diabetes."},{"instruction":"do elasticated socks cause problems for healthy people","output":"Elasticated socks typically do not cause problems for healthy individuals. In fact, many types of socks have elastic components to help them stay in place and provide a snug fit. Elasticated socks offer support and compression, which can be beneficial during physical activities or for individuals who stand or sit for long periods. However, in some cases, elasticated socks that are too tight or have excessive compression may cause discomfort, restrict blood circulation, or leave marks on the skin. This can be a concern for individuals with certain conditions such as sensitive skin, circulation issues, or lymphedema (a condition characterized by the swelling of limbs). For most healthy people, wearing well-fitting elasticated socks should not cause any problems. It's always a good idea to choose socks that are comfortable, non-restrictive, and made of breathable materials. If you have concerns about the fit or any discomfort, it may be best to consult with a healthcare professional for guidance."},{"instruction":"why are elasticated socks good for people who sit or stand for long periods","output":"Elasticated socks can be beneficial for individuals who sit or stand for long periods due to their compression properties. Compression socks or stockings are designed to apply pressure to the legs, helping to improve blood circulation and prevent swelling or pooling of blood in the lower limbs. When a person sits or stands for extended periods, gravity can cause blood to accumulate in the lower legs, leading to discomfort, heaviness, and swelling. Compression socks work by applying a gentle graduated pressure, meaning they are tighter at the ankles and gradually decrease in pressure towards the calves. This compression helps to improve blood flow, enhance venous return, and prevent fluid retention. By wearing elasticated socks, individuals who sit or stand for long periods can reduce the risk of conditions like varicose veins, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and edema (swelling). The compression promotes better circulation, reduces discomfort, and can increase overall comfort during prolonged periods of sitting or standing. It is important for individuals to choose the right level of compression based on their specific needs, and consult with a healthcare professional if they have any concerns or underlying medical conditions."},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么我可以帮助你的吗？"},{"instruction":"可以帮我写一个关于毛主席的简介吗","output":"当然可以！以下是毛主席的简介： 毛泽东（1893年12月26日-1976年9月9日），中国共产党的重要领导人和中华人民共和国的创立者，被尊称为毛主席。他生于湖南省湘潭县，出身农民家庭。毛泽东在中国近现代历史上扮演了极为重要的角色，他是中国共产党的一位杰出的理论家、政治家、军事家和革命家。 毛泽东领导中国共产党于1949年建立了中华人民共和国，并担任国家主席和中央人民政府主席。他提出了许多重要的思想和理论，其中最著名的是毛泽东思想。毛主席的思想以实现中国的社会主义革命和建设为核心，形成了中国共产党的指导思想。毛主席还倡导了大规模的土地改革、大跃进运动和文化大革命，这些都极大地影响了中国的经济、社会和政治。 在他的领导下，中国进行了一系列重要的政治和经济改革，包括农业集体化、工业化和军事现代化。他还提倡了独立自主的外交政策，主张“独立自主、自力更生、对外开放、百花齐放、百家争鸣”的外交原则。同时，他也引发了一些争议和批评，尤其是在文化大革命期间，这段历史被认为导致了一些负面后果。 毛主席于1976年去世，但他的遗产和影响力在中国和全球依然存在。他被视为一位具有深远影响的领导人，对中国和世界都产生了重要的影响。他的形象和思想仍然在中国被广泛崇敬和研究。毛主席是一位伟大的历史人物，他的思想和理论对中国和世界都留下了深远的影响。"},{"instruction":"Лабораторная работа: “Изучение технических средств и техники измерения линейных размеров” Выводы по работе","output":"В ходе выполнения лабораторной работы были изучены основные технические средства и методы измерения линейных размеров.

Каким образом удается исключить влияние нестабильности источни¬ка света при световых измерениях? 4. Чем отличается денситометр от-фотометра по назначению и структуре? 5. Каковы отличия спектрофотометра от фотометра?","output":"1. Оптическая плотность (также известная как оптическая плотность пропускания) - это мера способности материала пропускать свет. Она определяется как отношение интенсивности прошедшего света к интенсивности падающего света и обычно измеряется в логарифмической шкале. 2. Нормирование условий освещения и наблюдения при световых измерениях необходимо для обеспечения одинаковых условий для сравнения и оценки результатов измерений. Различия в освещении и наблюдении могут привести к искажению результатов измерений и несоответствию с действительностью. 3. Для исключения влияния нестабильности источника света при световых измерениях используются стабилизированные источники света или компенсационные методы. Например, можно использовать систему обратной связи для поддержания постоянной интенсивности света, или использовать двойные измерения с последующим вычитанием базового значения. 4. Денситометр и фотометр – это оба прибора, используемые для измерения оптической плотности, но с различным назначением и структурой. Денситометр используется для измерения плотности чернил на печатных материалах и имеет специализированные светочувствительные элементы для измерения отраженного света. Фотометр используется для измерения интенсивности света в различных областях спектра и может иметь различные типы светочувствительных элементов в зависимости от приложения. 5. Основное отличие между спектрофотометром и фотометром заключается в способе измерения. Фотометр измеряет интенсивность света в заданной области спектра, обычно используя набор фильтров для выбора узкой полосы пропускания. Спектрофотометр, с другой стороны, измеряет интенсивность света для множества длин волн и может строить спектральный профиль или спектр объекта. Это позволяет анализировать более широкий спектр света и получать более детальную информацию о поглощении или пропускании света в различных частях спектра."},{"instruction":"Подготовиться к защите лабораторной работы : «Измерение оптической плотности фотоформ».

Let's tackle the backend first: 1. First, you need to serve the audio file over HTTP. You can use FastAPI's \`FileResponse\` to do this. Modify the \`/audio\` endpoint in FastAPI to serve the file instead: \`\`\`python from fastapi.responses import FileResponse @app.get(\\"/audio\\") async def play_audio(): return FileResponse(\\"audio.mp3\\") \`\`\` 2. Next, you should ensure that the audio file is played when a specific event occurs. However, you can't directly \\"play\\" audio on the server-side; you have to instruct the client's browser to start playback. On the frontend, here’s how you might trigger the audio to play: \`\`\`javascript function playAudio() { var audioPlayer = document.getElementById(\\"audioPlayer\\"); audioPlayer.load(); // Reload the audio file in case it's changed audioPlayer.play(); // Play the loaded audio file } \`\`\` 3. Tie the \`playAudio\` function to an event, such as the button press you specified, or call it after a successful response from the server: \`\`\`javascript function captureImage() { fetch('/start_processing', { method: 'POST' }) .then(response => { if (response.ok) { return response.json(); } else { throw new Error('Network response was not ok'); } }) .then(data => { console.log('Data received:', data); // Play audio after processing is complete playAudio(); // The rest of your logic for handling the successful POST request }) .catch(error => { console.error('There has been a problem with your fetch operation:', error); }); } \`\`\` 4. Ensure that the audio player in your HTML reads from the correct endpoint and has controls so users can interact with it if necessary: \`\`\`html <audio id=\\"audioPlayer\\" controls src=\\"/audio\\"></audio> \`\`\` 5. Make sure the \`playAudio\` function is accessible to your HTML by including it in a \`<script>\` tag or an external JavaScript file referenced in your HTML document. Finally, I recommend removing unrelated Python code involving OpenCV and OCR from the function that serves the audio file. By keeping the functions focused on a single task, you'll maintain a clean separation of concerns and improve the manageability of your code."},{"instruction":"it doesn't play the audio","output":"If the audio isn't playing, there could be several issues at play. Here's a troubleshooting checklist to find and solve the problem: 1. **Check audio file accessibility**: Ensure that the audio file is available and can be accessed by the server at the expected location (\`audio.mp3\`). It should be in the same directory as your FastAPI application if you're opening it as \`open(\\"audio.mp3\\", \\"rb\\")\`. 2. **Check Response Type**: Ensure you're returning a \`FileResponse\` for the audio file. \`\`\`python from fastapi.responses import FileResponse @app.get(\\"/audio\\") async def play_audio(): return FileResponse(\\"audio.mp3\\") \`\`\` 3. **Check URL paths**: Ensure that the URL in the HTML's \`<audio>\` element is correct and matches the FastAPI route. The route you have set up is \`/audio\`, so the \`src\` should be set to \`/audio\`. 4. **Verify the JavaScript function**: Ensure that the JavaScript function \`playAudio()\` works correctly. \`\`\`javascript function playAudio() { var audioPlayer = document.getElementById(\\"audioPlayer\\"); if (audioPlayer) { audioPlayer.play(); } else { console.error(\\"Audio player element not found!\\"); } } \`\`\` 5. **Check browser console**: Look at the browser's developer tools console (usually accessible with F12) for any errors. If there's an issue with the file loading or network errors, they will show up here. 6. **Autoplay Policy**: Modern browsers have strict policies about autoplaying audio and video. Make sure the page is interacted with before attempting to play audio. For example, the user might need to click a button first. 7. **File MIME Type**: Ensure that the MIME type of the audio file is correctly recognized. If it's an \`.mp3\` file, the server should serve it with the \`audio/mpeg\` MIME type. \`FileResponse\` should handle this automatically, but you can specify it if needed: \`\`\`python @app.get(\\"/audio\\") async def play_audio(): return FileResponse(\\"audio.mp3\\", media_type='audio/mpeg') \`\`\` 8. **Cross-Origin Resources Sharing (CORS)**: Check if CORS might be blocking your requests. If your server and client are on different origins, you might need to configure CORS support in FastAPI: 9. **Network issues**: Ensure that the server is running and reachable from the client. If you're running the server on localhost and trying to access it from another device or if there's a proxy/firewall, this could cause issues. 10. **HTML Audio Tag**: Ensure you've added the \`controls\` attribute to the \`<audio>\` tag so you can manually test playback on the browser. 11. **Server errors**: Check your FastAPI logs to see if there are any server-side errors when the \`/audio\` endpoint is hit. If you have gone through this checklist and the audio still doesn't play, you might want to provide more specific details including any error messages you're seeing in the browser console or FastAPI logs.

You don't have to start a new thread manually—FastAPI's \`BackgroundTasks\` handles this for you. The \`process_images\` function will execute in the background while the server continues to be responsive for other requests. Just keep in mind that background tasks are a simple way to handle background execution in API endpoints but they have some limitations: - Background tasks will end if the server process stops. - There's no easy way to monitor these tasks or get feedback if they run successfully or fail. - For more complex or long-running tasks that need to be resilient, using a task queue such as Celery with a message broker like RabbitMQ or Redis would be a more robust solution."},{"instruction":"play the audio in python: @app.get(\\"/audio\\") async def play_audio(): #open audio.mp3 and play the audio in python with open(\\"audio.mp3\\", \\"rb\\") as f: audio_data = f.read() audio_data = audio_data.decode('utf-8') return audio_data","output":"To play an audio file in Python using FastAPI, you won't be actually playing the sound on the server itself; instead, you serve the audio data to the client's browser and let the browser handle playback.

This can happen if you're executing long-running synchronous tasks in response to an event. However, from the code snippets you have provided, it's not entirely clear where the freezing might be occurring. Here are some steps you can take to try and resolve the client-side freezing issue: 1. **Offload Heavy Processing**: Ensure that any heavy processing on the client-side is offloaded to web workers or the server, as they should not be executed synchronously on the main thread. 2. **Check Audio Loading and Playing**: Playing audio shouldn't normally freeze the page. However, if you have a very large file, or if there are performance issues with the server, it could result in the audio taking a long time to load. Since you are using the \`load()\` method to ensure that the latest audio file is loaded, check if the file is large or the server response is slow. 3. **Handle Promise Properly**: The \`audio.play()\` method returns a promise that can be used to detect when the playback starts. If there's an issue with playback starting, it should throw an error that might be informative. Here is an example of properly handling this promise: \`\`\`javascript function playAudio() { var audioPlayer = document.getElementById(\\"audioPlayer\\"); audioPlayer.load(); audioPlayer.play() .then(() => console.log(\\"Audio playback started successfully!\\")) .catch(error => console.error(\\"Error during audio playback:\\", error)); } \`\`\` 4. **Avoid Unnecessary server hits**: The \`generate_audio\` function checks the existence of the audio file every time. This results in multiple HTTP/HTTPS requests to an external service, which can be a slow and blocking operation. Make sure this function runs only when necessary. 5. **Check Server-Side Processing**: The way the server handles the \`/start_processing\` route might be causing issues if \`process_images\` is taking a long time. Though \`BackgroundTasks\` should prevent the endpoint from blocking, if the task is extremely resource-intensive, it could impact server responsiveness. 6. **Verify Network Performance**: Check the network's performance. If the server is slow to respond to the client's requests, this could cause delays and give the appearance of the client \\"freezing.\\" 7. **Confirm Browser Policies**: Verify that browser autoplay policies aren't interfering with playback. Modern browsers have limitations where audio cannot autoplay without user interaction. 8. **Browser Console**: Keep an eye on the browser console for errors. A freeze or hang should generate some sort of error message, which you can use to diagnose the issue. 9. **Debugging**: To pinpoint the operation that's causing the freeze, add more log statements and check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see which requests are taking a long time. As of now, the most probable reasons for a freeze after initiating playback with the provided extracts would be either the file is too large and takes time to buffer, or there's a heavy processing task running in the background that is slowing down the client's main thread.

You have an async \`process_images\` function that's performing image processing and you are trying to trigger audio playback within the same process. In a server environment like FastAPI, you don't typically play audio. Instead, you serve the audio file over HTTP and the client's browser is responsible for playing it. When you use \`await play_audio()\` in your \`process_images\` function, it's not actually playing the audio. It's awaiting the \`play_audio\` endpoint, which is incorrect because the \`play_audio\` function is an HTTP GET endpoint and should only be called by an HTTP client (the browser), not from within the server code itself. The correct approach would be: 1. Let \`process_images\` function do the following: - Process the images. - Use \`generate_audio\` to create the audio file (as it already does). - Save the audio file to disk. - Signal the client to fetch and play the audio (this will be handled on the client-side, not server-side). 2. On the frontend (client-side), after calling '/start_processing', poll the server for the status of the task. When the task is complete, load and play the audio or notify the client that the audio is ready. Here is a simplified client-side polling mechanism: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Video</title> </head> <body> <button onclick=\\"captureImage()\\">Capture Image</button> <audio id=\\"audioPlayer\\" controls src=\\"/audio\\"></audio> <script> function checkTaskStatus() { fetch('/task_status') .then(response => response.json()) .then(response => { if (response.status === 'Completed') { playAudio(); } else if (response.status === 'In progress') { // Poll every 2 seconds if the task is still in progress setTimeout(checkTaskStatus, 2000); } else if (response.status === 'Failed') { console.error('Task failed'); } }) .catch(error => console.error('Error checking task status:', error)); } function playAudio() { var audioPlayer = document.getElementById('audioPlayer'); audioPlayer.load(); audioPlayer.play(); } function captureImage() { fetch('/start_processing', { method: 'POST' }) .then(response => response.json()) .then(() => { // Begin polling for the task status checkTaskStatus(); }) .catch(error => console.error('Fetch operation error:', error)); } <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` In the server-side code, you will need to update the \`TASK_STATUS\` variable to \\"Completed\\" when \`process_images\` completes successfully: \`\`\`python # Inside process_images # After processing and generating audio, before the try-except block ends TASK_STATUS = \\"Completed\\" \`\`\` With this setup, you should avoid the client-side freezing, and your audio playback logic should work correctly where the server prepares the media and the client fetches and plays it.

Ultimately, it offers an endpoint to serve the generated audio file. On the front-end, JavaScript triggers the \`/start_processing\` end-point and then polls the \`/task_status\` endpoint until the task is complete. Once complete, it calls \`playAudio()\` to attempt to play the sound from the \`/audio\` endpoint. There are a couple of things to check if the audio is not playing: 1. **File Generation:** Ensure that \`generate_audio\` correctly generates the \`audio.mp3\` file and that the file is indeed being placed in the correct directory that the server has access to. 2. **Endpoints:** Verify that the \`/audio\` endpoint is serving the correct audio file. If the \`audio.mp3\` isn't getting updated correctly, that could be why the audio is not playing. 3. **Content-Type:** Make sure the response headers for the audio request are correct. \`FileResponse\` should handle the \`Content-Type\` automatically, but you can manually check the headers in the network tab of your browser's development tools. 4. **Client-side Errors:** Open your browser's developer console (usually you can press F12) and pay attention to any errors. If the audio file is not found, or if there are any other issues (such as permission issues or decoding errors), it will show up here. 5. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** If your FastAPI server and the page from which you're trying to access the audio are not on the same domain, you may run into CORS issues. You may need to add CORS middleware to allow your web page to fetch resources from your FastAPI server. Here's how you could add CORS middleware to your FastAPI app: \`\`\`python from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware app.add_middleware( CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\\"*\\"], # Allows all origins, you should narrow this down for production allow_credentials=True, allow_methods=[\\"*\\"], # Allows all methods allow_headers=[\\"*\\"], # Allows all headers ) \`\`\` 6. **Task Status Update:** Ensure that \`TASK_STATUS\` gets updated to \\"Completed\\" after successful generation of the audio file. 7. **Audio Autoplay Policy:** Modern browsers have strict rules around autoplaying audio and video. If your page is trying to play the audio before the user has interacted with the page, then the browser may block the audio from playing. It's possible that the audio element is trying to play the audio before it's loaded. You should wait for the \`canplaythrough\` event before playing the audio. Here's a modified \`playAudio\` function in your client's JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript function playAudio() { var audioPlayer = document.getElementById('audioPlayer'); audioPlayer.oncanplaythrough = function() { audioPlayer.play(); }; audioPlayer.load(); // This call loads the new audio file and, due to the event listener above, plays it once it can } \`\`\` Make sure the audio file is small, or at least adequately buffered, to avoid delays in playback, as that might frustrate users."},{"instruction":"#include <SDL.h> #include <SDL_image.h> #include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <random> #include <vector> // Размеры окна const int WINDOW_WIDTH = 800;

They were developed by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century and are still widely used and applied in physics and engineering today. 1. Newton's First Law of Motion, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. In other words, objects tend to resist changes in their state of motion. This law essentially describes the concept of inertia, which is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its velocity. 2. Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, this can be written as F = ma, where F represents the net force, m represents the mass of the object, and a represents the acceleration produced. 3. Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if Object A exerts a force on Object B, then Object B exerts an equal and opposite force on Object A. Forces always occur in pairs and act on different objects. This law is particularly useful in explaining the motion of interacting objects and the conservation of momentum. These laws of motion are fundamental principles in physics and are applied in various fields such as engineering, biomechanics, and astrophysics. They provide a framework for understanding how forces affect the motion of objects and are essential in explaining the behavior of physical systems."},{"instruction":"Zaza","output":"I'm sorry, but I don't have any information or context regarding \\"Zaza\\".

That was not its official name, but its colloquial name based on its founding and origins. It began when a young villager was cast out, excommunicated by everyone in his village. His own family, friends and lover shunned him and sent him on way. Soon, he would meet other outcasts from different villages who, while having their own ethnicities, their own cultures, suffered the same fate, across different parts of the continent. At first, they sought to create their own village, but soon it had transformed into a kingdom, and in less than three years time, its power was great enough to not only conquer half of the continent, but even claim territories over neighboring continents.","output":"In a distant land, nestled amidst lush valleys and towering mountains, stood the Empire of Outcasts. Once a scattered group of exiled individuals, they had transformed their fortunes against all odds, rising to unimaginable heights of power and influence. It all began with a young man named Adrian, his heart filled with dreams and ambitions, until one fateful day when his village turned its back on him. They blamed him unjustly for a misfortune that befell the community, a plague that ravaged their crops, leading to poverty and despair. Betrayed by his own people, Adrian was cast out, destined to wander the vast realm alone. As he embarked on his solitary journey, the bitter sting of rejection gradually transformed into burning determination. Wandering far and wide, he soon encountered others who shared his fate. With each passing encounter, Adrian discovered an untapped wellspring of strength within these outcasts - resilience, ingenuity, and boundless potential. Recognizing the power that emerged from their collective stories, Adrian and his newfound allies decided to embark on a quest to create a sanctuary, a place they could call home. Drawn together by their shared experiences and united by a common vision, they chose to establish a village to serve as a refuge for all. Word of this endeavor swiftly spread, capturing the hearts and minds of outcasts from distant lands. People from different cultures, varying backgrounds, and diverse walks of life flocked to the call, seeking solace within the village's welcoming embrace. As they poured in, the village burgeoned into a bustling community, growing in size and strength. But as the village expanded, so too did its ambitions. Adrian and his companions realized that together, they possessed the potential to reshape the world. They worked tirelessly, fostering unity, and pushing the boundaries of their collective abilities. Gradually, the village transformed into a kingdom, the Empire of Outcasts, standing tall as a testament to their shared resilience and indomitable spirit. Within an astonishingly short span of three years, the Empire's reach extended across vast territories, embracing half of the continent within its fold. The once-scorned outcasts now commanded a force feared by many, their strength born not of cruelty, but of empathy and the unyielding pursuit of justice. The Empire of Outcasts became a harmonious blend of cultures, each contributing their unique customs, arts, and philosophies. It became a beacon of hope, a land where outcasts found acceptance, and where hardships were turned into stepping stones towards greatness. Bridging neighboring continents, the Empire formed alliances based on mutual respect and understanding, crafting bonds stronger than iron and broader than the horizon. As the Empire grew in power, Adrian stood at its helm, transformed from an exiled outcast into an emblem of inspiration for the oppressed and marginalized. He never forgot his humble beginnings, forever dedicating himself to ensuring that the Empire maintained its compassionate core, and that its might was utilized for the betterment of all. The Empire of Outcasts had flourished not due to raw strength alone, but through the forging of a shared identity. It stood as an eternal reminder, etching a narrative of triumph over adversity, inspiring generations to challenge the status quo and breathe life into their own dreams. Thus, the Empire of Outcasts forever left an indelible mark on the annals of history, an enduring testament to the power of unity and the transformative potential of those society often deems unworthy."},{"instruction":"From village to kingdom to empire, Adrian's empire was considered an unstoppable force, an immovable object, and a trove of resources and riches. Education and health was at an all time high, respect amongst different cultures was the norm, hierarchies based on race or sex and even slavery were abolished. It's military was the strongest, both in numbers and technology. No wall, no barrage of arrows could defeat him. But today, Adrian was greeted by old faces. The villagers who had cast him out all those years ago. They sought his empire's aid, unknown to them that the young Adrian they had outcast was its founder and ruler. Adrian was conflicted, especially since after all these years, he has never forgiven them.","output":"As Adrian looked upon the familiar faces of those who had once cast him out, a whirlwind of emotions gripped his heart. Betrayal, resentment, and anger resurfaced, threatening to cloud his judgment. The wounds inflicted by their actions had never truly healed, etching a permanent scar upon his soul. Yet, despite the tempest raging within, Adrian couldn't help but notice the desperation etched upon their faces. Their village, once thriving, now faced an impending doom. Their crops withered, their children fell ill, and their spirits were broken. It was a stark reminder of the vulnerability that plagued humanity, irrespective of past transgressions. His advisors whispered words of caution, reminding him of the empire's unparalleled power and the risks of extending a hand to those who had once discarded him. They urged him to maintain his distance, to let karma run its course. But Adrian's heart, though scarred, still retained a flicker of compassion. Engulfed by conflicting emotions, Adrian summoned his closest confidants, seeking their counsel. Together, they deliberated on the course of action to take. The memory of his own pain and suffering mingled with the desire to rise above bitterness and forge a path of forgiveness and redemption. After much contemplation, Adrian made a decision that surprised even himself. He would grant the village his empire's aid. Not out of obligation or a desire for revenge, but as a testament to the transformative power of compassion and growth. It would be an opportunity for the villagers to witness the magnitude of the empire they had unknowingly sought help from. With cautious optimism, Adrian welcomed the villagers into his realm. He ensured that their needs, both immediate and long-term, were met. Experts were sent to help revive their dying crops, heal the sick, and rebuild their shattered infrastructure. It was an arduous task, but the empire's resources and knowledge proved invaluable in restoring the village's prosperity. As the days turned into weeks, the villagers marveled at the empire's grandeur. They admired the advancements in education, healthcare, and social equality that had flourished under Adrian's reign. It was an eye-opening experience, forcing them to confront their own prejudices and the consequences of their actions. Deep within Adrian's heart, the flames of bitterness began to flicker, gradually giving way to forgiveness and understanding. He realized that the villagers who had once cast him out were products of their own fears and limited perspectives. Their actions were not excusable, but they were born out of ignorance and a lack of compassion. Through their interactions, Adrian observed a transformation taking place within the villagers. They began to recognize the error of their ways, expressing remorse for the pain they had caused him. The seeds of empathy were sown, blossoming into a newfound appreciation for the value of every individual, regardless of their past. The village's redemption became a powerful symbol, reminding the empire's citizens that growth and forgiveness were the cornerstones of a prosperous society. Adrian's act of kindness served as a catalyst for change, inspiring others to question their own prejudices and embrace a more compassionate way of life. In time, the village's scars healed, and it flourished once more, albeit as an integral part of the empire they had once rejected. Adrian's forgiveness did not erase the past, but it forged a path towards healing and reconciliation. Within the empire, stories of their founder's act of compassion echoed through the generations, serving as a constant reminder of the power of forgiveness and the potential for growth. Adrian's transformation from a scorned outcast to a benevolent ruler was complete. The Empire of Outcasts had not only conquered lands and amassed wealth, but it had also conquered the demons within Adrian's heart, replacing the pain with forgiveness, and turning a chapter of anguish into a tale of redemption."},{"instruction":"eu tenho essa rota [HttpGet] public async Task<IActionResult> List([FromQuery(Name = \\"lista\\")] string entrada) { e tenho esse teste unitario [Fact] public async void GetConsultaHorarios_ComTipoEquipamentoInformado_DeveRetornarStatusCode200() { //Arrange string parametro = \\"1111,2222,3333\\"; string url = \\"/nana/v1/nana?nana?lista={parametro}\\"; HttpRequestMessage request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, url); request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(\\"Bearer\\", _jwt); //Act HttpResponseMessage response = await _client.SendAsync(request); var body = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); var token = JToken.Parse(body); //Assert Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.StatusCode); Assert.Single(token.SelectTokens(\\".data[*]\\")); } porem quando executo meu teste a variavel que deveria ser preenchida atraves do fromquery \\"entrada\\" vem vazia","output":"Provavelmente o problema ocorre porque você está configurando os parâmetros da consulta incorretamente na URL do teste unitário.

This snack consists of thinly sliced plantains that are either fried or baked until they become crispy and golden brown, paired with a creamy and flavorful avocado-based dipping sauce. Here is a general description of each component: **Plantain Chips:** - Plantains: Plantains resemble large bananas but are starchier and less sweet. They must be peeled, which can sometimes be a bit more difficult than peeling a banana. - Cooking Method: The plantain slices can be fried in oil until they take on a crispy texture and a golden color. Alternatively, for a healthier version, they can be baked with a light coating of oil until they become crisp. - Seasoning: After cooking, the chips may be seasoned with salt. Some variations might include other spices like garlic powder, cayenne pepper, or paprika for an extra kick of flavor. **Avocado Dip:** - Avocado: The main ingredient is ripe avocado, mashed until it's smooth or left a bit chunky, depending on preference. - Flavorings: Typical additions to the dip might include lime juice (to prevent browning and add a tangy flavor), cilantro, minced onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. In some cases, it might resemble guacamole. - Texture: The dip is usually creamy and can be made to various consistencies by adding ingredients like sour cream, yogurt, or mayonnaise for added creaminess and flavor. When eaten together, the savory, crunchy plantain chips complement the rich and creamy avocado dip, creating a delicious contrast of textures and flavors. This snack is often enjoyed as an appetizer, at parties, as a side dish, or simply as a tasty treat during the day. It can also be customized with additional ingredients and spices to suit individual tastes."},{"instruction":"Carrot and Zucchini Fritters","output":"Carrot and zucchini fritters are a delightful and nutritious dish that can serve as an appetizer, a side, or even a light main course. They are made by combining grated carrots and zucchini with various ingredients to form patties that are then pan-fried to achieve a crispy exterior and a tender interior. Here is a basic recipe and method for making carrot and zucchini fritters: **Ingredients:** - 1 medium zucchini - 2 medium carrots - 1-2 green onions, finely chopped - 2 cloves of garlic, minced - 1/4 cup all-purpose flour (gluten-free flour or another binder can be used for those with dietary restrictions) - 1-2 eggs, beaten (acts as a binder) - Salt and pepper, to taste - Optional: grated cheese, chopped fresh herbs (like parsley, dill, or basil), spices (like cumin or paprika), or a pinch of chili flakes for heat - Oil for frying (vegetable, canola, or olive oil) **Method:** 1. Start by washing and grating the zucchini and carrots using the coarse side of a box grater. 2. Place the grated vegetables in a clean kitchen towel or cheese cloth and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Excessive moisture will prevent the fritters from being crispy. 3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the squeezed vegetables, green onions, garlic, and any of the optional ingredients you've chosen (cheese, herbs, spices). 4. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Then, stir in the flour until everything is evenly combined. 5. Mix in the beaten eggs until the mixture is cohesive and can hold its shape. If the mixture is too wet, you can add a bit more flour. If it's too dry, you can add another egg or a little water. 6. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, form patties from the vegetable mixture using your hands or a spoon, and place them in the skillet. Don't overcrowd the skillet; work in batches if necessary. 7. Cook the fritters for about 3-4 minutes on each side until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside. 8. Transfer the cooked fritters to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. 9. Serve the fritters warm with a dollop of sour cream, yogurt, or any dip of your choice, like a garlic aioli or a tzatziki sauce. Carrot and zucchini fritters are versatile and can be customized with different herbs and spices to match various cuisines and preferences. They are a great way to incorporate vegetables into your diet and are particularly kid-friendly."},{"instruction":"Healing Soups and Broths","output":"Healing soups and broths are nourishing concoctions that are touted for their potential health benefits and are often used for comfort during colds, flu, or convalescence. These provide hydration, essential nutrients, and often include components believed to enhance immune function, improve digestion, and offer a therapeutic effect. Here are some examples of ingredients and types of soups and broths that are commonly regarded as healing: **Bone Broth:** - Made by simmering bones (chicken, beef, fish, etc.) for an extended period, often with vinegar to help extract minerals. - Rich in collagen, which may support joint health and skin elasticity. - Contains amino acids like glycine and glutamine that may aid digestion and gut health. **Chicken Soup:** - Often called \\"Jewish penicillin,\\" homemade chicken soup is a classic remedy for the common cold. - Typically includes chicken, broth, onions, garlic, carrots, celery, and sometimes noodles or rice. - The steam from the hot soup helps clear nasal passages, and the warm liquid can soothe a sore throat. **Miso Soup:** - A Japanese soup made with a stock called dashi, into which softened miso paste is mixed. - Contains fermented miso, which provides probiotics beneficial for gut health. - Can be enhanced with tofu, seaweed, and green onions, adding nutrients and flavor. **Ginger Soup:** - Incorporates fresh ginger, which is known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-nausea properties. - Often includes other vegetables and may be blended for a smooth texture. - May also feature ingredients like turmeric, known for its potential anti-inflammatory effects. **Vegetable Broth:** - Made by simmering vegetables such as carrots, onions, celery, garlic, and herbs. - Rich in vitamins and minerals from the vegetables. - Can be sipped on its own or used as a base for more substantial soups. **Turmeric Broth:** - Turmeric contains curcumin, a compound with anti-inflammatory properties. - Made with a base of either vegetable or bone broth, enhanced with turmeric and other spices like black pepper, which increases curcumin’s bioavailability. **Garlic Soup:** - Garlic has natural antimicrobial and immune-boosting properties. - A soup can be crafted by simmering garlic cloves in broth, then blending it to create a creamy consistency. - Additional healing spices may be added, such as thyme or cayenne pepper. When creating your healing soup or broth, consider not only the nutrient content but also the digestibility and comfort factor for the person consuming it. Soups and broths are easily digestible, can be kept low in fat, and can be adjusted in terms of texture and ingredients to suit dietary needs and preferences. While these soups and broths are indeed healthful and can provide comfort during illness, it's important to note that they are not a cure-all. Adequate rest, staying hydrated, and a balanced diet, along with necessary medical treatment, are paramount for recovery and maintaining health."},{"instruction":"Healing soups and broths can be particularly soothing and are a cornerstone of the AIP diet due to their gut-friendly properties and the easy digestibility.","output":"The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet is designed to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms associated with autoimmune disorders. It is a stricter version of the Paleo diet, eliminating foods that may trigger an immune response or irritate the gut lining. Healing soups and broths are indeed a cornerstone of the AIP diet for several reasons: 1. **Gut Health:** Healing broths, especially bone broth, are rich in amino acids like glycine and proline, as well as gelatin and collagen, which can help repair the gut lining. This is crucial as a compromised gut lining or \\"leaky gut\\" is thought to be a contributing factor to autoimmune reactions. 2. **Easy Digestibility:** Soups and broths are generally very easy to digest. This means that they provide nutrients without taxing the digestive system, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with compromised gut health or during times of increased inflammation or flare-ups. 3. **Nutrient Density:** These liquid meals are packed with vitamins and minerals derived from the vegetables, meats, and bones used in their preparation. This allows for a concentration of essential nutrients in a form that's easy for the body to absorb. 4. **Hydration:** Soups and broths help keep the body hydrated, which is vital for overall health and especially important when the body is under stress or during healing. 5. **Anti-inflammatory Properties:** Many recipes for healing soups and broths include ingredients with natural anti-inflammatory properties, such as turmeric, ginger, garlic, and herbs like parsley and thyme. 6. **Whole Food Ingredients:** The AIP diet focuses on whole, unprocessed foods, and soups and broths made from scratch fit this criterion perfectly. They do not contain the additives, preservatives, and stabilizers that are often found in store-bought versions. 7. **Exclusion of Trigger Foods:** Soups and broths can be easily customized to exclude common trigger foods like gluten, dairy, grains, nuts, seeds, and nightshades, all of which are avoided in the AIP diet. When preparing healing soups and broths while following the AIP diet, it's important to use ingredients that are compliant with the protocol. For instance, when making a bone broth, one should ensure that no disallowed spices are used, and when creating a vegetable soup, any nightshades like tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers should be excluded. AIP-friendly healing soup and broth recipes often start with a homemade bone broth or vegetable broth base and then include permitted vegetables and meats. Herbs and botanicals are added for additional flavor and health benefits. It's also crucial to avoid using any non-AIP compliant cooking oils or garnishes when preparing these dishes. Remember, the strict elimination phase of the AIP diet is usually not meant to be long-term and should be followed by careful re-introductions of foods to monitor for potential triggers in an individualized approach to managing autoimmune conditions."},{"instruction":"Bone Broth","output":"Bone broth is a nutrient-dense liquid made by simmering animal bones, often with marrow, connective tissues, and joint cartilages, for an extended period. This process extracts beneficial compounds and minerals from the bones into the broth. Bone broth can be made from the bones of chicken, beef, turkey, pork, lamb, fish, or virtually any other type of meat. **Key Components and Nutrients of Bone Broth:** - **Collagen and Gelatin:** These proteins are responsible for the jelly-like consistency of chilled bone broth. They're thought to support skin, hair, and nail health, as well as gut integrity and joint health. - **Amino Acids:** Glycine, proline, and glutamine are among the amino acids found in bone broth, which have various health-supportive properties, such as supporting the body's detoxification processes and gut health. - **Minerals:** Calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and other trace minerals are leached from the bones into the broth, which can contribute to overall mineral intake. - **Chondroitin Sulfates and Glucosamine:** Found in connective tissues and joint cartilage, these compounds may help support joint health. **How to Make Bone Broth:** 1. **Collect Bones:** Save bones from meals or buy them from a butcher. They can be raw or cooked, and even a mix of different types is fine. Including joints and knuckles can provide more gelatin. 2. **Roast Bones (Optional):** Roasting bones before making the broth can improve the broth's flavor. Place bones in a roasting pan and roast at around 400°F (200°C) until browned, usually 30-60 minutes. 3. **Prepare the Broth:** - Place the bones in a large pot or slow cooker. Delicate bones like fish can require a shorter cooking time, whereas denser beef bones can benefit from more extended simmering. - Add enough water to cover the bones. Some people like to add a splash of vinegar (such as apple cider vinegar) because it may help leach minerals from the bones. - Consider adding vegetables (like onions, carrots, and celery), herbs (such as parsley, thyme, oregano), and aromatics (like garlic) for additional flavor, but avoid ingredients that are high in starches or sugars. 4. **Simmer:** Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. For rich, gelatinous broth, cook for an extended period: - Beef bone broth: 24–48 hours. - Chicken bone broth: 12–24 hours. - Fish bone broth: 6–8 hours. 5. **Skim:** During the first few hours of simmering, you might need to occasionally skim off any impurities that rise to the surface. 6. **Strain:** After the broth has simmered for enough time, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the bones and any large pieces of vegetables or herbs. 7. **Cool:** Let the broth cool. If desired, you can remove the layer of fat that solidifies on the top after cooling, although some people prefer to leave it for the flavor and potential health benefits. 8. **Store:** Keep the broth in the refrigerator for up to a week, or freeze it in smaller portions for several months. Bone broth can be sipped on its own, seasoned with salt, or used as a base for soups, stews, sauces, and other dishes. It is known for its soothing properties and its role in various dietary approaches that focus on whole foods and gut health, including the Paleo and AIP diets. While there are many anecdotal claims about the health benefits of bone broth, it is generally recognized as a nourishing addition to a balanced diet."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:j},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},Y={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],z={key:0},H={key:1};function R(n,e,h,p,o,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",Y,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
