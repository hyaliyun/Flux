The primary pieces of information that support this conclusion are as follows: 1. Captain Zeppos is a Belgian children's television series, and Belgium is a country with multiple official languages. One of these languages is Dutch, which is primarily spoken in the Flanders region of Belgium. 2. The series originally aired with the Dutch title \\"Kapitein Zeppos,\\" implying that it was targeted at a Dutch-speaking audience. 3. The paragraph states that all episodes of Captain Zeppos have been released on DVD with Dutch subtitles and extras, indicating that the show's content was originally in Dutch or at least intended for Dutch-speaking viewers. 4. Senne Rouffaer, a Flemish actor, played the title role in the series. The term \\"Flemish\\" refers to the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, which suggests that Senne Rouffaer was likely a native Dutch speaker. Taking these pieces of information into account, it can be concluded that the hypothesis that Senne Rouffaer spoke Dutch is true.

Swept up by mountainous tsunami   waves at a Thai resort ( ), she could not hold on to both her young sons and survive . Fighting to stay above the waters , she had to choose which one would have to take his chances in the swirling torrent  . \\"I knew I had to let go of one of them and I just thought I'd better let go of the one that's the older,\\" she told Sky News television in a report broadcast on Thursday. She said she was accompanied by the two boys, Lachie, 5, and two-year-old Blake, and their father, Brad, who had watched the drama helplessly from their first-floor hotel room, when the waves struck. \\"And I was screaming, trying to find _ , and we thought he was dead,\\" she told reporters on arrival back in Australia. Lachie was found alive about 2 hours later clinging to a door and, looked uninjured as his mother spoke to reporters. British surfer   Martin Markwell is also a lucky man. He had always dreamed of catching that perfect wave -but when it finally came along, it was a nightmare. He was on his surfboard when he was swept up by a tsunami wave. \\"It was really terrible because I was surfing, I was really surfing on a wave I wasn't supposed to be on,\\" he said. \\"As an experienced surfer, when I saw the wave come I realized something was wrong, but I couldn't escape because my surfboard was tied to my ankle.\\" His wife Vicki and son Jake looked on in horror from a hotel balcony as he crashed towards the shore.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House.  The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.

News article: Obama's order no free ride for immigrants (Opinion) Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette is a CNN contributor and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. San Diego (CNN) -- President Obama's critics have the right to be upset by his decision to shield from deportation, at least temporarily, some groups of undocumented immigrants. But they don't have the right to twist the facts, use inflammatory language and create confusion. They're the ones who are most confused. They don't appear to have the foggiest idea how the process would work. That's their own fault. They should have paid closer attention two years ago, the last time the administration did something like this, with the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Simply put, Obama is using the executive power granted to him by the Constitution to reshuffle the immigration enforcement deck and prioritize deportations so that, for instance, the undocumented parents of U.S.-born citizens get a temporary \\"deferred\\" status and thus can't be removed for three years. But you should read the fine print. There are a lot of strings attached, and there is no guarantee that some of these people won't be deported. It's a crap shoot for undocumented immigrants, which explains why only a little over half of the young people who were eligible for DACA took the risk and applied for it, according to the Migration Policy Institute. No one can say what will happen when Obama's new deferment expires. A lot will depend on the political mood at the time, and what the new president will decide, in 2017, to do with immigrants who are holding these deferments. There could be extensions offered, or it could be the end of the road. If it's the latter, a large number of undocumented immigrants -- media reports have put the potential figure at 5 million, although the actual figure is likely to be much lower, given the response to DACA -- will be deportable once again. The administration has said that the new program -- which it is calling DAPA, Deferred Action for Parental Accountability -- would work much the same way as its predecessor, DACA. Obama announced that program in June 2012 and it took effect about six months later. Under DACA, undocumented young people brought here as children can apply for a two-year \\"deferred action\\" that lets them remain in the country temporarily without fear of being deported. Yet there is a catch -- when you deal with government, there's always a catch. I'll explain what it is in a minute. But first, let's listen to what has been coming from the sky-is-falling chorus in the Republican Party. Obama's conservative critics really do say the darnedest things. A recurring theme is that Obama is acting outside the law, rewriting the law or ignoring the law. When I asked one conservative commentator to explain, he said: \\"Well, there was a law on the books that said a person can't be in the country illegally? Now they can. Because Obama changed it.\\" Nonsense. He did no such thing. Obama merely applied to the enforcement of immigration laws something that all police, prosecutors and judges have: discretion. Now it turns out I have to explain this simple concept to Obama himself. This week, the President responded to hecklers at a speech in Chicago who were demanding that he ease up on deportations by insisting that he had just taken action to \\"change\\" the law. Meanwhile, law professors and other legal experts have come forward to say that Obama did not, in fact, change the law and that he has the Constitution on his side when it comes to using executive power. Conservative critics are wrong that he went so far as to \\"change\\" the law, and Obama was wrong to agree with them. Other critics went even further and suggested that Obama wasn't just changing the law but actually \\"canceling\\" it. More nonsense. No president can cancel a law, or repeal a law, or strike down a law. Only Congress can do that. But this brings us back to the \\"catch\\" in Obama's executive action. Those of us who have interviewed DACA recipients and studied how that program works will find it difficult to take seriously the concerns raised by critics who are unfamiliar with the subject matter. You see, while the administration hasn't yet released the procedures for applying for DAPA, White House officials have said that the new program will be modeled on DACA. This means that qualifying for this temporary reprieve from deportation won't be a walk in the park. Here's what happens under DACA: The first thing that an undocumented immigrant must do is contact the friendly neighborhood office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and declare that he or she is in the country illegally. Immigrants who do that are then subjected to background checks and fingerprinted. Files are created with their names on them, where the government will keep their home addresses, the names of their employers, if any, the names of everyone else who lives in their houses, etc. Then each application is considered by USCIS officials, and either approved or denied. If the application is approved, under DACA the immigrant could remain in the United States for three years -- unless the policy is rescinded by a future president. If it is denied, there is no appeal and the government has all of the immigrant's personal information. So much for staying in the shadows. So tell me again how Obama is \\"canceling\\" existing immigration law. If that is the case, then how it is that the whole process for obtaining deferred action for DACA -- and likely for DAPA too -- begins with undocumented immigrants, in essence, surrendering to authorities? If immigration law is really no longer in effect, why do these people have to bother turning themselves in at all, getting fingerprinted and all the rest? Also, if immigration law is really being repealed, then under what authority will immigration agents be deciding the fate of DAPA applicants? In fact, if the immigration law is canceled, wouldn't these agents be out of a job? After all, once you strike down a law, it's difficult to enforce it. You think all this makes for a sweet deal for the undocumented? Not exactly the free ride that Obama's critics think it is -- that is, if they were thinking at all.

They express that the United States and Britain are attempting to gain support from the United Nations for their plan to transfer authority to the Iraqi people. The primary distinction between the two lies in their structure and emphasis, but their overall intent is identical.  In the first sentence: \\"The United States and Britain are seeking backing at the United Nations for their agenda to hand over power to Iraqis,\\" the focus is on the actions of the United States and Britain, with the reference to the United Nations as the avenue for achieving their objective. This sentence emphasizes the efforts that the two countries are making to gain support and highlights that their goal is to transfer power. In the second sentence: \\"At the United Nations, the United States and Britain are seeking backing for their agenda to hand over power to Iraqis,\\" the United Nations is featured at the beginning, which shifts the emphasis towards the international nature of the situation and the fact that approval is sought within that context. The sentence still communicates that the United States and Britain are pursuing support, but the framework of the United Nations is foregrounded to a greater extent.

News article: Police say they're closer than ever to solving the mysterious disappearance of Sheila and Katherine Lyon, the young sisters who vanished almost 40 years ago from a suburban Washington, D.C., shopping center.      Lloyd Lee Welch, a 58-year-old convicted sex offender who authorities named as a person of interest last year, has implicated not only himself, but also an uncle and a cousin, according to newly released police documents.      Welch told detectives he saw his uncle sexually assault one of the girls the day after they were kidnapped, according to the documents. The documents also reveal investigators have been searching for the girls' bodies in rural southwest Virginia, where Welch's family owns property.      \\"Lloyd Welch has admitted he left Wheaton Plaza in a vehicle with the Lyon sisters on the day they disappeared,\\" police say in the documents.      Sheila Lyon, 12, and her 10-year-old sister, Katherine, were last seen inside Wheaton Plaza, a popular shopping center in the Maryland suburbs, on March 25, 1975. The girls were on spring break from school and reportedly went to look at Easter exhibits. They had about 4 between them. They had been told by their parents, prominent radio disc jockey John Lyon and his wife Mary, to return home by 4 p.m., according to a March 25, 1980, article in The Washington Post.      Around 2 p.m. that day, the girls were spotted by witnesses at a pizza shop. What happened after that has remained a painful mystery.      Lloyd Welch, according to police, said he was with the girls that day in a car with his uncle, Richard Welch Sr., now 69, and a cousin, Thomas Welch Jr., who was 10 in 1975. Lloyd Welch told investigators he was dropped off near his home and his uncle and cousin drove off with the girls, according to the documents.      \\"Lloyd Welch stated that the following day he went to the home of Richard Welch and observed Richard Welch having sexual intercourse with one of the Lyon sisters,\\" the court documents allege. \\"Lloyd Welch claims that he left the residence and never saw the Lyon sisters again.\\"      Lloyd Welch told police he had nothing to do with \\"killing those girls.\\" Richard Welch has declined to comment to reporters. His daughter told The Washington Post the allegations are a lie and \\"my dad would never do something like that.\\"      No one has been charged in the case.      Lloyd Welch told police he doesn't know where the sisters are buried, the documents say. A search warrant alleges Lloyd Welch told a fellow inmate in Delaware, where Welch is serving time for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl, that he had kidnapped the Lyon sisters and buried them on family property in Virginia.

Share this slide:      Montgomery County Police Department      Lloyd Welch was 18 in 1975, a drifter and carnival worker who had spent time in the Maryland suburbs and was known to investigators working the Lyon sisters' case, according to The Washington Post. A fresh look at the cold case file in recent years renewed interest in him.      The release of the court documents come four months after Maryland's Montgomery County Police Department named Richard Welch Sr. a \\"person of interest\\" in the girls' disappearance, joining Lloyd Welch with that distinction. At the time, Assistant Chief Russ Hamill said \\"investigative efforts\\" had led to the interest in Richard Welch Sr.      Hamill also revealed that authorities had been searching in Bedford County, Virginia, where the Welch family owns property -- about 200 miles from Wheaton Plaza.      \\"We're looking for evidence and gathering information that may indicate a connection [between this area] and the girls' disappearance,\\" Montgomery County Police Lt. Sonia Pruitt told The Huffington Post in September.      The newly released court documents indicate authorities located a graveyard during one of their searches. Of the more than two dozen graves in it, only one was marked with a headstone, police said.      A search warrant affidavit states police seized \\"various bones\\" during their September search efforts. Authorities also say additional evidence was found in January, but they haven't released details.      \\"We are unable to provide additional information or comment on the content of the recently unsealed search warrants as this is still an ongoing and active investigation,\\" said in a Friday press release.      The commonwealth attorney in Bedford County, Randy Krantz, told TV station WDBJ on Monday that he is confident authorities are close to solving the case.      \\"We believe the investigation has significantly progressed since we started,\\" Krantz said. \\"Our commitment to solving this case is stronger than ever.\\"      Anyone with information is asked to call investigators at 1-800-CALL-FBI.

Lloyd Lee Welch Timeline      Earlier on HuffPost: ||||| In January, an FBI forensic team searched land in the Taylors Mountain area of Virginia for evidence in the 40-year-old case of Sheila and Katherine Lyon. Investigators returned to the area this week for another dig. (Photo by Nikki Arrington)      Investigators trying to solve the case of Sheila and Katherine Lyon — two Montgomery County girls who went missing from a shopping mall in 1975 — are conducting another dig this week in the Taylors Mountain area in central Virginia.      Investigators have searched the area off and on since September. Of particular interest in the case are 34 acres once owned by relatives of Lloyd Welch, a Delaware prison inmate who earlier was named a “person of interest” in the case. Detectives have spoken with Welch, who told them he left the Wheaton Plaza shopping mall with the two girls, 12 and 10 years old at the time, according to court papers that detectives have filed in the case.      The search is being conducted by investigators from the Montgomery County Police Department, Bedford County Sheriff’s Office and Virginia State Police.      In a statement Monday, the Bedford Sheriff’s Office said, “The investigation has developed additional leads through supplemental investigative interviews that have found cause to conduct an additional dig on the mountain.”      A representative from the Virginia Department of Forensic Science also is on the scene, according to the Bedford Sheriff’s Office.      News of the new search was reported on Sunday by WDBJ-7 TV in Roanoke, Va.      Wednesday of this week marks the 40th anniversary of the case. It was March 25, 1975, that the Lyon sisters went missing. ||||| Forensic investigators from the FBI are spending the first part of this week digging up specific locations on a rural Virginia mountain, the latest sign of progress in the nearly 40-year-old investigation of two young girls who disappeared after walking to a Montgomery County shopping mall in 1975.      The forensic team is searching land on Taylor Mountain, in Bedford County, about 200 miles southwest of Washington. Detectives earlier identified two “persons of interest” in the case whose family once owned the land that is being searched. Neither man has been charged.      “The team is here to process certain locations on the mountain that have become a location of interest,” Bedford County Sheriff Mike Brown said Monday.      Under a leading theory of the case, the girls were abducted in Montgomery, killed and buried on Taylor Mountain. If any human remains or clues are found this week, they will be sent to the Virginia Department of Forensic Science for analysis, Brown said.      Investigators already have “familial DNA” to make a comparison, which could take at least four weeks, the sheriff added.      An FBI forensics team is on the site of a Virginia mountain where investigators are searching for the remains of the Lyon sisters, who went missing from a Maryland mall in 1975. (Reuters)      The FBI forensic team has 12 members. They have been joined by detectives from Bedford County, the Virginia State Police and the Montgomery County Police Department. All have pledged to find an answer for the girls’ parents, who still live in Montgomery.      Investigators “will be as tenacious as humanly possible,” Brown said, “with the target of locating these children, and providing the parents closure in this nightmare that no parent should be forced to endure.”      The investigators on Monday had to battle cold, wet weather. “It’s miserable up on the mountain,” Brown said.      They are expected to search again on Tuesday. They also searched the area, off of Taylor Mountain Road, in the fall.      It was March of 1975 when Sheila and Katherine Lyon, ages 12 and 10, disappeared after walking to the Wheaton Plaza mall. Decades passed with few developments.      Last year, Montgomery police said they were investigating Lloyd Welch, a former carnival worker who was at the shopping center that day and later assaulted girls in South Carolina and Delaware. He is locked up in Delaware.      Officials later said their interest extended to Welch’s uncle, Richard Welch, who is believed to have worked as a security guard in the Wheaton area in the 1970s.      Welch family members have owned land on Taylor Mountain, which is being searched.      Neither Richard Welch nor Lloyd Welch has been charged in the Lyon sisters case. Authorities have declined to say what role either might have had in the disappearance or to detail what evidence they have gathered.      In December, in Bedford, Richard Welch’s wife, Patricia Welch, appeared before a grand jury investigating the case. She was then charged with perjury because she willingly spoke falsely “regarding a material matter while under oath,” according to a copy of her warrant. Patricia Welch is due in court next month, according to online court records. Authorities did not detail the allegation.      In a letter to The Washington Post, Lloyd Welch denied any involvement in the sisters’ disappearance. And when a Post reporter knocked at the Hyattsville, Md., address listed for Richard and Patricia Welch, a woman opened a window and declined to comment.      On Monday, Randy Krantz, the commonwealth attorney in Bedford County, appealed to help from the public. The community of Taylor Mountain “did not ask for this,” he said. “This was brought to them. And the overwhelming support that we have had has helped further this investigation. But we need more.”      He said that by bringing forth information, “you’re not just helping law enforcement do its job, you’re helping a mother and father have some peace.”      Officials ask anyone with information about the case to call Montgomery investigators at 240-773-5070 or Bedford investigators at 540-586-7827. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Police are closer to solving the mysterious disappearance of the Lyon sisters, Sheila and Katherine, who vanished almost 40 years ago from a suburban Washington, D.C., shopping center.

The Old Dessauer with part of his 20,000,--aided by Boy Dietrich (KNABE, \\"Knave Dietrich,\\" as one might fondly call him) and the Moravian Meal-wagons,--accomplished his Troppau-Jablunka Problem perfectly well; cleaning the Mountains, and keeping them clean, of that Pandour rabble, as he was the man to do. Nor would his Expedition require mentioning farther,--were it not for some slight passages of a purely Biographical character; first of all, for certain rubs which befell between his Majesty and him. For example, once, before that Interview at Chrudim, just on entering Bohemia thitherward, Old Leopold had seen good to alter his march-route; and--on better information, as he thought it, which proved to be worse--had taken a road not prescribed to him. Hearing of which, Friedrich reins him up into the right course, in this sharp manner:--  \\"CHRUDIM, 21st APRIL. I am greatly surprised that your Serenity, as an old Officer, does not more accurately follow my orders which I give you.

But the old Son of Gunpowder stood taciturn, rigorous, in military business attitude, in the King's presence; had not forgotten the passage; and indeed he kept it in mind for long months after. And during all this Ober-Schlesien time, had the hidden grudge in his heart;--doing his day's work with scrupulous punctuality; all the more scrupulous, they say.

Objective-C was chosen as the prime language for Apple's development framework due to its object-oriented nature and compatibility with the C language, while also incorporating Smalltalk's messaging system. This allows for the fast and efficient execution of code and handling of complex computational tasks. The reason for adopting Objective-C and incorporating elements of Smalltalk is rooted in Apple's history. When NeXT Computer was founded by Steve Jobs in 1985, after his departure from Apple, NeXT licensed the Objective-C language for use in their NeXTSTEP operating system. NeXTSTEP was an innovative object-oriented operating system with a powerful and easy-to-use graphical interface. When Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, the technologies developed at NeXT, including Objective-C and NeXTSTEP, were incorporated into the development of macOS (then called Mac OS X) and the associated development frameworks like Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. With Apple's support and advancements in macOS and iOS development, Objective-C and its Smalltalk-derived features proved to be advantageous in creating cutting-edge applications for both desktop and mobile platforms. The language continued to evolve and mature under Apple's guidance, enabling developers to create powerful, efficient, and maintainable software. In 2014, Apple introduced Swift, a modern programming language that built upon the lessons learned from Objective-C. Swift is designed to be more expressive, safe, and fast, while also being easier to use by developers. Although Swift has since become the primary language for Apple's ecosystem, Objective-C remains an important and relevant language, especially for maintaining and updating legacy applications.\\" Therefore, it's more accurate to say that Apple saw value in the combination of C and Smalltalk-style messaging, which led to the widespread adoption and continued usage of Objective-C in their operating systems and development frameworks. It is not only about knowing more Smalltalk, but also about using its best features to create a better, more efficient programming language."},{"instruction":"Title: Better Homes & Gardens Complete Step By Step Cookbook Review: This is an excellent cookbook for beginners.

Is it true that can a gas mix into a liquid explain based on the following text? In industrial process engineering, mixing is a unit operation that involves manipulation of a heterogeneous physical system with the intent to make it more homogeneous. Familiar examples include pumping of the water in a swimming pool to homogenize the water temperature, and the stirring of pancake batter to eliminate lumps (deagglomeration). Mixing is performed to allow heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams, components or phases. Modern industrial processing almost always involves some form of mixing. Some classes of chemical reactors are also mixers. With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas. A biofuel fermenter may require the mixing of microbes, gases and liquid medium for optimal yield; organic nitration requires concentrated (liquid) nitric and sulfuric acids to be mixed with a hydrophobic organic phase; production of pharmaceutical tablets requires blending of solid powders. The opposite of mixing is segregation. A classical example of segregation is the brazil nut effect. Possible answers:  (a). no;  (b). yes;","output":"Based on the text, the correct answer is: (b). yes Explanation: The text states that \\"With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas.\\" This statement implies that a gas can be mixed into a liquid under the appropriate conditions and with the right equipment.

Possible A: mountain, flat land, pool, valley, flat ground  Why is \\"mountain\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"The term \\"mountain\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense when referring to a type of hill because, fundamentally, both mountains and hills share similarities in their formation and characteristics. Although mountains are generally taller and steeper than hills, they both involve elevated landforms with natural geographic features. Understanding the relationship between mountains and hills and why they are considered interconnected landforms requires an analysis of their defining qualities, origins, way they are classified, and their ecological contributions. Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge the common features shared by hills and mountains. Both are elevated landforms that rise prominently above their surrounding areas, creating a distinguishable landscape. They are typically defined by their topography, which consists of slopes, peaks, and valleys. Additionally, they both experience various types of erosion, which contribute to their constantly changing shapes and sizes. The formation of mountains and hills can be attributed to similar geological processes, such as tectonic plate movements, volcanic activity, and erosion. When two tectonic plates collide, immense pressure is exerted on the Earth's surface, leading to the creation of hills or mountains (the latter generally formed when the pressure is greater). In other cases, magma solidifies beneath the Earth's surface before erosion reveals the formation, leading to the characterization of the elevated structure as a hill or mountain. Hills and mountains are also both subject to erosional processes, mainly by wind and water, which ultimately modify their appearance over time. Furthermore, classification systems developed by geographers and geologists often distinguish between hills and mountains based on height, slope, and prominence, among other factors. While definitions can vary, a general consensus holds that a mountain is taller and steeper than a hill. For example, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) considers a landform to be a mountain if it stands more than 1,000 feet (305 meters) above the surrounding terrain, while the United Kingdom follows a similar definition but with a height threshold of around 2,000 feet (610 meters). Despite these distinctions, hills and mountains sometimes overlap in classification, further illustrating their interconnectedness. Lastly, mountains and hills have vital ecological functions, acting as biodiversity hotspots and playing significant roles in the water cycle. They both serve as habitats for various plant and animal species that can adapt to the unique environmental conditions these landforms offer. Moreover, their elevated structures affect the Earth's climate by intercepting air masses and causing precipitation on windward slopes. The rivers and streams originating in these upland areas provide vital water resources for various ecosystems and human populations. In conclusion, the term \\"mountain\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense when considering a type of hill because they share fundamental similarities in their origin and formation processes, contribute to ecological functions, and are often classified within the same systems based on height, slope, and prominence. While mountains are typically taller and steeper than hills, their interconnected nature as elevated landforms arising from similar geologic events and processes makes \\"mountain\\" a fitting response when discussing a type of hill."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which boy will start developing muscles later?  Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested. The tests reveal that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, but that is to be expected given their age difference.  Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. The answer to this question is:","output":"Jimothy Step 1: Understand the paragraph - It talks about Jimothy and Dwight, who are brothers, and their testosterone levels. It also explains that growth, including muscle development, is controlled by testosterone. Step 2: Identify key information - Jimothy is a freshman, Dwight is a junior, and Dwight has more testosterone than Jimothy. Step 3: Consider the hint provided - During puberty, rapid growth occurs first, and muscle development takes place toward the end of the growth spurt. Muscles may continue to develop even after the height growth is finished. Step 4: Relate the information to the question - The question is asking which boy will start developing muscles later. Step 5: Draw conclusion - Since Jimothy is younger than Dwight (a freshman in high school vs. a junior) and has less testosterone, it's likely that he will start developing muscles later than Dwight, who is already at a more advanced stage of puberty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"It seemed to stiffen slightly and become more thoughtful, but there was no disappointment.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"It did not seem to be disappointed but it did stiffen slightly.\\" is true?","output":"In order to determine whether the hypothesis \\"It did not seem to be disappointed but it did stiffen slightly.\\" is true based on the given premise, we must first analyze the premise and its components, evaluate any relevant implications, and then compare those implications to the hypothesis statement. First, let us break down the premise, \\"It seemed to stiffen slightly and become more thoughtful, but there was no disappointment.\\" There are two main components to this statement: 1. It seemed to stiffen slightly and become more thoughtful. 2. There was no disappointment. By examining these two components, we can deduce several implications. Implication 1: There is a change happening, which is evidenced by the stiffening (even if slight) and the increasing thoughtfulness. This indicates that there is some sort of reaction taking place, potentially in response to an event or situation. Implication 2: The lack of disappointment implies that either the entity did not have any expectations or that its expectations have been met. This suggests that the reaction is likely not driven by feelings of disappointment or failure. Now, let us examine the hypothesis: \\"It did not seem to be disappointed but it did stiffen slightly.\\" Based on our analysis of the premise and its implications, we can see that the hypothesis aligns well with the information provided. The assertion that the entity did not seem to be disappointed is supported by the clear statement from the premise, \\"but there was no disappointment.\\" Additionally, the hypothesis correctly identifies the slight stiffening as a component of the entity's reaction. However, it is important to note that the hypothesis omits the \\"becoming more thoughtful\\" aspect of the reaction, which was mentioned in the premise. It focuses only on the physical reaction (the stiffening) and not on the psychological one (becoming more thoughtful). While this omission does not necessarily make the hypothesis false, it does make it incomplete in capturing the entirety of the premise. To improve the hypothesis, it could be rephrased to include both the stiffening and the increasing thoughtfulness: \\"It did not seem to be disappointed. It stiffened slightly and became more thoughtful.\\" In conclusion, based on the premise \\"It seemed to stiffen slightly and become more thoughtful, but there was no disappointment,\\" we can affirm that the hypothesis \\"It did not seem to be disappointed but it did stiffen slightly.\\" is true. However, the hypothesis provides an incomplete representation of the premise's content, as it omits the component of becoming more thoughtful. By adding this aspect into the hypothesis, we can achieve a more comprehensive alignment between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A thug who attacked a bus passenger with a claw hammer in broad daylight then told the driver ‘sorry about that, drive’ has been jailed for three years after the sickening CCTV footage of the incident was played to a judge. Russell Edwards, 42, boarded the bus without paying before climbing the stairs and using the hammer to batter a helpless teenager in the head. He demanded the 17-year-old victim hand over his cash and mobile phone as other terrified passengers tried to flee the vehicle. Scroll down for video. Brutal: Russell Edwards, clearly brandishing the claw hammer in this CCTV footage, cornered his terrified victim on the top level of the bus. Edwards took just £18 and the teenager’s mobile phone before telling him not to return to that area of Bristol again. The. thug then coolly walked down the stairs and left the bus - apologising. to the stunned driver for the disturbance. The terrifying attack was. caught on CCTV. Edwards, who. has previous convictions for ABH and affray, pleaded guilty to robbery. and possession of an offensive weapon at Bristol Crown Court. He wept in the dock as Recorder Mr Nicholas Atkinson QC jailed him yesterday for three years. Recordrtold. Edwards: ‘I am afraid this incident was pre-planned to an extent. because you went in pursuit of this young man and chose to arm yourself. with a claw hammer. Threat: Edwards approaches his unsuspecting 17-year-old victim who was sitting on his own on the top deck of the bus. Attack: The chilling moment thug Edward attacked a bus passenger with a claw hammer in broad daylight was played to the court before he was sentenced to three years in jail. Cowering: The 42-year-old father of one made his victim hand over £18 and his mobile phone during the frightening attack. ‘You went on to the upper deck of the bus where other passengers were and attacked a man half your age. ‘This incident was aggravated because it was during the day and on public transport.’ The court was told how Edwards boarded the number 76 First Bus near his home in Hartcliffe, Bristol, at 1pm on February 6. Edwards climbed to the upper deck of the bus before approaching the teenager, whom he believed had stolen from him. Chilling CCTV footage played to the court shows him cornering the teenager before striking him with the handle as he holds out his hand demanding cash. Chilling: Edwards coolly walks away after the brutal attacked which left his teenage victim crouched in fear at the back of the bus. 'Sorry': The composed thug apologised to the driver, telling him 'sorry about that, drive', after he attacked and robbed a passenger. He is then seen striking the victim twice with his left and once with the head of the hammer to the head. Prosecuting, John Penny told the court: ‘There were other passengers at the front of the top deck who left when they saw what was happening. ‘The defendant demanded money and then hit the teenager in the face with the wooden hammer to re-enforce the demand. ‘He handed over around £18 and then the defendant demanded his phone. He refused and the defendant patted him down and took it. ‘As he left the bus he also said ‘Sorry about that drive’.’ Defending, Simon Burns told the court Edwards, who has a 12-year-old son, believed the teenager may have stolen from him and was enraged.

Four hundred cyber-warriors from 16 countries last week responded to a scenario in which computer networks came under attack from another state's hackers. The scenario was based around the idea of \\"hybrid conflicts\\", just below the level of war, in which one state both carries out espionage and disrupts the communications and operations of another, tied in with other activities. The countries portrayed in the scenario were fictional, but it is hard to interpret this as anything other than thinking about Russia, which is seen as having pioneered hybrid conflict in Ukraine and, before that, Georgia. The exercise itself was taking place in Estonia, which was subject to its own cyber-attack. But the ability to carry out significant - even destructive  - cyber-attacks is spreading rapidly: all part of a cyber-arms race accelerating rapidly not just between Nato and Russia but also beyond into other states and even non-state actors. Just before Christmas, Sony Pictures got hacked. The intrusion was attributed by the US to North Korea and linked to the release of the studio's film The Interview, in which North Korea's leader was featured as being killed. The cyber-attack did not only expose embarrassing corporate secrets but also wiped company computers, rendering them as useful as a brick. Computer espionage has been happening for years, but the destructive element was another sign that states are increasingly willing to deploy malware that does real physical damage and to link their cyber-attacks to physical threats (in this case against cinemas showing the film). In North Korea's case, cyber-weapons are a vital part of the country's arsenal. \\"Cyber-hacking is a crucial part of their asymmetric military capabilities. They have been pursuing it for such a long time with unbelievable levels of concentration, support and investment,\\" says Kim Heung Kwang, a former computer science professor in North Korea who left for the South. \\"That's how they have been able to foster this in such a lopsided shape compared to everything else in the country.\\" He says a military unit that had 500 personnel when it started in 1998 has now grown to more than 3,000. This kind of wiper attack, which renders computers unusable, was first seen on a large scale in 2012, when staff at the oil company Saudi Aramco tried to switch on their computers. US officials believed this attack was, like the Sony hack, state-sponsored, in Saudi Aramco's case by Iran. But, if so, it was almost certainly simply a response to attacks on Iran itself - including most famously the Stuxnet virus, which damaged Iranian centrifuges over an extended period and is widely believed to have been the joint work of the US and Israel. Stuxnet was first detected in June 2010 by a security firm based in Belarus, but may have been circulating since 2009. Unlike most viruses, the worm targets systems that are traditionally not connected to the internet for security reasons. Instead it infects Windows machines via USB keys - commonly used to move files around - infected with malware. Once it has infected a machine on a firm's internal network, it seeks out a specific configuration of industrial control software made by Siemens. Once hijacked, the code can reprogram so-called PLC (programmable logic control) software to give attached industrial machinery new instructions. What surprised cyber-experts is the speed with which cyber-attack capabilities are now proliferating. No-one was surprised that the first tier of cyber-states - the US, UK, China, Israel and Russia - were capable of carrying out destructive attacks on infrastructure, but the speed with which others - such as Iran - were able to do the same has caused consternation and is a sign of how far cyber-attack can be a force-equaliser between different nations who might otherwise have wildly different capabilities. Capabilities are also spreading to non-state actors. Criminals have long used ransomware to extort money from people or else see their computers locked. But terrorist groups may also now be toying with more than just low-level disruptive attacks that deface or take off-line websites. France's TV5 Monde saw the real-world effects of a cyber-attack when it was taken off air by people who claimed to belong to the \\"cyber-caliphate\\" affiliated to the group calling itself Islamic State. There are fears the use of destructive attacks against industrial control systems - like Stuxnet - could also spread. At a recent Cyber Security Challenge, Dr Kevin Jones, from Airbus, showed me how a model city connected up to the internet could have its power switched off remotely. \\"Unless we put a security architecture in place, this is very possible,\\" he says. A German government report said a steel mill had been damaged by a cyber-attack last year - the perpetrators were unknown. Dr Jones believes the attackers got in through the regular corporate infrastructure, although it is not clear how far they deliberately targeted the control systems for the blast furnace that was damaged. When it comes to the cyber-arms race, are Western countries still in the lead? Some argue the top end of cyber-espionage tools may well still be in the hands of the US. The security firm Kaspersky Labs, for instance, recently revealed the work of hackers they called the Equation Group, who were highly sophisticated. \\"The Equation Group are masters of cloaking and hiding,\\" says Costin Raiu, director of the Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Labs, pointing to the ability of the group to get inside the firmware of machines and then launch highly advanced attacks. \\"This is insanely complicated to be honest,\\" he says. Kaspersky Labs will not directly point the finger, but the widespread assumption is that the Equation Group is linked to America's National Security Agency (there are links with the codes used in Stuxnet as well). Documents released by the American whistle-blower Edward Snowden have also raised the profile of Britain's cyber-activities. \\"GCHQ has formidable resources,\\" says Eric King, of the group Privacy International, whose concern lies in the lack of a transparent framework of accountability over offensive hacking. \\"In the last year and a half, we've seen their malware. The depth of the work and where they are going is very formidable.\\" He says: \\"We have non-existent policies, practices, legal safeguards to oversee this.\\" (GCHQ always maintains its activities are lawful and subject to oversight). Another concern is the way in which such some of these cyber-espionage capabilities are now commercially available and being used by more authoritarian states. \\"Companies are providing surveillance as a consultancy service,\\" says Mr King, who adds foreign law enforcement and intelligence agencies can then use the bought services to hack dissidents and activists based in the UK. The capabilities may be spreading to more and more actors but a small handful of states still operate at the highest level. One senior Western intelligence official believes the Russians are already ahead of the US and UK - partly because of the level of resources, mainly people - they throw at finding and exploiting vulnerabilities. That official, of course, may be bluffing, but they also said they did not think it would be long before the Chinese had also not just caught up but moved ahead. Summary:","output":"Cyber-warriors from 16 countries participated in an exercise responding to a state-sponsored computer network attack, highlighting the rapidly spreading abilities to carry out significant cyber-attacks in an ongoing cyber-arms race among NATO, Russia, and other states and non-state actors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - You inhale - The air enters the mouth and nose - The diaphragm contracts - Air fills all the sacks in the lungs - Oxygen passes through the sacks into capillaries - The blood is passed to the blood in the capillaries - The blood carries the oxygen to the heart - The heart pumps the oxygenated blood to the body.  Question: suppose more deforestation occurs happens, how will it affect less air filling the lungs.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"Deforestation can lead to a decrease in the overall quality of air and a reduction in the available oxygen. The less oxygen available, the harder it can be for a person to breathe in adequate amounts of air. In this scenario, the deforestation might have a \\"less\\" effect on air filling the lungs, as it could lead to a reduction in oxygen supply. This would mean that the process of inhalation and air entering through the mouth and nose could become more difficult and strained. Consequently, the overall efficiency of the respiratory system may be reduced, as the level of oxygen entering the lungs would be lower than in an environment with adequate oxygen. Furthermore, the reduced amount of available oxygen means that the second effect mentioned - the diaphragm contracting and the air filling the sacs in the lungs - could be impacted negatively. With less air filling the sacs, there may be a diminished capacity for oxygen to pass through the sacs into the capillaries, thus limiting the amount of oxygen-rich blood that can be carried to the heart and circulated throughout the body. This could lead to a variety of health issues in the long run due to insufficient oxygen reaching vital organs and tissues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

One of the few truly \\"independent\\" films produced in the last ten years, no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution. The independent company Kino Films, gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited run with virtually no promotion, and the majority of major film critics didn't even bother reviewing it. I guess a movie based on a one act, one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in today's market - and it's the intelligent film-lover's loss. For the record, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved Ocsar nominations (as did the cinematographer) but the film received such little fanfare that I can't even blame the academy on that one. This is a film that is challenging, thought-provoking, and heartbreaking, and it actually requires the audience to meet it on it's own terms. Taking that into consideration, it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment. Director John Berry wisely does not attempt to dress-up Athol Fugard's play. Sure, we're given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots, but the film version of BOESMAN AND LENA remains, on the whole, a story of two people living in inhumane conditions. Stripped of their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one left to attack but each other. A third character joins them for awhile (Willie Jonah, amazing in a largely silent role), but the film's focus never strays from the title characters and what they've become. Bassett and Glover give brave performances as the broken couple, performances that simply could not be improved upon. Vigorously and brutally stimulating, both intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN AND LENA deserves to be rediscovered of home video. Hands down, the best film of the year 2000. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is highly positive and praiseful. The reviewer admires the film, Boesman and Lena, for its thought-provoking and heartbreaking portrayal of the apartheid's effect on its two main characters.

U.S. lawmakers grilled Trump administration officials Tuesday about the war in Afghanistan, saying the new White House strategy was inconsistent and was not producing results. The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy. After Sullivan and a top Pentagon official told the lawmakers that the U.S. was in fact still open to negotiations with the Taliban, lawmakers pressed for more details. \\"You can see that the world and those involved in the peace process may be pretty confused about what the U.S. position is. What is it?\\" asked Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Sullivan said he thought Trump was expressing a reaction to last month's terrorist attacks, and was pointing out that \\"significant elements of the Taliban are not prepared to negotiate.\\" \\"And it may take a long time before they are willing to negotiate,\\" he added.

Answer the following question: Where would a person go if he or she wants to get a good view? - hill - building - family - water cooler - space shuttle  The best answer is Answer:","output":"If a person wants to get a good view, they have several options depending on the kind of view they are looking for, the accessibility of the location, and the level of adventure they are seeking. Here's a breakdown to help them make an informed decision: 1. Hill: A person could go up a hill to get an excellent view of the surrounding landscape. Hilltops often offer panoramic vistas of the nearby scenery, which may include forests, meadows, rivers, or city skylines. Being outdoors on a hill often offers a sense of serenity and a connection with nature. The hike to the top of a hill can range from easy to challenging, making it an excellent option for people with varying levels of physical abilities. 2. Building: For those who prefer an urban setting, going to the top of a tall building can provide a breathtaking view of the city skyline. Observation decks on skyscrapers or other tall structures often offer a unique perspective on the city below, featuring landmarks, parks, and intricate city grids. This option is particularly appealing for those who enjoy a combination of architecture and an expansive cityscape. 3. Family: Although this option might not seem like an obvious choice for seeking a good view, spending time with family can offer a different kind of view – an emotional connection and a sense of belonging. Gatherings with loved ones, whether at a park, a beach, or a family home, allow for a shared experience and memorable moments to cherish. 4. Water Cooler: For a more casual and work-related setting, a water cooler might provide an opportunity for brief moments of relaxation and conversation with colleagues, allowing one to hear interesting stories, share experiences, and gain new perspectives on work and life. 5. Space Shuttle: If a person is seeking a truly extraordinary and unique view, going on a space shuttle would undoubtedly offer an unrivaled experience. Seeing the Earth from outer space provides a breathtaking and awe-inspiring perspective on our planet and the vastness of the cosmos. This option, though not readily available to the general public, would certainly be the most adventurous and unforgettable experience. Based on these options, the best answer is subjective and depends on what the person values most in a view. If they seek a connection with nature and a moderately challenging adventure, a hill might be their best choice. For an urban vista, a tall building would be ideal. If emotional connection and a sense of belonging are what's most important, spending time with family would be the best choice. For a more laid-back and casual setting, a water cooler could be their pick. And if they desire a truly otherworldly experience, a space shuttle would be the ultimate option – although access to this experience might be quite limited. Ultimately, the best view is the one that brings the most enjoyment and satisfaction to the individual based on their personal preferences and interests."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In an exclusive interview, Anderson criticized the CIA for being seduced by the jihadist killer and for putting the blame on Jennifer Matthews. He argued that his wife had been unfairly singled out in the aftermath of the attack and that the report had failed to acknowledge the systemic issues within the intelligence agency that had contributed to the tragedy. In his interview, Anderson recounted the dedication and unwavering commitment Jennifer had shown throughout her career as a CIA operative. He contended that, although she had volunteered for the mission in Afghanistan to fight al-Qaeda, the responsibility for the security breach and the failure to prevent the attack did not rest solely on her shoulders. Instead, he pointed to the wider intelligence community and the flaws in their intelligence collection and vetting processes. Anderson further emphasized that Jennifer's role within the organization demanded a comprehensive understanding of the jihadist threat and that, ultimately, she was working towards the same goal as her colleagues: neutralizing al-Qaeda and ensuring the safety of the United States and its allies. He argued that it was an injustice to attribute the fault for the deadly attack to a single individual who had given so much in the service of her country. In his attempt to shed light on the broader issues within the CIA and to clear his wife's name, Gary Anderson has not only called for a more in-depth analysis of the circumstances surrounding the Khost bombing but has also implored the American public to consider the complexity of intelligence gathering and the undeniable challenges faced by those working on the frontlines of national defense. His plea not only sheds new light on the investigation into the tragic event but also serves to remind us that behind every tragedy lies a story of individual sacrifice and unyielding devotion to the safety and security of their country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The concept of a gap year may not be new, but the recent surge   of interest certainly is.  Some students are putting off admissions. Others, who don't get into the college of their choice, are taking a year to explore new frontiers before reapplying. Students are choosing to take a breather; they are thinking. They are not sure what they are going to do. They are going and exploring some of their interests. They are getting experience they can take to the school they finally go to. It is an idea actively encouraged by colleges. Princeton University has just launched a \\"bridge year\\" program that will send 10 percent of its incoming class to do volunteer work abroad, starting in 2009. And the Harvard has spent the last 30 years urging incoming students to take a gap year. \\"Many speak of their year away as a 'life-changing' experience or a 'turning point'\\" says Harvard admissions director Marlin Lewis. \\"Many come to college with new opinions about their academic plans, their extracurricular interests and the career possibilities they observed in their year away.\\" Question: A student won't   _   in a gap year.

Article: It's 4 am, and Danilo C. Dequina is already awake. Holding a flashlight and a bucket, he is walking in the pre-dawn darkness along the shore of Old Poblacion Beach in the town of Maitum, Sarangani, in the far south of the Philippines. A few minutes later, he spots a patch of sand that appears to have been disturbed by a turtle. Dequina studies the area carefully, figuring out where the eggs have been buried, and then starts digging slowly. After clearing away several centimeters of sand, he uncovers a large group of eggs, roughly the size of ping-pong balls. He picks them up and puts them in the bucket. Dequina carries the eggs to his hatchery  , some 50 meters away from the seashore. The hatchery is really just a sandy patch of land under the coconut trees enclosed by a black fence. It is here that he buries the turtle eggs he has collected. Today, Dequina scoops a hole, puts the eggs in it, and covers them with sand. After 45 to 70 days, the eggs will hatch. Dequina will then carry the hatchlings to the shore, and release them into the sea. He admits to feeling sorrow as he sets the hatchlings free -- most are hunted down by natural predators, and just one percent survive to adulthood. According to the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), eight species of sea turtles face extinction, including four that come to the shores of Sarangani to lay their eggs -- the Hawksbill, Olive Ridley, Loggerhead and Green Turtles. After learning about their plight  , Dequina attended a DENR training session on turtle conservation and decided to take action. He helped the local government to set up the Pawikan Nesting Sanctuary next to his house in 2003. The hatchery drew the attention of the locals. \\"They started to change their attitudes towards sea turtles,\\" 52-year-old Dequina says. \\"If they see turtle eggs, they will either bring them to me or inform me of the nesting places.\\" Over the past ten years, more than 3,000 hatchlings have been released to the ocean.

However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain.  - Isalo National Park is a National Park in the Ihorombe Region of Madagascar . The park is known for its wide variety of terrain , including sandstone formations , deep canyons , palm - lined oases , and grassland . The closest town is Ranohira , and the closest cities are Toliara and Ihosy .  - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.  - A biodiversity hotspot is a biogeographic region with significant levels of biodiversity that is under threat from humans. Norman Myers wrote about the concept in two articles in The Environmentalist (1988), & 1990 revised after thorough analysis by Myers and others in Hotspots: Earths Biologically Richest and Most Endangered Terrestrial Ecoregions and a paper published in the journal \\"Nature\\"  - Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses (Poaceae), however sedge (Cyperaceae) and rush (Juncaceae) families can also be found. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica. Grasslands are found in most ecoregions of the Earth. For example, there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications (subdivisions) of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (ecosystem), which is one of eight terrestrial ecozones of the Earth's surface.  - Sandstone (sometimes known as arenite) is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized minerals or rock grains.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia.

Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Ihosy is a city (commune urbaine) with 16990 inhabitants (2004) in Ihorombe Region in central south Madagascar.   - Shrubland, scrubland, scrub or brush is a plant community characterised by vegetation dominated by shrubs, often also including grasses, herbs, and geophytes. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire. A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing. Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term \\"shrubland\\" was first coined in 1903.  - The Cyperaceae are a family of monocotyledonous graminoid flowering plants known as sedges, which superficially resemble grasses and rushes. The family is large, with some 5,500 known species described in about 90 genera, the largest being the \\"Carex\\" genus of \\"true sedges\\" with over 2,000 species. These species are widely distributed, with the centers of diversity for the group occurring in tropical Asia and tropical South America. While sedges may be found growing in almost all environments, many are associated with wetlands, or with poor soils. Ecological communities dominated by sedges are known as sedgelands.  - Arenite (Latin \\"Arena\\", sand) is a sedimentary clastic rock with sand grain size between 0.0625 mm (0.00246 in) and 2 mm (0.08 in) and contain less than 15% matrix. The related adjective is \\"arenaceous\\". The equivalent Greek-derived term is psammite, though this is more commonly used for metamorphosed sediments.  - Poaceae or Gramineae is a large and nearly ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses. Poaceae includes the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and cultivated lawns (turf) and pasture. Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks. The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath. With ca 780 genera and around 12,000 species, Poaceae are the fifth-largest , following the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.  - Ihorombe is a region in Madagascar. It borders Haute Matsiatra region in north, Atsimo-Atsinanana in east, Anosy in south and Atsimo-Andrefana in west. The capital is Ihosy and the population was estimated to be 312,307 in 2013.

As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries.  - The World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) is one of six commissions of the IUCN (World Conservation Union). WCPA is the world's premier network of protected area expertise. It is administered by IUCN's Global Protected Areas Programme and has over 2,400 members, spanning 140 countries.  - Atsimo-Andrefana is a region of Madagascar. It borders Menabe in north, Amoron'i Mania and Haute Matsiatra in northeast, Ihorombe and Anosy in east and Androy in southeast. The capital is Toliara and the population was estimated to be 1,316,756 in 2013. Atsimo Andrefana is geographically the largest of all Malagasy regions with an area of .  - A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas.  - The Malagasy Republic was a state situated in Southeast Africa.

The area is .  - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.

Birds do what by laying eggs? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. air  B. pick berries  C. sky  D. breathe  E. reproduce Answer:","output":"Answer: E. reproduce Birds reproduce by laying eggs. Birds are oviparous animals, which means that their offspring develop from fertilized eggs outside of the mother's body. This method of reproduction is distinct from mammals, who mostly give live birth and whose offspring develop within the mother's body. The process begins with the female bird's ovary, which contains hundreds or thousands of tiny ova (eggs). When it is time to reproduce, one or more eggs is fertilized by sperm from a male bird. Once fertilization occurs and eggs are formed, they are coated with a protective shell, which is mostly composed of calcium carbonate. The female bird then lays these eggs in a nest, a carefully built structure that ensures the safety and comfort of the developing embryos. Once the eggs are laid, they must be incubated to provide the appropriate warmth and humidity for successful hatching. In many bird species, it is the female that primarily incubates the eggs, while in others, both parents take turns or the male performs incubation duties. During incubation, which can last anywhere from 10 days to several months, depending on the species, the embryos inside the eggs develop and grow. The period of development is known as the \\"gestation period.\\" Eventually, the young birds, or chicks, hatch from their eggs, emerging as fully formed, albeit very small and often helpless or partially dependent offspring. Parents then invest time and effort in raising their offspring and teaching them essential skills for survival. This mode of reproduction is advantageous to birds for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, eggs are well-protected and provide a safe environment for the developing embryos, allowing mothers to continue their daily activities, such as finding food, without worrying about the safety of their offspring. Moreover, laying eggs allows for the production of multiple offspring at once, increasing the odds of survival for their young. The incubation period also helps to ensure the proper development of chicks, allowing them to emerge more physically developed and capable of surviving in the wild. In conclusion, birds reproduce by laying eggs, a method that has evolved to fit their unique needs and lifestyle. This reproductive strategy allows them the flexibility to proliferate while continuing to care for existing offspring and maintaining their daily habits for survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Domestic geese are much larger than their wild counterparts and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, and one of the attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and can be used as a guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Process:  - Coal is mined out of the ground - Coal is pulverized into fine powder - The coal is mixed with hot air - The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler - The coal and hot air burn over a fire - Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler - The water turns into steam - The steam presses against turbines - The turbines spin - Electricity is produced.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose coal become cheaper happens, how will it affect LESS heat for the house.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned states that if coal becomes cheaper, it would lead to less heat for the house. To understand the potential direct or indirect effect of this hypothesis on the process described, we need to analyze each step and the overall result of the process. The process detailed consists of the following steps: 1. Coal is mined out of the ground. 2. Coal is pulverized into fine powder. 3. The coal is mixed with hot air. 4. The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler. 5. The coal and hot air burn over a fire. 6. Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler. 7. The water turns into steam. 8. The steam presses against turbines. 9. The turbines spin. 10. Electricity is produced. By breaking down the process into individual steps, we can assess the potential impact of the perturbation hypothesis. If coal becomes cheaper, more people may choose to use it as an energy source. This increased demand for coal could potentially lead to higher production levels at coal mines, resulting in a greater availability of coal. This increase in coal supply may in turn affect steps 2 through 5 in the process, as coal is pulverized, mixed with hot air, and burned over a fire in a boiler. However, the triggered perturbation is about \\"less heat for the house\\". This could be interpreted in two ways: less heat being generated or less heat being used to heat a building. In the context of this process that generates electricity, we can assume the hypothesis implies that less heat may be used to produce electricity. Even with coal becoming cheaper, the amount of heat generated by burning coal (Step 5) will not necessarily decrease. The calorific value of coal remains consistent whether the price of coal rises or falls. Therefore, the process of burning coal and generating heat remains constant, regardless of the perturbation hypothesis. Now, if we consider any indirect effects of the perturbation hypothesis, we could argue that cheaper coal might affect the efficiency of power plants using it as an energy source, which could potentially result in changes in regulations, technologies, or processes to improve efficiency. But this would still not lead to \\"less heat for the house\\" as stated in the hypothesis. Overall, the perturbation hypothesis of coal becoming cheaper leading to less heat for the house does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process described for producing electricity from coal. The process would remain consistent, and the production of electricity through the burning of coal, generating steam, and spinning turbines would still be in effect, regardless of the price fluctuation of coal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Practice letting it swing at your side.\\"","output":"Title: Mastering the Art of Tomahawk Throwing: Techniques, Tips, and Tricks Introduction Tomahawk throwing is an ancient art that has not only been used for centuries as a means of hunting and survival but has also evolved into a popular sport and recreational activity. This versatile tool, often associated with Native American tribes, can be a fun and challenging pursuit for enthusiasts of all ages and skill levels. In this article, we will go through the fundamental steps and techniques to get started in tomahawk throwing, including the ready stance, proper grip, and essential tips for a smooth and accurate throw. Step 1: The Ready Stance To promote maximum accuracy, stability, and safety, adopting the correct ready stance plays a crucial role. Achieving this optimal posture involves the following steps: 1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with your dominant foot slightly ahead to ensure balance and support for your body. 2. Align your shoulders and hips parallel to your target, keeping your body nice and straight for optimal control and focus. 3. Bend your knees slightly to create a slight spring-like effect, which will help transfer energy to the throw. 4. Stay relaxed and keep your weight evenly distributed between both feet to prevent overcompensation during the throw. Step 2: Holding the Tomahawk Correctly A firm and secure grip is essential for safely controlling the tomahawk during the throw. The following guidelines can help you get a grip on this vital aspect of the process: 1. Hold the tomahawk with your dominant hand, utilizing a handshake-style grip. Your thumb should lie on one side of the handle while your other four fingers wrap around the other side. 2. Place your grip at the end of the handle, leaving about an inch or so below your palm to maximize leverage and control. 3. Do not squeeze the handle too tightly, as an overly tense grip can affect accuracy. Instead, maintain a firm, yet relaxed grip that allows for a natural release during the throw. Step 3: Keeping the Tomahawk Straight and Aligned Proper alignment of the tomahawk is essential for an accurate and consistent throw. Keep these points in mind: 1. Ensure that the blade remains perpendicular to the ground throughout the throwing motion. Maintaining this orientation will result in a smooth, parallel rotation during flight, increasing the chances of a successful stick. 2. Align the tomahawk with your target by extending your non-dominant arm and pointing at the target with your index finger. This will help you visualize the flight path. 3. As you draw the tomahawk back for the throw, keep it parallel to your dominant side, maintaining a straight alignment to ensure the blade remains oriented correctly during the release. Step 4: Practicing the Swing and Release Many factors come into play during the tomahawk's swing and release, including timing, coordination, and focus. Practice the following techniques to hone your skills: 1. As you begin your swing, move your dominant arm in a smooth, circular motion, ensuring the tomahawk remains straight and aligned with your target. 2. During the forward swing, shift your weight from your rear foot to your front foot, utilizing the power of your legs and core in tandem with your arm. 3. Keep your eye on the target as you release the tomahawk. This unwavering focus will allow you to make necessary adjustments as you practice and analyze your throws. 4. Release the tomahawk when your arm is fully extended forward, parallel to the ground. Maintain a smooth release by allowing the tomahawk to slip naturally from your grip - trying to force the release too suddenly may impair the spin and accuracy of the throw. Conclusion Patience, perseverance, and attention to vital techniques like the ready stance, proper grip, and effective release will set you on the path to tomahawk throwing mastery. Paying close attention to these fundamentals will not only ensure safety but also enhance your skills, making for an enjoyable and rewarding experience. With practice and dedication, you'll be hitting your targets with precision and confidence."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

No. Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"when the seasons change from the summer to the fall, what decreases?\\" is \\"rainfall\\", given that  when the seasons change from the summer to the fall , the amount of light from the Sun will decrease? A:","output":"Based on the given information, I would say the right answer to the question \\"when the seasons change from the summer to the fall, what decreases?\\" is not \\"rainfall\\" but rather \\"the amount of light from the Sun.\\" This is because as the Earth's axial tilt changes during its orbit around the Sun, the amount of daylight hours decreases, leading to shorter days and less sunlight during the fall compared to summer. To elaborate, when the season changes from summer to fall, the Earth's tilt causes the angle at which sunlight hits the Earth to become less direct, which leads to less intense sunlight and a reduction in the amount of daylight hours. This decrease in sunlight typically results in cooler temperatures and a shift in the overall climate. As for rainfall, there can be variations in precipitation patterns between summer and fall depending on the location, so it is not accurate to assume that rainfall universally decreases during this seasonal change. Some regions may experience increased rainfall during the fall, while others may see a decrease or relatively stable amounts. In summary, the decrease in the amount of sunlight received by the Earth is a more fitting answer to the question, as it is a general consequence of the seasonal change from summer to fall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There, you and your colleagues wait for a man to arrive from the capital, perhaps a thousand miles away, with a suitcase of cash. Few countries are as corrupt as Congo . Mobutu Sese Seko, a former strongman, used state funds to _ a Concorde to take him on shopping trips to Paris. By the time of his overthrow in 1997, graft was endemic. Government employees were not paid but rather expected to use their positions to make a living. Among the most prized government jobs was that of accountant: the people responsible for transporting bags of cash to the provinces to hand out to employees. In 2012, however, the Congolese government started helping civil servants to open bank accounts. Around three-quarters of them--some 670,000 people--now have one. In the process, the government has weeded out tens of thousands of ghost employees, since the embezzlers who invented them could not open accounts in their names without a matching ID. Yet in a vast country with fewer roads than Luxembourg, hardly anyone lives anywhere near a bank branch. So Congolese banks must now do the work the government accountants used to: shipping money to the remote area. Cash has to be transported to branches in regional capitals, and thence to account-holders on the backs of motorbikes, in canoes or by foot. Bank staff with suitcases of cash make easy targets, just as they did in the west of America in the 19th century. Though they usually travel with armed policemen, there have been at least ten armed robberies of bank employees since January. At the moment banks are little more than money-transfer companies, and not very sophisticated ones at that. The transfers tend to go only one way--out of Kinshasa--so cannot be netted against each other; instead cash almost always has to be moved physically.

Summarize this article: PORTLAND, Oregon (KPTV) — Portland city leaders are considering a plan to build tiny houses for homeless people to help get them off the streets.      The tiny houses would be about 200 square feet and look a lot like the ones at The Caravan Tiny House Hotel in northeast Portland.      Brad Gibson and Karen Timmerman lived on the streets for five years before they found an affordable apartment. But if city leaders get their way, homeless people will have a faster and better option — micro communities.      Michael Withey, who represents Micro Community Concepts, pitched the idea to Portland City Council.      The houses would be built on surplus city lands, and residents would pay rent between 250 and 350 per month. Withey said the project is self-sustaining.      “Half the rents we collect from these homes will go into a fund to fund the next microcommunity that will help the next set of people that need help,” he said.      The tiny homes, however, would need a tiny bit of startup cash – probably in the neighborhood of 1 million. Mayor Charlie Hales’ team said they don’t yet know where it would come from.      “Whether it’s city money, state money or federal money, we’re going to try and get creative and figure out all the places where we can bring money into this to try different kinds of pilots for different kinds of housing needs,” said Josh Alpert, strategic initiatives director.      Gibson and Timmerman fully support the tiny homes as an intermediate step to stability, but they also said it won’t replace emergency homeless camps because “people on the street do need a place to go.”      The concept is still in the very early stages, and the city has formed a task force to examine it. They’ll meet for the first time in two weeks. ||||| With an estimated 2,000 of its residents sleeping under bridges, on streets and in empty lots in a variety of makeshift shelters, the city of Portland, Oregon, is on a quest to provide more safe housing for those without a permanent address. Thinking beyond typical dorm-style shelters, it has launched a task force that will meet September 4th \\"to assess the viability of using tiny homes as a potential for housing houseless people,\\" says Josh Alpert, Director of Strategic Initiatives for Mayor Charlie Hales. Alpert hopes the first batch of homes will be ready for occupancy by late February 2015.      The mayor's office began looking into the idea of micro homes in June after housing advocate Michael Withey presented an idea to the city council based on designs by architecture firm TechDwell. Alpert says he envisions a pilot program in which up to ten structures are erected on four separate city-owned lots. The idea is to establish the micro communities in various neighborhoods \\"so that no one area is feeling overburdened,\\" Alpert adds.      TechDwell      The tiny houses will be selected through a request-for-proposals process and will hinge on two key factors: cost and the ability to meet city and county building codes. Tim Cornell of TechDwell, who has already met with Alpert to discuss his prototype, says he can deliver micro homes that sleep two people and have bathrooms and kitchens built-in for 20,000 each. His FlexDwell prototype (shown at right) measures 16 feet wide and 12 feet deep and features a sloped ceiling that is 12-ft. high in front. Made of prefab materials available at Home Depot and Lowe's, it includes two sleeping pods joined by a kitchen, bathroom and eating area. To save space, the bathroom shares a sink with the kitchen. \\"We could have them built on-site in 45 days\\" after an order is placed, Cornell says.      Because the tiny houses offer dwellers more privacy than big shelters, they may appeal to people who are reluctant to give up the sense of independence that comes from living on the street. The micro homes could also be cheaper than temporary emergency shelters, which cost up to 16,000 a year and lack plumbing.      \\"If there is a potential to get even one person off the streets, it's worth trying,\\" says Alpert. \\"Simply having a roof over their head may enable them to springboard into finding a job.\\" |||||","output":"The city leaders in Portland, Oregon are thinking about building tiny little houses for people who don't have homes, similar to the ones at The Caravan Tiny House Hotel in the same city. Each tiny house would be around the size of your bedroom and living room combined.  The idea was suggested by a gentleman named Michael Withey, who believes that these tiny houses would help people who don't have homes find a safe space to live. These houses would be built on land that the city is not using and the people living in them would pay a small amount of rent.  The money collected from rent would then be used to build more tiny house communities to help others who need it. But to start, they need about 1 million dollars, and they aren't sure yet where they will get that money from.  People who used to live on the streets but now have a home fully support this idea, noting that it won't replace emergency shelters for homeless people, but can be a good step toward finding a stable place to live. The idea is still new, and a team of people from the city will meet to talk about it and figure out how to make it happen. They hope to have the first tiny houses ready by February 2015. The small size of these tiny houses could make them feel more private and comfortable than larger homeless shelters. And they could also be less expensive to run than temporary shelters that cost up to 16,000 a year and don't have plumbing like bathrooms.  The hope is that having a safe and private little house might make it easier for some people to find a job, turning their life around. If it helps even one person find stability, the city leaders believe it's worth trying."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who told Bernhard Cossmann to \\"listen to the instrumentation\\" and claimed it was his own? is inside the article: While Raff was able to offer \\"practical suggestions [in orchestration] which were of great value to Liszt\\", there may have been \\"a basic misunderstanding\\" of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions., can you guess it ? A:","output":"The name of the person who told Bernhard Cossmann to \\"listen to the instrumentation\\" and claimed it was his own is Joachim Raff.

When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\",  answer the following question.

After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland.

Q: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf.

He's trying to understand the mystery behind the voice on the CD that they're listening to. His father insists it can't be Glenn Miller because the recording was made three days after Miller was reported deceased. Yet, he also remarks that whoever it is playing the trombone on the recording made the same mistakes Glenn Miller did in his versions of the songs. It's an unexpected and intriguing situation that leaves the narrator unsure of what to make of it. He's dealing with conflicting information - his father's assertion that the recording they are listening to can't be Glenn Miller but the musical evidence suggesting it could be. It's a puzzle he doesn't have an immediate solution for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The question appears to involve two separate concepts: the process of muscle contraction and the germination of spores. To understand the potential impact of more spores germinating on muscles contracting less intensely, we need to first discuss the process briefly and determine how spores may or may not play a role in this process. The process of muscle contraction can be broken down into several steps: 1. Electrical signals in the brain travel through nerves to muscles: When the brain sends a signal to contract a muscle, it creates an electrical impulse that travels along the nerves and reaches the intended muscle. 2. Two types of proteins exist in filaments in the muscles: Actin and myosin are the primary proteins found in muscle filaments. These filaments are responsible for muscle contraction. 3. The filaments move when the brain instructs them to: As the electrical signal from the brain reaches the muscle, the actin and myosin filaments slide past one another, which is known as the sliding filament theory. This action causes the muscle to shorten and contract. 4. The motion of the filaments causes the muscle to shorten and contract: This shortening and contracting of the muscle results in movement or resistance to movement. 5. Opposing pairs of muscles exist to provide the necessary range of motion: Every muscle has an opposing muscle, and they work together to generate movement. For example, the bicep and tricep muscles in the arm work in opposition to flex and extend the arm, respectively. Now, let's consider the role of spores and their germination. Spores are reproductive structures produced by certain plants, fungi, and bacteria. Germination is the process by which a spore begins to develop into a new organism.  The germination of spores is not directly linked to the process of muscle contraction explained above. There is no known mechanism by which germinating spores could directly affect the electrical signals, the proteins in muscle filaments, the motion of filaments, or the pairs of opposing muscles that govern muscle contractions. Given this information, the supposed perturbation involving more spores germinating and its impact on muscles contracting less intensely would be \\"not impacting any step of the process.\\" While spores and their germination are essential for the life cycles of various organisms, they do not play a direct or indirect role in the process of muscle contraction and intensity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Protists are the simplest eukaryotes.   Q: What group includes the simplest eukaryotes, including most single-celled eukaryotes?   A: A:","output":"The group that includes the simplest eukaryotes, encompassing most single-celled eukaryotes, is protists.  Protists are a diverse group of organisms that belong to the domain Eukarya, which also includes animals, plants, and fungi. Eukaryotic cells are characterized by having a well-defined nucleus housing their genetic material, in contrast to prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), which lack a nucleus. Although there is considerable diversity among protists, they share the common attribute of being eukaryotes and, in general, are simpler in structure and function than plants, animals, and fungi. Protists can be found in various environments, including aquatic systems, soil, and even inside other organisms as symbionts or pathogens. They exhibit a wide range of characteristics in terms of size, shape, and mode of nutrition. Many protists are single-celled, but some form colonies or are multicellular. Some protists are autotrophic, meaning they can generate their own food through photosynthesis, while others are heterotrophic, requiring them to consume external sources of carbon and energy. The classification of protists has evolved over time due to advancements in molecular techniques, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetics. Traditionally, protists were thought of as a single kingdom, but now it is understood that they belong to multiple distinct lineages within Eukarya, which have been classified into various phyla, classes, and other taxonomic ranks. Some well-known examples of protists include: 1. Amoebas: Unicellular, heterotrophic organisms capable of changing their shape as they move and engulf food particles. 2. Euglenoids: Unicellular, mostly autotrophic organisms that contain chloroplasts for photosynthesis, but can also be heterotrophic under certain conditions. 3. Dinoflagellates: Unicellular, mostly autotrophic organisms responsible for bioluminescence and harmful algal blooms in marine and freshwater environments. 4. Diatoms: Unicellular, autotrophic organisms with silica-based cell walls, significant contributors to aquatic primary production and forming the base of various food chains. 5. Ciliates: Unicellular, heterotrophic organisms covered in hair-like structures called cilia, which they use for locomotion and feeding. 6. Plasmodium: Unicellular, parasitic organisms responsible for causing malaria in humans. In conclusion, protists are the group that includes the simplest eukaryotes, encompassing most single-celled eukaryotes. These organisms display remarkable diversity in terms of morphology, physiology, and ecological function, contributing significantly to the overall biodiversity on our planet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: HAGERSTOWN, Md.—George Washington may have slept in your town, but Maryland’s Washington County has a more compelling link to the father of our country: It was the first U.S. county to be named after him.      Or so they say.      Washington County, Ga., makes the same claim, as does Washington County, Pa. Ditto Washington County, Tenn. In... ||||| WASHINGTON COUNTY      COMBINING HISTORY WITH NATURE, INDUSTRY & BUSINESS      Washington County, the first county in our nation to be named after General George Washington, was formed in 1784. It became the 9th county in Georgia. The Creek Indians had ceded the vast, unsettled territory the previous year. Revolutionary War soldiers came to Washington County after receiving land grants from the General Assembly.      When formed, the county was located in the territory between the Ogeechee and Oconee Rivers. To the north, Washington County extended to present day Franklin County and its southern boundary was the Altamaha River. Over time, ten other counties were carved from the original county. Today, Washington County contains 684 square miles and is still one of the largest counties in Georgia. The northern part is known as the Red Hills, referring to the red dirt in this area of the county. In the south, the land is characterized by rolling hills and gullies. The Oconee River still bounds the county to the west and the Ogeechee River forms most of the eastern boundary.      The first settlements were in the northern part of the county in and around Warthen. Many of the early settlers were of Scotch-Irish descent arriving mainly from North Carolina. A smaller number of settlers came from Virginia. Others migrated from other Georgia counties including Burke, Wilkes and Effingham. These settlers were in search of fertile land, timber, a milder climate, and new beginnings. By 1787, the population in Washington County had grown to 4,552.      With the arrival of more settlers the population quickly swelled. During this agrarian era, Washington County farmers raised a variety of crops. When the cotton gin was invented in 1793, cotton was on its way to becoming the major crop in the county.      In 1796, Sandersville, originally Saunders Crossroads, was named by the Georgia Legislature as the county seat of Washington County. It was situated at the crossing of two Indian Trails. Today, Sandersville is the largest town in Washington County.      Among the first structures built was a hand hewn log jail which still can be visited in Warthen. It once housed Aaron Burr, the notorious third Vice President of the United States. In 1804, Burr was housed there overnight while in route to Richmond, Virginia to stand charges of treason following his famous duel with Alexander Hamilton.      In the northern part of the county, deposits of clays suitable for making stoneware attracted communities of potters. Potters introduced their goods that served the cooking and storage needs of early settlers. In some cases the pottery served as grave markers. Examples of their work can still be seen at the Brown House Museum in Sandersville, an ante-bellum house better known as William T. Sherman’s headquarters during his Civil War stay in Washington County.                  During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the agrarian economy of Washington County also supported potters, cobblers, tailors, blacksmiths, gunsmiths, general store merchants, and carpenters. A water-driven sawmill, a woolen mill, cotton gins, and grist mills played a vital role in the early economic growth of Washington County. The rivers in the county were navigable, allowing barges to transport goods from the coast of Georgia up to the Fall Line where the Piedmont Plateau gives way to the Coastal Plain. At this point, the rivers become narrower and rocky thus many early Georgia settlements were located along this geologic area. Timber was also transported on these rivers.      The nineteenth century was a progressive era for the county. By early 1816, a stagecoach line ran between Milledgeville and Savannah through Washington County. A railroad provided a faster and less expensive means of transporting crops. This provided new opportunities for business establishments. Wealth increased as businesses and industries expanded and also the demand for services and merchandise grew due to increased population in the area.      Washington County flourished with the continued establishment of additional schools, churches, post offices, a courthouse, and a newspaper. Agriculture continued and when the price of cotton plummeted, the farmers turned to the agricultural discovery of soy beans. These were planted as an additional crop to boost economics. Crops of corn, wheat and grain, cotton, and soy beans grew well and continue to be cultivated today. The majority of the field workers were slaves and most of the county’s planters and other business and industry owners had one or more, depending on their wealth. Regrettably, slavery was an accepted way of life during this era of Washington County’s history.      By the mid-nineteenth century many of the citizens of the county were enjoying prosperity. Even with the unsettled country heading toward war. Crops were good, businesses and industries flourished and it was quoted that the stories of the North “starving us out” was “a crazy idea.” It would not be long before the county and her citizens would feel the ravishes of war.      THE CIVIL WAR      It is believed that Washington County furnished more soldiers to the Confederacy than any other county in Georgia. Fifteen military companies were organized here.      On November 16, 1864 General William T. Sherman left Atlanta, Georgia on his famous “March to the Sea”. His army was grouped into two wings, Left and Right. One wing approached Washington County from Milledgeville, the other from Irwinton. Over 62,000 Union Soldiers converged in Washington County. Sherman and his army met their first resistance just inside the county at Buffalo Creek, near present day Deepstep, Georgia an act which enraged the general. The army also found resistance when the Confederate troops defended the crossing at the Oconee River (Balls Ferry and the Oconee River Railroad Bridge.) Sherman’s army destroyed the railroad track and any building connected to the Central of Georgia Railroad.      The army arrived in Sandersville on the morning of November 26, 1864. The night before, C.S. General Joe Wheeler’s cavalry had galloped into Sandersville. The next morning, Wheeler’s cavalry briefly skirmished with the Union troops as they approached town before saddling up and heading out in the opposite direction. The Union army camped overnight in Sandersville on November 26, 1864. Sherman used the Brown House as his Union headquarters. He slept in the house, ate a meal with the family and left town. As he left, Sherman’s army burned the courthouse and any other building which was felt to be any support to the South’s war efforts. The Courthouse in Sandersville was one of the few Courthouses burned during the March to the Sea campaign.      Six months later in May of 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his escort party crossed through Washington County. He was attempting to escape to reach Texas and safety in an effort to continue the Confederate cause. His wife and her party left a few days prior to President Davis. It is believed that the last official act of the Confederacy was carried out in Washington County.      Washington County is the only place where both the “March to the Sea” and the “Escape of Jefferson Davis” cross.      After the Civil War the county’s outlook was bleak, but, according to From Cotton to Kaolin “there was a sustaining faith that prosperity would return. With the combined leadership of the county’s representatives and her citizens, the period of reconstruction began. The roads were impassable; widows, orphans and the disabled needed immediate assistance. The need for public education and the rebuilding of the courthouse were assessed as immediate needs. However, with southern determination and will power the leaders of the county led the citizens in the rebuilding of their town, homes and lives”.      FROM RECONSTRUCTION TO “THE MAN WHO MADE ARMIES MARCH”      The citizen rebuilt the Courthouse by 1869. This new building burned again and the current structure was completed in 1899. This historic structure of High Victorian style still stands in downtown Sandersville today.      Stable cotton prices from about 1890 to about 1920 brought prosperity to Washington County. However, in 1915 the boll weevil entered Georgia and with it, cotton production plummeted.      During WWI, eight of its citizen fell in battle. During WWII over 1,400 of its citizens served in the armed forces and unfortunately again another 45 did not return home. Monuments honoring these Washington County’s servicemen as well as those killed in the Korean War and Vietnam War can be seen on the lawn next to the Courthouse. Another monument at the Courthouse honors Washington County native Willie Duckworth who created the official United States Army chant “Sound Off”. Mr. Duckworth is known as “The Man Who Made Armies March”.      THE KAOLIN CAPITAL OF THE WORLD      Fortunately for Washington County a new industry emerged just as cotton was declining. Mining for kaolin, a white clay used in hundreds of productsincluding paper, paint, plastics, ceramics, food and medicines, began in Middle Georgia in the early 1900s.      The origin of kaolin can be traced to the Cretaceous geologic period, about 70 million years ago when dinosaurs roamed the earth and much of the southern half of Georgia was covered by a great sea. During that period the climate was more tropical than now. The seacoast stretched across Georgia from Columbus to Macon to Augusta along a line that we now call the “Fall Line. About 50-56 million years ago the weathering of the rocks of the Piedmont generated large volumes of kaolinitic clays, quartz sand and mica, as well as minor amounts of other minerals, especially iron and titanium oxides, such as limonite and anastase. Feldspar, a major component of granitic rocks such as those at Stone Mountain near Atlanta, is considered the parent material for most of Georgia’s sedimentary kaolin.      50-65 million years ago washed into rivers and streams, the weathered clays and sands of the Piedmont were transported and deposited in swamps, marshes and lagoons near and along the coastline of the ancient sea. Iron and titanium oxides were often deposited along with the kaolin, contaminating and making much of the kaolin unusable for commercial applications.      Changes in the sea level interrupted the sequence of erosion, transportation and deposition of kaolin from the Piedmont, but the process continued for some 30 to 35 million years. The last invasion of the land by the great sea deposited huge amounts of red and brown sands and clays over the kaolin deposits. These later sediments formed the characteristic red hills of Middle Georgia. The commercially mineable kaolin deposits are found in a relatively narrow “belt” along the Fall Line. The kaolin mining industry has located its processing facilities in the communities near the deposits, primarily in the nine rural counties between Macon and Augusta. Highly technical equipment and processes are employed to transform the crude kaolin into high quality products which are marketed around the world for a wide variety of applications.      The industry grew as the North American paper and paint industries grew. Today, the product line has diversified and serves over NNN industries including ceramics, pharmaceuticals, plastics, catalysts, and building materials. During its peak in the mid-1990s, over 4,500 middle Georgians worked in the industry. Washington County provided a friendly business environment, plentiful labor and other natural and business resources that made the industry huge to the county and to Georgia. Many more thousands worked in supporting the industry in trucking, rail service, construction, maintenance and other service and retail businesses. Washington County retail establishments grew and today Washington County is a regional shopping area that attracts customers from nearby counties and a stopover for people traveling through the county.      Kaolin is still the major economic driver in the county today. An annual Kaolin Festival celebrates the importance of the resource. At the end of the twentieth century, kaolin was an 800 million business and Georgia’s largest volume export.      However, the kaolin industry had begun a decline by the end of the 1990s. County leaders worked to aggressively pursue diversify the industrial base, planned improvements to its infrastructure, and sought to improve and expand educational opportunities. Protecting and supporting the kaolin industry and attracting new businesses and visitors to this historically rich and diverse county were now priorities.      THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY – DIVERSIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT      Today, Washington County provides an environment which is business and industry friendly. Its location halfway between Augusta and Macon as well as Atlanta and Savannah. This provides unique access to theses four metropolitan cities in Georgia. Washington County is also less than 40 miles to both Interstate 16 and to Interstate 20. The Fall Line Freeway crosses the county and will serve as a connector from Columbus to Augusta upon its completion.      As the Kaolin Industry continues to change in Washington County, a number of other industries and employers continue to emerge locally. In 2002, Washington County opened its Industrial Park adjacent to Deepstep Road with a speculative building. Since this time, Dura-Line and Trojan Battery have occupied space in the Washington County Industrial Park. In 2010, the University System Shared Services Center began operation in the expanded Industrial Park. Other key industries that have located to Washington County in the last decade includes Zorlu, KaMin, and Meltblown Technologies. These industries have been instrumental in increasing a diversified economy that includes the Washington County Regional Medical Center and its numerous medical clinics and facilities, Oconee Fall Line Technical College, numerous trucking companies, a district GDOT office in Tennille, and the local Board of Education which all serve as major employers for Washington County and surrounding counties.      HISTORY OF THE BELL AND CLOCK IN THE COURT HOUSE      In 1899 the Washington County Court House underwent extensive remodeling. The purchasing of a new brass bell and a Seth-Thomas clock for the tower were included in the project. The clock, run by weights, had to be rewound by hand; it was eventually electrified. The large brass bell was located on the floor beneath the clock. The wheel located on the side of the bell was drawn by a rope which dropped several stories below. The bell served a dual purpose of striking the time and sounding fire alarms. After one hundred sixteen years, the inscription on the bell is still legible. It reads:      Buck Eye Bell Foundry 1899      Commissioners Roads and Revenues: Wiley Harris, chairman, B.C. Harris, S.G. Taylor. M. Newman, Ordinary and Secretary to the Commissioners.      Building Committee: M. Newman, Chairman, B.C. Harris, C.D. Thigpen. Architect: Lewis F. Goodrich, Augusta, Ga.      Contractors: John H. McKenzie and Son. AD 1899      Additional information of interest:      The clock underwent a cleaning and restoration in 1975. One hundred bolts in the hands of the clock and gear time shaft mechanism were replaced. The bolts were made of wood.      The clock was installed in August 1899 and a Dublin, Ga . Jeweler, Mr. W.J. Wright, was employed to install the clock (“put up”- stated in Progress) and to regulate it.      The eagle was put on the tallest dome of the courthouse. The Progress stated “the eagle has been perched upon the tallest dome of the courthouse”.      Description of the clock: The dials were white and the figures and hands were gilt.. The dials were supposed to have been black. The writer of the article in the Progress in 1899 stated: “the contrast is not sufficiently great to make a difference, but as it conforms to the specifications of Architect Goodrich, it will not be changed at the present at least.” The writer stated the clock had a musical sound and it was said the strikes on the bell could be heard a distance of 3 miles.            Research by :      Mary Murphy, 2015      LEWIS COHEN Researched by Mary Murphy April 2015      A prominent citizen of Washington County, Mr. Lewis Cohen was born in Germany in 1849 and came to America at the age of three. He grew up in Americus, GA and moved to Tennille ca 1877. After a short time in Tennille he moved to Sandersville and was associated with the firm of Pinkus Happ and Company. He was described as an enthusiastic businessman and was determined to see the town he had adopted grow. He worked diligently for Sandersville’s advancements and was one of the town’s most aggressive business leaders with numerous and varied profitable interest.      Mr. Cohen began the first banking system in Sandersville in 1885; it being the first banking system between Macon and Savannah. He continued to be involved in the banking business for approximately twenty-nine years. He was responsible for the first cotton warehouse being built in Sandersville. He also sold wagons and buggies and when the Birmingham Guano Company located in Sandersville, he served as President of the company. He built the first ginnery and flour mills, which afterwards he sold to Wiley Harris and Sons.      Lewis Cohen built the short line railroad between Sandersville and Tennille after the first railroad had been purchased by the Augusta Southern; worked effortless to cause the Sandersville and Tennille Telephone Exchange to be established; promoted the telegraph line from Sandersville to Dublin; installed the first electric light system in the town; worked actively in obtaining the municipal-owned electric light, waterworks and sewerage system in Sandersville.      Mr. Cohen served on the city council as well as serving as Mayor. For thirty years he was a member of the City Board of Education and for eleven of these years he served as president. He was also owner of Cohen’s Jewelry Store.      Mr. Louis Cohen died at his home in Sandersville 10 February 1937 at the age of 88 years. He was buried in Oakland Cemetery, Atlanta, GA.      LEWIS COHEN STONE STEP      THE STONE STEP WITH THE NAME LEWIS COHEN INSCRIBED CAME FROM THE FRONT YARD OF MR. COHEN’S HOME ON NORTH HARRIS STREET IN SANDERSVILE. THE STONE WAS USED IN HIS ERA TO ASSIST LADIES AS THEY STEPPED IN AND OUT OF CARRIAGES. THE HOME WAS DEMOLISHED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO TO ALLOW FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE GEORGE D. WARTHEN BANK. WHEN THE STONE STEP WAS REMOVED IT WAS ONLY BEFITTING THAT IT BE PLACED BESIDE THE GAZEBO ON THE COURTHOUSE SQUARE. IN 1898 MR. COHEN HAD THE GAZEBO BUILT FOR HIS DAUGHTER FLORENCE SO CONCERTS COULD BE HELD THERE FOR HER ENJOYMENT AND THE ENJOYMENT OF THE TOWN.      JARED IRWIN MONUMENT      The monument in memory of Governor Jared Irwin (1750-1818) was erected on the town square in 1856 by an act of the State of Georgia Legislature. It was later moved to the present location after the construction of a new courthouse in 1869.      Jared Irwin was born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina and moved with his family to Burke County, Georgia, later to Washington County. He fought in the American Revolution and his political career spanned several decades with varied notoriety. The monument to this twice governor of Georgia (1796-1798) and (1806-1809) has withstood the test of time; surviving the Civil War with only one bullet leaving its ‘mark.      Entering Sandersville during the occupation a Union Soldier described the monument as: “a splendid structure erected by the State and if the epitaph upon the same is all it reads, he (Irwin) never halted short of the 3rd heaven for the same covers the four entire sides.”      The inscription reads:      Erected by the State of Georgia to the memory of Governor Jared Irwin, who died at his residence, Union Hill, Washington, Co., on the first day of March 1818 in the 68th year of his age.      A true patriot, he entered the service of his country as a Captain as soon rose to the rank of colonel in the Revolutionary War. As a soldier, he was brave and gallant. He distinguished himself at the sieges of Savannah and Augusta and in the battles of Camden, Brier Creek, Black Swamp, and several other engagements, he was at all times foremost leading his gallant band to victory. And not with his work, and in his person only did he do service for his country. From his private means he erected a fortress in Burke County for protection of the people of the surrounding districts.      His pure devotion to the cause of liberty marked him in the eyes of the enemy, and on more than one occasion was he plundered of his property, and his promises reduced to ashes.      As the close of the War of the Revolution, with the rank of General, he was actively engaged in the service of the state, in repelling the attacks and invasions of the hostile Indians; and here, again, was his liberality called into activity. He, at his own expense, built a for at White Bluff, for the security and protection of the frontier inhabitants against the savage attacks of the merciless foes.      General Irwin was one of the convention which met at Augusta 1788, and ratified the constitution of the United States. He was a member of the convention in 1789, which formed the constitution of the State of Georgia. In 1798, he was president of the convention which revised the constitution of the State of Georgia. He rendered distinguished to his country as a commissioner, in concluding several treaties with the Indians.      At the close of the war of Independence he was a member of the first legislature under our present form of government; a position which he occupied for several years. He was elected president of the senate frequently, at various periods from 1790 until the time of his death.      He was governor of Georgia from January 17, 1796 to the 11th of January, 1798. And again from the 23rd of September, 1806, to the 7th of November, 1809. His administration was distinguished for his justice and impartiality; and his was the honor, after several years’ labor in the behalf, of signing the act rescinding the Yazoo Act.      In his private relations Governor Irwin was beloved by all who knew him. The spotless purity of his Character, his benign and affable disposition, his widespread benevolence and hospitality, made him the object of general affection. To the poor and distressed he was ever a benefactor and friend.      In every position of public life, as a soldier, a statesman, and a patriot, the public good was the object and the end of his ambition; and his death was lamented as a national calamity.      But his memory will ever be embalmed in the hearts of his countrymen; and the historian will award him a brilliant page in the records of the country.      Peace to his ashes! Honor to his name.      Mary Murphy      January 2016      THE OLD JAIL      This Victorian Era conjoined jail and sheriffs’ home was built in 1891 and is one of a few known to exist today. Very little has changed in the building since 1975 when it was last used as a jail. It was built of brick and stone with the intention of the appearance of a well appointed dwelling. The sheriff storied, was in the back part. The jail section still houses the original cells and locking mechanism. The Washington County Historical Society now houses the Old Jail Museum and Genealogy Research Center in the building.      Mary Murphy      December 2015      GAZEBO      The gazebo was built in 1898 on the courthouse grounds by Louis Cohen for his daughter Florence. The gazebo was used as a grandstand for the benefit of having outside symphonies. Florence was an avid music loves and sought a place for outside entertainment. In ca 1900 a local band was formed and in honor of her, named the Florence Symphony. Many outside musical symphonies were held from the gazebo. In later years the gazebo was moved to its present location on the courthouse square and extensive renovations were made. The gazebo is still in use today.

Article: Growing mushrooms  is probably the easiest thing you can do if you are new to mushroom growing. Mushroom growing is becoming more and more common as restaurants are creating more dishes that include mushrooms. Mushroom growing is easy. To start with you need to have a growing space where you are going to grow these mushrooms. It does not have to be too big enough for you to grow as many mushrooms as you need. When you have found the space that is perfect for you, you can start to research what kind of mushrooms you want to grow. There are hundreds of kinds to choose from but not all mushrooms are _ which is an important fact you need to remember before you start. Don't grow mushrooms you can't use or sell. When you figure out what kind of mushrooms you want to grow, you can make some preparations. Sometimes you need to hire some workers to help you if you have a large mushroom farm, or if you are trying to start a professional mushroom growing business. Trying to start a business by yourself can be stressful. If you don't have time to take care of everything yourself, to hire a worker is the best bet. After you have started the mushroom growing, you should regularly check and make sure that your mushrooms are growing properly and that they are not being attacked by any pesticides  or any other animals that are potentially dangerous for them.

Fact 2: Incandescent light bulbs use a tungsten filament sealed inside a glass bulb.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"Tungsten filaments sealed in a glass bulb are used for what in the dark?\\" with the following options:  - photons  - energy  - seeing  - stay warm  - sleeping  - talking  - communicating  - heat A:","output":"Given the two facts provided, we can deduce that tungsten filaments sealed in a glass bulb are used for seeing in the dark. This is because Fact 1 states that a light bulb is used for seeing in the dark, and Fact 2 explains that incandescent light bulbs, which are designed for this purpose, contain a tungsten filament sealed inside a glass bulb. When an incandescent light bulb is turned on, the tungsten filament inside the glass bulb starts to glow. This is because an electrical current passes through the filament, which causes the filament to heat up to a high temperature. As a result of this heat, the filament emits visible light due to a process known as incandescence. The visible light emitted by the filament is composed of photons, which are packets of electromagnetic energy that our eyes can detect. The primary purpose of a tungsten filament surrounded by a glass bulb is to provide illumination for seeing in the dark. Other options, such as energy, stay warm, sleeping, talking, communicating, and heat, are not directly relevant to the primary function served by the tungsten filament and glass bulb. While incandescent bulbs generate heat as a byproduct of their operation (due to energy loss through heat), this is not their intended function. The primary role of the tungsten filament and glass bulb is to convert electrical energy into visible light, thereby enabling us to see in the dark."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who worked professionally in archaeology, and specialised in the Romano-British period? ?  Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle. During World War II, he re-joined the Armed Forces and rose to the rank of brigadier, serving in the North African Campaign and then the Allied...

Information:  - Vejle Fjord is an East Jutland-type fjord in Denmark. It is approximately in length, and it stretches east from the town of Vejle at its head to the towns of Trelde Næs on the south side and Juelsminde on the north side at the mouth. The fjord's generally calm surface waters are surrounded by low forested hills shaped by glaciers during the last ice age.  - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.  - In engineering, a truss is a structure that \\"consists of two-force members only, where the members are organized so that the assemblage as a whole behaves as a single object\\". A \\"two-force member\\" is a structural component where force is applied to only two points. Although this rigorous definition allows the members to have any shape connected in any stable configuration, trusses typically comprise five or more triangular units constructed with straight members whose ends are connected at joints referred to as nodes. In this typical context, external forces and reactions to those forces are considered to act only at the nodes and result in forces in the members that are either tensile or compressive. For straight members, moments (torques) are explicitly excluded because, and only because, all the joints in a truss are treated as revolutes, as is necessary for the links to be two-force members.  - A box or tubular girder is a girder that forms an enclosed tube with multiple walls, rather than an or H-beam. Originally constructed of riveted wrought iron, they are now found in rolled or welded steel, aluminium extrusions or prestressed concrete.  - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.  - Jutland , also known as the Cimbric or Cimbrian Peninsula , is a peninsula of Northern Europe that forms the continental portion of Denmark and the northern portion of Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east.  - A cantilever bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers, structures that project horizontally into space, supported on only one end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large cantilever bridges designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - A bridge is a structure built to span physical obstacles without closing the way underneath such as a body of water, valley, or road, for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle. There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.  - Arable land (from Latin \\"arabilis\\", \\"able to be plowed\\") is, according to one definition, land \\"capable\\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland.  - Vejle is a town in Denmark, in the southeast of the Jutland Peninsula at the head of Vejle Fjord, where the Vejle River and Grejs River and their valleys converge. It is the site of the councils of Vejle Municipality (\\"kommune\\") and the Region of Southern Denmark. The city itself has a population of 54,862, making it the ninth largest city in Denmark. Vejle Municipality has a population of 111,743. The city is part of the Triangle Region, which includes the neighbouring cities of Kolding and Fredericia.  - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).  - Falsework consists of temporary structures used in construction to support spanning or arched structures in order to hold the component in place until its construction is sufficiently advanced to support itself. This usage is specifically called centering. Falsework also includes temporary support structures for formwork used to mould concrete to form a desired shape, scaffolding to give workers access to the structure being constructed, and shoring which is temporary structural reinforcement used during repairs.  - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper.  - Structural steel is a category of steel used as a construction material for making structural steel shapes. A structural steel shape is a profile, formed with a specific cross section and following certain standards for chemical composition and mechanical properties. Structural steel shapes, sizes, composition, strengths, storage practices, etc., are regulated by standards in most industrialized countries.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Vejle Fjord Bridge ( Danish : Vejlefjordbroen ) is a cantilever bridge that spans Vejle Fjord between Mølholm and Nørremarken near the town of Vejle in Denmark . The bridge is 1712 metres long , the longest span is 110 metres , and the maximum clearance to the sea is 40 metres . The bridge has 15 spans . Vejle Fjord Bridge was built to lead traffic past the town of Vejle , where traffic congestion had become a problem in the 1970s . The building started in 1975 , and the bridge was opened on July 1 , 1980 . It cost 350 million kroner . The bridge now has more traffic than any other highway bridge in Denmark .  - Prestressed concrete is a concrete construction material which is placed under compression prior to it supporting any applied loads (i.e. it is \\"pre\\" stressed). A more technical definition is \\"\\"Structural concrete in which internal stresses have been introduced to reduce potential tensile stresses in the concrete resulting from loads.\\"\\" This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength \\"tendons\\" located within or adjacent to the concrete volume, and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service. Tendons may consist of single wires, multi-wire strands or threaded bars, and are most commonly made from high-tensile steels, carbon fibre or aramid fibre. The essence of prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied, the resulting material has the characteristics of high-strength concrete when subject to any subsequent compression forces, and of ductile high-strength steel when subject to tension forces. This can result in improved structural capacity and/or serviceability compared to conventionally reinforced concrete in many situations. Prestressed concrete is used in a wide range of building and civil structures where its improved concrete performance can allow longer spans, reduced structural thicknesses, and material savings to be realised compared to reinforced concrete. Typical applications range through high-rise buildings, residential slabs, foundation systems, bridge and dam structures, silos and tanks, industrial pavements and nuclear containment structures.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Zealand is the largest (7,031 km) and most populated island in Denmark with a population of 2,267,659 (39% of Denmark's total as of January 2016).  - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands).

Context: The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful. Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. Question: What does the author think about constantly pushing yourself?

Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him.

Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

Step-by-step translation and justification: 1. \\"Because of the traditional division of roles\\" = \\"Koska perinteisten roolijakojen vuoksi\\" - I translated the introductory phrase to Finnish, keeping the \\"because\\" as \\"koska\\" to indicate the cause. 2. \\"and the weak infrastructure\\" = \\"ja heikon infrastruktuurin\\" - I translated the conjunction \\"and\\" to \\"ja\\" and the adjective-noun pair \\"weak infrastructure\\" as \\"heikko infrastruktuuri\\". I added the genitive form of the adjective \\"heikko\\" as \\"heikon\\". 3. \\"in many areas\\" = \\"monilla alueilla\\" - I translated \\"in many areas\\" keeping the meaning of \\"many\\" as \\"monilla\\" and \\"areas\\" as \\"alueilla\\". 4. \\"such as child care, for example\\" = \\"kuten esimerkiksi lastenhoidossa\\" - I translated \\"such as\\" and \\"for example\\" as \\"kuten\\" and \\"esimerkiksi\\" respectively, adding the Finnish word for \\"child care\\" which is \\"lastenhoito\\" and putting it in the inessive case as \\"lastenhoidossa\\" to indicate the location. 5. \\"many women never feature in the official labour market\\" = \\"monet naiset eivät koskaan pääse osaksi virallista työmarkkinaa\\" - I translated the subject \\"many women\\" as \\"monet naiset\\" and rearranged the sentence to say \\"do not get to be part of\\", which is \\"eivät pääse osaksi\\" in Finnish.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3. Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Problem:Question: Who had more wins the year Robertson dropped the belt back to Lewis, Jerry Valiant or Steve Regal? Passage 1:When the American Civil War began, Weitzel was assigned to construct defenses, including in Cincinnati and Washington, as well as for George McClellan in the Army of the Potomac in late 1861. He was then attached to the staff of Major General Benjamin F. Butler as chief engineer of the Department of the Gulf. When Union troops captured New Orleans, Weitzel became assistant military commander and acting mayor. He was promoted to brigadier general in August 1862 and two months later routed a large force of the enemy at Labadieville, Louisiana, which earned him a brevet promotion to major in the Regular Army. Weitzel commanded a brigade in the XIX Corps advancing in Major General Nathaniel P. Banks's operations in western Louisiana during April and May 1863, which led to the siege of Port Hudson. Weitzel was later brevetted lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army, \\"for gallant and meritorious services at the siege of Port Hudson,\\" which fell on July 9, 1863, days after Vicksburg, Mississippi, about 120 miles upriver, the last Confederate stronghold on the great Mississippi, had fallen. Together those successful sieges and the continuing blockage of Southern ports completed the Anaconda Plan.  Passage 2:Robertson moved to Central States Wrestling, where he won the majority of his titles. On October 22, 1981, he won the NWA Central States Television Championship with a victory over Gene Lewis. He lost the belt to Oliver Humperdink later that year but soon regained it in a rematch. On February 18, 1982, however, he dropped the belt back to Lewis. This allowed Robertson to focus on the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship, which he won a total of five times. His first reign came in October 1981 when he teamed with Rufus R. Jones to defeat Buzz Tyler and James J. Dillon. His next reign came in March 1982 when he teamed with Steve Regal to win the belts from Roger Kirby and Jerry Valiant. The title changed hands twice more that month, as Kirby and Valiant quickly regained the title only to drop it back to Robertson and Regal. Two months later, Kirby and Valiant won the belts back again. Robertson found a new partner, however, and won the championship by teaming with Hercules Hernandez in August. The reign lasted less than a month, but Robertson and Hernandez held the belts one final time after another victory in September 1982. The following year, Robertson's main success came as a singles wrestler. On February 10, 1983, he won the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship with a victory over Manny Fernandez. He lost the belt to Bob Brown two months later but regained it in a rematch the following week. Robertson's final title reign ended when he dropped the title to Race on June 2, 1983.  Passage 3:Keith Cerny is an American opera director and businessman. From 2004-2007 he was Executive Director and CFO of the San Francisco Opera and from 2010-2018 he was General Director of the Dallas Opera. In 2018 he was appointed General Director of the Calgary Opera. He is also the former CEO of Sheet Music Plus (2008-2010), the world's largest interest-based sheet-music company. He is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley (B.A. in Music and B.S. in Physics), the Harvard Business School (M.B.A.), and the Open University in the United Kingdom (Ph.D. in Economic Development Studies/Econometrics). He also studied conducting, voice, and accompanying at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London and studied opera-accompanying in English National Opera's répétiteur training course. He also worked for McKinsey & Company for six years where he was a Senior Engagement Manager, and seven years with the consulting firm Accenture. He is also an Executive Board Member for Opera America. Solution:","output":"Part #1: Identifying the relevant passage Usage: Passage 2 is the relevant passage for the question. This passage provides information about Robertson's wrestling journey, including details about his matches, titles, and opponents like Jerry Valiant and Steve Regal. Part #2: Identifying Robertson dropping the belt back to Lewis Usage: \\"On February 18, 1982, however, he dropped the belt back to Lewis.\\" In this sentence, we find the information about when Robertson dropped the belt back to Lewis. Part #3: Identifying information about Jerry Valiant and Steve Regal Usage: \\"In March 1982 when he teamed with Steve Regal to win the belts from Roger Kirby and Jerry Valiant.\\" This sentence mentions Jerry Valiant and Steve Regal in relation to the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship, which is useful for answering the question. Part #4: Analyzing the title exchange during the year in question Usage: \\"The title changed hands twice more that month, as Kirby and Valiant quickly regained the title only to drop it back to Robertson and Regal. Two months later, Kirby and Valiant won the belts back again.\\" These sentences show that Jerry Valiant had at least two instances of winning the title the year Robertson dropped the belt back to Lewis. Part #5: Making a conclusion based on the given information Usage: Based on Passage 2, it can be inferred that Jerry Valiant had more wins the year Robertson dropped the belt back to Lewis. Steve Regal and Robertson won the title together from Valiant and Kirby, who regained the title and then lost it again to Regal and Robertson. Thus, Jerry Valiant's wins outnumber Steve Regal's wins in that specific timeframe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Passage: In 2012, Abigail Fisher, an undergraduate student at Louisiana State University, and Rachel Multer Michalewicz, a law student at Southern Methodist University, filed a lawsuit to challenge the University of Texas admissions policy, asserting it had a \\"race-conscious policy\\" that \\"violated their civil and constitutional rights\\". The University of Texas employs the \\"Top Ten Percent Law\\", under which admission to any public college or university in Texas is guaranteed to high school students who graduate in the top ten percent of their high school class. Fisher has brought the admissions policy to court because she believes that she was denied acceptance to the University of Texas based on her race, and thus, her right to equal protection according to the 14th Amendment was violated. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Fisher on October 10, 2012, and rendered an ambiguous ruling in 2013 that sent the case back to the lower court, stipulating only that the University must demonstrate that it could not achieve diversity through other, non-race sensitive means. In July 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that U of T maintained a \\"holistic\\" approach in its application of affirmative action, and could continue the practice. On February 10, 2015, lawyers for Fisher filed a new case in the Supreme Court. It is a renewed complaint that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit got the issue wrong — on the second try as well as on the first. The Supreme Court agreed in June 2015 to hear the case a second time. It will likely be decided by June 2016. Question: What did the plaintiffs claim the university had for an admissions policy?

But with his death of a heart attack Tuesday at the age of 71, Chalabi's legacy is a much different one: He's now known mostly as the Iraqi figure who used faulty information about weapons of mass destruction to persuade the US to topple Saddam, reports the Wall Street Journal. It's unclear whether Chalabi himself knew the information was bogus. Here's how the New York Times puts it: \\"As it became clear that the evidence he promoted as proving that Mr. Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction was, if not fabricated, then manipulated and exaggerated, the Bush administration distanced itself from him.\\" The split became even more pronounced a year after the invasion when US forces invaded his home looking to prove accusations that he was spying for Iran. The only charges that resulted, however, involved forged bank notes, reports the Guardian. \\"There are some people who will remember him in a good way, and there are others, to be honest, [who] do not like and did not want his politics,\\" former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi tells Reuters. \\"But regardless, Iraq lost a man who had an important contribution, important commitments towards the nation and he tried to offer what he could to this country.\\" Chalabi was a member of Parliament at the time of his death. Expand this summary.","output":"Ahmad Chalabi, an influential Iraqi politician, passed away on November 3, 2015, at the age of 71 after suffering a heart attack. Once considered a darling of the US, Chalabi was expected to lead Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein. However, his legacy took a dramatic turn as he became known as the Iraqi figure who used inaccurate information about weapons of mass destruction to persuade the US to overthrow Saddam Hussein. It remains unclear whether Chalabi was aware that the information was false. Chalabi's rise to prominence began when he founded the Iraqi National Congress in 1992, an umbrella organization for exiles and opposition figures working to overthrow Hussein. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Chalabi cultivated close ties with the US, particularly neoconservatives like Paul Wolfowitz, who later became the Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Bush administration. Chalabi's connections allowed him to provide intelligence to the US about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction, which was then used by the Bush administration as a central rationale for the 2003 invasion. However, as it became evident that the evidence Chalabi promoted to prove Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction was at best exaggerated and, at worst, fabricated, the Bush administration began to distance itself from him. A rift emerged between Chalabi and the US when American forces raided his home in 2004, attempting to verify accusations that he was spying for Iran. Although the only charges that resulted were related to forged banknotes, Chalabi's credibility was severely damaged. Despite the controversy surrounding his role in the lead-up to the Iraq invasion, Chalabi continued to hold political power in Iraq. In the years that followed, he served as the interim Oil Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, and was a member of the Iraqi Parliament at the time of his death. While some people may remember Chalabi in a positive light, acknowledging his commitment to Iraq and his contributions to the nation, others may have unfavorable opinions due to his politics and the pivotal role he played in providing inaccurate information leading up to the Iraq war. Former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi told Reuters, \\"There are some people who will remember him in a good way, and there are others, to be honest, [who] do not like and did not want his politics. But regardless, Iraq lost a man who had an important contribution, important commitments towards the nation, and he tried to offer what he could to this country.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A girl in pink picks flowers.\\" if \\"Woman has allergy on flowers.\\"?","output":"No, it is not possible to conclude that \\"A girl in pink picks flowers\\" if \\"A woman has allergy on flowers\\". These are two separate statements that are not directly related.  Let's break down these individual statements. The first statement, \\"A girl in pink picks flowers\\", is a simple sentence expressing an action. It talks about a girl, who is wearing pink, doing the activity of picking flowers. Key elements or information pieces in this statement include: a girl who is in pink and the action of picking flowers. There is nothing to indicate whether the girl has any sort of allergy or sensitivity to flowers or not. The second statement, \\"a woman has allergy on flowers\\" is a different statement all together. It communicates that there is a woman who has some sort of allergic reaction when she comes in contact with flowers. Key elements or information pieces here are: a woman and an allergy to flowers. There is no information given about what this woman is doing, what she is wearing, or if she is currently in contact with flowers.  To link these two statements directly and logically, we would need more information. For example, if we were told that the 'girl in pink' and the 'woman with flower allergies' are the same person, then we could add and conclude something new. Or if we were told that there is a cause-effect relationship between the girl picking flowers and the woman's allergies, then again, we might be able to draw a conclusion. Without any additional information, however, these two statements stand separate. From \\"a woman has allergy on flowers\\" we cannot conclude that \\"a girl in pink picks flowers.\\" And vice versa, from \\"a girl in pink picks flowers\\" we cannot conclude that \\"a woman has allergy on flowers.\\" They exist independently of each other. We would need more information in order to draw a logical, direct conclusion from one statement to the other.  It is important to note that assuming things not explicitly stated can lead to leaps in logic that are not grounded in the information provided. In order to make sound and justified conclusions, one needs to have solid and related information that logically leads from one idea or statement to the next."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: When you are learning English, listening, speaking and writing are important, but reading can also be very helpful.

Three cafeteria staff members were hospitalized after inhaling fumes from the fiery sauce, according to Highland Park High School spokeswoman Natalie Kaplan.      \\"Several staff and students reported reactions to the sauce, including coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and skin rashes,\\" said Kaplan. \\"The impacted staff members were taken to hospital but no serious injuries were reported.\\"      The World's Hottest Pepper: Brings Pleasure and Pain Relief      Police say the male student behind the peppery prank, whose name and age have not been released, somehow sneaked \\"Da Bomb\\" hot sauce into a container of marinara sauce during the first lunch period on May 14.      \\"A student then went through the food line and purchased spaghetti with marinara sauce, and after sitting down and taking his first bite, found it intolerably hot and went back to the food line to advise staff,\\" said Highland Park Police Deputy Chief George Pfutzenreuter. \\"Staff pulled the sauce from the line and, in evaluating the sauce, some of the staff members also started feeling effects.\\"      Pfutzenreuter said he didn't know which type of Da Bomb hot sauce was used in the prank. According to the brand's website, \\"Final Answer Hot Sauce\\" reaches 1,500,000 Scoville units - a level of heat approaching that of law enforcement-grade pepper spray.

Gabby Douglas is flying high—and solo. America's newest gymnastics icon will be the only American to compete in Monday's uneven-bar final—and she'll likely be one of only two gymnasts to perform without a spotter, or someone to catch her if she falls. Look for her coach, Liang Chow, to stand far to the side as Douglas twirls and soars over the chalk-coated bars. \\"He's just, 'You don't need me anymore—you got this,' \\" Douglas said. \\"He knows I can do it.\\" Get the latest Journal coverage of the 2012 Games right here—every story, video, photo or tweet related to the competition and all news off the field. The confidence will help Douglas as she competes for her third gold medal at London, where the 16-year-old already has led the U.S. women to a team victory and became the first African-American to win the individual all-around title. Douglas said she was starting to fathom the frenzy that awaits her when she returns to the U.S. next week. \\"It definitely sank in when Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne were tweeting at me,\\" she said of the rap stars. \\"I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I am a superstar.' \\" She also is dealing with some of fame's downside. Her straightened hair has triggered debates on Twitter and other social-media sites, with some women criticizing the style and others calling it unkempt. But the tiff doesn't seem to bother Douglas. \\"What is wrong with my hair? Are you kidding me? I just made history, and you are focusing on my hair?\\" she said. \\"Nothing is going to change. I am going to wear my hair like this for bar finals. You might as well get used to it.\\" Douglas was the only American to qualify for the uneven-bar finals, after scoring 15.333 to finish sixth on the apparatus in the qualifying round. The favorites in the competition are Britain's Beth Tweddle, who led qualifiers with a 16.133 score, as well as two gymnasts each from China and Russia. Besides Douglas and Tweddle, all of Monday's uneven-bar competitors have used a spotter during the London Games. None of the Americans in Tuesday's team final had such help. Aly Raisman didn't use one in Thursday's all-around final, which her coach, Mihai Brestyan, called a strategy to sharpen her concentration. \\"You don't trust nobody,\\" Brestyan said. \\"You trust just in yourself. Sometimes the spotter makes you have half-half decisions because you start the skill and then whatever happens, you don't pay attention, 100%, to the execution. Then you trust to that person, OK whatever happens to me, I will not fall.\\" Spotters, often a male coach, usually scamper underneath gymnasts as they prepare to do aerial moves. Their goal is to at least break the fall of their pupil if she doesn't catch the bar—if not catch them entirely. The spotters aren't perfect. Former Olympic all-around winner Nastia Liukin fell on her face several weeks ago after her father, who is also her coach, didn't get an arm on her. \\"Sometimes the other countries, their spotters don't even catch them. Even though they fall, he's still standing there,\\" said Kyla Ross, one of Douglas's teammates. Chow, Douglas's coach, said he spotted her for the few months it took her to learn her current routine. \\"But after she mastered everything, why would I want to make her more paranoid?\\" he said. \\"That shows her confidence, that shows my confidence. Plus if I'm standing away, I can see her technique better.\\" He said he would stick to the plan when Douglas performs Monday. \\"I have never seen Gabby fall on any of her release moves for three months,\\" he said. \\"Not even once.\\" Corrections & Amplifications Kyla Ross is a teammate of Gabby Douglas.

What festival is celebrated with bread baked from the first grains of wheat harvested????","output":"The festival that is celebrated with bread baked from the first grains of wheat harvested is Lammas, also known as Lughnasadh or the Feast of St. Peter in Chains. This festival has its roots in various ancient cultures, and it is typically observed on August 1st in the Northern Hemisphere or February 1st in the Southern Hemisphere. Lammas marks the beginning of the harvest season and is celebrated as a festival of thanksgiving for the first fruits of the earth, particularly the newly harvested wheat. Lammas has its origins in the Celtic festival of Lughnasadh, which commemorated the god Lugh, a Celtic warrior and sun god. Lughnasadh was a major event in the agricultural calendar, as it marked the first harvest of the season. People would participate in various rituals and games during this celebration to honor Lugh and ensure a bountiful yield for the rest of the harvest season. In pre-Christian Europe, Lammas also had pagan roots that coincided with the Celtic festival. The name \\"Lammas\\" comes from the Old English \\"hlaf-maesse,\\" which translates to \\"loaf mass.\\" This early festival marked the first loaf of bread baked from the first harvested grains of wheat. Communities would come together to celebrate the harvest, share food, and participate in customs such as making corn dollies or offering loaves of bread to the gods or spirits of the harvest. As Christianity spread throughout Europe, this festival was adopted and adapted to Christian beliefs. In the Christian tradition, Lammas became the Feast of St. Peter in Chains, which commemorated St. Peter's imprisonment and eventual miraculous release. However, many of the original pagan customs remained, such as baking bread from the first wheat harvested. Christians would often bake loaves of bread and bring them to church to be blessed and later used as sacramental bread. Today, Lammas is still celebrated in various forms around the world. In some regions, it is observed as a Christian feast day, while in others, it is embraced as a pagan festival honoring the earth and its harvest. Customs may include baking and sharing bread, creating grain or harvest-themed decorations, feasting, and engaging in traditional games or dances. The festival serves as a reminder of the importance of the harvest and the connection between people and the earth. In conclusion, Lammas, or Lughnasadh, is an ancient festival celebrating the first wheat harvest with bread baked from the newly harvested grains. With roots in Celtic and pagan traditions, it has evolved over time to also incorporate Christian elements. Today, it continues to be a time of thanksgiving, sharing, and honoring the bountiful gifts of the earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Process:  - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose We are located at a high altitude zone happens, how will it affect \\"MORE oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\".  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the perturbation (high altitude) has a direct effect on the process of oxygen being brought to the body's cells. At high altitudes, the air pressure is lower, which means the air is thinner and contains less oxygen. Consequently, when you take a breath inward, you inhale fewer oxygen molecules compared to sea level.  The process you described remains the same, but the lower levels of oxygen in the air make it more challenging for the body to acquire the necessary amount of oxygen: 1. The human body takes a breath inward, but inhales less oxygen due to the thin air. 2. Air with reduced oxygen content is transported to the lungs. 3. Air reaches the alveoli, where the lower oxygen levels create a pressure difference that affects the rate at which oxygen can enter the blood. 4. The dissolved oxygen in the capillary blood is lower than at lower altitudes. 5. Red blood cells pick up oxygen but may not become fully saturated with the limited amounts available. 6. Red blood cells circulate throughout the body but carry less oxygen due to limited saturation. 7. Oxygen reaches the cells within the tissues in reduced quantities. The body will often try to compensate for this lack of oxygen by increasing breathing rate and heart rate in an attempt to deliver more oxygen to its cells and tissues. However, in the short term, this may not be enough to overcome the reduced oxygen availability, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, or headaches. Over time, the body can adapt to high-altitude conditions by producing more red blood cells and blood vessels, as well as improving the efficiency of oxygen utilization within the cells. In summary, the high altitude perturbation indirectly hampers the process of oxygen delivery to the body's cells due to the reduced availability of oxygen in the inhaled air. This causes physiological changes in the body as it attempts to adapt to the lower oxygen levels."},{"instruction":"Question: Process: - A hurricane usually starts as an organized thunderstorm activity that stretches at least 100 miles across and maintains its identity for more than 24 hours - Under the right conditions it can develop further and start to spin around a low-pressure center - If it develops it&#x27;s classified as a &#x27;tropical cyclone&#x27; or &#x27;tropical depression&#x27; - If the system strengthens and wind speeds rise past 39 mph, the system is dubbed a &#x27;tropical storm&#x27; - If the pressure in the center drops even further and the winds really pick up and forms a clearly defined &#x27;eye&#x27; it&#x27;s a hurricane -   Question: suppose more oxygen enters the blood stream happens, how will it affect LESS POWERFUL hurricanes.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"C: no effect"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kelly is a prostitute who shows up in the small town of Grantville, just one more burg in a long string of quick stops on the run after being chased out of the big city by her former pimp. She engages in a quick tryst with local police captain Griff, who then tells her to stay out of his town and refers her to a cat-house just across the state line. Instead, she decides to give up her illicit lifestyle, becoming a nurse at a hospital for handicapped children. Griff doesn't trust reformed prostitutes, however, and continues trying to run her out of town. Kelly falls in love with J.L. Grant, the wealthy scion of the town's founding family, an urbane sophisticate, and Griff's best friend. After a dream-like courtship where even Kelly's admission of her past can't deter Grant, the two decide to marry. It is only after Kelly is able to finally convince Griff that she truly loves Grant and has given up prostitution for good that he agrees to be their best man. Shortly before the wedding, Kelly arrives at Grant's mansion, only to find him on the verge of molesting a small girl. As he grinningly tries to persuade her to marry him, arguing that she too is a deviant, the only one who can understand him, and that he loves her, Kelly kills him by striking him in the head with a phone receiver. Jailed, and under heavy interrogation from Griff, she must convince him and the town that she is telling the truth about Grant's death.

The author of the tweet is intentionally using informal and colloquial language to express their disdain towards a specific aspect of sports culture – violence in sports or the aggressive behavior of fans associated with it. There are several indicators in the text that help us understand the sentiment: 1. The usage of \\"amen\\" - This term is often used to show agreement or concurrence, suggesting that the tweeter agrees with the sentiment or opinion expressed by @panasonicyouth. However, it should also be noted that \\"amen\\" could be interpreted sarcastically in some instances. 2. \\"stupid sportsball violence\\" - The word \\"stupid\\" signifies the displeasure and irritation the author is feeling towards the subject matter. By choosing the term \\"sportsball\\" instead of \\"sports,\\" they might be suggesting that they see sports as trivial or unimportant, and that they don't understand why people are getting violent or aggressive about it. 3. The casual language and expressions might indicate that the author is not speaking from personal experience, but is merely annoyed by the behavior of others in association with the sport. This could be a reaction to a specific event they saw in the news, experienced personally, or witnessed on social media. 4. It is essential to point out that the tweet is short and concise, which sometimes suggests that the sentiment expressed might be more straightforward and direct. However, it can also denote sarcasm, depending on the context, which is a bit difficult to decipher without additional information. In conclusion, based on the language, tone, and choice of words, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as negative. The author appears to be expressing their disdain for violent behavior related to sports, and they may be using sarcasm to further emphasize their point. The tweet likely reflects the author's personal opinion on the matter, and they might be trying to convey this feeling to their followers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He achieved stardom for his acting achievements. In particular, he is best known for his motion picture portrayal of the classic DC comic book superhero Superman, beginning with the acclaimed Superman (1978), for which he won a BAFTA Award. Reeve appeared in other critically acclaimed films such as The Bostonians (1984), Street Smart (1987) and The Remains of the Day (1993). Christopher Reeve was born on September 25, 1952, in New York City, the son of Barbara Pitney (Lamb) (1929-2000), a journalist, and Franklin D'Olier Reeve (1928-2013), a teacher, novelist, poet, and scholar. Reeve was of almost entirely English ancestry, with many family lines that had been in America since the early 1600s. His paternal grandfather, Colonel Richard Henry Reeve, had been the CEO of Prudential Financial (when it was called Prudential Life Insurance Company) for over 25 years.  Reeve's father was a Princeton University graduate studying for a master's degree in Russian at Columbia University prior to the birth of his son, Christopher. Despite being born wealthy, Franklin Reeve spent summers working at the docks with longshoremen. Reeve's mother had been a student at Vassar College but transferred to Barnard College to be closer to Franklin, whom she had met through a family connection. They had another son, Benjamin, born on October 6, 1953.  Franklin and Barbara divorced in 1956, and she moved with her two sons to Princeton, New Jersey, where they attended Nassau Street School. Later that year, Franklin Reeve married Helen Schmidinger, a Columbia University graduate student. Barbara Pitney Lamb married Tristam B. Johnson, a stockbroker, in 1959. Johnson enrolled Christopher and his brother, Benjamin, in Princeton Country Day School, which later merged with Miss Fine's School for Girls to become the co-educational Princeton Day School. Reeve excelled academically, athletically, and onstage; he was on the honor roll and played soccer, baseball, tennis, and hockey. The sportsmanship award at Princeton Day School's invitational hockey tournament was named in Reeve's honor. Reeve admitted that he put pressure on himself to act older than he actually was in order to gain his father's approval.  Reeve found his passion in 1962 at age nine when he was cast in an amateur version of the operetta The Yeomen of the Guard; it was the first of many student plays. In mid-1968, at age fifteen, Reeve was accepted as an apprentice at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts. The other apprentices were mostly college students, but Reeve's older appearance and maturity helped him fit in with the others. In a workshop, he played a scene from A View from the Bridge that was chosen to be presented in front of an audience. After the performance, actress Olympia Dukakis said to him, \\"I'm surprised. You've got a lot of talent. Don't mess it up.\\" The next summer, Reeve was hired at the Harvard Summer Repertory Theater Company in Cambridge for 44 per week. He played a Russian sailor in The Hostage and Belyayev in A Month in the Country. Famed theater critic Elliot Norton called his performance as Belyayev \\"startlingly effective.\\" The 23-year-old lead actress in the play, a Carnegie Mellon graduate, turned out to be Reeve's first romance. She was engaged to a fellow Carnegie Mellon graduate at the time; they mutually ended the relationship when he made a surprise visit to her dorm room at seven in the morning and found Reeve with her. Reeve's romance with the actress fizzled a few months later when the age difference became an issue. Reeve was briefly involved with Scientology but opted out of becoming a member. He subsequently voiced criticism of the organization.","output":"This text is about Christopher D'Olier Reeve, an American actor who is best known for his role as Superman in the DC comic book movies.

The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border.

Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human.

Possible answers: (a). yes. (b). it is not possible to tell. (c). no.","output":"(c). no. Given the premise, the hypothesis \\"Jesus was never stationed here at all\\" is contradicted because it provides clearly that Jesus was in fact 'stationed' at a place, which is referred to as the \\"Fortress Courtyard\\". The content of the premise describes the course of events occurring in this location, namely, \\"Jesus receives the cross, is taken away, beaten, and mocked by a crowd.\\" These events establish the presence of Jesus in this location at some point in time. It is important, however, to take note of the term 'stationed'. Ideally, it is used to denote the assignment of a specific place or duty to someone. In this context, the premise does not necessarily indicate that Jesus was officially stationed, or assigned, to the courtyard as if it was his duty post. The term 'stationed' only serves to locate him in the Fortress Courtyard as the place where the described events transpired.

Overall, the interpretation of these statements requires not just a literal reading of the words, but an understanding of the implied and contextual meanings.

Next question: who is the heroine of quit india movement?","output":"Your question focuses on the heroine of the Quit India Movement, a significant phase in India's struggle for independence. While many women bravely fought for India's freedom and made crucial contributions, Aruna Asaf Ali is widely recognized as the 'Heroine of the 1942 Movement'. Aruna Asaf Ali, born Aruna Ganguly on July 16, 1909, played an instrumental role in the Quit India Movement launched by the Indian National Congress in Bombay in 1942. She is most famous for hoisting the Indian National Congress flag at the Gowalia Tank Maidan in Bombay during the Quit India Movement's launch, following the arrest of many senior leaders. This act made her an icon for all women and men fighting for India's freedom. When most Congress leaders were imprisoned, Aruna chose to stay outside prison and helped fan the sparks of the movement. She went underground to evade arrest, during which she edited 'Inquilab', a monthly magazine, to keep the spirit of freedom alive among masses. Her courageous actions inspired countless people to join the movement and resist British rule. For this reason, the British government announced a hefty reward for her capture. Possessing an indomitable spirit, Aruna worked relentlessly to motivate people to participate in the freedom struggle. Her role was not confined to the Quit India Movement alone. Even after India's independence, she remained politically active and continued to work for the upliftment of the poor and marginalized sections of society. In recognition of her invaluable contribution to the nation, she was awarded India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, posthumously in 1997. Besides, she was also honored with the International Lenin Peace Prize in 1964. Therefore, Aruna Asaf Ali, with her extraordinary courage and relentless work towards India's independence, is fondly remembered as the heroine of the Quit India Movement. Her legacy serves as an inspiration for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

With both of their permission, we give you the full transcript of their conversation.      Russell Simmons: I've known you since the beginning of your career and have always thought you were one of the funniest guys in the game. Ever since I saw you on Def Comedy Jam, I knew you were going to be extraordinarily successful. But, I gotta be honest, I was quite disappointed when I read about your comments you made about having a gay son and about gay people in general.      Tracy Morgan: I guess the reason I am successful is because I am so unfiltered. And sometimes as a result I say really stupid shit. The truth is if I had a gay son, I would love him just as much as if he was straight ... I might have to try to love even more because I know of the difficulty that he would have in society.      Russell: Having fought for decades for the gay community in their struggle to be treated fairly and with dignity, I think you know you crossed the line. However, I know you...I know you very well. And I know that deep down inside there is no hate in your heart.      Tracy: Of all the sicknesses, there is probably none more abusive than homophobia. My heart is committed to giving everyone the same rights that I deserve for myself. I don't care if you love the same sex as long as you have the ability to love someone. Also, you should have the right no matter who you are to protect and serve our country. I am deeply sorry for the comments I made. What I am most sad about is the comments I made about kids and bullying. I would never want any young person to think that I wasn't on their side and if any young person thinks they can bully a young gay kid, come see me at 30 Rock.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Hondo Movie plot: The story takes place at some point between 1869 and 1877 (It is mentioned in the dialogue that Ulysses S. Grant is President). At a remote ranch in the Arizona Territory, homesteader Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six-year-old son Johnny (Lee Aaker) come upon a stranger (John Wayne) on foot, carrying only his saddle bags and a rifle. The man tells them only his last name, Lane, and that he was riding dispatch for the US Army Cavalry. He had lost his horse in an encounter with some Indians. Angie tells Lane her ranch hand had quit before he had a chance to break her two horses for riding, so Lane offers to break a horse himself. He asks where her husband is, and she says he is rounding up cattle in the mountains and should return soon. Lane deduces from the neglected ranch that her husband has been away for some time, a fact she confesses is true. When night falls Angie offers to let Lane sleep in her home. Angie sees his rifle is inscribed \\"Hondo\\" Lane, whom she knows had killed three men the year before. She attempts to shoot him, but due to the first chamber being empty, Hondo is not hurt. He loads the chamber and tells her to keep it that way. Hondo returns to his Cavalry post, where he meets up with his friend Buffalo Baker (Ward Bond). He reports to his commanding officer that C troop, which was sent to gather and bring in settlers to the north, was killed by Apaches. It is clear to the Major (Paul Fix) that the Apaches are raiding and killing settlers. At the ranch, Angie and Johnny are beset by Apaches, led by Chief Vittoro (Michael Pate) and his main under-chief, Silva (Rodolfo Acosta). Angie is not nervous in their presence as they have never attacked her family before. This time, they begin manhandling Angie. Johnny emerges from the house with the pistol and shoots at Silva. As Silva recovers and approaches him, he throws the pistol at Silva. Vittoro is impressed by Johnny's bravery and makes him an Apache blood brother.

Answer:","output":"The company that sponsored the 1995-1996 Premier League season was Carling, a popular British beer brand. Carling's sponsorship of the Premier League lasted from 1993 to 2001 and bestowed the full title \\"FA Carling Premiership\\" upon the league during this duration. Carling is a brand of lager produced by the brewing company Molson Coors Beverage Company, which has an extensive history that can be traced back to multiple locations and companies. Molson Coors Beverage Company, as it is known today, was formed by the merger of Canadian company Molson and American company Coors in 2005. To determine the beginnings of Carling sponsorship, we need to examine the history of both Molson and Coors. The Molson part of the company finds its roots in Montreal, Canada, where it was founded in 1786 by John Molson. It is one of the oldest brewing companies in North America and holds a strong market presence in Canada. Coors, on the other hand, was founded in 1873 by Adolph Coors in Golden, Colorado, United States. Coors was a well-established brand in the American beer market before joining forces with Molson. However, the Carling brand itself originated in London, Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1840 by Thomas Carling as the Worts and Carling brewery. Later in 1952, the brand was bought by Canadian Breweries Limited (CBL), which subsequently became Carling O'Keefe in 1973. Eventually, in 1989, Carling O'Keefe merged with Molson, paving the way for Carling to become a part of the Molson Coors Beverage Company. Therefore, to answer the question, the company that sponsored the 1995-1996 Premier League, Carling, finds its origins in London, Ontario, Canada, where it was founded in 1840. However, it should be noted that the contemporary company responsible for the brand, Molson Coors Beverage Company, has a diverse history that combines the heritages of Molson (founded in Montreal, Canada) and Coors (founded in Golden, Colorado, United States)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: We all know how important human life is--it's priceless. Firstly, we can tell you that the lives of your relatives could depend on your ability to give first aid. If you think highly of human's life, this article is for you! Here you can find information about first aid. The very first thing that you should do when you see an accident is to _ the situation and prevent further dangerous incidents. First of all, you have to recognize what has happened and what the dangers to rescuers and victims are. Think about how to take care of the victims. Helping usually takes place in very difficult conditions and injuries can be very bad. Therefore, you cannot be too afraid of making mistakes to help. Sometimes you have to face the fact that regardless of   your actions and your efforts the victim's condition might not improve--he or she could even die. In some cases even professional medical aid may not succeed. If you have done everything you think you should do, you shouldn't feel guilty. Do not expose yourself to danger. Giving first aid can be dangerous. While trying to help a victim, do not forget about your own safety. If something happens to you, you won't be able to help anyone. Call for help after you find out the condition of a victim. But remember if a victim faints   due to breathing failure caused by drowning, choking or poisoning, you should first take action that helps to bring back the heartbeat and breathing. While calling, talk shortly but clearly. Always provide the following information--the location of the accident, the kind of accident, the number of the injured and your full name and phone number and so on. Question: What can be inferred from the passage? Answer: Answer:","output":"From the passage, it can be inferred that: 1. Human life is invaluable, and providing first aid in emergency situations can be critical in saving someone's life. 2. When encountering an accident, it is important to assess the situation and prioritize the safety of both the rescuer and the victim. 3. Fear of making mistakes should not hold a person back from offering help in difficult conditions. 4. It is essential to understand that despite one's best efforts, the outcome may be unsuccessful, and professional medical aid may not always guarantee improvement. 5. Prioritizing the rescuer's safety is vital, as they cannot help the victim if they themselves are in danger. 6.

Higher pressure would most likely lead to the accelerated conversion of buried plant and animal remains into hydrocarbons, as more pressure could facilitate the rearrangement of carbon atoms into a new substance.

Premise: \\"I am ready to redeem him!\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"I am prepared to redeem him!\\" true?","output":"When analyzing the given premise, \\"I am ready to redeem him!\\", and comparing it with the hypothesis, \\"I am prepared to redeem him!\\", it is essential to consider the definitions and implications of the terms \\"ready\\" and \\"prepared.\\" Although the two words are often used interchangeably, on closer inspection, we can observe subtle differences that may affect the validity of the hypothesis based on the premise.  First, let's examine the meaning of the word \\"ready.\\" In this context, \\"ready\\" refers to the state of being willing and able to take action or proceed with a task. It implies that the speaker is equipped or mentally prepared to engage in a given action, which, in this case, is the process of redeeming the mentioned individual. The word \\"prepared,\\" on the other hand, corresponds to the state of having made arrangements or plans to do something ahead of time. It typically involves acquiring the necessary knowledge, resources, and tools to execute a particular task successfully. Therefore, \\"prepared\\" suggests that the speaker has not only the willingness but also the means to accomplish the stated objective.  Despite their subtle differences, \\"ready\\" and \\"prepared\\" share similar connotations because they both denote certain degrees of mental, emotional, or physical readiness to undertake a given task. Consequently, a person described as being \\"ready\\" for a specific action may also be perceived as \\"prepared\\" to carry it out, and vice versa, depending on the context. In light of this, we can now address the original question: Based on the premise \\"I am ready to redeem him!\\", is the hypothesis \\"I am prepared to redeem him!\\" true?  When we consider that both \\"ready\\" and \\"prepared\\" suggest a certain level of willingness and capability for a task, it is reasonable to assume that being in the state of readiness involves some degree of preparation. Even though the premise explicitly states that the speaker is \\"ready\\" to redeem the individual, the underlying implication that the speaker possesses the necessary resources or mental fortitude can still be inferred. Under this assumption, the hypothesis \\"I am prepared to redeem him!\\" can be considered accurate to a certain extent. While the specific details of the preparations may not be explicitly mentioned in either the premise or the hypothesis, the willingness and capability needed to pursue the act of redemption remain consistent across both statements. Therefore, from a semantic perspective, we can conclude that the hypothesis is likely true, based on the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Fact 1: If an object in a fluid is more dense than that fluid then that object will sink in that fluid because of gravity.  Fact 2: Water is usually the best fluid.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"an object will sink in what if it's more dense?\\" with the following options:  - water  - gravity  - calcite  - wood  - liquid  - rain  - outer space  - crust Answer:","output":"To answer the question \\"an object will sink in what if it's more dense?\\", let's go through the options: 1. Water: Fact 2 states that water is usually the best fluid. Fact 1 indicates that an object more dense than a fluid will sink in that fluid. Since water is a fluid, if the object's density is more than water, it will sink in it. So, this is a possible answer. 2. Gravity: Gravity is a force, not a fluid. Therefore, objects do not sink in gravity. Discard this option. 3. Calcite: Calcite is a mineral, not a fluid. Discard this option. 4. Wood: Wood is a solid material, not a fluid. Discard this option. 5. Liquid: Liquid is a general term for fluids, but it does not specify the particular fluid. Since Fact 2 suggests that water is the best fluid, it's better to choose water as the fluid where the denser object will sink. Keep this option but prioritize water. 6. Rain: Rain is a form of water, but in individual droplets, not a continuous fluid body. Discard this option. 7. Outer space: Outer space is a vacuum, but it does have microgravity. Objects do not sink in outer space as they would in a fluid due to the lack of gravity. Discard this option. 8. Crust: Crust is a solid, not a fluid. Discard this option. Considering the analysis of all options, the answer should be water, as it matches with both Fact 1 and Fact 2. Thus, an object will sink in water if it's more dense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: Upcycle your aluminum cans into planters. How would you accomplish this goal? Available options: i. Cut the top and bottom off the can and rinse well. Fold the aluminum lip down on both sides and fill with dirt. Add plant.. ii. Cut the top off the can and rinse well. Fold the aluminum lip down and fill with dirt. Add plant..","output":"To accomplish the goal of upcycling aluminum cans into planters, you may choose from the two available options mentioned. Both methods are great for repurposing aluminum cans and giving them a new life as functional planters. The primary difference between the two options is whether you cut off only the top or both the top and bottom. Here, I will provide a detailed comparison between the two methods and a step-by-step guide on how to proceed with each option. Option i: Cut the top and bottom off the can and rinse well. Fold the aluminum lip down on both sides and fill with dirt. Add plant. Pros: 1. Better drainage: As the bottom of the can is removed, this method provides better drainage for the plants compared to Option ii. It helps prevent waterlogging and root rot in the planter. 2. More decorative options: You can decorate the can by painting the exterior, or you can intertwine multiple cans to create unique planters. Cons: 1. Requires a stable base: You need to place the can on a stable and flat base, like a tray or saucer since it does not have a bottom. This adds an extra step to ensure the planter is appropriately set up. Step-by-step guide: 1. Gather your materials: an aluminum can, a can opener, a pair of gloves, a pair of pliers, scissors, a file or sandpaper, a clean cloth, dirt or potting mix, your chosen plant, and a tray or dish to act as the planter's base. 2. Use the can opener to carefully remove the top and bottom of the aluminum can. Wear gloves to protect your hands. 3. Use the pliers and scissors to fold the aluminum lip down on both sides, creating a relatively smooth edge. Make sure there are no sharp edges. 4. Rinse the can well with water and dry it using a clean cloth. 5. File or sand the edges of the can to eliminate any remaining sharp points. 6. Place the can on a flat and stable base, such as a tray or saucer. 7. Fill the can with dirt or potting mix. 8. Dig a hole in the dirt to plant your seed or transplant your chosen plant. Option ii: Cut the top off the can and rinse well. Fold the aluminum lip down and fill with dirt. Add plant. Pros: 1. Easier setup: Since the bottom of the can is intact, you can place the planter on any surface without requiring an extra tray or dish. 2. Good for shallow-rooted plants: This method is ideal for plants with shallow root systems that do not require extremely well-draining soil. Cons: 1. Limited drainage: Depending on the can, drainage might be limited which can lead to issues such as waterlogging. Step-by-step guide: 1. Gather your materials: an aluminum can, a can opener, a pair of gloves, a pair of pliers, scissors, a file or sandpaper, a clean cloth, dirt or potting mix, and your chosen plant. 2. Use the can opener to carefully remove the top of the aluminum can. Wear gloves to protect your hands. 3. Use the pliers and scissors to fold the aluminum lip down, creating a relatively smooth edge. Make sure there are no sharp edges. 4. Rinse the can well with water and dry it using a clean cloth. 5. File or sand the edges of the can to eliminate any remaining sharp points. 6. Optionally, drill a few small drainage holes in the bottom of the can to allow excess water to escape. 7. Fill the can with dirt or potting mix. 8. Dig a hole in the dirt to plant your seed or transplant your chosen plant. Both options offer unique benefits and are suited for different plants and setups. To choose the best option for you, consider the specific requirements of the plants you want to grow and the preferred aesthetic of your space, whether indoors or outdoors. With either choice, you are giving new life to aluminum cans and promoting sustainability, all while creating beautiful planters to brighten up your environment."},{"instruction":"USS Hingham (PF-30) a Tacoma-class frigate was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Hingham Massachusetts.

When Johnny Quinlan loses his job in a drug store, he is afraid to tell his wife, Bertha, and therefore keeps up the pretense of leaving each morning for a non-existent job, as he begins the search for a new job. As the days pass and he is unable to find employment, their household, which includes his sister, Lottie, and Bertha's brother, Dan Walsh, goes through what little savings they have. As he gets more desperate, he agrees to do small jobs for \\"Nifty\\" Herman, a small-time gangster.  Nifty had loaned Johnny 15, as part of a plan to entice him to work for him.  After Johnny gets insulted by a common laborer job offer from a neighbor, Nifty lies to him and says that he has a friend who will get him a managerial position at a liquor store.  All Johnny has to do is hold onto a case of high-priced alcohol for a few days.  Dubious, Johnny reluctantly agrees and takes the suitcase back to his apartment.  However, when Bertha finds out who he got the suitcase from, she demands that he return it, threatening to leave him if he doesn't. Taking the case back to Nifty, he finds the office locked, and so returns home.  When he arrives, his sister's suitor, Charles Newton, is visiting.  Newton is a government agent.  Even though Johnny tries to hide the case, his efforts are futile, and Newton spies it and becomes suspicious, seeing a resemblance to a case he and his men have been attempting to track down.  Opening it, he discovers it contains a cache of drugs.  When he interrogates Johnny, he gets the whole story, and is about to arrest Johnny, when Nifty arrives to retrieve the suitcase.

In England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300, and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million. By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided, but it never really died out in England. Over the next few hundred years, further outbreaks occurred in 1361–1362, 1369, 1379–1383, 1389–1393, and throughout the first half of the 15th century. An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479–1480 could have been as high as 20%. The most general outbreaks in Tudor dynasty and House of Stuart England seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636, and ended with the Great Plague of London in 1665.

OPT: [1]. yes [2]. it is not possible to tell [3]. no","output":"Yes, the statement \\"A black dog sits by two bowls near some tile steps.\\" does mean that \\"Near the steps are a dog and some bowls.\\" When breaking down the statement, we can see the following elements: 1. A black dog: The subject being described is a dog that is black. 2. Sits: The dog's position is sitting. 3. By two bowls: The dog is located near two bowls, which associates the dog and the bowls spatially. 4. Near some tile steps: This part of the statement describes the dog's position and, subsequently, the bowls' position as being close to some tile steps. By dissecting the phrase, it is clear that the dog and the two bowls are in proximity to the tile steps. Therefore, the statement \\"Near the steps are a dog and some bowls.\\" is an accurate depiction of the original sentence. It might also be important to note that while the second statement is true, it does not mention the dog's color, which was specified as black in the original statement.

Steve Way celebrated with his first pint of lager for three months after breaking a 35-year-old British record to finish 10th in the Commonwealth Games marathon. The bank worker from Bournemouth weighed 16-and-a-half stone seven years ago, but has given up his ‘couch potato lifestyle’ — smoking 20 days cigarettes a day, boozing and eating junk food — to shed nearly half his body weight and take his place among the elite. The 40-year-old’s time of 2hr 15min 16sec yesterday smashed Ron Hill’s 1979 best for over-40s. Way was the second British man home after Scotland’s Derek Hawkins, who finished ninth. Personal best: Steve Way completed a remarkable turnaround by finishing 10th in the marathon. Post-race recovery: Way used to weigh more than 16st and smoke 20 cigarettes a day before changing his lifestyle to become a marathon runner. Pleased: Steve Way tweeted shortly after the race describing it as the 'Best day ever' Going the distance: Steve Way will represent England in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. ‘I need to go have a drink and I’m not talking about water,’ said Way. ‘I’m going to have a pint or few as I haven’t had one for three months. ‘I can’t go completely off the rails because I’ve got a 90-kilometre (55-mile) race in Sweden at the end of August. ‘I’m absolutely delighted. This is the best day ever. Running is normally second place to my wedding day but this one matches it. ‘My wife Sarah won’t mind because my goals were top 10, personal best, British record and I’ve managed all three so I’ve couldn’t have hoped for a better day. ‘I hope I’m an inspiration. There are quite a few people out there that say they are getting themselves off the couch, getting out the door and seeing whether there is a marathon runner hidden underneath that couch potato.’ Way’s England team-mates Nicholas Torry, 37, and Ben Moreau, 32, finished 13th and 14th respectively. Australia’s Michael Shelley, who never bothers to look at a marathon course before he runs it, won gold with a time of 2hr 11min 15sec. Shelley, 30, won silver in Delhi four years ago in only his second outing over 26.2miles and on Sunday became the second man after Steve Moneghetti, Australia’s chef de mission in Glasgow, to reach the podium in consecutive Commonwealth Games. Turnaround: Steve Way was overweight and unhealthy before he changed his life through running. Shelley took up running because his parents did not want him to play contact sports after he was born with a hole in his diaphragm. The Australian said: ‘To come back and win now I’ve got a bit more experience is indescribable. It was a dream. I can’t believe it.’ Stephen Chemlany finished 43secs behind Shelley. He won Kenya’s first medal of these Games, but there were two more shortly afterwards in the women’s marathon as Flomena Cheyech Daniel, 32, took gold and Caroline Kilel, 33, won silver. Scotland’s Susan Partridge was the first British runner home in sixth place, with England’s Louise Damen seventh and Amy Whitehead ninth. The third English runner, Alyson Dixon, retired with a calf injury.

(CNN) -- Sevilla have sacked coach Manolo Jimenez after their disappointing home draw to bottom-club Xerez on Tuesday extended the club's winless run to seven games. Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \\"done what I had to.\\" He told the club's official Web site: \\"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \\"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible. However it is obvious that he could not get a response out of the team. \\"Fortunately we believe that there is time. The growth and the ambition of the club is shown in the change of the manager. We are fighting for important things.\\" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February.

Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Ravens the Dolphins played on home ground for an AFC duel with the Titans. In the first quarter the Dolphins took the lead as RB Ronnie Brown got a 2-yard TD run. The Titans replied with RB Chris Johnson getting a 17-yard TD run. They fell behind after kicker Rob Bironas nailed a 40-yard field goal. They eventually took the lead after kicker Dan Carpenter made a 23 and a 26-yard field goal, which was soon followed by QB Chad Henne completing a 13-yard TD pass to RB Patrick Cobbs. The Titans replied with QB Vince Young completing a 14-yard TD pass to WR Nate Washington, but the Dolphins continued to score after Carpenter got a 42-yard field goal, followed by QB Tyler Thigpen making a 9-yard TD pass to TE Anthony Fasano (With a failed 2-point conversion). Then FS Reshad Jones intercepted a pass in the end zone for a touchback. Answer this question: How many more field goals did Carpenter make than Bironas?","output":"First, we need to identify the number of field goals each kicker made in the summary. Dan Carpenter made a 23-yard, a 26-yard, and a 42-yard field goal. That's a total of 3 field goals. Rob Bironas made a 40-yard field goal. That's a total of 1 field goal. Now we can compare the number of field goals between the two kickers. Carpenter made 3 field goals - Bironas made 1 field goal = 2 more field goals by Carpenter than Bironas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: The death penalty is deterrance for the rest of society, both criminals, potential crimanals, and average citizens. A:","output":"Part #1: Assess the quality of an argument Usage: In the sample provided: \\"The death penalty is deterrence for the rest of society, both criminals, potential criminals, and average citizens\\", we need to assess whether the statement makes a clear, understandable point. This statement meets the criteria as it implies that the existence of the death penalty can serve as a preventative measure that discourages individuals (criminals, potential criminals, and average citizens) from engaging in criminal behavior that would warrant such a sentence. This statement is clearly understandable and makes a point regarding a potential benefit of the death penalty.  Part #2: Determine if the argument is valid Usage: The argument validity is evaluated, in this case \\"The death penalty is deterrence for the rest of society, both criminals, potential criminals, and average citizens\\" is a valid argument because it is clearly interpretable, expresses an argument, and is specifically related to the topic of death penalty. Part #3: Check if the argument is on the topic of death penalty Usage: The sample argument is on the topic of death penalty since it discusses possible effects of death penalty on different sections of society.

Write the last sentence in this story. Washington (CNN) -- Democratic and Republican leaders don't see eye to eye on much these days. But political veterans on both sides of the aisle do agree on one point -- the stakes are high in the rapidly approaching 2014 midterm races. For Democrats, the midterms are all about holding their slim Senate majority and, if possible, defying historical odds by retaking the House of Representatives. They want to give President Barack Obama a working congressional majority for his last two years in office to help secure his legacy and lay the best possible groundwork for the party's standard bearer in 2016. \\" OPTIONS: - Barack Obama have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns. - CNN have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns. - Democratic have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns. - Democrats have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns. - GOP have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns. - House of Representatives have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns. - Obamacare have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns. - Republican have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns. - Senate have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns. - Washington have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns.","output":"Democrats have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns.

Write a text based on this summary: israeli deputy pm warns of iranian nuclear threat Text:","output":"Title: Israeli Deputy PM Sounds Alarm on Iranian Nuclear Threat In a recent statement, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister, [Deputy PM's Name], has expressed growing concerns over the potential Iranian nuclear threat to the region and the world. Citing new intelligence, [Deputy PM's Name] emphasized the urgency of addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions, which have long been a point of contention within the international community. According to the Deputy PM, Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear capabilities pose a serious danger to Israel and its allies, prompting heightened concern amongst Israeli officials. The restoration of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has not doused the fears, as [Deputy PM's Name] believes it may not be sufficient to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear program. Given Iran's past approach to nuclear development and frequent references to Israel as its enemy, Israeli officials are taking this threat seriously. The Deputy PM's warning came after a series of high-profile meetings, where the issue was discussed in depth with regional and global leaders, including US representatives. The Israeli government urges the international community to adopt a proactive approach in dealing with this potential threat. [Deputy PM's Name] suggested adopting tougher sanctions on Iran, alongside vigilance in monitoring the country's nuclear activities. He further emphasized the need for cooperation among the world powers, including the United States, European Union and the Middle East countries, in working collectively towards ensuring the safety and security of the region. In conclusion, the Israeli Deputy PM's warning of an imminent Iranian nuclear threat highlights the precarious state of affairs in the Middle East. As Iran continues to advance its nuclear capabilities, it is crucial for the international community to join forces in addressing this burgeoning crisis. By working together, countries can adopt focused strategies aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions and ensuring long-term stability and peace in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... Question: After the cancellation was announced, how did the people of North Korea feel about it? Answer: A:","output":"It is difficult to accurately determine the feelings of the people of North Korea after the cancellation of the joint military exercises, as the country is known for its strict control over information dissemination and public opinion. However, it can be assumed that North Koreans likely viewed the cancellation positively, as their government has long called for the end of these joint military exercises, claiming that they are offensive \\"rehearsals for war.\\" The North Korean government might have framed the cancellation as a sign of progress towards reducing tensions and building trust with the United States and South Korea. Furthermore, the decision to cancel the exercises could also have been seen as a step towards denuclearization and fostering diplomatic relations, demonstrating that the negotiations between the three countries have the potential to yield positive outcomes. Nonetheless, it is vital to keep in mind that the exact sentiment of the North Korean people cannot be definitively determined due to the nation's secretive nature and restrictions on the flow of information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the U.S. Army as a private at Fort Chaffee, near Fort Smith, Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers then accompanied him into the fort. Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military stint, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else: \\"The Army can do anything it wants with me.\\"Presley commenced basic training at Fort Hood, Texas. During a two-week leave in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley, granted emergency leave to visit her, arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure, aged 46. Presley was devastated; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.After training, Presley joined the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, on October 1. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant. He became \\"practically evangelical about their benefits\\", not only for energy but for \\"strength\\" and weight loss as well, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging. The Army also introduced Presley to karate, which he studied seriously, training with Jürgen Seydel. It became a lifelong interest, which he later included in his live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier, despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased TV sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu. They would eventually marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24-month spell as a GI would ruin his career....

This can create a ripple effect, generating positivity and motivation among their social circles. 6. Environmentally Conscious Choices: Motivated by the newly discovered enthusiasm for painting, some may research and opt for eco-friendly painting materials and practices.

Given those answer options, answer the question: One summer when I was 8 years old my father, mother, and I were rear ended by a 16 year old boy in a pickup truck. Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it. Williamson County population : 226,257 Wayne County population : 16,583 I ran a business with my father, graduated from a high school that was ranked 24/273 instead of one ranked of 223/273 in the state. The woman I married would not be the same, nor where I live and the lifestyle I now live, the jobs I have been able to get, the places I have been able to go, traveling around the US and to Canada and soon further abroad. The amazing things that I have experienced in my life are a pretty direct effect of some 16 year old kid not paying attention and rear ending my family.

Based on the premise \\"Good-bye, and good luck.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"You are forbidden to leave, lest you be struck by a terrible curse.\\" is true?","output":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"You are forbidden to leave, lest you be struck by a terrible curse.\\" based on the premise \\"Good-bye, and good luck.\\", let's analyze the statements step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the elements of the premise. In the premise, there are two main elements: 1. \\"Good-bye\\" - This indicates a farewell or a situation in which someone is leaving. 2. \\"Good luck\\" - This indicates a wish for success or positive outcomes for the person who is leaving. Step 2: Compare the elements of the premise to the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"You are forbidden to leave, lest you be struck by a terrible curse.\\" This implies that leaving is prohibited and may result in a negative consequence, which is a curse. Step 3: Evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Upon analysis, the premise does not support the hypothesis. The premise suggests a positive or at least neutral attitude towards the person leaving, as shown by wishing them good luck. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a negative consequence for leaving, which contradicts the sentiment expressed in the premise. Conclusion: Based on the premise \\"Good-bye, and good luck.\\", we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"You are forbidden to leave, lest you be struck by a terrible curse.\\" is true. The premise does not provide any evidence that supports the hypothesis, and in fact, it contradicts the suggested negative outcome of leaving."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: Let's hear it for \\"the man of the moment, the man of the millennium.\\" That man is Narendra Modi, and those are the words with which an Australian public servant introduced India's Prime Minister in Brisbane on Sunday. \\"Modi, Modi, Modi,\\" chanted the crowd. The adulation didn't end there. The next day, Modi was in Sydney, delivering a speech to an audience of 16,000 at the Allphones Arena. \\"You're a rock star!\\" shrieked an excited fan as the event beamed across millions of television screens in India and around the world. And so it was that #Rockstar and #ModiInAustralia began trending on Twitter. Tuesday: new city, new audience. Modi pitched up at the Australian Parliament in Canberra. He spoke in English this time, highlighting the linguistic and cultural commonalities between India and Australia -- almost as if to suggest India was a better trading partner than China. \\"Australia has immense opportunities to participate in India's progress. ... India will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities,\\" Modi declared. Is India really the one-stop answer? And is Modi really the man of the millennium? The hype seems to be reaching dangerous levels. There's no denying that Modi has generated immense excitement in India and abroad. Rightfully so. Here, finally, is an Indian leader who says the things Indians have been yearning to hear. He talks about faster growth, creating jobs, about a smartphone in every hand, a toilet in every home, clean streets, leaner and more transparent government. And boy, can he talk. In Hindi, in Gujarati, in English, Modi seems to know exactly what his audience wants to hear. In that sense he is indeed a rock star, riffing on his key anthems at every big speech. But can he deliver the runaway platinum sales Indians now seem to expect? We're beginning to see the first signs of questions being asked. Earlier this month, at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in New Delhi, top industrialist Anand Mahindra told CNN that Modi's \\"honeymoon period is over.\\" When CNN spoke with Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, he seemed to dial back on expectations of big reforms, saying \\"people with their sense of wisdom will be able to appreciate\\" the cumulative effect of the government's smaller steps. And then there are the questions of Modi himself. At the inauguration of a hospital in Mumbai last month, Modi made a speech, played out live on many Indian TV channels. Curiously, one bit was ignored by the Indian press. Speaking of the Hindu god Ganesha -- who is depicted as having an elephant's head -- Modi claimed that Ganesha's half-man, half-elephant body was evidence that ancient Indian doctors were experts at the art of plastic surgery. Seriously? The Indian TV anchor and journalist Karan Thapar was one of the few to raise an eyebrow. \\"He believes in digital India, wants to import bullet trains and 'Make in India' state-of-the-art (defense) weaponry,\\" Thapar wrote. \\"These are 21st-century ambitions. How does all of that sit alongside this belief in unverified mythology?\\" He added, \\"The silence of the media is deeply disturbing. It feels as though it's been deliberately blanked out by everyone.\\" I doubt there's a larger media conspiracy only to portray Modi positively. But the media do need to take a step back and question the rock-star levels of adulation. Modi has gotten India dreaming. Who knows, those dreams may even be realized one day. But in Modi's seven months as Prime Minister so far, rhetoric and big plans aside, nothing has really changed. For hundreds of millions of poor Indians, it is still the same India. Basic infrastructure is still subpar; there are no social safety nets on health care or pensions; India is still an immensely frustrating place to live and work. And that's the tip of an enormous iceberg. India could take decades to change. We all need to remember that. So do Modi's fans. Highlights:","output":"- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has generated immense excitement in India and abroad due to his speeches on faster growth, job creation, improved infrastructure, and transparent government. - However, some critics argue that Modi's focus on ancient mythology detracts from his 21st-century ambitions and question whether his proposed reforms can be sustained. - Despite the excitement, Modi's first seven months as Prime Minister haven't seen significant change yet, with hundreds of millions of Indians still struggling with poverty, subpar infrastructure, and lack of social safety nets. - While Modi's impact on India is undeniable, caution is necessary in terms of expectations for progress and change, which could take decades to materialize in a country as massive and diverse as India."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Ira Gershwin (December 6, 1896 August 17, 1983) was an American lyricist who collaborated with his younger brother, composer George Gershwin, to create some of the most memorable songs of the 20th century.  - Guy Reginald Bolton (23 November 1884  4 September 1979) was an Anglo-American playwright and writer of musical comedies.

For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat.  Customers bought two types of electrical ovens, type A and type B.

First question: Which is faster: rsync or scp? Second question: What is rsync speedup? Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPTIONS: * no; * yes;","output":"First question: I will compare the two utilities to determine which is faster. rsync and scp are both utilities used for copying files between remote systems. rsync is typically faster than scp because it uses delta-transfer algorithm which only transfers the differences between the source and destination files, rather than transferring entire files. Additionally, rsync can compress the data during transfer, further reducing transfer times. Second question: I will define rsync speedup and provide examples. Rsync speedup is a measure of how much faster rsync is when compared to other file transfer methods, particularly when updating existing files. Speedup is calculated by comparing the total size of the files being updated to the amount of data actually transferred during the update. A significant speedup occurs when the majority of the files remain unchanged and only a small portion of the files need to be updated. For example, if you have 100 MB of files, but only 5 MB of them have been updated, rsync will only transfer the changed 5 MB. In this scenario, the rsync speedup would be 20x (100 MB / 5 MB) compared to transferring the entire files. No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is comparing the speed of rsync and scp, while the second question is defining the concept of rsync speedup.

Process: - Magma is formed when rock melts inside the Earth&#x27;s crust - Magma rises - Collects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano - Pressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill - Gain energy for eruption - Some of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes) - If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky it will trap gases - Results in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense - If the magma is thin and runs - The magma results in a low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of a violent eruption -   Question: suppose there is more oxygen produced happens, how will it affect MORE or GREATER eruptions.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"The presence or increase in oxygen levels wouldn't directly lead to more, less, or no effect on volcanic eruptions. Volcanic eruptions primarily depend on the geological activities and conditions within the Earth’s crust, such as the subduction of tectonic plates, the temperature, and pressure in the mantle, and the type of magma involved. The composition of the magma (including its gas content, viscosity, and temperature) primarily determines the type and intensity of the volcanic eruption. In the context of volcanic processes, oxygen could play a role in the oxidation state of the magma. This refers to the amount of oxygen available for chemical reactions, which can influence the composition of the magma. However, oxygen being produced in greater quantities on the surface of the Earth does not strongly imply a change in the oxygen levels deep in the Earth’s crust or mantle, where magma forms. Certain gases such as sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and water vapor are more directly influencing the explosivity of the eruptions. They can increase the pressure within a volcano when they are dissolved in magma, and a sudden release of these pressurized gases can cause a violent eruption. In essence, an increase in the production of oxygen wouldn't necessarily result in more or greater eruptions unless it substantially altered the oxidative state of the magma, which is unlikely given the involved depths and temperatures. Therefore, more oxygen production typically should have minimal to no immediate effect on the frequency or intensity of volcanic eruptions. Hence, the closest answer to this would be (C: no effect), but it's crucial to remember that the actual impact would also depend on many other factors like temperature, pressure, and the existing geological conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: how many innings in overtime in baseball I found the following answer on Google: According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the term innings has been used in reference to cricket since at least 1735. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the information you found in the Oxford English Dictionary does not answer your question regarding how many innings in overtime in baseball. They seem to be discussing the term's origin in relation to cricket rather than baseball. In baseball, there is no designated number of innings for overtime. Instead, the game continues into extra innings until one team is ahead at the end of a completed inning. After the completion of the standard nine innings, if the two teams are tied, they will proceed to play additional innings as required. During these extra innings, each team is given the opportunity to bat and score runs, just as they would during the first nine innings. The extra innings are played until a winner is determined - a team outscoring the other at the end of a completed extra inning. In some cases, this could take only one extra inning, while in others, it may take several more innings for a team to outscore the other and ultimately win the game. It should be noted that in Major League Baseball (MLB) regular-season games, a new rule was implemented in 2020 to speed up the game during extra innings. This rule places a runner on second base to start each extra inning, increasing the chances for faster run scoring and reducing the duration of overtime games. In summary, there is no fixed number of innings in overtime (extra innings) in baseball.

Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Dan found three rattle snakes: one only had one rattle, the second snake had 4 rattles and the third snake had seven rattles on its tail.  and a hint : At birth, a rattlesnake hatchling has only a small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached to the tip of the tail.[13] The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time.[14] A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.[15]  Please answer this question : Which snake had more segments, the first or the second snake Dan found? Answer:","output":"The second snake that Dan found had more segments.  According to the hint provided, a rattlesnake is born with a small button or 'primordial rattle' on its tail. The first segment is added when the snake sheds its skin for the first time, and each subsequent shedding of the skin adds a new segment to the rattle. Taking this information into account, let's analyze the situation of the two snakes: 1. The first snake had only one rattle. This indicates that it has only the primordial rattle plus one additional segment added after its first shedding of skin. Therefore, the first snake has a total of 2 segments (1 primordial rattle + 1 from the first shedding).  2. The second snake had four rattles. This suggests that it has gone through more shedding cycles, with the primordial rattle and three additional segments added after each shedding of its skin. So, the second snake has a total of 5 segments (1 primordial rattle + 3 from subsequent sheddings). Comparing the two, it's clear that the second snake has more segments (5) than the first snake (2)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Zhang Heng (Chinese: Zhang Heng ; AD 78-139), formerly romanized as Chang Heng, was a Han Chinese polymath from Nanyang who lived during the Han dynasty. Educated in the capital cities of Luoyang and Chang'an, he achieved success as an astronomer, mathematician, scientist, engineer, inventor, geographer, cartographer, artist, poet, statesman, and literary scholar. Zhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. Zhang Heng's mechanical inventions influenced later Chinese inventors such as Yi Xing, Zhang Sixun, Su Song, and Guo Shoujing. Su Song directly named Zhang's water-powered armillary sphere as the inspiration for his 11th-century clock tower. The cosmic model of nine points of Heaven corresponding with nine regions of earth conceived in the work of the scholar-official Chen Hongmou (1696-1771) followed in the tradition of Zhang's book Spiritual Constitution of the Universe. The seismologist John Milne, who created the modern seismograph in 1876 alongside Thomas Gray and James A. Ewing at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo, commented in 1886 on Zhang Heng's contributions to seismology. The historian Joseph Needham emphasized his contributions to pre-modern Chinese technology, stating that Zhang was noted even in his day for being able to \\"make three wheels rotate as if they were one.\\" More than one scholar has described Zhang as a polymath. However, some scholars also point out that Zhang's writing lacks concrete scientific theories. Comparing Zhang with his contemporary, Ptolemy (83-161) of Roman Egypt, Jin Guantao, Fan Hongye, and Liu Qingfeng state:  Based on the theories of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed on the basis of his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.  Here we can see how important the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry as a model for the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.","output":"This text is about Zhang Heng, a Han Chinese polymath who lived during the Han dynasty.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Determine the sentiment: Yesterday I attended the world premiere of \\"Descent\\" at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC. I had a great time. It was sold out and attended by all the major stars including fellow my-spacer Marcus Patrick. I give the movie 7.5 starts out of a possible 10 stars. The movie begins with Maya (Rosario Dawson) at college. You can envision the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on. The photography in this film was excellent. She meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they become sweethearts. It appears like any other relationship in the beginning. The man is in quest of the woman's attention and affection and the woman is playing hard to get. Both played this well. Very innocent flirtation between the two. He invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart. The apartment is very dreary and dark. They eventually end up in the basement which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles. This actually reminded me of a dungeon. Here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her. This is a very dark and gritty rape scene. This scene is not for the young or weak at heart. The rape scene is a little long and hard to take, but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows. Maya now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex. She falls into her own abyss. She starts attending the wildest of parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no recollection on how she got there. She is told to go see Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say \\"he is the person who saves anyone who needs saving\\". He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs. They begin a relationship of dependency which comes into play later in the movie. The club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise. I thought they were well done and I noticed that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the showing during the credits by the audience. Maya is then back in college as a TA and who is in her class -- Jared her rapist!! You could see the confusion and emotion on Maya's face. What should I do?? What do I do next?? The shots of her face and the emotions are priceless. What unfolds next is not actually whats happening. She acts interested in Jared. She appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweethearts again. I was sitting there saying could this really be happening. It wasn't. Nothing could be farther from the truth. She invites him to her apartment and of course, he shows up. Now her apartment is dark and gritty. She has him strip down completely. He thinks he's going to get \\"lucky\\". She then teases him like any woman can. She's caressing him everywhere and he's getting excited. Note:: for anyone who plans on seeing this movie this scene is full frontal nudity - may not be right for the younger viewer. She then turns the situation around and she becomes the beast and proceeds to rape him. Once again, the scene is dark, gritty, and very rough. If you are going to see the movie and don't want to know what happens next, skip this paragraph and go on to the last paragraph. This is where Adrian reenters the picture. Maya has Adrian save(?) her by performing extremely rough male sex with Jared. She thinks this is the final revenge. Adrian continues to take all of Jared's manhood and strips his dignity to nothing. Marcus, as Adrian, plays this scene as believable as anyone can. He is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out all over the screen. After the movie, during a Q&A session, Marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya believes that this revenge will save her but I don't think it does. One of the final scenes has a closeup of Mays's face and you see a tear roll down her cheek. This was a fabulous closeup scene and evokes constant discussion from anyone who goes to see this movie. Did she get the revenge she wanted?? Was it as satisfying as she expected?? In my opinion, it does not. It only makes matters worse. This is an excellent movie, will well acted roles, and I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it. I would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years of age. Rosario, Chad, and Marcus should be commended for jobs well done. The directing and photography must also be commended. It was a night that I enjoyed.","output":"The person talking about the movie is sharing their feelings or what they experienced when they watched the movie.

Francis Piol Bol Bok (born February 1979), a Dinka tribesman and native of South Sudan, was a slave for ten years but is now an abolitionist and author living in the United States. On May 15, 1986, he was captured and enslaved at the age of seven during an Arab militia raid on the village of Nyamlel in South Sudan during the Second Sudanese Civil War. Bok lived in bondage for ten years before escaping imprisonment in Kurdufan, Sudan, followed by a journey to the United States by way of Cairo, Egypt. Bok was aided by people of diverse cultures and faiths in his journey to freedom. Francis Bok waited three years, until 1996, before he tried to escape again. During the intervening three years he tended to the herds and regained Giemma's trust. Giemma regularly praised Bok's work with the animals yet still forced him to live a life of slavery.  Bok finally escaped from Giemma when he was 17 years old by walking through the forest to the nearby market town of Mutari. Bok went to the local police department to seek help, and asked the police to help him find his people. Instead of helping him, the police made him their slave for two months. Bok escaped from the police by simply taking their donkeys to the well, tying them, and leaving them behind as he walked into the crowded marketplace.  Bok asked a man with a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to transport Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein in the back of his truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok.

Article: The State Council submitted   a bill which aims to allow couples to have two children if either parent is an only child. It focuses on adjusting and improving the family planning policy. The State Council argues adjustment to the policy in the face of a steadily declining birth rate. The birth rate has remained relatively low and shows a tendency to fall further. The rate has dropped to between 1.5 and 1.6 since the 1990s, which means each Chinese woman of child-bearing age gives birth to 1.5 to 1.6 children on average. The working population began to drop in 2012 by 3.45 million every year, and it is likely to fall by 8 million each year after 2023. The population aged 60 and above will reach 400 million and account for one-fourth of the total population in the early 2030s, up from one-seventh now. \\"If the current family planning policy continues, the birth rate will continue to fall and lead to a sharp drop of the total population after reaching a peak,\\" said Li Bin, minister in charge of the National Health and Family Planning Commission. \\"It is the right time to make changes: The low birth rate is stable, the working population is still large and the burden of supporting the elderly remains relatively light,\\" he added. An increase in birth is expected if the policy changes but will not seriously affect the food supply, public education, health care or employment. China's food safety and public service plans are designed to meet the needs of 1.43 billion population in 2020 and 1.5 billion in 2033. Even with the policy change, the total population will reach no more than 1.38 billion in 2015, Li said. Question: What can we learn about the population in China from the passage? Options: A: After the year of 2023, the population will become less and less. B: There's no need to carry out the family planning policy. C: At the beginning of 2030s the aging problem will be worse than now. D: In the year 2023, the population may be the least.","output":"From the passage, we can learn the following about the population in China: A: After the year of 2023, the working population will likely experience a decline, falling by 8 million each year.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In fact, the premise and the hypothesis present contrasting views of the situation regarding Joyce's latest outing. Here, we will analyze both the premise and the hypothesis and explore their differences. Premise: \\"But contradictions abound in Joyce's latest outing.\\" The premise suggests that there are numerous contradictions, inconsistencies, or conflicting aspects in Joyce's recent outing. This may refer to contradictions within the plot, characters, or themes. It highlights a sense of confusion, disagreement, and unreliability about the information related to Joyce's outing. To better understand this premise, some examples of potential contradictions could be: 1. Joyce's stated intentions for the outing contradicted their observed behavior during the event. 2. The timeline of the events during the outing may not make logical sense or have inconsistencies. 3. Characters involved in the outing might have contradicting versions of the same events or stories. 4. Multiple aspects of the outing may be in direct conflict with each other, leading to a lack of clarity or coherence. Hypothesis: \\"Everything about Joyce's recent outing made sense and checked out.\\" On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that all aspects of Joyce's recent outing were coherent, logical, and consistent. This implies that there were no disagreements, confusions, or contradictions present in the plot, themes, or characters. Instead, the hypothesis presents a view wherein all elements can be understood and reconciled without any issues. The hypothesis promotes a sense of clarity, coherence, and reliability with regards to the description of Joyce's outing. Based on these analyses, it is apparent that the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as they present opposite views of the same situation. The premise focuses on the presence of contradictions, while the hypothesis emphasizes the absence of any inconsistencies or disagreements. Consequently, accepting one view would negate the other, making it impossible for both statements to be true simultaneously. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is better described as contradictory rather than entailing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Can you tell me the answer to when did three point line start in college??","output":"The three-point line, which is an essential feature in modern basketball, was first introduced in the college basketball scene by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1980. The origin of the three-point line concept dates back to a few years before, and in college basketball, it was officially adopted during the 1980-1981 season. The three-point line's introduction aimed to change the gameplay dynamics by encouraging more perimeter shooting and offering an additional way to score points from distance, thus making the game more exciting for both fans and players alike. It has certainly had a significant impact on basketball strategies and how coaches devise their gameplans. The idea of the three-point line was first proposed by Howard Hobson, a basketball coach at the University of Oregon, in the 1930s. However, it took decades for the concept to be widely implemented and considered an elemental part of the sport. The American Basketball Association (ABA) was the first professional league to introduce the three-point line during the late 1960s. The NCAA introduced the three-point line at a distance of 19 feet, 9 inches (6.02 meters) for both men's and women's college basketball in 1980. With its introduction, several adjustments had to be made, including the spacing of players on offense, and defenders had to work on closing out perimeter shooters, making the game of basketball even more tactical. Over the years, the three-point line's distance in college basketball has been subject to modifications, particularly for the men's game. In 2008, the NCAA increased the distance to 20 feet, 9 inches (6.32 meters), and more recently, in the 2019-2020 season, they extended it further to match the international (FIBA) distance of 22 feet, 1¾ inches (6.75 meters). The current women's college basketball three-point line remains at 20 feet, 9 inches. These changes are intended to make college basketball more closely aligned with international standards and continue to challenge and evolve the skills of both coaches and players. The three-point line has undoubtedly played a significant role in revolutionizing basketball as a sport and fostered the development of a new generation of sharpshooters and more versatile players across college and professional basketball levels around the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We will decide the terms to potential transfers in and out of the club. 'We will involve the manager. That is important for everybody to know. That's why we have been able to not agree to any transfers to date, because we have control of the situation, and anybody who is saying anything else doesn't understand that we are in a strong position with the Saints.' Erik Lamela will not be allowed to leave Tottenham on loan but the club are willing to sell for around £25million. That's the information being. circulated around Italian clubs at the moment and was reported on Sky. Italia on Thursday. Lamela's fortunes may change though under the tutelage of. Mauricio Pochettino, who knows the player well. Spurs misfit. Roberto Soldado remains keen to go with Atletico Madrid very much in the. frame. They have an interest in Romelu Lukaku but the Chelsea striker. is understood to be reluctant to go to Spain. Franco Baldini's role at Tottenham remains under question. Ending their White Hart pain: Erik Lamela can leave Spurs for £25m, while Atletico want Roberto Soldado. Manchester City have taken encouragement in developments with Mehdi Benatia at Roma. Sportsmail reported City's interest in Benatia earlier this month as an alternative to Eiaquim Mangala of Porto who has declared a desire to join Chelsea. Benatia, 27, is facing a fine from his club after an outburst in the Italian papers regarding the club's contract offer. The France-born Morocco defender said: 'I never said I want to leave. But Roma have not kept their promises. They had told me that they would make me a new contract offer if I had a great season. 'My agent is doing his job, I could go away but I could also stay and finish my career in Roma. But I was disappointed (with the new wage offer), I deserved more respect. 'I have received an unacceptable proposal, less than €3million per season. I replied that I would not sign it. Developments: Manchester City target Mehdi Benatia is unhappy with Roma's contract offer. 'I'm in love with Roma, I'm very fine here but my mistake was to be too correct with the club and too honest.' Regarding speculation about him leaving, he added: 'I only said that anyone dreams of teams like Real, Bayern and City. 'My agent is doing his job, I could leave but I could also stay and finish my career in Roma. But I was disappointed (with the new wage offer), I deserved more respect.' City remain interested in Malaga goalkeeper Willy Caballero also as competition for Joe Hart with Costel Pantilimon ready to look at a new club with Arsenal among those to have shown interest - although they have a few names on their list. City are also understood to be exploring the possibility of. signing David Villa for their New York City franchise. Villa, 32, has. just won the Spanish league title and is looking at his next challenge. City's franchise will be ready next year and they are recruiting big. names now. Carles Puyol and Xavi have also been mooted with. both players keen on the MLS project. Sportsmail revealed that David. Beckham was keen to get Xavi involved in his Miami franchise but that. may be too far ahead for the 34-year-old. Xavi is due to hold. talks over his future with new coach Luis Enrique prior to making his. decision. Big cheese in the Big Apple: Manchester City want David Villa (left) to join their New York franchise. Wigan. are showing an interest in Chelsea midfielder George Saville. The. 20-year-old is in the final year of his contract Stamford Bridge and. they are ready to sell rather than loan him out again. Saville had a. successful loan spell at Brentford last season and Uwe Rosler has kept. him mind ahead of his plans for the Championship next season. The German is keen to stay at the DW Stadium and build for promotion again after going so close this year. Saville. is also attracting interest from Wolves and Chelsea would be looking. for around £750,000 with the price eventually rising to £1million. Road to Wigan: Chelsea's George Saville, here on loan at Brentford, is wanted by Uwe Rosler at the DW. Former Liverpool and Oldham. goalkeeper Dean Bouzanis will return to Australia after signing a. two-year A-League deal with the Western Sydney Wanderers. The 23-year-old has spent the past seven years playing in Europe and joins the fledgling club from Carlisle. Bouzanis. moved abroad in 2007 to link up with Liverpool and will join up with. former Crystal Palace defender-turned-coach Tony Popovic. He said: 'I've seen how good a coach Popa is with the results that he's got, and it all just went from there.' Going Down Under: Goalkeeper Dean Bouzanis, here playing for Oldham, is heading back to Australia. Premier League and Championship clubs are keeping a check on St Patrick's Athletic winger Christopher Forrester. Scouts are expected at Friday night's game in Dublin with Derry City and the 21-year-old is understood to be the main attraction. Everton and Sunderland have a long-held interest but West Ham and Leeds have also checked on his progress.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   When skater 2 runs into skater 1, he’s going faster than skater 1 so he has more momentum. Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to stop. It’s a product of the object’s mass and velocity. At the moment of the collision, skater 2 transfers some of his momentum to skater 1, who shoots forward when skater 2 runs into him. Whenever an action and reaction such as this occur, momentum is transferred from one object to the other. However, the combined momentum of the objects remains the same. In other words, momentum is conserved. This is the law of conservation of momentum .   Q: What property of an object is obtained by multiplying its mass and its velocity?

When Flowers decides to take over a betting shop, owned by Joey Maddocks (Anthony Valentine), he forbids Chas to get involved, as he feels Chas's complicated personal history with Maddocks (which is at least partly gay) may lead to trouble. Chas is angry about this and later humiliates Maddocks, who retaliates by wrecking Chas's apartment and attacking Chas. Chas shoots him, packs a suitcase and runs from the scene. When Flowers makes it clear that he has no intention of offering protection to Chas but instead wants him eliminated, Chas decides to head for the countryside to hide but instead winds up hiding out in London, requesting that Tony (a trusted friend he refers to as 'Uncle') helps him get out of the country. He assumes a new name, Johnny Dean, and appears at the house of Turner (Mick Jagger), makes a clumsy attempt to ingratiate himself with Pherber (Anita Pallenberg), one of the female inhabitants, and moves in.

The phrase \\"less a story than an inexplicable nightmare\\" implies that the subject being discussed does not possess the qualities one would expect from a proper story, such as a coherent plot, structure, or character development. Instead, it is compared to an \\"inexplicable nightmare,\\" which implies an unpleasant, confusing, and disorienting experience. Furthermore, the addition of \\"right down to the population's shrugging acceptance to each new horror\\" illustrates that even the people within the context of this subject do not react strongly or with concern toward the unfolding horrors. The expression \\"shrugging acceptance\\" indicates apathy and a lack of emotional response, which often connotes a sense of powerlessness or despair. This further emphasizes the negative sentiment being conveyed, as the horrors being referenced are expected to provoke a strong emotional reaction, yet, they are met with a lack of concern or resistance. In conclusion, the given sentence evokes a negative sentiment, as it portrays the subject as having qualities similar to a disconcerting and confusing nightmare. Additionally, the indifferent attitude of the population toward the tragedies they face amplifies this negative feeling.

In 1933, during the Great Depression, New York City vaudeville actress Ann Darrow is hired by financially troubled filmmaker Carl Denham to star in a film with Herb, Carl's cameraman, Mike, Carl's soundman, Preston, Carl's assistant, and actor Bruce Baxter. Ann learns her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll, is the screenwriter. As their tramp steamer, the SS Venture, journeys to the mysterious Skull Island, Ann and Jack fall in love. The people on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain and his crew, including Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, and the Venture's lookout Jimmy. Captain Englehorn has second thoughts about the voyage, prompted by Lumpy and Hayes' speculation of trouble ahead. Deep in the southern waters, the Venture receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island. Carl and his crew explore the island and are attacked by natives, who kill Mike as well as one of the sailors. Ann screams as she is captured, and a loud roar is heard beyond a wall. After this, the matriarch of the tribe targets Ann, muttering the word \\"Kong\\". Englehorn kills one of the natives and his crew break up the attack. Back on the ship, they lighten their load to float off the rocks and carry out repairs, but Jack discovers Ann has been kidnapped and another sailor has been killed. The natives offer Ann as a sacrifice to Kong, a 25 feet (7.6 m) tall gorilla. The crew returns fully armed, but is too late as Kong takes Ann and flees into the jungle.

NHS England said centres were limited due a shortage of \\"suitably qualified staff\\" but an additional Â£4m funding has been put into the services. A Transgender Equality report recommended an overhaul of the system, after noting \\"unacceptably long\\" waiting times. There are currently about 4,500 referrals to gender identity clinics in England per year, NHS England said. The House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee report said the demand for the clinics is growing at 25-30% each year. It said one of the largest clinics, based in London, has admitted that waiting times are \\"between 12 and 18 months\\" for an initial consultation. At the current rate, it is forecasting waiting times for physical surgery to be at three-and-a-half years, by 2017. Transgender people in the north west of England, where no clinics exists, are travelling to Leeds, Sheffield, the Midlands or London for treatment. Ashleigh Talbot, from Manchester, is receiving hormone treatment after receiving her prescription three years after first approaching her GP. With no clinics in her local area, she was referred to the Charing Cross clinic in London. \\"I've finally been on the hormones since August... after having initially spoken to my GP in 2012,\\" she said. \\"I elected to go [to London] because actually I was told by the community mental health team that the waiting time for Leeds would be an additional three years.\\" Transgender people are usually required to undergo hormone therapy for a year, before further consultations at a gender identity clinic. If surgery is deemed appropriate, they are given a consultation with a surgeon - all of whom have their own individual waiting lists. Before having any surgery to fully transition, patients must be seen by two psychiatrists - something transgender patient Dawn Pomfret believes adds to the stress of the situation unnecessarily. Ms Pomfret, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, said: \\"I know one girl who was pushed back and pushed back purely because she didn't get on with her psychiatrist. \\"He wanted referral after referral and she should have got her surgery three years before she did.\\" The report noted that waiting times for initial appointments are in breach of patients' legal entitlement, under the NHS Constitution, which requires a first appointment in a specialist service within 18 weeks of referral. Will Huxter, chairman of NHS England's Gender Identity Task and Finish Group, said: \\"As with other specialised services, the number of gender identify centres around the country is limited primarily due to the shortage of suitably qualified and experienced staff. \\"However, we want to ensure that people are able to access services in a timely way wherever they live. \\"We recognise the urgent need to bring down waiting times, and to this end we have met with all the gender identity clinics to agree plans to increase capacity from April 2016.\\" NHS England is aiming to bring waiting times to below 18 weeks by 2018. Jenny Anne Bishop, of the Manchester-based TransForum help group, said: \\"We have the gender identity clinics, they're great for people who are struggling or who are not sure who they are. \\"But, for the average person who knows exactly who they are and where they want to go, we just need a doctor with specialist knowledge. \\"When the diagnosis is done the person could be referred for treatment and just get on with their lives.\\" The government is due to respond to the Women and Equalities Committee's findings in March. BBC Inside Out North West is on BBC1 from 19:30 GMT on Monday. Summary:","output":"In England, individuals seeking gender reassignment at one of the country's eight centers are currently facing a wait of over three years. This waiting period is significantly longer than the 18 weeks recommended under NHS guidelines for an initial appointment regarding hormone therapy and surgery. NHS England has stated that the current waiting times are due to a lack of qualified staff. To help address this issue, an additional £4m in funding has been allocated to the services. The Transgender Equality report has called for an overhaul of the system, as the waiting times have been deemed unacceptably long. Each year, there are about 4,500 referrals to gender identity clinics in England, with a growing demand of 25-30% annually. NHS England is working to bring the waiting times down to below 18 weeks by 2018."},{"instruction":"Question: Claude Williams (politician) -  Claude Williams (born November 25 1955 in Saint-Antoine New Brunswick) is a former civil servant and politician in the province of New Brunswick Canada.Williams studied at the University of Moncton graduating with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree.

Kidder, one of five children, was born in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, the daughter of Jocelyn Mary \\"Jill\\" (nee Wilson), a history teacher, and Kendall Kidder, an explosives expert and engineer. Kidder also spent time growing up in Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador. Her mother was from British Columbia, Canada, and her father was from New Mexico, United States. She is of Welsh and English descent. Kidder made her film debut in a 49-minute film titled The Best Damn Fiddler from Calabogie to Kaladar (1968), a drama set in a Canadian logging community, which was produced by the Challenge for Change. Her first major feature was the 1969 American film Gaily, Gaily, a comedy starring Beau Bridges. She appeared in a number of TV drama series for the CBC, including guest appearances on Wojeck, Adventures in Rainbow Country, and a semi-regular role as a young reporter on McQueen, and as a panelist on Mantrap which featured discussions centered on a feminist perspective. During the 1971-72 season, she co-starred as barmaid Ruth in Nichols, a James Garner western, which aired 22 episodes on NBC.  In the late 1960s, Kidder was based in Toronto, and in 1970, relocated to Vancouver. During an August 3, 1970 interview on The Dick Cavett Show, Kidder stated that she was ambivalent toward having a film career, and was considering working as a film editor in the future. She appeared in \\"Such Dust As Dreams Are Made On\\", the first pilot for Harry O which aired in March 1973. She was a guest star in a 1972 episode of the George Peppard detective series Banacek.  After moving to Los Angeles, Kidder was cast opposite Gene Wilder in Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx (1970) as an exchange student in Ireland who becomes the love interest of a poor horse manure collector in Dublin whom she almost runs over with her car. After filming in Ireland, Kidder relocated to New York City to further study acting. A year later, she returned to California, and was cast in the Brian De Palma cult classic Sisters (1973), which gained notoriety for both director and Kidder, who as leading lady, portrayed conjoined twins. Kidder had been in a relationship with De Palma at the time, and had been roommates with co-star Jennifer Salt in Los Angeles. She then starred in the slasher film Black Christmas in 1974, for which she won a Canadian Film Award for Best Actress; followed by a role as a prostitute in the Terrence Malick-scripted The Gravy Train (1974). She received another Canadian Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in the war drama A Quiet Day in Belfast (1974).  In 1975, Kidder was cast in a lead role in The Great Waldo Pepper opposite Robert Redford, she also appeared in The Reincarnation of Peter Proud and 92 in the Shade (1975) with Peter Fonda, all of which established her as a commercially viable leading lady. Kidder famously married the director of 92 in the Shade, Thomas McGuane. She appeared on the March 9, 1975 edition of The American Sportsman, learning how to hang glide with her providing the narration and a remote microphone recording her reactions in flight; the segment concluded with Kidder doing solos soaring amid the Wyoming Rockies.  After taking a break from acting after the birth of her daughter in 1976, Kidder sought to return to making films in the late 1970s. After doing a reading of Lois Lane for the 1978 superhero film Superman: The Movie, Kidder was flown to England by Richard Donner for screen-tests. Donner ultimately cast Kidder in the role, which would become her most iconic. Filming took over a year, and the film was released during Christmas 1978, to major commercial success. Kidder won a Saturn Award for best actress for her performance in the film. Kidder publicly disagreed with the decision of producers Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind to replace Richard Donner as director for Superman II (1980). It was reported that as a result, Kidder's role in Superman III (1983) consisted of less than five minutes of footage, though the producers have denied this in DVD commentaries. Her role in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) was more substantial.  Kidder's performance as Kathy Lutz in the 1979 summer release of The Amityville Horror further cemented her status as one of Hollywood's leading ladies. Though it received mixed reviews from critics, The Amityville Horror was a major commercial success, grossing over 86 million in the United States. Janet Maslin of The New York Times, though giving the film a mixed review, said Kidder \\"stubbornly remains the bright-eyed life of the party [in the film].\\" In retrospect, Kidder called the film \\"a piece of shit.\\" The same year, Kidder hosted an episode of the American sketch comedy TV show Saturday Night Live.  Kidder continued to work in film throughout the 1980s, appearing in Paul Mazursky's Willie & Phil and Some Kind of Hero. Her performance in 1981's Heartaches generated critical acclaim and Oscar buzz. As court stenographer-cum-private eye Mickey Raymond, the PG rating that 1983's Trenchcoat received led Disney to launch Touchstone Pictures. She appeared opposite James Garner in the controversial Hollywood crime drama The Glitter Dome (1984). In 1985, she toplined Little Treasure for Columbia Tri-Star with co-stars Ted Danson and Burt Lancaster, where she played a distraught stripper looking for her bank robber-father's buried fortune. In 1986 she was selected as the English narrator for the Japanese animated series The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.  A 1982 stage performance of Bus Stop starring Kidder as Cherie and Tim Matheson as Bo, was broadcast on HBO. In 1983, she produced and starred as Eliza Doolittle in a version of Pygmalion with Peter O'Toole for Showtime. She produced and starred in the French-Canadian period television film Louisiana (1984) as a plantation owner in the American South who returns from Paris to find her estate and holdings have been lost. Body of Evidence (1988), a CBS Movie of the Week, cast Kidder as nurse who is suspicious that her medical pathologist second husband is a serial killer. In 1994, Kidder played the bartender at the Broken Skull Tavern in Under a Killing Moon, an IBM PC adventure game. In 1994 she took time to appear in the Disney Channel movie WindRunner, with Russell Means and Jason Wiles. She made uncredited cameo appearances in Maverick (1994) and Delirious (1991).  By the mid-1990s, Kidder's career began to decline, which was attributed to her widely publicized nervous breakdown in 1996. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: who was one of her co-stars?","output":"One of Margot Kidder's notable co-stars was Gene Wilder with whom she was cast opposite in the movie \\"Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx\\" (1970). Kidder was an exchange student in Ireland who becomes the love interest of a poor horse manure collector in Dublin, a role played by Wilder. This was after Kidder had moved to Los Angeles.  Another key co-star was Beau Bridges, alongside whom Kidder starred in her first major American feature film \\"Gaily, Gaily\\" in 1969 which was a comedy genre.  She also starred opposite James Garner in the controversial Hollywood crime drama \\"The Glitter Dome\\" (1984).  However, her most iconic co-star was probably Christopher Reeve, with whom she starred in \\"Superman: The Movie\\" (1978).

Moreover, in 1983 she produced and starred as Eliza Doolittle in a version of \\"Pygmalion\\" with Peter O'Toole for Showtime. In Robert Redford's movie \\"The Great Waldo Pepper\\" 1975, she was cast in a lead role as well. Another co-star was Peter Fonda, with whom she appeared in \\"92 in the Shade\\" (1975), a film directed by Thomas McGuane whom Kidder later married.

Performance art via kayak at Fort Point There's a choice little piece of waterfront property along Fort Point Channel, snug to the Summer Street Bridge along the Harbor Walk. Early last week, the place was surrounded by a picket fence and had a “For Rent” sign up. So what if it’s only 8 feet square, and floating in the channel. It looked darling in the late afternoon sun — at least until a redheaded woman in a business suit arrived in a kayak and started renovating. She tore down part of the fence, built a desk, and picked up a phone. Heidi Kayser’s “The Remodeling Project’’ is the fifth installment in the Floating Art Series. Welcome to “The Remodeling Project,” the latest installment of Fort Point's Floating Art Series, and the first one featuring performance art. The woman in the chic black suit was artist Heidi Kayser. She enlisted a builder in Maine to make the square wooden dock, and throughout the month, she’ll be kayaking out periodically to her little patch of paradise and changing it up. This weekend, the artist may have the biggest audience of the month, with Fort Point Art Walk, an open studios event, which began Friday and continues through Sunday, from noon to 5 p.m. Originally, Kayser says, she had thought to call the project “The American Dream.” “What does it mean to be successful?” she asks. “A picket fence? A suit?” Or maybe it’s a little piece of real estate. “It’s about what we do with our space,” Kayser says. “If you’re lucky, you have a yard. A cubicle. My studio in the South End is about that size.” On a sunny day last week, she stood on a dock outside the Barking Crab restaurant, conspicuous in her black suit, packing her blue kayak and a raft to tow out to her floating venue. Among her props: a dozen phones, a desk chair, the makings of a desk, and patent leather pumps. As she tends her personal space in full view of passersby, Kayser says, she explores the edge between public and private. When she was on the dock erecting the picket fence in early May, she recounts, “someone on the bridge said something like ‘What are you doing? It ain’t like nobody can come get you.’ The fence is 13 inches tall. It's a symbol of a fence.” Every performance will be distinct, inspired in part by ideas Kayser has culled from an Internet survey, asking people to free-associate about specific words, including private, public, home, work, domestic, commute, and woman. Some responses were poetic, the artist says. “For ‘private,’ someone wrote [that] at night they ‘hide in little boxes.’ ” “It’s about what we do with our space,” Kayser says of her 8-foot-square project. “If you’re lucky, you have a yard. A cubicle. My studio in the South End is about that size.” Kayser has lots of boxes these days — this summer she’s moving from Boston to San Diego, where she’ll work toward a master of fine arts degree from the University of California. So she's considering taking some of the boxes out to the floating dock and hiding in them. When not in a box, she might do some ironing out there, or put up a mailbox. For one performance, she envisions mixing up the imagined scenarios, floating on the platform along with a garden gnome, an ironing board, and office furniture. The project is getting attention. One passerby last weekend took a picture of the dock with the fence and the “For Rent” sign before Kayser arrived on the scene. “I'm thinking about posting on Facebook, saying ‘I need my own island,’ ” said the woman, who declined to give her name. “The neighborhood is totally intrigued,” reports Gabrielle Schaffner, executive director of Fort Point Arts Community, which presents the Floating Art Series. Schaffner must seek permission from the Boston Harbormaster for every project in the Floating Art Series, which is funded partially by the nonprofit Friends of Fort Point Channel. The mark of a successful public art project, she says, “is when people stop to take pictures. This one is such a double take, even if you're used to seeing public art projects pop up around here.” “The Remodeling Project” is the fifth in the Floating Art Series, which officially debuted in 2005. The community’s jury for this year's Floating Art Series leaped at Kayser’s proposal. “It's completely different than anything we’ve ever done,” Schaffner says, adding that jurors had confidence in Kayser’s track record. She's a curator as well as an artist, and founder of the Axiom Center for New and Experimental Media. The Hull Lifesaving Museum, which keeps a pier down by the Barking Crab, has lent the artist a slip for her kayak. Preparing to tow out her office equipment on this May afternoon, she lashed an orange push broom to the kayak, along with the desk chair. \\"I'm worried that my desk might fall into the channel,” she says, noting the choppy water. “I need to clamp it to the dock.” The project, which began with the erection of the picket fence and the “For Rent” sign, will conclude when Kayser puts a “For Sale” sign out on her platform. So even though you probably can’t keep it in Fort Point Channel, that little piece of paradise could be yours, for the right price.

To come up with this answer, I first looked at the definition, which stated that I needed to create a new French sentence by making small adjustments to the input, while maintaining its semantic meaning, proper syntax, and ensuring it remains plausible. I began by identifying the main components of the input sentence: \\"aider\\" (to help), \\"fil\\" (thread), \\"s'écouler\\" (to flow), \\"dedans\\" (inside) and \\"dehors\\" (outside). Next, I considered how I could rephrase the sentence while preserving its meaning. I decided to change the verb \\"aide\\" (help) to \\"facilite\\" (facilitate), which is a synonym of \\"aide.\\" I also restructured the sentence to emphasize \\"le passage du fil\\" (the passage of the thread) rather than focusing on the action of \\"écouler\\" (flow). Lastly, I ensured that the sentence kept to proper French grammar and maintained a high commonsense plausibility. The generated sentence provides a refreshed way of communicating the same information while adhering to the task definition's requirements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available options:  +boil it for five minutes.;  +boil it for half an hour.; Answer:","output":"The best way to make a potato soft is to boil it for an appropriate amount of time, taking into consideration factors such as the type, size, and purpose of the potato dish you are preparing. Boiling a potato for five minutes would be insufficient, as it will only partially cook the potato and not result in the soft texture desired. Boiling a potato for half an hour is a better option but might be too long for some instances, or it could cause overcooking, leading to a mushy texture.  Here's a detailed recommendation for boiling potatoes to achieve a soft texture: 1. Select the right type of potato: Starchy potatoes such as russets or Idaho are more suitable for achieving a soft, fluffy texture. For dishes that require a firm yet soft texture like potato salad, waxy potatoes such as red or fingerling potatoes are preferable. 2. Wash and peel the potatoes (optional): Washing removes any dirt or debris from the surface. Depending on the dish you're preparing, you might choose to peel the potatoes or leave the skin on. If you prefer to keep the skin, make sure it's thoroughly cleaned. 3. Cut the potatoes into uniform sizes (optional): Cutting the potatoes into evenly sized pieces ensures that they cook uniformly. This step is particularly important if you're preparing a dish that requires consistent texture, such as mashed potatoes or potato salad. 4. Place the potatoes in a pot: Add the potatoes to a large pot with enough water to cover them by at least an inch. You may add a pinch of salt to the water to enhance the flavor. 5. Bring the water to a boil: Place the pot on the stove over high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil. Once it reaches a boil, you may reduce the heat to medium or medium-high, maintaining a steady simmer. 6. Adjust the boiling time according to the size and type of potato: The ideal boiling time depends on the size and type of potato. In general, small and medium-sized potatoes should be boiled for 15-20 minutes, while large potatoes may require 25-30 minutes. Test the potatoes for doneness by poking them with a fork, which should slide in easily when they are soft enough. Waxy potatoes generally take a little longer to soften than starchy potatoes. 7. Drain the potatoes: Once the potatoes have reached the desired softness, carefully drain the water using a colander or strainer. Allow the potatoes to steam off for a minute or so to remove any excess moisture. By following these steps and adjusting the boiling time based on the type and size of potatoes, you can achieve the perfect, soft texture for various potato dishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before leaving, he said he would write to them as soon as he found a job there. But two months passed, they did not hear from him. Now they had nothing except the old house and they had no money to buy any food. They thought for a long time. Then they decided to sell the house and look for their father. So one day the two brothers said goodbye to their friends and started to go. They got to the station and bought two tickets. They were afraid that they would be hungry in the train, so they went to the market to buy something to eat. They saw bananas for the first time. The seller told them the bananas were very delicious, so they bought five kilos and got on the train with them. After a while Bruce brought out a banana and bit  a little. Just at that moment the train went into a tunnel  and it was dark in the train.

A:","output":"Bruce and Bruno were worried for multiple reasons, which can be summarized as follows: A) Their father's potential inability to find a job in the town: The main reason for their father leaving was to find a job in a faraway town. The fact that their father had not yet contacted them in two months could indicate that he was struggling to find suitable employment. B) They didn't hear from their father: Bruce and Bruno's father had promised to write to them as soon as he found a job. The extended period of silence since his departure was becoming a cause of concern for the two brothers. They were understandably anxious about their father's well-being. C) Their father left them far away: The distance between their home and the town where their father went for work meant that the brothers could not easily visit him or know what was happening with him. As a result, they were left feeling vulnerable and disconnected from their beloved father. D) They had no money to buy any food: The absence of their father, who was the family's primary breadwinner, had led to financial struggles for Bruce and Bruno. The lack of money for necessities such as food added to their worries and further reinforced their decision to sell their old house and search for their father.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person whose portrait is described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits?  Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the collective name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter. They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident. Each panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down. They have been separated since at least 1628, until Barbara's portrait—long considered lost—was reattributed in 1977. The panels were reunited in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum's 2012 exhibition \\"The Early Dürer\\".

Options: - medicine cabinet - barber shop - bath room - grocery store - suitcase  Explain why a human would choose \\"barber shop\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"barber shop\\" to answer the question above because a barber shop is a traditional establishment where haircare and grooming services are provided, including hair cutting, shaving, and trimming. In these establishments, skilled professionals known as barbers use various tools and equipment to perform these services, one of which is a razor. Razors are used for different purposes within a barber shop. They can be utilized for shaving facial hair or even for achieving precise, clean lines when giving haircuts. Traditional barber shops often have a classic ambiance and a considerable customer base who appreciates the close shaves and well-executed haircuts provided by experienced barbers. Razors have been an essential tool of the trade for many years and are often considered a symbol of the barber profession, making the barber shop a fitting place to find a razor. In contrast, the other options presented – medicine cabinet, bathroom, grocery store, and suitcase – may have some connections to razors but are not specifically dedicated to their use like a barber shop would be.  A medicine cabinet may contain razors in a personal context within a household, but this location is not a traditional public establishment where razors would typically be provided or used. Similarly, a bathroom could have personal razors, but razors are not the primary focus of bathrooms, which are designed for an array of hygienic activities.  A grocery store may sell razors, but again, this is not its primary function, and the store carries a vast range of products beyond grooming supplies. Lastly, a suitcase is merely a transportation device, which may contain a razor packed for personal use while traveling, but it is not a traditional location where one would specifically go to find a razor. Given these explanations, it becomes clear that a human would choose \\"barber shop\\" because it represents a traditional establishment where the primary functions revolve around grooming services, including the use of razors. Barber shops have a deep-rooted historical significance in providing these services, and they remain popular places to find and utilize razors in a professional context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) plays an important role in vascular pathobiology, being involved in the development of coronary restenosis and atherosclerosis. The activation of nuclear proto-oncogenes appears to be a final common pathway onto which various mitogenic signals coverage. Accordingly, we attempted to determine whether the activation of the c-myc nuclear proto-oncogene is essential for human SMC proliferation and explored the possibility of inhibiting their growth using antisense oligonucleotides directed against c-myc messenger RNA (mRNA).', 'Proliferation of human SMCs was associated with an increase in c-myc mRNA expression after growth stimulation. Using 15-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (oligomers), we tested their growth-inhibitory effect in SMCs in vitro. Antisense oligomers directed against the translation initiation region of the human c-myc gene exhibited a significant antiproliferative effect, whereas sense and mismatched oligomers did not inhibit the growth. The growth-inhibitory effect of c-myc antisense oligomers was dose dependent and preventable by an excess of sense oligomers. Furthermore, growth inhibition of SMCs treated with c-myc antisense oligomers was associated with a marked decrease in the c-myc mRNA level. Phosphorothioate oligomers remained stable in medium containing 20% serum and were detectable in SMCs as early as 1 hour after cell exposure. Intact oligomers rapidly accumulated intracellularly and persisted within human SMCs for at least 16 hours. Answer: c-myc antisense oligomers reduced c-myc expression and produced a significant growth inhibition of human SMCs, indicating an important role of c-myc gene activation in the process of SMC proliferation. Furthermore, extracellular stability and rapid cellular uptake provide the basis for future studies assessing the therapeutic role of the c-myc antisense approach in reducing SMC proliferation in the process of vascular restenosis.","output":"Task: Construct a question based on the given passage and answer, making sure that the question is unambiguous, answerable from the passage, has a unique answer, and utilizes text phrases from the passage.

From the early stages of Christianity, belief in the virginity of Mary and the virgin conception of Jesus, as stated in the gospels, holy and supernatural, was used by detractors, both political and religious, as a topic for discussions, debates and writings, specifically aimed to challenge the divinity of Jesus and thus Christians and Christianity alike. In the 2nd century, as part of the earliest anti-Christian polemics, Celsus suggested that Jesus was the illegitimate son of a Roman soldier named Panthera.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: What is amplified by playback equipment? A:","output":"The playback equipment amplifies the bass frequencies. This is part of the equalization process enacted to restore the tonal balance in the original signal, which ensures the sound fidelity of the music as it was intended to be heard. During the recording process, the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced to minimize the groove width required, thus allowing more music to fit onto the record.

Question: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora.

Patsy Cline (born Virginia Patterson Hensley; September 8, 1932 - March 5, 1963) was an American country music singer and part of the Nashville sound during the late 1950s and early 1960s. She successfully \\"crossed over\\" to pop music and was one of the most influential, successful, and acclaimed vocalists of the 20th century. She died at age 30 in the crash of a private airplane. Cline was known for her rich tone, emotionally expressive and bold contralto voice, and her role as a country music pioneer. Patsy Cline was born Virginia Patterson Hensley on September 8, 1932 in Winchester, Virginia, in the city's Memorial Hospital. She was the eldest child of seamstress Hilda Virginia (nee Patterson, 1916-1998) and blacksmith Samuel Lawrence Hensley (1889-1956). She had a brother Samuel Jr. (1939-2004) and a sister Sylvia. The family moved often before finally settling in Winchester, Virginia when Patsy was 16. Sam Hensley deserted his family in 1947, but the children's home was reportedly happy nonetheless.  When Patsy was 13, she was hospitalized with a throat infection and rheumatic fever. She later said, \\"The fever affected my throat and when I recovered I had this booming voice like Kate Smith.\\"  Cline enrolled at John Handley High School but never attended classes. To help her mother support their family, she worked as a soda jerk at Gaunt's Drug Store and a waitress at the Triangle Diner. She watched performers through the window at the local radio station, and she asked WINC (AM) disc jockey Jimmy McCoy if she could sing on his show. Her performance in 1947 was well received and she was asked back. This led to appearances at local nightclubs wearing fringed Western outfits that her mother made from Patsy's designs.  Cline performed in variety and talent shows in the Winchester and Tri-State areas, and she gained a large following through the shows and local radio appearances.

Abstract: Resistance to apoptosis is an important component of the overall mechanism which drives the tumorigenic process. EBV is a ubiquitous human gamma-herpesvirus which preferentially establishes latent infection in viral infected B-lymphocytes. EBNA1 is typically expressed in most forms of EBV-positive malignancies and is important for replication of the latent episome in concert with replication of the host cells. Here, we investigate the effects of EBNA1 on survivin up-regulation in EBV-infected human B-lymphoma cells. We present evidence which demonstrates that EBNA1 forms a complex with Sp1 or Sp1-like proteins bound to their cis-element at the survivin promoter. This enhances the activity of the complex and up-regulates survivin. Knockdown of survivin and EBNA1 showed enhanced apoptosis in infected cells and thus supports a role for EBNA1 in suppressing apoptosis in EBV-infected cells. Here, we suggest that EBV encoded EBNA1 can contribute to the oncogenic process by up-regulating the apoptosis suppressor protein, survivin in EBV-associated B-lymphoma cells..

Plot title: Judgment at Nuremberg Movie plot: Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) arrives in Nuremberg in 1948 to preside over the trial of four Nazi judges, each charged with having abused the court system to help cleanse Germany of the politically and socially undesirable, allegedly guilty of war crimes. The opening statement of the prosecuting attorney (Richard Widmark) is a vicious one, depicting the defendants as having been willing, evil, accomplices in Nazi atrocities, but Judge Haywood wonders if it is really that simple.Confounded at how one defendant, a renowned German champion of justice named Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster), appears to have played the greatest role in molding Germany's Ministry of Justice into a destructive instrument of Nazism, Judge Haywood resolves to gain some perspective on the period in which the German legal system strayed from a course of entirely objective justice.Probing for the truth proves difficult, though, as nobody who lived in Germany during Nazism seems to admit to having much inside knowledge. He befriends Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), the widow of an executed Nazi army officer, but she offers few insights, more consumed by her personal experiences than the broader matters of Nazism. Mrs. Bertholt is focusing on being a catalyst for the cultural rebirth of Nuremberg, keen on remolding the image of a city that had become notorious as the site of the Nazi raliies. An attempt to discuss the period with his housekeepers, Mr. and Mrs. Halbestadt, who had lived near the Dachau concentration camp, proves equally fruitless for Judge Haywood, as they cannot help but focus on the loss of their child in the bombing and the fact that they nearly starved from poverty. Whether anyone knew anything mattered little, for Germans were looking forward, not backward, still grappling with, and recovering from, the hardships and losses that the war brought to them and their families.Only in the courtroom will Judge Haywood have the opportunity to gain insights into the realities of the period.

Information:  - A subcarrier is a sideband of a radio frequency carrier wave, which is modulated to send additional information. Examples include the provision of colour in a black and white television system or the provision of stereo in a monophonic radio broadcast. There is no physical difference between a carrier and a subcarrier; the \\"sub\\" implies that it has been derived from a carrier, which has been amplitude modulated by a steady signal and has a constant frequency relation to it.  - A radio reading service or reading service for the blind is a service of many universities, community groups and public radio stations, where a narrator reads books, newspapers and magazines aloud for the benefit of the blind and vision-impaired. It is most often carried on a subcarrier, with radio receivers permanently tuned to a given station in the area, or an HD Radio subchannel of the offering station. Some reading services use alternative methods for reaching their audiences, including broadcasting over SAP, streaming Internet radio, cable TV, or even terrestrial TV.  - 6RPH Vision Australia Radio broadcasts on 990 kHz AM and was previously owned and operated by the Foundation for Information Radio of Western Australia Inc. It now broadcasts Vision Australia Radio and aims to provide access to printed information for Western Australians with a print disability . Vision Australia Radio is a member of RPH Australia . Its radio reading service is available on 990 AM throughout the wider Perth metropolitan area . However , in the early part of 2015 the station started to play a recorded music loop , together with a repeated announcement that its service had been suspended due to \`\` technical issues '' . In March / early April 2015 , 6RPH ceased broadcasting , but has since recommenced transmission with the Vision Australia Radio service on 990AM and on IRIS digital . Radio 6PM occupied the 990 kHz frequency until the late 1980s .  - HD Radio is a trademarked term for iBiquity's in-band on-channel (IBOC) digital radio technology used by AM and FM radio stations to transmit audio and data by using a digital signal embedded on-frequency immediately above and below a station's standard analog signal, providing the means to listen to the same program in either HD (digital radio with less noise) or as a standard broadcast (analog radio with standard sound quality). The HD format also provides the means for a single radio station to simultaneously broadcast one or more different programs in addition to the program being transmitted on the radio station's analog channel.  - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores.  - A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts.   - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation -26n - 525 = -38n - 3n for n, first combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. Since there are two terms with the variable n on the right side of the equation, you can combine the -38n and -3n terms to simplify the equation. -26n - 525 = -38n - 3n -26n - 525 = -41n Now, the goal is to isolate the variable n on one side of the equation. Let's add +41n to both sides of the equation to eliminate the variable n from the right side: -26n + 41n - 525 = -41n + 41n 15n - 525 = 0 Now, add 525 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable n on the left side of the equation: 15n - 525 + 525 = 0 + 525 15n = 525 Finally, to find the value of n, divide both sides by 15: 15n / 15 = 525 / 15 n = 35 The solution to the equation -26n - 525 = -38n - 3n is n = 35."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: David works for the government as a statistician.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What became France's main rival on the imperial stage? , can you please find it?   Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain. A:","output":"In the 18th century, England (which became Britain after the union with Scotland in 1707) emerged as the world's dominant colonial power, with France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage. The rivalry between the two nations heightened during the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession. The Dutch, who were initially competing with England for colonial supremacy, gradually shifted their focus towards European conflicts, thereby increasing the prominence of France as Britain's main rival. The Nine Years' War (1688-1697) saw England and the Netherlands ally against France and Spain. The conflict took place both in Europe and overseas, but the outcome left England as a stronger colonial power compared to the Dutch, as the latter had to allocate more resources to the costly land war in Europe. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) further intensified the rivalry between Britain and France. The war began after the death of Charles II of Spain, who left his throne and colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France. The prospect of unification between France, Spain, and their respective colonies was unacceptable to Britain and other European powers. England, Portugal, and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the conflict. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 marked the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Under the treaty, Philippe renounced his claim to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. Britain gained valuable territories from both France and Spain, including Newfoundland and Acadia from France, and Gibraltar and Menorca from Spain. Gibraltar became a crucial naval base for Britain, enabling them to control the entry and exit points to the Mediterranean. Additionally, Spain ceded the lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain, further strengthening the British Empire. In summary, France became Britain's main rival on the imperial stage during the 18th century, with the rivalry intensifying during the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession. The Dutch, who were previously prominent competitors, shifted their focus towards European conflicts, leaving France as Britain's primary contender for colonial dominance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – The FBI is keeping a close watch on Americans who have traveled to and returned from the war in Syria. The US believes that al-Qaeda affiliates in the war-torn country are actively attempting to recruit Americans there and train them to carry out attacks back home, senior intelligence and counterterror officials tell the New York Times. At least 70 Americans have traveled to Syria or attempted to since the war began three years ago, the officials revealed. Most haven't returned, but the FBI is monitoring those who have. \\"We are focused on trying to figure out what our people are up to,\\" FBI Director James Comey told reporters yesterday. A handful of those who've returned are under direct around-the-clock surveillance. One man, former US Army soldier Eric Harroun of Phoenix, was charged last year with fighting alongside the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front; he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was released. But despite all the worry about Islamist groups, the Obama administration is considering resuming shipments of non-lethal aid to the rebels, notes another Times report—even if some of it ends up in militants' hands.","output":"Title: The FBI's Vigilance on American Returnees from Syria and its Implications Introduction The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has made it a significant priority to monitor Americans traveling to and returning from war-torn Syria. With growing concerns over al-Qaeda affiliates' attempts to recruit and train American citizens for potential attacks on U.S. soil, senior counterterrorism officials are keeping a close watch on these individuals. Since the war in Syria began, there have been at least 70 cases of Americans traveling to or attempting to travel to Syria. Most of these individuals have not returned, but the FBI has been monitoring their activities. In this article, we will discuss the FBI's surveillance strategies, the impact of these strategies on domestic security, and the implications of these actions for U.S. foreign policy. FBI Surveillance Strategies The FBI is making considerable efforts to track and monitor Americans who have been to Syria and returned. According to FBI Director James Comey, the agency is \\"focused on trying to figure out what our people are up to.\\" For some returnees, this means being under direct, around-the-clock surveillance. In one particular case, former U.S. Army soldier Eric Harroun of Phoenix was charged with fighting alongside the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front. Harroun ultimately pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was released. Through these investigations, the FBI aims to prevent potential homegrown terrorists from carrying out attacks in the United States. Implications for Domestic Security There is a great deal at stake for domestic security when it comes to tracking American returnees from Syria. According to a report in the New York Times, al-Qaeda operatives in Syria are actively trying to recruit and train Americans for potential attacks. So far, there have been no reported incidences of homegrown terrorist attacks as a result of recruitment from Syria. However, the FBI's vigilance ensures that there is a better chance of preventing such attacks before they occur. By monitoring those who have been to Syria and are suspected of having ties to al-Qaeda or other extremist groups, the FBI can take preemptive measures to safeguard national security. Implications for U.S. Foreign Policy The Obama administration has been engaged in an ongoing debate regarding the shipment of non-lethal aid to the rebels in Syria. Many critics argue that such assistance could end up in the hands of militants who pose a threat to the United States. Nonetheless, reports suggest that the administration is considering resuming shipments of non-lethal aid to the rebels. The FBI's investigations into American returnees from Syria provide a crucial perspective on the risks of such support. By carefully examining the motivations and activities of these individuals, the U.S. government can make decisions about the extent and nature of their support for the Syrian opposition. Conclusion The FBI's close watch on Americans who have returned from Syria serves as an important strategy for U.S. domestic security. These individuals may have been exposed to extremist ideologies, and even trained to conduct attacks on American soil. By monitoring their activities, the FBI can work to prevent future attacks and ultimately safeguard citizens. Additionally, these investigations can play a crucial role in informing U.S. foreign policy decisions, particularly regarding support for the Syrian opposition. In an uncertain and complex global landscape, the FBI's vigilance is a vital tool for understanding and managing the risks associated with the Syrian war."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In our life, there are always some days that will never be forgotten. This was one of those days, a day when we were on a hike, I became my children's hero. This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail   and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek   a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther  _ was. While crossing the creek by walking on a downed tree trunk, our little Izzie fell into the creek and immediately started moving up and down in the current  . Immediately, I jumped into the creek after her. I managed to grab her and push her to the bank. But now, I was the one in need of being rescued. I thought this might be the end and I wasn't sure if I could hold on. Then, I heard the voice of the love of my life, my wife's voice. She shouted loudly--Stand up! Stand up! With the last bit of strength I had, I stood, and walked out of the creek. The kids showed little concern for my health; they were looking after Izzie, now safe in their arms. But I did hear one of the kids say: Thanks Dad, for saving Izzie. You're our HERO! As we walked back down the trail, I enjoyed a rare, but one of those sweet moments in life, that I wouldn't trade for anything on earth. I didn't care about my wet clothes, the squish   of water in my boots, or the embarrassment of nearly drowning in water; none of that mattered.

The victory was followed by a clean sweep of all Roman forts, garrisons and cities (of which there were at least two) east of the Rhine; the remaining two Roman legions in Germania, commanded by Varus' nephew Lucius Nonius Asprenas, were content to try to hold the Rhine. One fort, Aliso, most likely located in today's Haltern am See, fended off the Germanic tribes for many weeks, perhaps even a few months. After the situation became untenable, the garrison under Lucius Caedicius, accompanied by survivors of Teutoburg Forest, broke through the siege, and reached the Rhine. They resisted long enough for Lucius Nonius Asprenas to organize the Roman defense on the Rhine with two legions and Tiberius to arrive with a new army, preventing Arminius from crossing the Rhine and invading Gaul. What's the best answer to this question: did any romans survive the battle of teutoburg forest?","output":"Yes, some Romans did survive the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, albeit not many. The battle, which took place in 9 CE between the Roman Legions and the Germanic tribes led by Arminius, resulted in a devastating loss for the Romans. Their three legions were all but annihilated, but not every Roman soldier perished in the battle. From the account, we learn of a fort named Aliso, likely situated in present-day Haltern am See. Following the disastrous battle, this fort withstood the subsequent assault from the triumphant Germanic tribes for an extended period, possibly even for a few months. It is reasonable to infer that some of the Romans at this fort were likely survivors of the Battle of Teutoburg Forest.  The fort's garrison, commanded by Lucius Caedicius, and likely composed of battle survivors, managed a daring breakout from the fort when the situation became unsustainable. They managed to penetrate the Germanic siege successfully and headed towards the Rhine.  Their staunch resistance provided crucial time for Lucius Nonius Asprenas, the nephew of Varus and the commander of the remaining two legions in Germania, to fortify the Roman defenses on the Rhine. It also bought time for Tiberius to arrive with a new army, thereby preventing Arminius from crossing the Rhine and invading Gaul.  Hence, while the Roman defeat was comprehensive and brutal, some soldiers did survive the Battle of Teutoburg Forest. Their survival and subsequent resistance played a critical role in ensuring that the Germanic tribes led by Arminius were not able to capitalize fully on their resounding victory by invading Gaul."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This event, also known as D-Day, involved the combined forces of the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and other Allied countries, with the objective of liberating Western Europe from Nazi control during World War II. The operation targeted an approximately 80 km (50-mile) stretch of the Normandy coastline, which was divided into five landing zones assigned to different Allied forces. These beaches were codenamed: Utah and Omaha for the United States, Gold and Sword for Britain, and Juno for Canada. The amphibious landings were followed by a major airborne assault, involving thousands of paratroopers deployed behind enemy lines to support the main attack. Under the leadership of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the extensive planning and coordination of forces led to a significant foothold in German-occupied France. The success of the Normandy landings set the stage for the eventual liberation of France and played a critical role in the Allied victory on the Western Front in World War II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Known for his signature style in works such as \\"300\\" (2006) and \\"Watchmen\\" (2009), Snyder delivered a gripping story that tackles themes such as empowerment, self-discovery, and rebellion. This article will explore the movie's complex narrative, its breathtaking visuals, and the poignant messages it conveys. Step 1: Analyze the Plot: \\"Sucker Punch\\" initially presents itself as a story about a young woman, Babydoll (Emily Browning), committed to a mental institution by a vile stepfather. Soon after her arrival, reality shifts, and Babydoll finds herself in a twisted fantasy world within her own mind. Teaming up with four other female inmates, Babydoll embarks on a mission to escape her mental imprisonment by acquiring various objects. The film encapsulates the struggle of these women as they fight both internal and external battles. Step 2: Discuss the Visual Style: Snyder employs his signature visual prowess in \\"Sucker Punch,\\" combining the aesthetics of comic book art and video game design. The vivid colors, slo-mo action sequences, and near-photorealistic visuals create an unforgettable experience for the viewers. The film brims with intricate details, from stunning costumes to intricately designed sets, immersing the audience into the captivating world that Snyder has created.  Step 3: Explore the Themes: Throughout \\"Sucker Punch,\\" the motif of empowerment runs strong. Babydoll and her team of warriors learn to harness their individual strengths and, together, they gradually discover their collective power. Despite their circumstances, these young women choose to rebel and fight back against their oppressors. Additionally, the film's multilayered narrative delves into the concept of reality versus illusion. While some argue that the visually immersive fantasy sequences are merely a distraction, others see them as a reflection of Babydoll's psyche, where she copes with her trauma and seeks solace and strength. Step 4: Analyze the Characters: The primary characters in \\"Sucker Punch\\" are multidimensional, demonstrating both vulnerability and strength. Babydoll's transformation from a frightened young girl into an empowered leader is nothing short of inspiring. Moreover, the camaraderie between the female characters showcases the importance of solidarity and shared purpose. Each character has a unique backstory, which serves as a catalyst for their growth throughout the film. Step 5: Discuss Reception and Legacy: While \\"Sucker Punch\\" received mixed reviews upon its release, it has since gained a cult following, with fans deeply appreciating its complex narrative, visual prowess, and subtext. The film has inspired debate and discourse, with some praising it as a feminist masterpiece and others critiquing it for objectification. Conclusion: 'Sucker Punch' remains one of the most intriguing entries in Zack Snyder's filmography. With its stunning visual style, layered narrative, and thought-provoking themes, the movie delivers a cinematic experience that, to this day, remains unparalleled. It invites viewers to ponder the lines between reality and imagination while reminding us that sometimes, our greatest battles are fought within."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

He becomes a taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia, driving passengers every night around the boroughs of New York City. He also spends time in seedy porn theaters and keeps a diary. Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, and takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he takes her to see a Swedish sex education film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers are rebuffed, so he berates her at the campaign office, before being kicked out by Tom. Travis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent, but Wizard assures him that he will be fine, leaving Travis to his own destructive path. Travis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, and attempts to find an outlet for his frustrations by beginning a program of intense physical training.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How did education impact the country?\\" is in \\"The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan.

The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\".

Glacier Ogives are alternating wave crests and valleys that appear as dark and light bands of ice on glacier surfaces. They are linked to seasonal motion of glaciers; the width of one dark and one light band generally equals the annual movement of the glacier. Ogives are formed when ice from an icefall is severely broken up, increasing ablation surface area during summer. This creates a swale and space for snow accumulation in the winter, which in turn creates a ridge. Sometimes ogives consist only of undulations or color bands and are described as wave ogives or band ogives. Q: How are ogives formed?","output":"Ogives are formed through a step-by-step process involving seasonal motion of glaciers, icefalls, and varying ablation rates: 1. Seasonal motion of glaciers: The width of one dark and one light band in an ogive generally corresponds to the annual movement of the glacier, indicating a link between ogive formation and the glacier's seasonal motion. 2. Icefalls: Icefalls occur when ice from the glacier moves over a steep cliff or edge, causing the ice to break up severely. This broken ice plays a role in the formation of ogives. 3. Increased ablation surface area: When ice is broken up by an icefall, the ablation surface area increases during the summer. Ablation refers to the loss of glacial ice due to melting, evaporation, or other processes. 4. Formation of swales and ridges: The increased ablation creates a swale (a shallow depression) and makes room for snow accumulation during the winter. This accumulated snow then forms a ridge, contributing to the formation of ogives. 5. Alternating wave crests and valleys: The combination of swales and ridges ultimately results in alternating wave crests and valleys on the glacier's surface, appearing as dark and light bands of ice, which are referred to as ogives. In some cases, ogives may consist only of undulations or color bands, which are described as wave ogives or band ogives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Information:  - Amoraim (Aramaic: plural  , singular Amora  ; \\"those who say\\" or \\"those who speak over the people\\", or \\"spokesmen\\") refers to the Jewish scholars of the period from about 200 to 500 CE, who \\"said\\" or \\"told over\\" the teachings of the Oral Torah. They were concentrated in Babylonia and the Land of Israel. Their legal discussions and debates were eventually codified in the Gemara. The \\"Amoraim\\" followed the \\"Tannaim\\" in the sequence of ancient Jewish scholars. The \\"Tannaim\\" were direct transmitters of uncodified oral tradition; the \\"Amoraim\\" expounded upon and clarified the oral law after its initial codification.  - Jose the Galilean ( Hebrew :   , Yose HaGelili ) , d. 15 Av , was a Jewish sage who lived in the 1st and 2nd centuries of the common era . He was one of the Tannaim , the rabbis whose work was compiled in the Mishna . Jose was a contemporary and colleague of Rabbis Akiva , Tarfon , and Eleazar ben Azariah . Neither the name of his father nor the circumstances of his youth are known , though his name ( \`\` HaGelili '' ) indicates that he was a native of Galilee . He suffered from the prejudice commonly held against the Galileans by the Judeans ; on one occasion a woman who wanted to make a point with him began by calling him a \`\` stupid Galilean '' . When he entered the academy at Yavne , he was entirely unknown . It is also noted that he was extremely modest and addressed Tarfon as \`\` my master '' . He was , nevertheless , a thorough scholar even then , and his arguments nonplused both Tarfon and Akiva . His first appearance at Yavne thus obtained for him general recognition , and the two rabbis considered him not as a pupil , but as a colleague . Akiva was obliged to endure more than one sharp criticism from Jose , who once said to him : \`\` Though thou expound the whole day I shall not listen to thee '' . Tarfon expressed his high esteem of Jose by interpreting Daniel viii. 4 - 7 as though it contained an allusion to him : \`\` I saw the ram , that is , Akiva , and saw that no beast might stand before him ; and I beheld the he - goat , that is , Jose the Galilean , come , and cast him down to the ground . '' As a matter of fact , Jose was the only one who opposed Akiva successfully , and the latter frequently abandoned his own interpretation in favor of his opponent 's . Jose frequently showed a tendency to revert to the older Halakha , explaining the text according to its literal meaning Generally , though , his halakic exegesis differed little from that of Akiva , and both often employed the same rules of interpretation He taught that poultry may be cooked in milk and eaten , as was done in his own native...  - Av (\\"Av\\" \\"\\" \\"Abba\\"; from Akkadian \\"abu\\"; \\"father\\") is the eleventh month of the civil year and the fifth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar. The name is Babylonian in origin and appeared in the Talmud around the 3rd century. This is the only month which is not named in the Bible. It is a summer month of 30 days. Av usually occurs in JulyAugust on the Gregorian calendar.  - Tannaim (, singular , \\"Tanna\\" \\"repeaters\\", \\"teachers\\") were the Rabbinic sages whose views are recorded in the Mishnah, from approximately 10-220 CE. The period of the \\"Tannaim\\", also referred to as the Mishnaic period, lasted about 210 years. It came after the period of the \\"Zugot\\" (\\"pairs\\"), and was immediately followed by the period of the \\"Amoraim\\" (\\"interpreters\\").  - Rabban Gamaliel II (also spelled Gamliel) was the first person to lead the Sanhedrin as Nasi after the fall of the second temple, which occurred in 70 CE. Gamliel was appointed nasi approximately 10 years later. Gamaliel II was the son of Shimon ben Gamaliel, one of Jerusalem's foremost men in the war against the Romans, and grandson of Gamaliel I. To distinguish him from the latter he is also called Gamliel of Yavne.  - The Sanhedrin (Hebrew: \\"sanhedrîn\\", Greek: , \\"synedrion\\", \\"sitting together,\\" hence \\"assembly\\" or \\"council\\") was an assembly of twenty-three to seventy-one men appointed in every city in the Land of Israel. In the Hebrew Bible, Moses and the Israelites were commanded by God to establish courts of judges who were given full authority over the people of Israel, who were commanded by God to obey every word the judges instructed and every law they established. Judges in ancient Israel were the religious leaders and Teachers of the nation of Israel. The Mishnah arrives at the number twenty-three based on an exegetical derivation: it must be possible for a \\"community\\" to vote for both conviction and exoneration. The minimum size of a \\"community\\" is 10 men (10 vs 10). One more is required to achieve a majority (11 vs 10), but a simple majority cannot convict, and so an additional judge is required (12 vs 10). Finally, a court should not have an even number of judges to prevent deadlocks; thus 23 (12 vs 10 and 1). This court dealt with only religious matters.  - The Gregorian calendar is internationally the most widely used civil calendar. It is named after Pope Gregory XIII, who introduced it in October 1582.  - Halakha (; also transliterated as halacha, halakhah, halachah or halocho) is the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah. It includes the 613 \\"mitzvot\\" (\\"commandments\\"), subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic law and the customs and traditions compiled in the \\"Shulchan Aruch\\" (literally \\"Prepared Table\\", but more commonly known as the \\"Code of Jewish Law\\").  - Ezra ('; fl. 480440 BCE), also called Ezra the Scribe  and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra, was a Jewish scribe and a priest. According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Seraiah (Ezra 7:1) the last high priest to serve in the first temple (kings 2 25:18), and a close relative of Joshua the first High Priest of the second temple (chronicles 1 5:40-41. see also Ezra 3:2). He returned from the Babylonian exile and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem (Ezra 710 and Neh 8). According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodoxy, he was also a high priest. Rabbinic tradition holds that he was only a common priest.   - The Shulchan Aruch (, literally: \\"Set Table\\") also known by various Jewish communities but not all as \\"the Code of Jewish Law.\\" There are various legal codes in Judaism but the Shulchan Aruch is the most widely consulted. It was authored in Safed (today in Israel) by Yosef Karo in 1563 and published in Venice two years later. Together with its commentaries, it is the most widely accepted compilation of Jewish law ever written.  - Eleazar ben Azariah, was a 1st-century CE Jewish tanna, i.e. Mishnaic sage. He was of the second generation and a junior contemporary of Gamaliel II, Eliezer b. Hyrcanus, and Joshua b. Hananiah, and senior of Akiva. He was a kohen and traced his pedigree for ten generations back to Ezra, and was very wealthy. These circumstances, added to his erudition, gained for him great popularity. When Gamaliel II, in consequence of his provoking demeanor, was temporarily deposed from the patriarchate, Eleazar, though still very young, was elevated to that office by the deliberate choice of his colleagues. He did not, however, occupy it for any length of time, for the Sanhedrin reinstated Gamaliel. He was retained as vice-president (\\"ab bet din\\"), nevertheless, and it was arranged that Gamaliel should lecture three (some say two) Sabbaths, and Eleazar every fourth (or third) Sabbath.  - Zugot \\"Pairs\\" (\\"tqufath hazzughoth\\") refers to the hundred-year period during the time of the Second Temple (515 BCE  70 CE), in which the spiritual leadership of the Jews was in the hands of five successive generations of \\"zugoth\\" (\\"pairs\\") of religious teachers.

Using images from a Russian weather satellite, an incredible time-lapse of Earth in 4K resolution has been created, showing our planet in stunning HD. In the video both hemispheres, and then Earth as a whole, are shown with the sun ‘moving’ across the surface as the planet rotates. Scroll down for video James Tyrwhitt-Drake from the University of Victoria in Canada has created a high-definition video of planet Earth (still from the video shown). In it Earth is seen rotating with the sun sweeping across the surface. He used images from a Russian weather satellite The video uses images captured by the geostationary","output":"Electro-L weather satellite, which was launched by Russia in 2011. The satellite is positioned above the Earth's equator, about 36,000 kilometers (22,369 miles) away from the surface, and it captures high-resolution images of our planet every 30 minutes. Here's a step-by-step process of how the time-lapse was created using these images: Step 1: Collect the images First, to create the time-lapse, James Tyrwhitt-Drake had to collect thousands of images captured by the Russian weather satellite Electro-L. These images provide a detailed view of both the northern and southern hemispheres of the Earth. Step 2: Clean and enhance the images After collecting the raw satellite images, each image needed to be processed to remove any artifacts, noise, or inconsistencies. This step ensures that the final time-lapse will be smooth and visually pleasing. Additionally, color corrections and adjustments were made to enhance the overall appearance of the images, giving them a more vibrant and realistic look. Step 3: Align the images Since the images were taken from a geostationary satellite, they would already be consistent in terms of perspective and orientation. However, to ensure that the final time-lapse is smooth and seamless, each image was carefully aligned with the previous image in the sequence. This step ensures that there are no abrupt jumps or shifts in the position of the Earth as it rotates in the time-lapse video. Step 4: Create the time-lapse sequence Once the images were cleaned, enhanced, and aligned, they were then combined into a time-lapse sequence using specialized software. This software stitched the images together, creating a smooth and seamless video showing the Earth's rotation over an extended period. The final result is a stunning 4K resolution time-lapse video showing the Earth's surface as it rotates, with the sun appearing to move across the surface due to Earth's rotation. Step 5: Share the video Finally, after completing the time-lapse, James Tyrwhitt-Drake shared the video online which allows people around the world to witness the incredible sight of our planet in stunning HD. By sharing the video online, audiences can appreciate the beauty and complexity of our Earth, and it serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding and protecting our environment. In conclusion, the process of creating this amazing time-lapse involved collecting images from a Russian weather satellite, processing and enhancing the images, aligning them, creating the time-lapse sequence, and sharing the video for viewers to enjoy. This incredible video provides a unique perspective on our planet and the speed of its rotation, as seen from space."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, it is impossible to definitively determine the exact source or nature of the sound. The passage describes several potential sources for the sound, including a shoe squeaking, a stomach gurgle, a burp, the leather on someone's chair moving, or even a fart. These are just a few examples of the countless possibilities that could be responsible for the noise. The sound could have been produced by a myriad of everyday audible phenomena or even a combination of multiple sources. However, there is a clue in the passage that offers a hint as to what the sound may have been. After the unidentified noise occurred, the person in question reacted by exclaiming, \\"OH! Excuse me!\\" This reaction suggests that the sound could have been a personal bodily function that typically requires an apology, such as a burp or a fart. Still, this information, while providing some insight, is not enough to definitively identify the source of the sound. It is important to note that human perception of sound can be influenced by various factors, including the surrounding acoustic environment, personal expectations or biases, and the ability to distinguish between different types of noises. As a result, audiences often interpret sounds according to their own unique experiences and associations, which can lead to diverse interpretations of the same auditory event. In summary, without further contextual information or a more concrete description of the sound, it is impossible to conclusively determine its source or nature. However, based on the available details and considering the reaction of the person involved, it appears more likely that the sound came from a bodily function, such as a burp or a fart. Regardless of the exact cause, it is clear that the sound in question elicited a response from the individual and prompted them to apologize, adding to the mystery and intrigue of the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press)      MILAN (AP) — The Latest the collapse of a bridge in Italy (all times local):      5:10 p.m.      The mayor of the Italian city of Genoa says the death toll in the collapse of a highway bridge in the city has risen.      Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci told Sky TG24 that the number of dead was now above 25 people and that 11 others who were injured have been pulled from the rubble.      A huge section of the Morandi Bridge on a main highway linking Italy with France collapsed Tuesday in Genoa during a sudden, violent storm, sending vehicles plunging 45 meters (nearly 150 feet) into a heap of rubble below.      Hundreds of rescue workers with sniffer dogs are searching through the tons of rubble and twisted metal looking for more victims.      The bridge is on a key highway that connects Genoa to the eastern Liguria coastline and to France.      ___      4:45 p.m.      It's too early to say what caused the deadly collapse of a highway bridge in the Italian city of Genoa, but corrosion or weather conditions could have been part of the cause, a structural engineer specializing in bridges says.      \\"As this reinforced and prestressed concrete bridge has been there for 50 years it is possible that corrosion of tendons or reinforcement may be a contributory factor,\\" said Ian Firth, former president of The Institution of Structural Engineers.      \\"The fact that there was reported to be a storm at the time may or may not be particularly relevant. In addition, ongoing work on the bridge may or may not be partly responsible for the collapse,\\" he added.      Firth said the bridge is an unusual design but is similar to a larger bridge in Venezuela, and both were designed by Riccardo Morandi.      ___      3:45 p.m.      The head of Italy's civil protection agency Angelo Borrelli has put the number of victims of the Genoa bridge collapse at 20 people dead and 13 injured.      Borrelli told a press conference in Rome on Tuesday that the victims appear to all have been in vehicles that plunged from the bridge. Borrelli said that while there are two warehouses below the collapse it is believed they were closed for the summer holiday and that no one was inside. He said no residences were involved.      Borelli said that highway engineers were checking the safety of the bridge in other points, and that some areas were being evacuated as a precaution.      Earlier, Italy's deputy transport minister Edoardo Rixi said the number of victims had risen to at least 22 dead and eight injured.      ___      3:30 p.m.      Italian      Rixi told Sky TG24 that, as he was speaking, emergency response crews were recovering a body from an automobile that was suspended on a central part of the bridge.      Rixi said it is \\"the biggest tragedy involving a bridge of this importance in Europe in the last decades.\\"      He said that at least 20 vehicles on the bridge had plunged in the collapse, and that also people in buildings below the bridge were in some way involved. That included the trash management offices for the city of Genoa.      ___      3 p.m.      French President Emmanuel Macron has offered Italy his country's help after a bridge collapsed in the Italian city of Genoa.      The president's office said that Macron, who is currently staying at a presidential residence in southern France, had a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.      In French and Italian, Macron wrote on Twitter: \\"Our thoughts go to the victims, their relatives and all the Italian people. France stands by Italy in that tragedy and is ready to provide all necessary support.\\"      The disaster occurred on a major highway that connects Italy to France and other vacation resorts.      ___      2:20 p.m.      The Italian news agency ANSA citing the Interior Ministry says that 11 people are confirmed dead in the collapse of a highway bridge in the port city of Genoa.      ANSA reported Tuesday that five people are injured and in serious condition. The Interior Ministry press office could not immediately confirm the fatalities.      An official with Italian firefighters, Amalia Tedeschi, told RAI state TV that some 20 vehicles, including cars and trucks, had been involved in the collapse. She confirmed that two people had been extracted alive from vehicles, with injuries.      Tedeschi said that sniffer dogs are at work in the rubble looking for more injured and victims. In addition, heavy equipment was being moved in so they could lift pieces of the bridge.      Tedeschi said the part of the bridge that collapsed was about 80 meters (yards) in length. Media reports had earlier put it at 200 meters.      ___      1:30 p.m.      Italian news agency ANSA says one person has been extracted alive from the rubble of the bridge collapse near the northern city of Genoa and is being transported by helicopter to a hospital.      ANSA says Italian rescue workers have identified at least 10 vehicles involved the bridge collapse.      There was no immediate word on overall deaths or injuries. Maria Luisa Catalano of the highway police in Genoa said work was ongoing, adding, \\"we don't know numbers of victims/injured yet.\\"      Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said some 200 fire fighters are responding to the accident. On Twitter he says \\"we are following minute by minute the situation of the bridge collapse in Genoa.\\"      The bridge is an important interchange between the northern regions of Lombardy and Piedmont and the beaches of Liguria, and to the main highway heading westward into France.      ___      12:55 p.m.      Italian authorities say that about 10 vehicles were involved when a raised highway collapsed during a sudden and violent storm in the northern port city of Genoa.      Private broadcaster Sky TG24 said that a 200-meter section of the Morandi Bridge collapsed Tuesday over an industrial zone, and firefighters told The Associated Press that there are concerns about gas lines.      Police on Twitter said the collapse occurred during a sudden, violent storm, while firefighters said vehicles were involved, indicating the likelihood of fatalities.      Photos published by the ANSA news agency on its website showed a huge gulf between two sections of the highway.

About 30 vehicles, including cars and trucks, were on the affected section when it fell 100 metres, mostly on to rail tracks, the fire service said.      Investigators are now looking at what could have caused such a catastrophic collapse, creating a scene rescuers compared to the aftermath of an earthquake. Sniffer dogs searched through the rubble, and heavy equipment was moved in to lift pieces of the bridge. Heavy rain also made conditions more challenging.      As cars and trucks tumbled off the bridge, truck driver Afifi Idriss just managed to come to a halt in time. “I saw the green lorry in front of me stop and then reverse so I stopped too, locked the truck and ran,” he told AFP.      The green truck was still on the bridge in the late evening, stopped just short of the now yawning gap.

People are in shock, it’s a very important arterial road that connects Lombardy and Piedmont with Liguria.”      Alberto Lercari, a bus driver, earlier told Corriere della Sera: “I saw people running towards me, barefoot and terrified. I heard a roar. People ran away coming towards me. It was horrible.”      Davide Ricci, who had been travelling south, told La Stampa: “The debris landed about 20 metres from my car.

The family had been making their way from Lucca, in Tuscany, to the Ligurian town of Imperia. A couple of friends and their baby had been travelling in another car.      “I’ve had some time to calm down and am now trying to understand what happened, but my wife and our friends are very shocked,” Pierami said.      “We didn’t hear or see anything, but after passing the bridge stopped at an Autogrill [roadside restaurant], and started to receive calls from family.”      Pierami, an engineer, had driven over the bridge many times before. “There was lots of traffic; there is always a lot of traffic there.”      Facebook Twitter Pinterest How the bridge appeared before its collapse. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo      The Italian transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, immediately blamed the collapse on poor infrastructure maintenance and pledged that those responsible “would pay”. The minister, from the Five Star Movement, was rebuked by the opposition for using “political propaganda” so soon after the tragedy.      Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, arrived in Genoa on Tuesday night and was expected to be joined later by his deputy, Luigi Di Maio.      Conte said: “It’s too early to talk about the causes and hypothesis, but one thing is certain, a tragedy of this kind cannot be repeated.”      The president, Sergio Mattarella, expressed his condolences in a statement, while stressing that Italians should be guaranteed the right “to modern and efficient infrastructure that accompanies everyday life”.

No authority can evade an exercise of full responsibility.”      The Morandi bridge, which was inaugurated in 1967, is 90-metres high and just over 1km long. Restructuring work on the bridge was carried out in 2016. The highway operator said work to strengthen the road foundations of the bridge was being carried out at the time of the collapse, and the bridge was constantly monitored.      Andrea Montefusco, an engineering expert at Luiss University in Rome, said: “It’s difficult to make any serious hypothesis right now.

Possible A: new jersey, new york, minnesota, eastern united states, connecticut  Why is \\"connecticut\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Connecticut\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context for several reasons. First, let's analyze the question: \\"He took a toll road and ended up in a state he couldn't spell, it was probably which one?\\" In this question, the main clue is that the subject couldn't spell the name of the state they ended up in, suggesting that the state has a more complex or less intuitive spelling than others. Now let's consider the possible answers: 1. New Jersey - This state's name consists of two simple words and has a straightforward spelling. 2. New York - Like New Jersey, this state's name consists of two simple words and has an easy-to-spell name. 3. Minnesota - Although longer, the spelling of Minnesota is phonetic and generally simple for most English speakers. 4. Eastern United States - This is not a specific state, but rather a region, so it is not a suitable answer. 5. Connecticut - This state's name has a non-phonetic spelling and may be challenging for some people, especially those unfamiliar with it. The 'c' before the 't' in \\"Connecticut\\" may be easily overlooked, leading to misspellings. Among the possible answers, \\"Connecticut\\" has the most challenging spelling, making it the answer that aligns with human common sense. Additionally, since the question mentions the subject was on a toll road, it is worth noting that some highways in Connecticut, such as the Merritt Parkway, have tolls. This provides further support for Connecticut as the state in question.

This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train. Previously, we've set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but must rally in the face of attack. I've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn. However, Bruce Cabot's allure is pretty much a mystery to me - he's base and unsubtle in comparison, but I've always felt he'd just emerged, smiling, from under a car, covered in grease and a sixth grade education.

It has a face value of 1 million, and while it would make investigators' job very easy if the crooks tried to spend it, police believe they will either melt the coin down or deliver it to a collector who hired them to steal it, the Globe and Mail reports. The Bode Museum in Berlin has housed the coin in its collection since 2010, reports the CBC. First issued by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2007 with an image of Queen Elizabeth II on one side and the country's symbolic maple leaf on the other, the coin made it into the Guinness Book of Records for its record-breaking gold purity of 99.999%. Authorities say the coin was secured behind bullet-proof glass in the building and that the bandits appear to have entered through a window, using a ladder that they left on nearby train tracks. The original coin is in Ottawa, while five others, including this one, were sold to private individuals. (Check out which day these thieves picked to pull off a jewelry heist.)","output":"Once upon a time in Germany, there was a museum called the Bode Museum, where there was a very special coin. This coin was called the \\"Big Maple Leaf.\\" It was from Canada and was really big, super gold, and very shiny. The Big Maple Leaf coin was so special that it was worth about 4 million! One night, when everyone was sleeping, a group of sneaky thieves went to the museum. They found a way to get past the security system and got inside. They saw the beautiful coin and knew they wanted it for themselves. They found out it was very heavy and weighed 220 pounds! Even though it was so heavy, the thieves managed to take the coin and run away.  Now the police are looking for the sneaky thieves and the special coin. They think the thieves might try to melt the coin or give it to someone who really wanted it. The museum is very sad because they've had the Big Maple Leaf coin since 2010, and now it's gone. The Big Maple Leaf coin was extra special because it set a record for how gold it was - 99.999% gold! It had a picture of Queen Elizabeth II on one side and a maple leaf, which represents Canada, on the other side. Now, the police will keep searching until they find the sneaky thieves and bring the special coin back to the museum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

His seemingly selfish decision has ruined his image in the eyes of many, including journalist Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who writes a scathing article claiming that the world \\"doesn't need Superman\\". Billionaire Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), who lost his fame and fortune after being exposed as a criminal by Superman, secures an early release from prison and marries an old heiress, whose subsequent death makes him wealthy once again. Upon returning to Metropolis, Superman, in his human identity of Clark Kent, is shocked to discover the consequences of his disappearance. While covering the launch of a space shuttle, he narrowly saves a plane carrying Lois and other observers from crashing after a mysterious power failure, an act that earns him much goodwill. Unbeknownst to anyone, the accident was triggered by Luthor using Kryptonian technology stolen from the Fortress of Solitude. Clark tries to fix his relationship with Lois, but soon learns that she is engaged to Richard White (James Marsden), nephew of Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White (Frank Langella), with whom she shares a young, asthmatic son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu).

Suspecting his involvement, Lois requests an off-the-record interview aboard his private yacht. Luthor admits that he is indeed responsible and reveals his true plan: to create a new continent modeled after Krypton that he can shape in his image, while triggering massive tsunamis that will wipe out the nations of the world and force humanity to turn to him for survival.

You know how police officers and some other people carry things called 'guns' to help keep us safe? Some people have special permission to keep these guns hidden from view, which we call \\"concealed-weapons carry permits.\\" This is a permission slip that says, \\"I can carry my gun to protect myself or others if necessary.\\" Guess what? At the CU Campuses in Boulder and Colorado Springs, only a tiny number (less than 1%) of students have these special \\"concealed-weapons carry permits\\" to bring a hidden gun. This new rule talks about how these guns can and cannot be brought into different areas of the campus. There are special events called \\"athletic\\" and \\"cultural\\" ones that happen at the CU Campuses. Athletic events are things like basketball games, where students run around and have lots of fun. Cultural events could be plays or music performances, where students show off their talents.

An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: \\"We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land.\\" The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp.

Write an article with the title: \\"New Fafsa Rules to Eliminate Frustrating Financial Aid Problem\\" Article:","output":"Title: New Fafsa Rules to Make Getting Money for School Easier Hello friends! Today, we are going to talk about something important for kids who want to go to college when they grow up. It's called Fafsa, which is short for \\"Free Application for Federal Student Aid\\". This is a special form that students fill out to get money to help pay for college. But sometimes, the form can be very confusing, and that makes people feel frustrated. So, new Fafsa rules are coming to make things easier and get rid of those problems! First, let's talk about why Fafsa is important. You see, college can be very expensive, and many students need some help to pay for it. When they fill out the Fafsa form, they can ask for money like grants and loans from the government and from their schools. The form looks at things like their family's money and how many people live in their home, then figures out how much help they need. But the problem is that sometimes, students and their families have troubles with the form. Maybe they don't know how to answer some questions, or they make a mistake when filling it out. Then, they might not get the right amount of money for college, and that can be very frustrating! That's why the people in charge of Fafsa are making new rules. Let's look at some changes that will help make things easier and get rid of those problems: 1. Easier to Understand: The Fafsa form will use simpler words and questions that are easy for everyone to understand. So, no more tricky questions that are difficult to answer! 2. Help from Your Phone: Students will be able to use a special app on their phones to fill out the form, which means they can do it from anywhere and get help right away if they're stuck. 3. Faster Answers: The Fafsa form will now connect with other government systems that already have information about students and their families. This means that they won't have to re-enter the same information over and over again – and they'll get answers about how much money they can get faster! 4. More Time: Sometimes, students need to make changes to their form because their situation changes, like if their family's money goes up or down. The new rules will give them more time to make these changes. So there you have it! The new Fafsa rules are all about making it easier for students to get the money they need for college. No more frustrating problems! We hope this helps our little friends who are dreaming about going to college one day. Just remember, even if college seems like a long way away, it's never too early to start thinking about your future and how Fafsa can help you get there!"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses.

Two different rivers were stocked with adult fish. Red river had a lower fish population because the fish had hardly reproduced naturally. Black river had doubled it's fish population in two years because they reproduced naturally.  Which of the two rivers had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body?  Hint: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, it appears that the Red River had fewer fish lay eggs outside of the body compared to the Black River. The clue here lies in the differences in fish populations and their ability to reproduce naturally. The fish in the Black River doubled their population in two years, suggesting that the conditions allowed for successful external fertilization and subsequently, a high survival rate for the eggs. This reproduction pattern is typical in most fish species, where eggs are laid and fertilized outside the mother's body. On the other hand, the fish in the Red River had a lower population and struggled to reproduce naturally. This could potentially be due to a lower rate of external egg-laying or less successful fertilization. It is also possible that the fish species in the Red River primarily reproduce through internal fertilization or that environmental factors negatively influenced the success of external fertilization. In conclusion, the Red River likely had fewer fish laying eggs outside of their body, resulting in lower reproduction rates and a smaller fish population compared to the Black River. However, it is essential to consider other factors, such as environmental conditions and the specific fish species involved, to gain a clearer understanding of the differences in reproductive patterns observed between the two rivers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The prevalence of sexual harassment has taken center stage in the wake of recently reported harassment and assault allegations involving well-known celebrities, politicians, and media figures. Yet with shocking, headline-worthy stories emerging almost daily, sexual harassment should not be mistaken as a problem limited to elite circles.      The actual data tell a different story about sexual harassment claims—in which they occur on a daily basis and across all industries. The vast majority of these claims occur out of the glare of the spotlight, where public scrutiny and attention is rare. Many women grapple with gender biases and power imbalances within their workplaces, making them targets for harassment or other forms of discrimination. Women of color, in particular, often must confront the combined impact of racial, ethnic, and gender prejudice that can result in degrading stereotypes about their sexual mores or availability and increase their risk of being harassed. Furthermore, women—particularly women of color—are more likely to work lower-wage jobs, where power imbalances are often more pronounced and where fears of reprisals or losing their jobs can deter victims from coming forward.      This column analyzes new, unpublished data on sexual harassment charges in the private sector filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) over the past decade. The analysis shows the breadth of sexual harassment charges affecting both women and men in every industry and in every corner of the workforce. Specifically, the findings reveal:      More than one-quarter of sexual harassment charges were filed in industries with large numbers of service-sector workers, including many low-wage jobs that are often occupied by women.      Nearly three-quarters of sexual harassment charges include an allegation of retaliation either upon being filed or later on in an investigation, suggesting that many victims face retribution when they come forward.      Understanding the pervasiveness of sexual harassment is critical in order to identify and deploy effective strategies to combat discriminatory practices—such as the use of gender-based stereotypes or the exclusion of women from high-level positions—that can enable harassment to take root. Understanding of the scope of the problem is essential in order to target enforcement resources where they are most needed and for maximum impact.      Sexual harassment occurs across all industries      Individuals alleging sexual harassment can file a charge with the EEOC—the federal agency responsible for enforcing critical employment discrimination laws, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Most sexual harassment charges are filed under Title VII, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on factors such as sex, race, or national origin. Nearly one-third of the more than 90,000 charges filed with the EEOC in fiscal year 2016 involved a claim of some form of harassment—almost half of which involved sex-based harassment.      The number of private-sector sexual harassment charges filed with the EEOC each year offers useful insight into industry differences and from where claims arise. Based on an analysis of unpublished data from fiscal years 2005 through 2015, the EEOC received more than 85,000 charges alleging sexual harassment. Of these charges, nearly half—48.3 percent—include a designation indicating the specific industry in which the charges occurred. This industry-specific sample provides a representative snapshot of the differences in sexual harassment charges across industries over the 10-year period. (see Figure 1)      The largest number of claims were found in the accommodation and food services industry, followed by retail trade, manufacturing, and health care industries. (see Figure 2)      Accommodation and food services      The accommodation and food services industry—including full-service restaurants, fast-food restaurants, coffee shops, recreational facilities, inns, hotels, and other hospitality establishments—accounted for 14.2 percent of the sexual harassment claims filed. Recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show that women represent the majority of workers in the accommodation and food services industry, often in lower-paying jobs such as food servers and preparers.      The data on sexual harassment claims are bolstered by other research documenting long-standing concerns regarding its prevalence within this industry. For instance, a recent survey of fast-food workers found that two-thirds of female workers and more than half of male workers had experienced sexual harassment from restaurant management; nearly 80 percent of women and 70 percent of men reported sexual harassment from co-workers; and nearly 80 percent of women and 55 percent of men experienced some form of sexual harassment from customers. In addition, a Hart Research Associates survey found that 40 percent of women working in the fast-food industry had experienced some form of sexual harassment.      Retail trade      The retail trade industry, which accounted for 13.4 percent of the EEOC’s sexual harassment claims, includes businesses that engage in a variety of consumer sales such as department stores, grocery stores, florists, gas stations, drug stores, gift shops, office supply stores, and other retail establishments. Similar to in the food services industry, many of the jobs in retail trade—such as cashiers and sales clerks—are low-paying and occupied predominantly by women. Overall, more than one-quarter of sexual harassment claims arose in these two industries—both of which contain large numbers of service-sector jobs.      Manufacturing      In contrast to accommodations and food services and retail trade, women represent a much smaller percentage of the workforce in the manufacturing industry. Recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that women represent just under 30 percent of workers in the manufacturing industry. Because many manufacturing jobs—such as machinists and craft workers—have long been male-dominated, women who enter the field may lack power or be seen as outsiders, thus making them targets for harassment.      Health care and social assistance      The health care and social assistance industry includes a range of jobs—from registered nurses to medical assistants to child care workers—many of which are predominantly occupied by women. Some of these jobs are also low-paying, which can add to the economic stress of workers who rely on their jobs to make ends meet. For instance, the overwhelming majority of home health aides are women—at 89 percent—and more than half are people of color. These workers, who typically provide in-home care for low wages, often work in individualized settings where they can become isolated and vulnerable to exploitation.      Most charges are filed by women      Over the EEOC’s 10-year time period, women reported the vast majority of sexual harassment charges at 80 percent—more than 68,000 charges. Clearly, women continue to confront much of the alleged harassment that occurs in the workplace. The data show, however, that men experience workplace sexual harassment as well. These data reinforce the need for both employers and employees to undertake comprehensive education and training in order to convey the pervasiveness of sexual harassment that occurs, regardless of gender.      The majority of charges filed include allegations of retaliation      Additional unpublished data on sexual harassment charges from fiscal years 2016 and 2017 reveal that allegations of sexual harassment are often coupled with allegations of retaliation. (see Table 1) For example, in FY 2016, approximately 72 percent of sexual harassment charges filed included a charge of retaliation. Similarly, in FY 2017, retaliation allegations were included in 71 percent of sexual harassment charges.      These data suggest that sexual harassment complainants are often targeted for retribution or other adverse conduct, perhaps due to efforts at intimidation or to dissuade them from complaining. This suggests the need for greater attention to the implementation strategies of sexual harassment policies in the workplace as well as for stronger disciplinary or accountability measures specifically aimed at retaliatory conduct.      Conclusion      Sexual harassment is a persistent problem in the workplace and one that affects people across industries and at every level. To combat it, it is essential to have a clear understanding of where problems are most likely to occur as well as to undertake robust measures to target discriminatory practices. This includes creating a sound infrastructure to counter workplace sexual harassment, starting with enforcing strong leadership from the top; communicating clear policies; conducting comprehensive training with supervisors and staff; establishing an internal reporting mechanism that operates with integrity; and imposing strong disciplinary measures when appropriate. It also requires vigorous efforts to combat retaliation and improve enforcement through measures such as collecting more extensive data on trends across industries. Most importantly, it is crucial to devote special resources that root out harassment—especially in lower-wage occupations, where significant power imbalances can often inhibit workers’ ability to speak out against their harassers. Reducing the pervasiveness of sexual harassment in the workplace requires intentional and concrete action at every level and across every industry.

About 25,000 members of the Culinary Union voted Tuesday to authorize a citywide strike in Las Vegas unless they reach a contract deal with their employers by June 1, union spokeswoman Bethany Khan said.      The contracts of 50,000 workers, including bartenders, guest room attendants, cocktail servers, porters and cooks at 34 casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and Downtown Las Vegas are set to expire May 31.      The workers eligible for the strike are about half of the hospitality employee population in the city, Khan said.

A:","output":"The best answer choice from the given options is the \\"Pituitary\\" gland. The pituitary gland plays a crucial role in regulating human metabolism by producing and secreting TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). TSH, in turn, stimulates the thyroid gland to produce hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These thyroid hormones are responsible for increasing the rate of metabolism in cells throughout the body.  It is important to recognize the relationship between the pituitary gland and the thyroid gland in this metabolic process. The pituitary gland acts as a central regulator that releases TSH to communicate with the thyroid gland and control the production of thyroid hormones. In situations where the level of thyroid hormones drops, the pituitary gland increases its secretion of TSH, which in turn prompts the thyroid gland to generate more hormones. This intricate feedback loop ensures that the body maintains proper metabolism levels, cellular energy production, and overall physiological balance.  Although the thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) are directly involved in regulating metabolism, it is the pituitary gland that controls their production through the secretion of TSH.

It hasn't been an easy road for Lin. After high school, Lin sent his resume  and a DVD of highlights to all the Ivy League schools, and his dream schools Stanford and UCLA. Harvard and Brown were the only schools that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. After graduating from Harvard University, Lin went undrafted in the 2010 NBA Draft . Lin spent his first season with his hometown the Golden State Warriors. He saw limited minutes with the Warriors, but was cheered in arenas  around the country, particularly in cities with large Asian communities, as fans came out in crowds to cheer their homegrown star. In late 2011, Lin spent less than two weeks with the Houston Rockets, moving to the New York Knicks at the very end of the year. He has made several trips to the NBA's Development League, a minor league for players who show promise but need seasoning before they can compete at the highest level. It appears to have paid off. In February 2012, after keying the Knicks victory over New Jersey, Lin was named the starter for the Utah game, a position he appears to have a hold on in the short term, as Baron Davis, who signed in December to play the position, stays on the disabled list. Lin will likely get stronger the more minutes he plays, and even if Davis returns, spelling the older, recovering player could be productive for Lin: a proven good student who can learn a lot from practicing against a veteran. Without the services of All-Stars Carmelo and Amare, Lin led New York to a 4-0 record last week.

Garrigan becomes attracted to Sarah, who enjoys the attention, but refuses to engage in an extramarital affair. Meanwhile, General Idi Amin overthrows incumbent president Milton Obote in a coup d'Ã©tat. Garrigan sincerely believes Amin will help the country, while Sarah warns him of presidents who have taken over before. Garrigan is called to a minor car accident involving Amin where he treats his hand. During the incident, Garrigan takes a gun and shoots a mortally wounded cow because no one else has the presence of mind to put it out of its misery. Amin is impressed by his quick action and initiative. Amin, fond of Scotland as a symbol of resilience and admiring the Scottish people for their resistance to the English, is delighted to discover Garrigan's nationality and exchanges his military shirt for Garrigan's Scotland shirt. Later, Amin invites Garrigan to become his personal physician and take charge of modernising the country's health care system. Garrigan soon becomes Amin's trusted confidant and is relied on for much more than medical care, such as matters of state. Although Garrigan is aware of violence around Kampala, he accepts Amin's explanation that cracking down on the opposition will bring lasting peace to the country.

Although the description \\"A lady setting up multicolored balls in a contraption\\" shares similarities with a lady building a ball pit, we cannot definitively conclude that it is a ball pit. A ball pit is typically an enclosed play area filled with multicolored balls, providing a fun and interactive environment for children to play in. It is important to keep in mind that multicolored balls can be used in various situations beyond a ball pit, and thus, not all scenarios involving multicolored balls equate to a ball pit. The term \\"contraption\\" refers to a device or machine that is intricate or complex and may serve a specific purpose. It is a vague description that does not provide enough information to identify the object specifically as a ball pit. The lady setting up the balls in a contraption could be working on an art installation, a mechanical system, a carnival game, or any number of applications with multicolored balls. Additionally, the phrase \\"setting up\\" suggests that the lady is in the process of assembling or positioning the multicolored balls. Although it is indeed possible that she is building a ball pit, there is not enough information provided in the description to draw a firm conclusion. The statement does not specify the size of the contraption, the area it occupies, or the intended purpose of the device.  In conclusion, while the lady working with multicolored balls and a contraption does evoke images of a ball pit, we cannot definitively conclude that she is building a ball pit without more information. There are various other possibilities for the use of multicolored balls and contraptions, and with the limited information available, it would be a speculative assumption to determine that it is a ball pit being built."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Developed from a 1974 article published in the Rolling Stone magazine by Paul Morantz , who also helped write the screenplay .  - The Synanon organization, initially a drug rehabilitation program, was founded by Charles E. \\"Chuck\\" Dederich, Sr., (19131997) in 1958 in Santa Monica, California, United States. By the early 1960s, Synanon had also become an alternative community, attracting people with its emphasis on living a self-examined life, as aided by group truth-telling sessions that came to be known as the \\"Synanon Game.\\" Synanon ultimately became the Church of Synanon in the 1970s, and disbanded permanently in 1991 due to many criminal activities, including attempted murder of which members were convicted, and legal problems, including losing its tax free status retroactively with the Internal Revenue Service due to financial misdeeds, destruction of evidence and terrorism. It has been called one of the \\"most dangerous and violent cults America had ever seen.\\"   - Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera \\"Crotalus\\" and \\"Sistrurus\\" of the subfamily Crotalinae (the pit vipers). The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies, all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta and southern British Columbia in Canada to central Argentina.  - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.  - A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series. In general usage, the term is most commonly seen in reference to a standalone production, such as a television film, a television play or an episode of an anthology series; in internal industry usage, however, all television scripts (including episodes of ongoing drama or comedy series) are teleplays, although a \\"teleplay\\" credit may be subsumed into a \\"written by\\" credit depending on the circumstances of its creation.  - Self-help or self-improvement is a self-guided improvementeconomically, intellectually, or emotionallyoften with a substantial psychological basis. Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and Twelve-Step culture, such as recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency have become firmly integrated in mainstream language.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - Paul Morantz is an American attorney and investigative journalist.  He is known for taking legal cases alleging brainwashing by cults, self-help groups and for sexual misconduct by psychotherapists. He is considered an expert on these subjects. His successful prosecution of Synanon led to an attempt against his life, by means of a rattlesnake.  - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program.

There he meets and courts socialite Leslie Lynnton, who ends a budding relationship with British diplomat Sir David Karfrey and marries Bick after a whirlwind romance. They return to Texas to start their life together on the family ranch, Reata, where Bick's older sister Luz runs the household. Leslie meets Jett Rink, a local handyman, and he becomes infatuated with her. Leslie discovers on a ride with Jett that the local Mexican workers' living conditions are terrible. After tending to one of the Mexican children, Angel Obregon II, she presses Bick to take steps to improve their condition. When riding Leslie's beloved horse, War Winds, Luz expresses her hostility for Leslie by cruelly digging in her spurs; War Winds bucks her off, killing her. She leaves Jett a small piece of land on the Benedict ranch. Bick, who despises Jett, tries to buy back the land, but Jett refuses to sell. Jett makes the land his home and names it Little Reata.

Possible answers: [-] no [-] yes","output":"Alright, let's first talk about the effects of the Cambodia earthquake and the Lisbon earthquake in 1755. The Cambodia earthquake happened in a country named Cambodia. It caused the ground to shake, and some buildings and houses got damaged. People got scared, and some may have got hurt. Now, let's talk about the Lisbon earthquake in 1755. The Lisbon earthquake happened in a city called Lisbon, which is in a country named Portugal. This earthquake was very big and caused a lot of buildings to fall down. Many people got hurt or lost their homes. There was also a big wave called a tsunami that came from the ocean and caused more damage. When we compare both the earthquakes, we see the Lisbon earthquake in 1755 was much more dangerous than the Cambodia earthquake. It caused more damage, and many more people got hurt. Now, let's talk about the Cambodia earthquake and the Concepcion earthquake in 1835. The Concepcion earthquake happened in a city called Concepcion, in a country named Chile. Just like the other earthquakes, the ground shook, and buildings and houses got damaged. Some people were hurt, and some may have lost their homes. When we compare both these earthquakes, we still see that they are different. The Cambodia earthquake happened in Cambodia, while the Concepcion earthquake happened in Chile. But both of them caused the ground to shake and some damage to buildings and houses. So, now let's see if the two questions are paraphrases of each other. The first question is comparing the Cambodia earthquake with the Lisbon earthquake in 1755, while the second question is comparing the Cambodia earthquake with the Concepcion earthquake in 1835. The answer is: [-] no These two questions are not paraphrases of each other because they are comparing the Cambodia earthquake with two different earthquakes that happened in different places and at different times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Shutdown: The Zaporozhiya nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine where one of six reactors was automatically taken off-line yesterday following an electrical fault Earlier this month another of","output":"the plant's reactors underwent a similar shutdown due to an electrical malfunction. While these incidents raise concerns over the safety and reliability of Ukraine's aging nuclear infrastructure, it is important to understand what led to these events and what measures are being taken to prevent future occurrences. The Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant is the largest in Europe and the fifth-largest in the world, with a total installed capacity of 5,700 MW. It is a critical component of Ukraine's power supply, contributing around 25% of the country's total electricity production. The facility includes six VVER-1000 reactors, all of which were commissioned between 1984 and 1995, making them more than 25 years old. In both recent cases, the reactors were automatically shut down by the plant's internal defense mechanism as a result of electrical malfunctions. These safety measures are designed to minimize the risk of accidents and ensure that the reactor remains under control even in the event of unexpected issues. The first reactor was shut down earlier this month, and after the fault was repaired, it was reconnected to the power grid. The second reactor experienced a similar issue yesterday morning and, after repairs, it was also reconnected to the grid later in the evening. While these incidents highlight the challenges of maintaining and operating aging nuclear infrastructure, it should be noted that the reactors' safety systems functioned as intended and prevented any further complications. The automatic shutdowns are part of a series of safety protocols in place to protect the plant, its workers, and surrounding areas from any potential harm. Ukraine's nuclear power sector is regulated by the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate (SNRI), which establishes and enforces safety standards and requirements based on international regulations. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also monitors and evaluates the performance of nuclear plants worldwide, offering guidance and support to ensure that countries are adhering to the highest safety standards. Following these recent incidents, it is expected that both the SNRI and IAEA will conduct thorough investigations into the root causes and determine if any further corrective actions are necessary. To address concerns over the aging nuclear infrastructure, Ukraine has been investing in the modernization of its nuclear power plants through various projects aimed at extending their operational life and enhancing safety levels. These projects involve replacing outdated equipment, upgrading safety systems, and incorporating advanced technological solutions where necessary. Additionally, the country is exploring opportunities to diversify its energy mix through renewable sources like solar and wind energy to reduce the reliance on nuclear power. In conclusion, the recent electrical malfunctions at the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant have indeed raised concerns about the safety and reliability of Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure. However, the proper functioning of safety systems in these instances demonstrates the effectiveness of measures already in place. The attention and resources currently being dedicated to modernizing and upgrading the country's nuclear sector, as well as seeking alternative renewable energy sources, will be vital in reducing the risk of future incidents and maintaining a secure and sustainable energy supply for Ukraine."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The people who lived in the town, near the border of the two countries, loved visiting the bridge. They would often walk across the bridge to visit their friends in the other country. It was like having one big neighborhood where everybody was friends with each other. At the center of the bridge, there was a special place called the \\"Friendship Circle.\\" It was a cozy little spot, with a few benches and a beautiful fountain.

The Women's March on Washington, D.C., is coming up later this month, the day after Donald J. Trump is inaugurated the 45th president of the United States. Here's a closer look at the Women's March, with answers to your questions about the event:      What is the Women's March on Washington, D.C.?      Women's rights groups and activist groups are coming together to stage a large demonstration in Washington, D.C., on the first full day of Trump's presidency. Most of the marchers are expected to be women, though men and children are also scheduled to be part of the event.      The march began as a grassroots effort the day after the presidential election. A large number of women marching through the heart of Washington \\"will send a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women's rights are human rights. We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us,\\" organizers said.      When is the Women's March on Washington, D.C.?      The march will be held on Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017. It is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. and end at 5 p.m.      There will also be \\"Sister Marches\\" in nearly every state and several foreign countries.      Why are women marching on Washington, D.C.?      The march is not designed to be an anti-Trump rally, organizers said. But, the event -- first suggested by a grandmother in Hawaii -- is a response to many of the comments about women, minorities and other groups that made headlines during the presidential campaigns.      \\"The rhetoric of the past election cycle has insulted, demonized, and threatened many of us -- women, immigrants of all statuses, those with diverse religious faiths, particularly Muslim, people who identify as LGBTQIA, Native and Indigenous people, Black and Brown people, people with disabilities, the economically impoverished and survivors of sexual assault,\\" the organizers said.      Feminist icon Gloria Steinem is a co-sponsor of the march. Other celebrities who have said they plan to attend include Amy Schumer, Samantha Bee and Jessica Chastain.      Where will the Women's March originate?      The march will begin at 10 a.m. at the intersection of Independence Avenue and Third Street SW, near the U.S. Capitol.      What's the route of the Women's March?      Marchers are expected to walk along Independence Avenue toward the Washington Monument, though organizers said they do not plan to release the official route until a later date for security reasons.      The permit issued by police in Washington, D.C., says march participants will disperse at the southern part of the Ellipse near the White House, at Constitution Avenue between 15th and 17th streets NW.      An earlier plan to hold the rally at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial was nixed when march organizers failed to secure a permit from the National Park Service.      How are people getting to Washington?      Some participants are traveling to the march independently by car, train, airplane and the Washington, D.C., metro system. But, most of the marchers are expected to travel in buses coordinated by local organizing groups in each state. Updated information about transportation from each state is available via email, Facebook or state websites.      How can you get more information?      The Women's March on Washington website contains the latest news on the march, along with information about how to register for the event or donate to the cause. ||||| Janaye Ingram, center, with Ianta Summers and Ted Jackson at 3rd Street and Independence Avenue SW, where the march will begin. Ingram has been the local point person for getting the logistics issues smoothed out. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)      Teresa Shook never considered herself much of an activist, or someone particularly versed in feminist theory. But when the results of the presidential election became clear, the retired attorney in Hawaii turned to Facebook and asked: What if women marched on Washington around Inauguration Day en masse?      She asked her online friends how to create an event page, and then started one for the march she was hoping would happen.      By the time she went to bed, 40 women responded that they were in.      When she woke up, that number had exploded to 10,000.      Now, more than 100,000 people have registered their plans to attend the Women’s March on Washington in what is expected to be the largest demonstration linked to Donald Trump’s inauguration and a focal point for activists on the left who have been energized in opposing his agenda.      (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)      [Women’s March on Washington officially has a permit for Jan. 21]      Planning for the Jan. 21 march got off to a rocky start. Controversy initially flared over the name of the march, and whether it was inclusive enough of minorities, particularly African Americans, who have felt excluded from many mainstream feminist movements.      Organizers say plans are on track, after securing a permit from D.C. police to gather 200,000 people near the Capitol at Independence Avenue and Third Street SW on the morning after Inauguration Day. Exactly how big the march will be has yet to be determined, with organizers scrambling to pull together the rest of the necessary permits and raise the 1 million to 2 million necessary to pull off a march triggered by Shook’s Facebook venting.      The march has become a catch-all for a host of liberal causes, from immigrant rights to police killings of African Americans. But at its heart is the demand for equal rights for women after an election that saw the defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton, the first female presidential nominee of a major party.      “We plan to make a bold and clear statement to this country on the national and local level that we will not be silent and we will not let anyone roll back the rights we have fought and struggled to get,” said Tamika Mallory, a veteran organizer and gun-control advocate who is one of the march’s main organizers.      More than 150,000 women and men have responded on the march’s Facebook page that they plan on attending. At least 1,000 buses are headed to Washington for the march through Rally, a website that organizes buses to protests. Dozens of groups, including Planned Parenthood and the antiwar CodePink, have signed on as partners.      Organizers insist the march is not anti-Trump, even as many of the groups that have latched on to it fiercely oppose his agenda.      1 of 55 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Here’s what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing since the election View Photos He has been holding interviews and meetings as he prepares to transition into the White House.

I’m not going to be silent anymore.’ ”      [Military leaders say inauguration will be steeped in tradition]      Trump Inaugural Committee spokesman Boris Epshteyn defended the president-elect’s popularity among women in an interview on CNN. While Trump did not receive the majority of women’s votes, he got an “overwhelming” number of them, Epshteyn said.      “We’re here to hear their concerns,” he said. “We welcome them to our side as well.”      That all this could grow out of a dashed-off post from her perch nearly 5,000 miles from Washington is amazing to Shook, who has booked her ticket and plans to be in the capital on Jan. 21.      “I guess in my heart of hearts I wanted it to happen, but I didn’t really think it would’ve ever gone viral,” said Shook, who is in her 60s. “I don’t even know how to go viral.”      Unsure of how to proceed in those initial few days, she said she enlisted the help of the first few women who messaged her to volunteer, some of whom independently also had an idea for a march. But as the march grew in prominence, it got caught up in a broader conversation in liberal circles about race and leadership, with activists and others criticizing that initial planning group for its racial makeup: Shook and all the women she tapped to help in the march’s nascent stages are white, she said.      Some also took issue with the name Shook had proposed, the Million Woman March, which was the name of a 1997 gathering of hundreds of thousands of black women in Philadelphia. The racial concerns set off a heated conversation on the group’s main Facebook page, with some African American women especially taking umbrage.      For her part, Shook said her aim was not to co-opt any other movement. It was just an idea that took hold after the victory of a president-elect caught on tape boasting of grabbing women’s private parts and the defeat of a woman who seemed to her much more qualified for the job. She said she had no idea of the race of the women she first contacted; in fact, she said, most had an image of Clinton as their Facebook profile photo.      Complicating matters, it became apparent that the march probably could not start at the Lincoln Memorial as Shook had proposed, since the inaugural committee has dibs on that space.      Overwhelmed and under pressure, the original organizers eventually handed the reins to a diverse group of veteran female activists from New York: Mallory, the gun-control activist; Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York; Carmen Perez, head of the Gathering for Justice, a criminal-justice-reform group; and Bob Bland, a fashion entrepreneur.      Together, they settled on a new name: The Women’s March on Washington, a nod to the 1963 demonstration that was a cornerstone of the civil rights movement. They even received the blessing of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s youngest daughter, Bernice King.      In the District, Janaye Ingram, the former executive director of Al Sharpton’s National Action Network, has been working to secure permits and hash out logistics for the march, including ensuring there is a proper sound equipment and sufficient portable toilets.      People traveling to attend the march seem less concerned with behind-the-scenes politics than the chance to call for more family-friendly government policies, equal pay for women or reproductive rights. Some say they simply want to stand against the crass way Trump has spoken about women.      Lindsey Shriver, a 27-year-old former pastry chef who is an at-home mom in Ohio, said she was offended this election cycle by Trump’s rhetoric, which she characterized as “hateful and misogynistic.” She also wants to highlight the need for paid family leave and affordable child care.      “I realized that being a feminist in my own personal life wasn’t going to be enough for my daughters,” Shriver said.      Caroline Rule, 57, a lawyer living in Manhattan, says she will attend with her 15-year-old daughter. While she agrees with the pro-women message behind the march, she said she would probably participate in any march that pushed against Trump’s messages.      “I absolutely despise Donald Trump and everything he stands for,” she said.      Feminist icon Gloria Steinem has recently signed on as a march co-sponsor, and celebrities including Amy Schumer, Samantha Bee and Jessica Chastain say they plan to attend.      Feminist scholars say the march reflects an emerging view of feminism: one that is less defined by reproductive issues, such as birth control and abortion, and more by how the challenges faced by women intersect with those encountered by African Americans, the LGBT community and immigrants.      [None of the inauguration protests have their proper permits yet. Here’s why.]      Still, reproductive rights will be a large part of the march, with Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America as key partners.      Hahrie Han, a political science professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara specializing in political organizations and political engagement, said it’s not all that surprising that individual women instead of an established organization founded this march. Established organizations all come with at least some political baggage.      “The challenge with having one organization brand it as its own is that each organization has its own image that draws some people and pushes others back away,” she said. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The Women's March on Washington, D.C. is scheduled for January 21, 2017, and is expected to draw over 100,000 participants, including men and children.
