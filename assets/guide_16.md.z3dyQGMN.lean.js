You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which is this about? Eight months after their contract expired, London #39;s outside workers remain without a new deal. Contract talks are not scheduled and none have been held since June when new city manager Jeff Fielding arrived","output":"This situation is about the contract negotiations between London's outside workers, who are employees responsible for various public services such as maintenance, waste management, and transportation services, and the city officials. The workers' contract expired eight months ago, but they have not yet been able to secure a new deal. This has led to a prolonged period of uncertainty for the workers, as they are unsure of their job security, benefits, and future prospects within their current roles. The primary reason for the lack of progress is the absence of any scheduled contract talks between the two parties. In fact, no contract negotiations have taken place since June, which is when the new city manager, Jeff Fielding, took office. It is likely that Fielding is focused on other pressing issues or has different priorities in his new role, which has led to the contract dispute with outside workers being pushed to the side. This situation has several implications for both the outside workers and London as a city. Without a new contract in place, there could be potential impacts on employee morale, their motivation to continue working in their current roles, and an increased likelihood of labor disputes or strike actions, which could disrupt essential services. For the outside workers, not having a new contract in place means that they are not receiving any negotiated pay increases, benefits, or improved working conditions that they may have been anticipating. This can create a sense of frustration among employees, who may feel that their work is undervalued and that their needs are not being considered or respected by city officials. Additionally, employees may be concerned about job security in the absence of a contract. They may worry that their positions are not guaranteed and that they could be subject to sudden changes in their employment status or working conditions. This uncertainty can lead to a decrease in job satisfaction and overall well-being, as well as negatively affecting the climate within the workplace. For the city of London, the lack of a new contract for outside workers could pose several risks. First and foremost, there is the potential for disruptions to essential city services if workers were to go on strike as a result of the ongoing contract dispute. These disruptions could impact the daily lives of London residents, affecting public transport, waste management, and maintenance of public spaces, among other services. Furthermore, with the contract negotiations stalled, London may struggle to attract and retain the best talent in these roles, as potential employees may be deterred by the job insecurity and the perceived lack of investment in employee well-being. This could result in a shortage of skilled outside workers, negatively impacting London's ability to provide high-quality public services to its residents. In conclusion, this situation involves contract negotiations between London's outside workers and city officials, specifically the new city manager, Jeff Fielding. The workers have been without a new contract for eight months, with no scheduled contract talks in sight. This lack of progress could have negative implications for employee morale, job security, and service disruptions, which could ultimately affect the quality of public services delivered to the residents of London. It is in the best interest of both parties to prioritize resolving this issue and establish a new contract that benefits both the outside workers and the city as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When you twist the top and let go, it starts spinning around, right? The Earth's rotation is similar to that spinning top.  A long, long time ago, when the Earth was formed, it was made from smaller pieces of rocks and dust that were spinning in space. As these pieces came together, they kept on spinning, and that's what caused the Earth to rotate on its axis. Now, let's look at the second question. This question is almost the same as the first one, but it's just worded a little differently. Both questions are asking why the Earth spins or rotates around an imaginary line called the axis. So, yes, these questions are pretty much the same thing. So, the reason for the Earth's rotation is the spinning motion it had from the very beginning when it was formed, just like how the spinning top spins when you twist it!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505.

A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers.

The Discovery Expedition of 1901–04, known officially as the British National Antarctic Expedition, was the first official British exploration of the Antarctic regions since James Clark Ross's voyage sixty years earlier. Organized on a large scale under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly. Its scientific results covered extensive ground in biology, zoology, geology, meteorology and magnetism.  The expedition discovered the existence of the only snow-free Antarctic valleys, which contain Antarctica's longest river. Further achievements included the discoveries of the Cape Crozier emperor penguin colony, King Edward VII Land, and the Polar Plateau (via the western mountains route) on which the South Pole is located. The expedition tried to reach the South Pole travelling as far as the Farthest South mark at a reported 82°17′S.

In a petri dish, marked Cell X, Gary sees that substances inside the cell are spreading apart from each other making it less concentrated. In the dish marked Cell Y, Gary sees substances coming together and moving into close proximity to one another.  and a hint : Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher concentration. An example is the sodium-potassium pump.  Please answer this question : Is cell Y moving up or down the concentration gradient? The answer to this question is:","output":"Cell Y is moving up the concentration gradient. This is because substances in Cell Y are coming together and moving into close proximity to one another, resulting in a higher concentration.

Movie producer Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon) gathers them in his office and explains that Shields was calling them because he has a new film idea and he wants the three of them for the project. Shields cannot get financing on his own, but with their names attached, there would be no problem. Pebbel asks the three to allow him to get Shields on the phone before they give their final answer. As they await Shields' call, Pebbel assures the three that he understands why they refused to speak to Shields. The backstory of their involvement with Shields then unfolds in a series of flashbacks. Shields is the son of a notorious former studio head who had been dumped by the industry. The elder Shields was so unpopular that his son had to hire \\"extras\\" to attend his funeral. Despite the industry's ill feelings toward him because of his father, the younger Shields is determined to make it in Hollywood by any means necessary. Shields partners with aspiring director Amiel, whom he meets at his father's funeral. Shields intentionally loses money he does not have in a poker game to film executive Pebbel, so he can talk Pebbel into letting him work off the debt as a line producer. Shields and Amiel learn their respective trades making B movies for Pebbel. When one of their films becomes a hit, Amiel decides they are ready to take on a more significant project he has been nursing along, and Shields pitches it to the studio. Shields gets a 1 million budget to produce the film, but betrays Amiel by allowing someone with an established reputation to be chosen as director. The film's success allows Shields to start his own studio, and Pebbel comes to work for him there. Amiel, now independent of Shields, goes on to become an Oscar-winning director in his own right.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the first names of the people who travelled extensively in Europe? ?  In February 1953 Vaughan Williams and Ursula were married. He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli. The Ninth, premiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert...

As more details regarding the incident come to light, it becomes apparent that the horrific accident was even worse than initially reported. This article will delve into the circumstances of the accident, the history of the waterslide, and the testimonies of park visitors who have faced similar dangers on the ride. The Incident Caleb Schwab ─ son of Kansas lawmaker Scott Schwab ─ was among the riders on the 168-foot \\"Verruckt\\" slide at the Schlitterbahn park. Early investigations revealed that he died from a \\"fatal neck injury.\\" However, lately, a source informed the Associated Press (AP) that the young boy was actually decapitated during the accident. Although the authorities have launched an investigation, the cause of the accident remains unexplained. Previous Concerns and Issues Following the tragic event, several park visitors have come forward with their experiences on the Verruckt waterslide. The Kansas City Star reported a range of problems faced by riders, including loose restraints and flying rafts. Dawn Gentry shared that on July 27, she and her daughter were on the slide when their raft flew off the tracks during the ride's second drop, causing the lifeguards to panic. Gentry stated that she had the impression that it had happened before. Another visitor, Sara Craig, recounted her experiences after the park reopened, stating that when she went down the slide a few weeks ago with her son and his friend, she found the ride to be \\"very, very rough.\\" She mentioned that her Velcro shoulder restraint had come off during her first trip down the slide. Craig also shared that operators allowed her group to use the waterslide with a combined weight of 393 pounds, below the 400-pound minimum required for a safe ride. Calls for Safety and Accountability The tragic death of Caleb Schwab has raised an ongoing discussion about the safety and oversight of amusement park rides. Safety experts and the concerned public are now demanding stronger regulations and a more comprehensive examination of existing safety protocols both at the Schlitterbahn park and other amusement parks nationwide. While the investigations continue, families and park enthusiasts alike are left wondering what powers they have to hold park operators accountable for maintaining the ride safety and preventing further tragedies from occurring. Conclusion The heartbreaking incident involving Caleb Schwab is a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with amusement park rides. It alerts park operators, local authorities, and the public about the critical importance of prioritizing safety measures, establishing a strong regulatory framework, and creating a culture of vigilance and accountability. It is only through these combined efforts that we can prevent such unspeakable tragedies from recurring in the future and ensure that our amusement parks remain a source of fun and excitement instead of fear and loss."},{"instruction":"The swinging doors slammed open.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more people are there than housing units?","output":"Title: The Surplus of People: A Closer Look at the Growing Gap Between Population and Housing Units Introduction The global population has seen a continuous surge over the past few decades, resulting in an increased demand for housing units. However, this demand has not always been met with an equal supply of adequate housing solutions. This article aims to explore the disparity between the number of people and available housing units and to answer the question: How many more people are there than housing units? Step 1: Collecting Data To begin this analysis, it would be essential to gather accurate data on both the global population and housing units from reliable sources. Databases such as the World Bank, Worldometer, or the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) can provide current numbers on population, while statistics on housing units may be found from national housing ministries, the International Housing Partnership (IHP), or the World House Price Index (WHPI). Step 2: Analyzing the Data With reliable data at hand, we can proceed to compare the numbers. Comparing the total number of people with the total number of housing units will give us an overall perspective of the existing gap. To accentuate this understanding, we could compute the ratio of people to housing units – a higher ratio would suggest that there are more people than housing units. It is essential to consider factors such as urbanization and population density when interpreting this ratio. Moving beyond a global level, a country or regional analysis would offer detailed insights into the disparity between population and housing units, taking factors such as income distribution, affordability of housing, and migration into account. This ensures a more accurate and holistic perspective. Step 3: Identifying Causes It's important to understand the factors contributing to this disparity. Possible reasons could include a lack of investment in infrastructure, slow housing construction rates, or regulatory restrictions that hinder the availability of residential land for development. Furthermore, population growth could be contributing to the lack of housing units, putting a strain on already limited resources. Identifying the causes allows us to understand how the gap between people and housing units arises and persists. Step 4: Addressing the Situation As the disparity between population and housing units directly affects the quality of life for millions and exacerbates issues like homelessness and overcrowding, it is vital to work towards viable solutions. Governments, local bodies, and the private sector can collaborate to implement policies and initiatives that address the housing crisis. This could include increasing investment in affordable housing, streamlining building regulations, and promoting sustainable construction practices that can keep up with the growing population. Conclusion While it is difficult to provide a precise numerical difference between the number of people and housing units worldwide without access to real-time data, the gap undoubtedly exists and continues to grow. Governments and other stakeholders must urgently address this issue to ensure that everyone has access to a safe, secure, and affordable place to call home."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is nucleotide that stores genetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus one phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base. The “choices” of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein. RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of base for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. The nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. A purine is a nitrogen-containing molecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine (found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A pyramidine is a nitrogen-containing base with a single ring structure Bonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate group of another form a “backbone,” from which the components’ nitrogen-containing bases protrude. In DNA, two such backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a double helix (Figure 2.29). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that act as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000 genes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which lose their nuclei during development). These genes carry the genetic code to build one’s body, and are unique for each individual except identical twins.

Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block.

This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year.

After pulling the engine apart, he will have likely discovered the specific issues that led to the engine malfunction. His next steps will involve carefully examining each component to identify any damage, wear, or faults that need to be addressed. To repair the engine effectively, Alex will need to carry out the following steps: 1. Clean and inspect all the parts: To ensure a thorough repair, Alex should clean each part of the engine to remove any dirt, debris, or build-up that could be affecting its functionality. He will also inspect each component for signs of damage or wear, making note of any parts that will need to be replaced or repaired. 2. Replace or repair damaged parts: Depending on the extent of damage, Alex may be able to repair certain components, such as grinding down a worn shaft or re-threading a stripped bolt hole. However, severely damaged or worn parts should be replaced entirely to ensure reliable engine performance. 3. Check and adjust clearances: While reassembling the engine, Alex needs to ensure the correct clearances for components such as valves, pistons, and connecting rods. Proper clearances are essential to prevent unwanted friction, component wear, and other issues. 4. Inspect and replace gaskets and seals: Alex should inspect all the gaskets and seals, which play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of individual components by preventing fluid leaks and maintaining pressure. If any gaskets or seals appear to be damaged, brittle, or worn, Alex will need to replace them before reassembling the engine. 5. Reassemble the repaired engine: With all necessary components replaced or repaired, and clearances established, Alex can begin reassembling the engine. He must ensure that each part is reinstalled correctly and in the right order. Tightening all bolts and fasteners to the appropriate torque specifications is critical during this process. 6. Test the engine: Once the engine is fully reassembled, it's crucial that Alex tests its functionality before reinstalling it in the car. He needs to verify that all repairs have been successful, and the engine performs efficiently and effectively. 7. Reinstall the engine in the car: After confirming that the repairs were successful, Alex can reinstall the engine into the car. He will need to reconnect all wires, hoses, and components before attempting to start the vehicle. To summarize, Alex's primary objective now would be to repair the engine so the car would work again. This process will involve several crucial steps, including cleaning and inspecting all the engine components, replacing or repairing damaged parts, adjusting clearances, reassembling the engine, testing its functionality, and reinstalling it back into the car. By completing these steps thoroughly, Alex can ensure that his vehicle returns to a reliable and optimal-performing state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: The 37-year-old Liverpudlian, who first joined Crewe a decade ago, returned to the Alex on loan in November. Boss Steve Davis hoped to make the move a more permanent one in January. But it is understood a 'gentleman's agreement' has now been reached for Lowe to re-join relegated Crewe. Davis first tried to bring the much-travelled marksman to Gresty Road when he first took over at Crewe four years ago. And he hinted that the vastly experienced Lowe would not be the only 'old head' to be brought in this summer to strengthen his predominantly young side. \\"The team's got a lot of potential,\\" Davis told BBC Radio Stoke. \\"It's a very young squad. But they need to learn how to win. They need to find a way to win games. \\"Old heads would certainly help in terms of situations within games. Those characters within the squad who have come into it this season could really help.\\" After starting at non-league Burscough, boyhood Liverpool fan Ryan Lowe did not make his Football League debut until he was almost 22. He made his name with Shrewsbury Town as a winger before the first of two spells with Chester City, during which he went out on loan to Stockport, followed by moves to Crewe, Bury, Sheffield Wednesday, MK Dons, Tranmere Rovers and then back to Gigg Lane. Ryan Lowe hit 17 goals in 74 games in two seasons at Gresty Road from 2006 to 2008. He then scored two more in six appearances - which included two of Crewe's six wins this season - when he returned on a six-week loan in November. But he has been used a lot more by Bury since Christmas, adding four more goals to a career tally that reached 200 on Saturday when he netted in the Shakers' 3-1 home defeat by Millwall.

Cinderella and the Prince are having a picnic to celebrate their one-year anniversary. Meanwhile, at the Tremaine mansion, Cinderella's stepsisters Anastasia and Drizella are bitterly doing Cinderella's old chores. Anastasia wanders off to avoid work and stumbles upon the picnic. When the Fairy Godmother drops her wand, Anastasia takes it to her mother. In the ensuing struggle, Anastasia inadvertently turns the Fairy Godmother into a garden gnome. Lady Tremaine, reveling at yet another chance to ruin Cinderella's life, uses the wand to go back in time to the day the Grand Duke fitted the glass slipper on Cinderella.

There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824.

But you know you’re running in vain. The robots are coming and this forest won’t hide you for long.      When the robot uprising happens, you’ll have Google—or Alphabet, as its parent company is soon to be called—to thank for those robots’ ability to track through the world. Its subsidiary Boston Dynamics has taught its Atlas robot, which was the backbone for many of the robots at the recent DARPA Robotics Challenge, how to find its way out in the world.      According to Popular Science, the engineers sent the Atlas robot out into the world for the first time, trailed by someone carrying a power pack tethered to the robot. In the future, however, it will be able to wander on its own, Boston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert said at a recent conference hosted by the Fab Foundation.      Atlas, initially appearing to look like a drunk person stumbling home through the woods after an exceedingly heavy night, seems to have perfected the ability to walk, and even jog, in the woods. Raibert said that Atlas’ mobility is “in shooting range” of a human’s, but not quite up to that standard yet.      YouTube/Michael Campbell Terrifying.      And if that’s not terrifying enough, the engineers at Boston Dynamics—seemingly taking inspiration from the evil kid in the first “Toy Story” movie—have made a robot dog with an arm for a head.      Raibert added that the team took Atlas to see how it fared in uncertain conditions. Atlas uses a laser radar system to “see” the world, similar to Google’s self-driving cars. “Out in the world is just a totally different challenge than in the lab,” he said in the video. ”You can’t predict what it’s going to be like.”      While Atlas is still acclimating to the outside world, it’s good to see that it didn’t react to the being outside for the first as other robots have this year.

Atlas is an “agile, anthropomorphic robot” (who apparently is also fond of alliteration). Atlas was created by Boston Dynamics, the Google-owned robotics company also famous for its speedy robotic cheetah and its swimming, snow-climbing BigDog. And recently, Atlas went for its first-ever walk in the woods.      The impressive — and perhaps mildly alarming — footage of Atlas staggering around like the less-coordinated cousin of a Transformers character has been making the rounds online after it was shown at the Fab Lab 11 conference and symposium in Cambridge, Mass., earlier this month.      It was the first time the company had shared video of one of its humanoid robots on an outdoor excursion. (Though its quadrupeds have been frequently filmed running in the wild.)      But Atlas wasn’t simply gripped by a Thoreauvian yen to experience nature. According to Boston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert, the hike was an opportunity to test the robot’s balance and ability to respond to an unpredictable environment.      “Out in the world is just a totally different challenge than in the lab,” he said at the conference.      According to the Boston Globe, much of the company’s research is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is trying to develop robots that can perform tasks in military and disaster-related situations that would be unsafe for humans. And the company originally began as a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, according to its Web site.      Atlas still isn’t quite ready to venture out on its own — in the video shown at Fab 11, the robot remained tethered to a power source as it tramped around the woods.      “I’m not saying it can do everything you can do,” Raibert said, “but you can imagine if we keep pushing we’ll get there.”      It’s not clear whether anyone has informed Atlas that the streets of America are not necessarily safe for wandering robots — look at the violence inflicted on the friendly hitchhiking Hitchbot in Philadelphia earlier this month.      Then again, Hitchbot was Canadian. And it had pool noodles for arms. And it looked like a character from a PBS kids show.

Based on the premise \\"So you did.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"You absolutely did not.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the premise \\"So you did,\\" we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"You absolutely did not\\" is true. To analyze this, we should evaluate the given premise, look into possible interpretations, and understand contradictions and logical fallacies. Firstly, let's examine the premise: \\"So you did.\\" This statement implies an affirmation, meaning that the subject (which is you) completed or achieved a particular action or task. The very structure of this statement suggests agreement with the idea that the action has taken place, whether it be an observation, a response, or even a confirmation. Possible interpretations of this premise could signify that: 1. The speaker is expressing a positive response, confirming that \\"you\\" indeed performed the task or action being discussed. 2. The speaker has found evidence implying that \\"you\\" did something or experienced something relevant to the conversation. 3. The speaker is using the phrase as an informal rhetorical device, implying that the truth or the conclusion of the matter is that \\"you\\" did it. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"You absolutely did not\\" contradicts the premise directly. This hypothesis is a negation of the action or task being associated with the subject. It emphasizes that the subject has not completed or achieved the action or task at all, and this assertion is regarded as definitive given the term \\"absolutely.\\" The contradiction in these statements can also be analyzed using formal logic. In formal logic, a contradiction occurs when two propositions cannot both be true at the same time. In this case: Premise: \\"So you did.\\" -> P Hypothesis: \\"You absolutely did not.\\" -> ¬P By stating that \\"you did\\" (P) and \\"you absolutely did not\\" (¬P), we have a contradiction, as both statements cannot be true simultaneously. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise provided. Additionally, assuming the hypothesis is true based on the initial premise is an example of the \\"appeal to contradiction\\" logical fallacy. In this fallacy, one assumes that because two statements are contradictory, one must be true, and the other must be false. However, without further information or context, we cannot determine the truthfulness of either statement independently. In conclusion, given the premise \\"So you did,\\" we cannot determine that the hypothesis \\"You absolutely did not\\" is true. The statements contradict each other, and drawing a conclusion based on this contradiction would involve committing logical fallacies. To establish the accuracy or validity of either claim, we would require additional information, clarification, or context to assess which statement is correct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Opponents warn the administration is set to be packed with tycoons who will do nothing to fulfil his promise of helping working-class Americans      The appetisers were young garlic soup with thyme and sautéed frogs’ legs, diver scallops with caramelized cauliflower and caper-raisin emulsion. Donald Trump ate a prime sirloin with citrus glazed carrots; Mitt Romney chose lamb chops with a mushroom bolognese sauce.      At Jean-Georges, a three-star Michelin restaurant in the Trump International Hotel in New York, it’s a rich man’s world, and one where the US president-elect feels at home. This has also been evident in his appointments so far, as the so-called “blue-collar billionaire” looks set to preside over the wealthiest administration in modern history.      Trump's conflicts of interest: a visual guide Read more      Trump, a former host of reality TV show The Apprentice, is surrounding himself with the 1%: billionaires and millionaires, investment bankers and venture capitalists, Wall Street insiders and family fortune heirs, many educated at elite schools. It is the most brazen embrace of big money since the 1980s era of Ronald Reagan, Tom Wolfe’s Masters of the Universe and Oliver Stone’s Gordon Gekko.      “It is a throwback to the ‘greed is good’ mentality,” said Marge Baker, executive vice-president of the liberal pressure group People For the American Way. “It’s also alarming that the president-elect said he believes what’s good for his business is good for America. That’s not how you want the leader of your country to be making decisions.”            Baker added: “When you’ve got Wall Street billionaires setting the agenda it’s not likely to benefit average Americans. Research shows that the wealthy have different priorities and policy priorities, for example on healthcare and the minimum wage.”      The Trump cabinet’s emphasis on tax cuts and deregulation is also likely to echo the Reagan era. Election rival Hillary Clinton warned during the campaign: “Trump is trickledown economics over and over again. I called it trumped-up trickledown economics.”      Igor Volsky, deputy director of a pro-Clinton thinktank, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, said: “The same trickledown policies we saw in the 80s [that] didn’t help ordinary Americans are going to be put forward again. If you look at large parts of the cabinet it does feel like going back in time.”      The very people who heard Trump’s blunt, populist message about unrigging the system would be the ones to suffer its betrayal, Volsky added. “He’s going to perpetuate a system that helps the very richest Americans at the cost of programmes that help middle and lower-income Americans.”            Andrew Mellon, one of the richest Americans of the early 20th century, served as treasury secretary in three administrations. George W Bush’s first cabinet was criticised for containing high rollers in 2001. But Trump has taken the mix of democracy and plutocracy to a whole new level.      The Politico website suggested the new president’s team could be worth 35bn – some have made political donations worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The median household income in the US is about 55,000.      Trump’s supporters have said they welcome the fact he is a businessman, not a politician beholden to special interests, and hope he will run America like an efficient corporation. But several members of the administration could face accusations of a conflict of interest – that they are forming policy with at least one eye on their own businesses, or those of their cronies.      Neil Sroka, spokesman for the liberal organisation Democracy for America, said: “You’ve got a group of entitled, out-of-touch billionaires who are going to be bossed around by a bigoted, out-of-touch billionaire. It is beyond credibility that they are going to be able to accurately reflect the needs of working-class citizens who rely on leaders in Washington to fight for them.”            The appointments were self-serving, Sroka added. “What this rogues’ gallery of billionaires that Trump is trotting shows is that he isn’t interested in protecting working people. He wants to curry favour with a millionaire and billionaire class that he’s always sought the approval of.      “This is a class that dines on lobster steak and caviar every night. They’re not figuring out how to put food on the table. They’re figuring out how to make a few more millions before they go home at night.”      Trump’s picks so far      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Betsy DeVos, Trump’s nominee for education secretary.

This collection of wealth is greater than that of the 43 million least wealthy American households combined—over one third of the 126 million households total in the US.      Affluence of this magnitude in a US presidential cabinet is unprecedented.      The household data on which we based our comparison is from the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances. Collected by the Federal Reserve, this survey is the most recent comprehensive data source on American wealth. The estimates were adjusted for inflation and an increase in the number of American households. It is possible that the wealth of low-income Americans has changed since 2013, but trends over the last several decades suggest a large change is unlikely.      It is worth noting that almost 13% of American households have zero or negative wealth because of debt, so we are adding together these households with those that have at least some wealth.      Even if we just compare the wealth of Trump’s cabinet to the median household, it is still an impressive concentration of riches. It would take about 120,000 households with the the United States median net worth of about 83,200 to match the wealth of just the four richest members of Trump’s cabinet—Betsy DeVos, Wilbur Ross Jr., Linda McMahon, and Rex Tillerson. ||||| \\"It matters that government as a whole is representative of America,\\" said Republican strategist Sara Fagen, former White House political director for George W. Bush. \\"I don't think this says something about him and his values.\\"      Raw numbers don't tell the whole story when it comes to diversity in government and who wields influence in an administration. While Obama put together the most diverse Cabinet ever, some women in his White House still felt marginalized. The concerns reached the president himself during his first year in office, leading him to hold a dinner with senior female advisers to discuss his administration's boys-club image.      Some of Trump's most powerful aides are women. Kellyanne Conway served as his third and final campaign manager and remains a senior adviser. Trump's daughter Ivanka consults on most major decisions and is expected to continue doing so once her father is in the White House.      Shortly after the election, Trump met with BET founder Robert Johnson, who suggested the White House create an office of minority and urban affairs. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and influential adviser, was in the meeting and told Johnson it was something the transition team was already considering.      \\"It ended with me telling him, 'I want to be helpful to you if I've got an open door to make my case that I think are in the best interests of African-Americans,' Johnson said. \\"Everyone nodded they were willing to listen.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"President-elect Donald Trump is set to preside over the wealthiest administration in modern history, including a cabinet with a combined wealth of over 9.5 billion. His selections so far for cabinet posts or other positions of power have been dominated by the richest 1%: billionaires, millionaires, investment bankers, venture capitalists, and Wall Street insiders, leading critics to highlight the disconnect between the administration and the working-class Americans Trump had promised to support.

Rotten floorboards in the sawmill Answer:","output":"Title: The Mill's Secret Genre: Mystery, Drama, Thriller Plot: Act I: The movie opens in a quaint rural town named Millwood, surrounded by dense woods and nestled near a rapid river. The primary source of income for the townspeople is the old sawmill, owned and operated by the local prominent farmer, Charles McIntyre, and his wife, Eliza McIntyre. Eliza had been a city girl and journalist who decided to start a new life in the countryside with her husband. Their love story is well-known and admired by the townspeople, but whispers of hidden secrets and discontent in their marriage have started to circulate. Charles, burdened by a familial predisposition to drinking, often disappears and indulges in alcohol. In contrast, Eliza remains compassionate and throws herself into her charity work and other activities to help the town prosper. Despite her husband's failings, Eliza is loved and respected by the community. Act II: One day, Eliza receives a letter from an anonymous source, hinting that the town's sawmill rests on a dark, untold secret. Intrigued, she decides to investigate and starts by researching the sawmill's history. Her journalistic instincts come alive, and she begins interviewing elderly townspeople to collect any relevant information. Through the interviews, Eliza discovers the town was founded on the booming lumber business but goes through cycles of enrichment and impoverishment. Legend has it that the sawmill is cursed, as a terrible tragedy occurs every few decades, leading to the closing of the sawmill for a time. Unsatisfied with the information and disbelieving of curses, Eliza decides to unravel the mysteries of the sawmill itself. One evening, while her husband is out, she sneaks into the sawmill to continue her investigations. As she explores the building, she comes across a hidden room with rotten floorboards. Carefully, she walks towards the room when suddenly, the floorboards give in, plunging her into the abyss below. Act III: The townspeople are shocked to discover Eliza's lifeless body the next morning. Charles, heartbroken and guilty, dedicates himself to finding out the truth about his wife's death. A bright and determined city detective, Sarah, is dispatched to Millwood to assist in the investigation. As Sarah and Charles follow Eliza's clues, they unearth long-forgotten documents that reveal a dark history surrounding the sawmill's construction. The sawmill, it turns out, was built on an ancient burial ground. The townspeople, desperate to attract wealth and prosperity, made a pact with a malicious spirit residing in the burial ground. Every few decades, a member of the community vanishes without a trace, and in return, the town prospers, and the sawmill continues to operate. The community tries to keep this truth hidden, stubbornly sticking to assumptions of a natural accidental death. Together, Sarah and Charles work through obstacles and threats from the shadowy town council, determined to expose the truth and break the town's deadly pact. In the climax, they perform a ritual involving Eliza's spirit to cleanse the curse and confront the malicious spirit. With Eliza's aid and the reluctant support of the townspeople, the curse is lifted, resulting in the closure of the sawmill. In the aftermath, the town of Millwood starts rebuilding its future, and its residents confront their morally fraught legacy. Meanwhile, Charles, finding solace in his journey to uncover the truth, opens up a small farm-to-table restaurant, including Eliza's name in its title, as a tribute to his late wife and their love. The movie closes with Charles and Sarah sharing a quiet moment, reminiscing about Eliza's courage and intelligence, as the town begins to forge a new, more honest chapter in its history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – More controversy for the NFL: Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice got into a fight with fiancee Janay Palmer at an Atlantic City casino early Saturday and knocked her out cold, ESPN reports by way of a court summons. A video posted to TMZ yesterday shows Rice dragging an apparently unconscious Palmer from an elevator, then laying her on the ground as he attempts to clear her legs from the elevator doors, in a scene said to have occurred after the fight. Rice's lawyer notes that though the video is authentic, it \\"is not the complete event, but is merely the end result of what transpired.\\" Both Rice and Palmer \\"struck each other with their hands\\" and were arrested for simple assault, police say. The pair then \\"returned home together after being detained,\\" the Baltimore Ravens told USA Today. The NFL will review the incident under its personal conduct policy, and commissioner Roger Goodell has \\"wide discretion\\" regarding punishment, the Baltimore Sun reports. It notes Goodell suspended Ben Roethlisberger for six games—later reduced to four—after he was investigated for sexual assault, though he was never charged. Rice is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. Article:","output":"Once upon a time, there was a big strong football player named Ray Rice, who played for the Baltimore Ravens team in the NFL. He got into big trouble one weekend when he got into a fight with his fiancée, Janay Palmer. The fight happened at a big building called a casino, and Ray ended up knocking Janay out cold.  People from a place called ESPN found out about the fight because it was written in a paper called a court summons. There was also a video, kind of like a movie, that showed people what happened. In the video, Ray was dragging Janay, who looked like she was sleeping, out of a small room called an elevator. It was a pretty scary scene that happened after their fight. Ray's lawyer, the person who helps him in court, said that the video did show the real thing, but it didn't show everything that happened. The police, who are like superheroes that keep people safe, said that both Ray and Janay hit each other with their hands, which is not a very nice thing to do. They both had to face the consequences and got arrested for something called simple assault. However, they went back home together after spending some time being detained, which means they were kept by the police for a little while. The big bosses of the NFL are going to look at what happened and make some decisions about what should happen to Ray. The NFL has a big, important person named Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has a lot of power to decide what sort of punishment is right. He has had to do this before when another football player named Ben Roethlisberger got into trouble. Now, Ray Rice has to go to a place called court on Tuesday, where he will find out if he will get into more trouble for his actions.

Step 1: Understand the given information In the background information, we learn that as water cools, its molecular motion slows down. This means that colder water has slower-moving molecules, while warmer water has faster-moving molecules. Step 2: Analyze the new situation In the new situation, we have two cups of water with different temperatures. Kim's water is room temperature and she wishes it was cooler, while Janet's water is so cold that it hurts her teeth and she wishes it was warmer. Step 3: Compare the molecular speeds Since Kim's water is at room temperature, which is warmer than Janet's very cold water, the molecules in Kim's water will be moving faster than those in Janet's water. This is because the molecular motion in warmer water is faster than that in colder water, as stated in the background information."},{"instruction":"Answer the question based on the following text.

Parker Barnes (Washington) and another officer, Donavan, step off of a subway car. Their surroundings appear to be glitching as they run down a crowded city street. Donavan is not sure of where he is going, but Parker runs confidently into a Japanese structure. Donavan asks what they are looking for, and Barnes replies that they will know when they find a man with eyes like his own. They see a man (Crowe) sitting behind a screen, and they begin firing upon him. He jumps out of the way and grabs a gun of his own to return the fire. The foe snidely knocks out his partner and promises to return for Barnes. Barnes searches for him inside the building, but the man is able to surprise him and injures his arm.

Disney theme parks make up four of the world’s top 20 tourist attractions, according to new research. Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park in California and Tokyo DisneySea registered a total of more than 66 million visitors last year. The destinations are among 15 theme parks included in a list of the world’s top 50 tourist attractions compiled by tourism website Travel + Leisure. The most popular tourist destination across the globe last year was Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, which recorded 91.25m visitors in 2013. The most popular destination across the globe was Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, which recorded 91.25m visitors in 2013. The 15th century market is famous for its hand-painted ceramics, lanterns, intricately patterned carpets, and Byzantine-style jewelry. Mexico City’s The Zócalo - the ceremonial Atzec plaza - came in second place with 85 million visitors, while New York’s Times Square was third in the list with 50 million. The Zocalo hosts military parades, cultural and political events, concerts, exhibitions, fairs, and public art installations, while Times Square is known for it lively entertainment, Broadway shows and many shops. Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida recorded 18.6 million visitors last year making it the 12th most visited tourist attraction in the world. Other attractions that made up the top ten were New York's Central Park, and Union Station in Washington D.C. which both attracted 40m visitors. The Las Vegas Strip came in sixth position followed by Tokyo's Meiji Jingu Shrine and Sensoji Temple. Niagara Falls was in ninth place while New York City's Grand Central Terminal was in tenth position with 21.6m visitors. There was no place on the list for any British attractions, and the least visited place in the top 50 most popular tourist destinations was the Taj Mahal, which still recorded between seven and eight million tourists. It means the British Museum in London (6.7 million), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (6.3 million), and the Roman Colosseum (5.1 million) narrowly missed the cut. Nevada's Las Vegas Strip attracted 30.5m annual visitors in 2013, making it the sixth most popular destination. The figures were compiled from data supplied by government agencies and industry reports including the Global Attractions Attendance Report. The attractions themselves also supplied their own data when ticket sales weren’t available. Travel + Leisure defined tourist attractions as ‘cultural and historical sites, natural landmarks, and officially designated spaces’. It meant that while destinations such as the Las Vegas Strip made the list, popular spots such as malls and shopping centres were not included, despite often attracting tens of millions of visitors each year. Beaches and religious sites were also omitted. Niagara Falls in New York and Ontario registered 22m visitors, placing it ninth in the top 50 tourist attractions. Bourbon Street in New Orleans was 45th in the list of the world's top 50 destinations with 7,470,000 visitors. The publication of the list comes shortly after the World Tourist Organisation published their annual report earlier this year detailing the state of global tourism. It revealed there was a five percent growth in international tourism in 2013, which amounted to an additional 52 million tourists and which brought the total up to 1.087 billion. The growth defied predictions that the global economic downturn would slow tourism. Regions that showed the biggest growth in international tourism in 2013 were Asia, Africa and Europe. Of these areas, Southeast Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and North Africa were the most popular places to visit. The Taj Mahal in India recorded between seven and eight million visitors in 2013 putting it in 50th position. The Great Wall of China had 10.7m visitors in 2013, making the historic attraction the 26th most popular site. The Palace of Versailles, in France just made it onto the list with 7,527,122 tourists visiting the site last year. The Forbidden City in Beijing attracted an astonishing 15,340,000 in 2013, making it the 16th most popular tourist attraction in the world last year. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee had 9,345,695 in 2013. Europe currently remains the most visited region in the world, welcoming an extra 29 million visitors last year to attract a total of 563 million tourists – 52 percent of the entire tourist market. Northern, Southern and Central America saw an increase of six million visitors to reach a total of 169 million. Africa attracted three million more arrivals than 2012, reaching a new record of 56 million. Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mexico City, recorded 20 million tourists in 2013, putting it in 11th place. The list of top 50 travel destinations also revealed that South Korean theme parks Everland and Lotte World were among the most visited attractions, beating the Eiffel Tower with nearly seven million, the Great Pyramids with nearly four million and Stonehenge with one million. Travel + Leisure noted that accessibility can be a factor in determining how many visitors visit a particular attraction, adding that it takes extra effort to reach destination’s such as Yellowstone National Park, which recorded 3.2 million visitors, the Terracotta Army in Xi'an, China, which had 4.8 million, and Peru’s Machu Picchu, which has restricted tourism to 2,500 entries per day, or 912,500 per year. 1 Grand Bazaar, Istanbul.

The crash happened after a mother-of-three stopped her car on a level crossing north of the city. She was killed in the subsequent inferno along with five train passengers. Accident investigators also said there were no problems with the signals or barrier at the site of the collision. But they remain unaware why the driver, 49-year-old Ellen Brody, became stranded on the crossing at Valhalla, about 20 miles (32km) north of New York City. An official from the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency leading the probe, said on Thursday that a witness in a nearby car had seen Ms Brody stop on the crossing in the moments before the train approached. Investigator Robert Sumwalt said that the barrier was seen to come down on the rear of the car, a Jeep Cherokee, at which point Ms Brody got out and appeared to inspect the damage. He said that, according to both the witness and the train driver, after returning to the car she suddenly drove forward slightly - straight into the path of the oncoming train. Data retrieved from the train's recording device suggested it was travelling at 58mph (92km/h) an hour, added Mr Sumwalt - just below the 60mph speed limit for that section of track. In addition to the six deaths there were 15 injuries, seven of them serious. The electrified third rail of the track came through the front carriage of the train after the crash, setting it on fire. Passengers had to escape from the rear carriages. The line on which the accident happened, Metro-North, is the second-busiest rail system in the US, serving about 280,000 passengers a day in New York and Connecticut. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board issued rulings on five accidents that occurred on the network in 2013 and 2014, criticising Metro-North while also finding conditions had improved.

A disabled Iraqi war veteran is suing a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in the Bronx for refusing him service when he brought in his service dog. 50-year-old Charles Hernandez says he entered the location on Fordham Road and Jerome Avenue on February 26 to buy a two-piece chicken meal with fries in order to take some prescribed medication. But he was refused service when the employees behind the counter saw that he was accompanied by his service dog, Valor. Turned away: Charles Hernandez (second left) and his dog Valor (black) meet Senator Chuck Schumer (center). Hernandez filed a lawsuit yesterday against a KFC in the Bronx for refusing him and Valor service. 'Papi, there are no dogs allowed,' Hernandez recalls an employee saying. Hernandez tried to explain that Valor is a service dog and according to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Valor is allowed to accompany him anywhere. 'OK, but you still cannot have the dog in the store,' the employee responded. Hernandez even says that the store's manager, Sade Clark, saw the 'discrimination' happening and did nothing about it. 'I was frustrated, angry and more, depressed,' Hernandez told the New York Post. 'No one was helping. Rather than understanding the needs of a person, they shut me out.' So Hernandez is now suing the employee, Clark, the restaurant's owner and the company's principal owner for 1million. Sued: This KFC in the Bronx was slapped with a 1million lawsuit yesterday for refusing Hernandez and his dog Valor service last February. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, Hernandez alleges that the KFC worker broke federal, state and city laws and caused him distress. Hernandez won a similar case in 2011 after being cursed out by a McDonald's store manager in Times Square for entering with his service dog. 'It's unfortunate that when disabled veterans return from war...they are confronted with ignorance and discrimination,' Hernandez's lawyer David Lackowitz told the New York Daily News. Hernandez was deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2006 and sustained multiple injuries to his shoulder and his back. A spinal chord injury led to his early retirement. Hernandez also worked at Ground Zero for three months after the September 11th attacks and was named 'City Council Veteran of the Year' in 2011. In 2010 he was given Valor to held him with balance and prevent his panic attacks. Write highlights for this article.","output":"A disabled man named Charles Hernandez, who is a war veteran, went to a KFC restaurant with his service dog, Valor. The employees at the KFC did not let him buy a chicken meal because of his dog. Charles told them that Valor is a special dog who helps him, but they still did not let him eat there. Charles is now asking for 1 million because he is very upset.

Iwasaki's careful respect for the Long Beach program and its lawyers earned him the political capital he needed to complete his takeover in a matter of weeks. \\"The Long Beach program had strong support in the community so in a situation like that, one has to recognize that it's not like a takeover where I have all the answers and I know best,\\" Iwasaki said. \\"The people in the community who are working there have the contacts and the knowledge that will allow service to continue.\\" Things have gone less smoothly across town. There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes. Personalities got involved when they shouldn't have. Things were said that caused bad feelings and couldn't be unsaid.\\" Iwasaki's merger with the smaller, 48-year-old Long Beach program was friendly and fast, and no one - not even Long Beach board members - lost a job. When it was over, Iwasaki had 1 million more in federal dollars and two new offices. Long Beach clients regained services they had lost years ago when federal budget cuts and dwindling grants reduced the staff of 15 lawyers to five and cut immigration and consumer law programs.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?

If less rain reaches the surface water, it will result in decreased levels of acidic water. As a consequence, there will be less damage to aquatic life such as fish and to the soil and leaves of trees.

Article: As a teacher, my daily life includes driving to a new school so I'm usually unable to anticipate   the day's events, good or bad! One day, I was teaching in a very difficult classroom. I was managing behavior all morning and by lunch time, I knew I needed coffee to even consider surviving the afternoon. So on my lunch break, I drove to a coffee shop nearby to get a cup of coffee. While returning to the car I realized I had locked my keys and my phone inside! I had about 15 minutes to get back to the school which was a good 4- or 5- minute drive away. I considered rushing back, but it being winter, I thought a fall on ice would only make the situation much worse. So I ran into a McDonald's and asked the man at the counter   who happened to be the manager to please call me a taxi. I explained my situation to him, and I could tell by the look in his eyes, that he took pity. He hurried to the back to use the phone while I walked in the restaurant. I had less than 10 minutes to get back to my school at this point. The manager returned only to tell me that the taxi company had put him on hold and then the line got disconnected, and that he was now on hold again, but had not yet been able to ask for the taxi yet. Without a thought, he caught his coat and offered to drive me to the school. Immediately I followed him into his car and made it back into my classroom with 2 minutes left before the bell! While arriving at the school, I thanked this man endlessly. His calm behavior and kind nature made me think he was probably a wonderful manager to work for, and also a wonderful human being to have on his earth. This experience makes me realize that out of every hopeless situation, there is the chance for acts of kindness to happen, which can create an unimaginable impression to those who receive them. Question: The writer   _   so he gave up the idea of going back to school on foot when he found his keys and phone were locked inside the car.

Jotkut muut ovat pitäneet kiinni surkeasta ja epäonnistumaan tuomitusta politiikasta, jonka mukaan konfliktin aiheuttaja rahoittaa sotajoukoista aiheutuvat kustannukset. Translate to English","output":"Some others have clung to a miserable and doomed policy whereby the initiator of the conflict finances the costs resulting from the military forces. In this scenario, certain individuals or groups insist on maintaining a policy that has been proven to be ineffective and prone to failure. This policy dictates that the party responsible for instigating a conflict should cover the expenses arising from the deployment of military forces and the subsequent consequences of military action. This strategy is considered miserable due to its inherent flaws, as it may encourage instigators of conflict to take advantage of the fact that they can initiate a dispute with little to no financial repercussions, allowing them to exploit this policy for their gain. Additionally, it places the burden of financial responsibility on the perpetrators, which is an immense challenge and could eventually lead a nation towards economic decline. Moreover, the policy is doomed from the outset because it doesn't take into account the complex nature of international conflicts and the potential for a wide array of unforeseen consequences. It oversimplifies matters and ignores the many variables involved in political and military disputes which may, in turn, lead to further escalation and animosity between opposing parties. There are a few potential reasons why some people still cling to such a policy. First, they may be unaware of the historic failures and long-term effects of this strategy, and thus continue to advocate for the same flawed approach. Alternatively, they might believe that the approach is advantageous for their country or political stance. Another reason could be that they are unwilling to explore alternative, more humane, and fair ways of settling conflicts, such as diplomatic negotiations or international court proceedings. They may fear that these alternatives would not yield the desired outcomes or serve their interests entirely. Lastly, they could be influenced by a broader sense of nationalism or loyalty to their nation, which may cloud their judgment and lead them to support such policies. This could occur even in the face of evidence that demonstrates the inefficiency of the approach, as it often becomes tied to a sense of national pride and identity. In conclusion, the policy of having conflict initiators finance the costs resulting from military forces is a bleak and ill-fated strategy that has proven to be both detrimental and fruitless in the long run. While some individuals or groups may still cling to this approach due to various reasons such as ignorance, fear of alternative means, or even nationalistic loyalty, it is crucial for the international community to recognize the dangers and inefficiencies tied to this policy and strive to seek more constructive and effective ways of resolving conflicts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite \\"in the near future\\". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations. A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew.

The original batch of pilots all had a DIY, goofy, occasionally experimental vibe, excepting Garry Trudeau’s congressmen comedy Alpha House, which alone looked like a show that could air on a old-fashioned, broadcast-to-a-television network. (It was one of the shows Amazon picked up). Last week, Amazon unveiled five new pilots, and it’s clear they have learned an important lesson about original content in the interim, one Netflix has long since grasped: If you want to make a splash as a fledgling provider of must-see TV, make something that could be on HBO. Call it the House of Cards precept: Your brand may be all about originality, binge-watching, and fresh business models, but that only works if you give the people a show that looks like one they already happily pay for. Amazon has finally made one of those.      Amazon’s new pilots are more professional and slick than the cute, homemade series it previously commissioned. The two dramas, Bosch, about a tortured LA cop named Hieronymus Bosch—yes, the show lays it on that thick—and The After, a post-apocalyptic drama from The X-Files’ Chris Carter that stars a French actress wholly unequipped to act in English, are both mediocre versions of network series, with additional cursing. They aren’t any good, but it’s easy to imagine some version of them airing in the summer on NBC. One of the comedies, The Rebels—if Major League were about a Los Angeles football team—is only better because it’s shorter. Mozart in the Jungle, created by Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman, and Alex Timbers and set in the world of New York classical musicians, is sweet and charming if a little unformed. It does, at least, feature Gael García Bernal as Rodrigo, a swashbuckling conductor with cockatoo hair, alongside television’s very first female oboist as a protagonist.      Advertisement            But towering above all of these shows is Jill Soloway’s Transparent, an honest to goodness great pilot that feels—and I mean this as a compliment—exactly like one of those HBO shows with a 1-to-1 ratio of viewers to think pieces. Ostensibly a half-hour comedy, Transparent is very much like Louie and Girls in its relationship to humor, which is conditional. It stars Gaby Hoffmann, Jay Duplass, and Amy Landecker as three grown, Los Angelino siblings and Jeffrey Tambor and Judith Light as their divorced parents—a cast that makes for as good company as it sounds like it should.      The show’s title is a pun, but Soloway, who was a big part of Six Feet Under, is interested in transparency as more than a play on words. Tambor’s character tells Hoffman’s, “It’s so hard when someone sees something you do not want them to see,” and she shrugs him off, preferring to pretend she’s better at camouflaging her unhappiness than she actually is. Everyone in the family is hiding feelings they only think they are hiding, particularly about sex, desire, and gender, which, needless to say, are the most enticing kind of hang-ups. |||||","output":"\\"Transparent\\" is a unique TV show about people who live very emotional and wonderful lives.

I don't remember much protest when Brian Mulroney - together with Ronald Reagan - pushed Canada right wing down into the US orbit during the 1980's, into the 90's.

Waiting four years, eight years, or 10 years to vote for another party is much too little much too late.

Answer a question about this article: Impermanence (Pāli: anicca) expresses the Buddhist notion that all compounded or conditioned phenomena (all things and experiences) are inconstant, unsteady, and impermanent. Everything we can experience through our senses is made up of parts, and its existence is dependent on external conditions. Everything is in constant flux, and so conditions and the thing itself are constantly changing. Things are constantly coming into being, and ceasing to be. Since nothing lasts, there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience. According to the doctrine of impermanence, life embodies this flux in the aging process, the cycle of rebirth (saṃsāra), and in any experience of loss. The doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent, attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering (dukkha). What is the meaning of impermanence in Buddhism?","output":"In Buddhism, the meaning of impermanence (Pāli: anicca) refers to the concept that all compounded or conditioned phenomena, including things and experiences, are inconstant, unsteady, and impermanent. This notion is based on the observation that everything experienced through our senses is made up of parts and relies on external conditions for its existence. As these conditions and the things themselves continuously change, nothing has a fixed or inherent nature. Impermanence is a fundamental concept in Buddhism and is closely linked to life's aging process, the cycle of rebirth (saṃsāra), and any experience of loss. The doctrine of impermanence teaches that attachment to impermanent things or experiences is pointless and leads to suffering (dukkha)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And seven days ago his father's fishing boat hadn't gone home in time. \\"I'll bring you a small sheep dog from the Shetland Isles,\\" Colin's father told him the morning he left. But now it was Christmas Eve. Colin looked toward the lighthouse, high on the hill. For seven days, there had been no light to guide his father's ship.  Colin pushed open the door of his cottage. \\"We'll need more peat   for the fire, Colin,\\" said his mother as he entered. \\"It has burned itself out.

Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret illustrates a scene from book III of The Faerie Queene, a 16th-century allegorical epic poem by Edmund Spenser, in which Busirane, an evil sorcerer, abducts the beautiful Amoret (representing married virtue), and tortures her to the point of death. The heroic female warrior Britomart (representing both chastity and Elizabeth I) battles through obstacles to reach the chamber in which Amoret is being held, and slays Busirane moments before he is able to kill Amoret.Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was intended by Etty to illustrate the virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart as he prepares to kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she swings her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.In the original poem, Busirane had tortured and cut out the heart of the still-living Amoret by the time of her rescue. When he came to paint Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret Etty had created numerous scenes of combat and death, and would later achieve a degree of critical approbation when it became known that he visited mortuaries to sketch cadavers to ensure the accuracy of his depictions of bodies in varying stages of decomposition. However, he had an aversion to \\"the offensive and revolting butchery, some have delighted and even revelled in\\", and disliked the depiction of gratuitous violence.

The painful process often leads to a slow and agonizing death for the bear. The rescue marks the first time a large number of bears was relinquished on conscience. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Brave Bears Rescued from Unkind Farm in Vietnam Once upon a time, in far-off Vietnam, there were 14 moon bears who needed help. Moon bears are big, lovely bears with shiny black fur and a white patch on their chest that looks like a crescent moon. They love to frolic around, climb trees and munch on tasty fruits. But they were not living the happy, playful life a bear should live - they were living in a very unkind place called a bear bile farm. This place wasn't really a farm with open fields and happy animals. Instead, it was a sad, scary place where naughty people were hurting the bears to get something called bile. Bile is a liquid in the bear's tummy that helps them digest their food. Some people believe bear bile has special magic to cure sickness, even though it's not really true.  To get this bile, the bad people were doing something very painful to the bears. This wasn't fair or nice and often made the bears very sick. Some poor bears even died from this terrible treatment, which is very, very sad.  But guess what, kiddos? Our story takes a happy turn! One beautiful day, some brave helpers came and rescued all 14 bears from this mean farm. These helpers stopped the bad people from hurting the bears, and took the bears to a safer, kinder place where they can now live happily, playfully, just as all bears should.  What's so extra special about this rescue? Well, this is the first time lots of bears were saved just because people felt it was the right thing to do. Some of the bad people realized how wrong they were, how much they were hurting the innocent bears, and willingly let the bears go to be happy and safe. It's like they finally listened to their heart that knew being good is better than being bad. From now on, these 14 moon bears will be free to do all the fun things they love - like munching on fruits, climbing trees, and of course, taking long naps under the big, shiny moon. Their rescue is a big reminder to all people to be kind to animals, to love them, and not hurt them in any way. After all, like us, animals too want to live happily and peacefully.

Question: \\"What may be described as \\"\\"a leguminous plant bearing pods that ripen underground, and contain seeds used for food and oil\\"\\"?\\" Answer:","output":"The plant that may be described as \\"a leguminous plant bearing pods that ripen underground, and contain seeds used for food and oil\\" is the peanut, also known scientifically as Arachis hypogaea. The peanut is a fascinating plant, as it has several unique characteristics that truly set it apart from other leguminous plants and makes it an important agricultural crop worldwide. Peanuts belong to the family Fabaceae, which is a large family of flowering plants, commonly referred to as the legume, pea, or bean family. This family includes a wide variety of plants such as soybeans, chickpeas, lentils, and alfalfa, among others. However, unlike most other legumes that develop their seeds above ground, the peanut plant is unique in developing and maturing its pods underground, which is a process known as geocarpy. The peanut plant's growth starts when seeds are planted in well-drained, warm, and fertile soil. It germinates and emerges above the ground, initially appearing as a small seedling. The peanut plant grows to be approximately 1 to 1.5 feet tall and produces yellow, self-pollinating flowers. After pollination, the fertilized ovary begins to elongate and forms a specialized structure known as the \\"peg.\\" The peg continues to grow downward and is eventually pushed into the ground by the weight of the developing pod. It is in this soil-embedded state that the pod ripens and forms peanut seeds. The peanut seeds, often referred to as nuts due to their characteristics and culinary use, are rich in protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. Peanuts are a popular ingredient in various culinary dishes and snacks worldwide. They can be consumed raw, roasted, boiled, or made into spreads like peanut butter. Due to their high oil content (approximately 45–55%), peanuts are also used to produce edible oils, such as groundnut oil or peanut oil. Peanut oil is widely used in cooking and food manufacturing due to its flavor profile, stability, and high smoke point. It is considered a healthy oil option and a source of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are beneficial fats crucial for a balanced diet. Furthermore, peanuts play a significant role in animal feed and are used in the production of cosmetics, detergents, and biofuel. Overall, the peanut is an essential leguminous plant with immense agricultural, nutritional, and economic value, owing to its unique growth process and the versatile uses of its seeds and oil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: \\" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.\\" Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea.

Yoga pants maker Lululemon reports annual sales of more than 2bn There’s a lot of money in yoga pants – even ones that not too long ago were found to be a little too revealing. Lululemon, the upmarket “athleisure” brand favoured by celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Cameron Diaz, on Wednesday reported annual sales of more than 2bn (£1.4bn). The surge in sales, up from 1.8bn the previous year, and the company’s prediction that sales could double to 4bn by 2020 sent Lululemon’s shares soaring on Wall Street. Lululemon shares, which had already increased by 16% so far this year, rose by 10.4% on Wednesday to 67.70 by lunchtime, valuing the 18-year-old Canadian company at 9.5bn. The financial success comes just two years after the company was plunged into crisis by an “unacceptable level of sheerness” in some of its up-to-98 black Luon pants, which led some yogis to display a little more than they intended while working out in their ashrams. In the wake of the see-through debacle, Lululemon withdrew 17% of its stock and its chief product officer, Sheree Waterson, resigned. However, Chip Wilson, Lululemon founder and Canada’s 17th richest person with a 2.3bn fortune, went on to blame women’s bodies for causing the problem. “Quite frankly, some women’s bodies just actually don’t work for [the pants],” Wilson told Bloomberg. “It’s really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there.” Now that women are once again happy doing a downward dogs in its pants, Lululemon is going after men with a target of 1bn in menswear sales by 2020. “The unification of men’s and women’s under one vision is really strengthening the brand, so when you think about selling global stories of functional materials and construction, we now have a platform that really is much larger than it was before,” Laurent Potdevin, Lululemon’s chief executive, said.

Steele In Their Spines In the summer of 2006, as Republican fortunes dimmed, one of the party's star Senate candidates sat down with reporters for an off-the-record lunch. Dana Milbank of The Washington Post recorded the unusually frank conversation for posterity. Far from towing the party line, the candidate blasted the Bush White House for its failures in Iraq and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. When asked if he'd want President Bush to campaign with him, the mystery man said, \\"To be honest with you, probably not.\\" As for the Congressional GOP, the candidate was harsher still. The party's most profound failure was, in his view, a failure to recognize where it had gone wrong. The candidate, we later learned, was Michael Steele, the then lieutenant governor of Maryland who eventually lost to veteran Congressman Ben Cardin in an overwhelmingly Democratic year. Milbank highlighted Steele's most striking remark from that lunch: The candidate called his Republican \\"R\\" a \\"scarlet letter.\\" Now, as the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, Steele has taken responsibility for rebuilding the Republican brand, which now stands in opposition to a popular president who is rolling up his shirtsleeves to fight the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Hailing from the heavily black middle-class suburbs of Washington, D.C., Steele is used to winning over hostile audiences. Though he lost to Cardin by a significant margin, Steele ran a shrewd campaign that was tailor-made to his state. On issues like public transportation and education, he reached out to voters who'd normally never give Republicans a hearing. On Iraq, the central issue in the campaign, he opposed withdrawal while calling for a serious rethink of U.S. strategy in the region. He came across as a results-oriented pragmatist without compromising his social conservatism, an approach that has also worked for much-lauded Republican governors like Mitch Daniels of Indiana and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. And as an African-American from a solidly Democratic state, he presented a marked contrast to the other candidates for RNC chair. Two of his most formidable opponents, Chip Saltsman and Katon Dawson, were southern conservatives who came across as racially tone-deaf if not worse. Saltsman, who helped lead Mike Huckabee's innovative campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and who served as Bill Frist's right-hand man, will forever be remembered for having included a song titled \\"Barack the Magic Negro\\" on a CD for members of the RNC. Dawson hastily resigned from an all-white South Carolina country club before entering the race for RNC chair. Whatever the intentions of either candidate, a victory for Saltsman or Dawson would have been a black eye for the party--an indication that the GOP's Big Tent was now a Pup Tent. Of course, Michael Steele can't transform the Republican party single-handedly. Fortunately, there are early indications that Republicans--even Congressional Republicans--are learning from their mistakes, and far sooner than beleaguered conservatives had any right to expect. House Minority Leader John Boehner, a man with all the charisma of a washed-up lounge singer, has emerged overnight as a conservative folk hero for uniting his party against President Obama's stimulus package. As David Brooks has ably described, the stimulus package represents an awkward marriage of long-term Democratic objectives, like pouring more money into higher education and green energy and big-ticket infrastructure projects, and short-term measures that governments at all levels will have an extremely difficult time absorbing. Many of these long-term objectives are very worthy ones that Republicans should embrace as well, particularly efforts to upgrade our physical infrastructure. Yet the speed with which this measure has been pursued means that spending discipline has gone out the window. State governments that receive billions of dollars will have no way to evaluate the efficacy of spending, and so we will find, two or three years hence, that vast sums were wasted, and indeed that vast sums fell into the wrong hands. Not only have Republicans opposed this ill-conceived free-for-all--they've actually floated a number of more attractive alternatives, including a steep payroll tax cut, a sharp increase in the child tax credit, and offering state governments loans instead of grants. The first would represent an immediate economic boon to all American workers and businesses, the second would benefit hard-hit families, and the third would force state governments to spend responsibly rather than shovel money out the door. If Republicans keep moving in this direction, by backing similarly smart policies on fighting climate change and rising health care costs, President Obama and Congressional Democrats will have a real fight on their hands.

The co-author of Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream, he writes a weekly column for Forbes.com. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses Michael Steele's ascension to the Republican National Committee's chairman position in 2006.

Article: PolitiFact conceded GOP's plan would end      Medicare's role in covering health care,      but still accused Democrats of lying.            Via Steve Benen, PolitiFact is hopping mad at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for its new ad calling out Republicans for voting to end Medicare, giving it the \\"dreaded\\" pants-on-fire designation.      Specifically, PolitiFact says it's unfair to accuse Republicans of ending Medicare because their vote was merely an expression of a policy preference:      The Republicans voted on a budget resolution that states policy preferences, but the vote did not actually change Medicare, much less end it.      Uh, okay. Except the ad didn't accuse Republicans of actually accomplishing their goal of ending Medicare. It accused them of \\"voting to end Medicare.\\" In other words, it accused them of stating a policy preference.      In addition, PolitiFact is ticked off that the ad claims the Republican plan would require seniors to pay 12,500 for health care coverage.      That number is based on statistics compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The ad doesn’t mention, though, that the number includes money that would go to Medicare in any case. The CBO estimates beneficiaries would contribute about 6,150 in premiums in 2022 if the program isn’t changed at all. So the extra money seniors need to pay under the Republican proposal is more like 6,350.      So...PolitiFact agrees that the CBO estimated seniors would pay 12,500 under the GOP plan, as the ad asserted. They just think the ad should have gone the extra mile and explained that the report estimates seniors would only be paying 6,350 more than they would have otherwise. But the ad didn't say seniors would have to pay 12,500 more. It said they would have to pay 12,500 total, which is completely accurate.      And finally, PolitiFact thinks it's unfair to describe the GOP proposal as being designed to \\"end Medicare.\\" But quoting from their own analysis:      The Republican proposal will end the aspect of Medicare that directly covers specific services, such as hospital coverage. ... Democrats, including Obama, have said the plan would end Medicare \\"as we know it,\\" a critical qualifier. But the 30-second ad from the DCCC makes a sweeping claim without that important qualifier .      I'm tempted to just leave it there, with no further explanation, but I can't resist.      PolitiFact appears to be resting its entire case on a severe case of parsing and the fact that the GOP proposal wouldn't change Medicare's name. Still, even PolitiFact acknowledges that the GOP plan would fundamentally change what Medicare does, replacing it with subsidized private insurance administered by the Office of Personnel Management, a completely different agency than currently runs Medicare.      According to their logic, if the FBI were replaced with a voucher program wherein citizens would receive subsidies for hiring private investigators to look into criminal activity, but the agency running the voucher program were still called the FBI, it would be unfair to say that the FBI had been ended. I guess it's their right to make that argument, but it's transparently absurd.      To recap PolitiFact's case:      Ending the essential services of Medicare and replacing them with subsidies administered by an entirely different agency is not the same as ending Medicare. Yes, it's true that CBO said the GOP plan would mean seniors would pay 12,500 in health care costs, but only 6,350 of that was incremental, and even though Democrats correctly stated the CBO's estimate, and even though seniors would have to pay the full amount of that estimate, they should have only focused on the incremental cost. It would be unfair to say the GOP actually ended Medicare because they merely voted to end it. Of course, that's what the ad says.      All I can say to that is, I hope the GOP defends itself using PolitiFact's line of argument. It would be an electoral bonanza for Democrats. ||||| By Steve Benen      The fact-checking website PolitiFact has announced its “Lie of the Year” for 2011. It made a poor, credibility-killing choice.      Republicans muscled a budget through the House of Representatives in April that they said would take an important step toward reducing the federal deficit. Introduced by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the plan kept Medicare intact for people 55 or older, but dramatically changed the program for everyone else by privatizing it and providing government subsidies. Democrats pounced. Just four days after the party-line vote, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a Web ad that said seniors will have to pay 12,500 more for health care “because Republicans voted to end Medicare.” […] PolitiFact debunked the Medicare charge in nine separate fact-checks rated False or Pants on Fire, most often in attacks leveled against Republican House members. Now, PolitiFact has chosen the Democrats’ claim as the 2011 Lie of the Year.      This is simply indefensible. Claims that are factually true shouldn’t be eligible for a Lie of the Year designation.      It’s unnerving that we have to explain this again, but since PolitiFact appears to be struggling with the relevant details, let’s set the record straight.      Medicare is a single-payer health care system offering guaranteed benefits to seniors. The House Republican budget plan intended to privatize the existing system and replace it with something very different — a voucher scheme. It would still be called “Medicare,” but it wouldn’t be Medicare.      It seems foolish to have to parse the meaning of the word “end,” but if there’s a program, and it’s replaced with a different program, proponents brought an end to the original program. That’s what the verb means.      I’ve been trying to think of the best analogy for this. How about this one: imagine someone owns a Ferrari. It’s expensive and drives beautifully, and the owner desperately wants to keep his car intact. Now imagine I took the car away, removed the metallic badge off the trunk that says “Ferrari,” I stuck it on a golf cart, and I handed the owner the keys.      “Where’s my Ferrari?” the owner would ask.      “It’s right here,” I’d respond. “This has four wheels, a steering wheel, and pedals, and it says ‘Ferrari’ right there on the back.”      By PolitiFact’s reasoning, I haven’t actually replaced the car — and if you disagree, you’re a pants-on-fire liar.      Indeed, reading through PolitiFact’s defense of its dubious honor, the explanation is effectively a semantics argument — its Lie of the Year, the editors argue, didn’t include the caveats and context that would make it more accurate. But let’s not forget, there were actual, demonstrable, unambiguous lies among the finalists for Lie of the Year. PolitiFact overlooked all of them.      When an outlet puts “fact” in its name, the standards for accuracy are especially high. When it’s selecting a Lie of the Year, standards dictate that the falsehood should be overwhelmingly obvious and offensive.      Today, PolitiFact, which relies exclusively on its credibility to affect the political discourse, ought to be ashamed of itself.      Update: I’ve seen some suggestions that Paul Ryan influenced the process by stuffing the ballot box. Here’s some additional analysis on this point.      Second Update: I didn’t realize this until later, but my friend John Cole used a similar car analogy two weeks ago. I guess great minds do think alike. ||||| Here’s a long, sad story about how Democrats’ basically true claim that House Republicans voted to end Medicare ended up “winning” PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year award — a development that will help the right and the GOP create their own reality as the future of the social safety net becomes a defining issue of the 2012 campaign.      Back in April, House Republicans passed a budget that included a plan to phase out Medicare over several years and build in its place a subsidized, private insurance marketplace for seniors.      Democrats called this a vote to “end Medicare.”      You can quibble. It wasn’t a vote to end Medicare — BLAM! — all at once. But under the GOP plan, within a couple decades, the current health retirement program for old people would be gone and in its place would be an entirely different one. It would just, by political design, have the same name: Medicare.      Ignoring policy in favor of process, and with an eye toward political balance, PolitiFact rated this basically true Democratic claim “Pants on Fire.”      Liberals, economists, health policy experts, and yours truly objected strongly to PolitiFact’s conclusion. But instead of rethinking their conclusion, the PolitiFact turned the opprobrium into a badge of honor: The claim itself became a candidate for PolitiFact’s “Lie of the Year” contest; Paul Ryan — the House GOP budget chairman who authored the plan — engaged in a modest ballot stuffing campaign; and the Democrats’ true “lie” came in third place, just behind the GOP claim that the stimulus created zero jobs, and Sen. Jon Kyl’s claim that abortion services are “well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.”      But you can’t be a fact checking organization and leave epistemic questions up to voters. So PolitiFact made a choice. And of those three frontrunners, they selected the only one with any truth behind it.      The reaction from Republicans has been muted so far — a sign, perhaps, that they don’t want to reopen this old wound. But back in their districts, when constituents grill them, Republicans will now have a compelling citation. It just happens to be a sham. ||||| Republicans muscled a budget through the House of Representatives in April that they said would take an important step toward reducing the federal deficit. Introduced by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the plan kept Medicare intact for people 55 or older, but dramatically changed the program for everyone else by privatizing it and providing government subsidies.            Democrats pounced. Just four days after the party-line vote, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a Web ad that said seniors will have to pay 12,500 more for health care \\"because Republicans voted to end Medicare.\\"            Rep. Steve Israel of New York, head of the DCCC, appeared on cable news shows and declared that Republicans voted to \\"terminate Medicare.\\" A Web video from the Agenda Project, a liberal group, said the plan would leave the country \\"without Medicare\\" and showed a Ryan look-alike pushing an old woman in a wheelchair off a cliff. And just last month, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent a fundraising appeal that said: \\"House Republicans’ vote to end Medicare is a shameful act of betrayal.\\"            After two years of being pounded by Republicans with often false charges about the 2010 health care law, the Democrats were turning the tables.            PolitiFact debunked the Medicare charge in nine separate fact-checks rated False or Pants on Fire, most often in attacks leveled against Republican House members.            Now, PolitiFact has chosen the Democrats’ claim as the 2011 Lie of the Year.            It’s the third year in a row that a health care claim has won the dubious honor. In 2009, the winner was the Republicans’ charge that the Democrats’ health care plan included \\"death panels.\\" In 2010, it was that the plan was a \\"government takeover of health care.\\"            A complicated and wonky subject with life-or-death consequences, health care is fertile ground for falsehoods. The Democratic attack about \\"ending Medicare\\" was a pervasive line in 2011 that preyed on seniors' worries about whether they could afford health care.            Even when explained accurately, the Republicans’ Medicare plan was not particularly popular with the public, nor with some independent health policy analysts. But the plan was distorted and attacked again and again.            \\"In terms of creating a national conversation about fiscal reform, the last thing we need is demagoguing attacks against people who have put forward serious policy proposals,\\" said Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \\"It’s very worrying.\\"            A persistent falsehood            With a few small tweaks to their attack lines, Democrats could have been factually correct, said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \\"I actually think there is no need to cut out the qualifiers and exaggerate,\\" he said.            At times, Democrats and liberal groups were careful to characterize the Republican plan more accurately. Another claim in the ad from the Agenda Project said the plan would \\"privatize\\" Medicare, which received a Mostly True rating from PolitiFact. President Barack Obama was also more precise with his words, saying the Medicare proposal \\"would voucherize the program and you potentially have senior citizens paying 6,000 more.\\"            But more often, Democrats and liberals overreached:            • They ignored the fact that the Ryan plan would not affect people currently in Medicare -- or even the people 55 to 65 who would join the program in the next 10 years.            • They used harsh terms such as \\"end\\" and \\"kill\\" when the program would still exist, although in a privatized system.            • They used pictures and video of elderly people who clearly were too old to be affected by the Ryan plan. The DCCC video that aired four days after the vote featured an elderly man who had to take a job as a stripper to pay his medical bills.            \\"Both parties use entitlements as political weapons,\\" Ryan said in an interview with PolitiFact. \\"Republicans do it to Democrats; Democrats do it to Republicans. So I knew that this would be a political weapon that the other side would use against us.\\"            Liberal bloggers and columnists contend it's accurate to say Republicans voted to end Medicare. Left-leaning websites such as Talking Points Memo, Daily Kos, and The New Republic said PolitiFact's analysis was wrong, as did New York Times columnist Paul Krugman.            \\"According to (PolitiFact's) logic, if the FBI were replaced with a voucher program wherein citizens would receive subsidies for hiring private investigators to look into criminal activity, but the agency running the voucher program were still called the FBI, it would be unfair to say that the FBI had been ended,\\" wrote Jed Lewison for Daily Kos. \\"I guess it's their right to make that argument, but it's transparently absurd.\\"            In a blog post, the DCCC stood by its claim, saying the ad accurately stated Ryan's plan would \\"abolish\\" Medicare.            But PolitiFact was not alone. Other independent fact-checkers also said the claim was false.            \\"Medicare would remain an entitlement program, but it would also be more costly to future beneficiaries. It would not end,\\" noted FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker concluded that while there’s \\"a worthwhile debate\\" about whether Ryan’s proposal should be adopted, \\"it is not true to claim Republicans are trying to ‘kill’ Medicare.\\"            The Democratic attacks struck a chord. Polls showed voters were skeptical of the Ryan plan and want Medicare to remain largely the way it is now. That may be why the plan has virtually no prospects of passing the Senate, which voted to shelve the plan. President Obama has indicated he would veto any changes to Medicare that would privatize the program and substantially shift costs to beneficiaries.            How the Ryan plan would work            Under the current Medicare system, the government pays the health care bills for Americans over age 65. Under the Ryan plan, future beneficiaries would be given a credit and invited to shop for an approved plan on a Medicare health insurance exchange. It received overwhelming support from Republicans in a House vote on a budget blueprint.            Starting in 2022, beneficiaries would receive \\"premium support payments\\" from the government to help pay for the private insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money, and high earners would get a little less.            The plan has some guarantees for coverage, although seniors would have to pay more to get the benefits they receive today, according to an analysis completed earlier this year by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).            The guarantees: Ryan's plan requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the health plans of federal employees. The Medicare eligibility age would rise from 65 to 67, an idea that has received some bipartisan support in the past.            The CBO found that it would save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for the same benefits.            Ryan says the plan would offer more choice for Medicare participants and increase competition among private insurers to drive down cost.            \\"I’m a big believer in patient-centered choice, where the beneficiary is the prime decision-maker, which drives competition and innovation, and that’s missing from the status quo, to a large degree,\\" he said.            It’s not the first time it’s been suggested that Medicare be changed from its current fee-for-service, where the government pays all the bills, to one that uses private insurers. In the past, some Democrats have even favored such proposals, especially if -- unlike the Ryan plan -- the support was linked to medical inflation, or there were an option for traditional Medicare, or there were more explicit protections for consumers.            Just last week, Ryan agreed to a new framework with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Their proposal uses Ryan’s idea for private insurers and exchanges, but it leaves traditional Medicare as an option.            Private insurers already offer Medicare plans under the program Medicare Advantage, though those plans have proven more expensive than traditional Medicare, not less.            The partisan split on health care reveals the contradictions of congressional debate. Republicans were staunchly against the insurance exchanges in the federal health care law. But they endorsed them in the Ryan proposal, even as Democrats switched to oppose the plan.            \\"Ryan basically proposed the Affordable Care Act for future seniors,\\" said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who advised both President Obama and Republican Mitt Romney on health care. \\"I don't understand how you can like it for future seniors but not like it for today's needy uninsured. That doesn't make any sense.\\"            'Scaring 85-year-olds'            Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on campaign advertising who directs the Annenberg center at the University of Pennsylvania, says Democrats have been using falsehoods and exaggerations about Medicare and Social Security since at least 1952. She calls it the longest-running \\"Democratic deception.\\"            It fits with a core theme from Democrats that they will use government to protect seniors and needy people, while Republicans supposedly want to cut those programs, she says. It is a scare tactic that works.            \\"If you're reliant on Medicare, a suggestion your benefits are going to be cut in any way is a direct, visceral threat,\\" said Jamieson.            Republicans actually used a version of the attack in 2010, claiming Democrats cut 500 billion from Medicare to pay for Obama's health care law; the law actually sought to reduce the growth of future spending with a series of efficiency measures. But historically, attacks about Medicare have come from Democrats.            In the 1950s and 1960s, Democrats used images of Social Security cards being torn in half to suggest that Republicans wanted to cut the program. In 1995, Democrats said House Speaker Newt Gingrich's plan to restructure Medicare would force seniors to pay more and would \\"wreck\\" Medicare.            President Bill Clinton vetoed the Republicans' Medicare bill, and used the issue to pummel GOP nominee Bob Dole in the 1996 campaign.            Gingrich complained at the time that \\"Medicare is the one issue the left believes they can lie about and demagogue.\\" He described the Democrats as \\"totally morally bankrupt\\" and said, \\"They are reduced to scaring 85-year-olds.\\"            The scare tactics are effective because seniors worry about being able to pay their medical bills and Medicare is a vital program for them. Also, seniors represent a large, up-for-grabs voting bloc.            Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, \\"If you can scare seniors that something is going to happen to those programs, there is potentially a huge payoff in votes.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, has accused the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) of lying in their recent ad that claims Republicans voted to end Medicare. However, the ad accuses Republicans of \\"voting to end Medicare\\", which PolitiFact itself acknowledges as a policy preference, leading many to argue that there is no lie. Furthermore, PolitiFact also agrees with the ad's assertion that seniors would have to pay 12,500 for health care under the GOP plan but is unhappy that the ad does not mention that the amount includes funds that would go to Medicare regardless. In conclusion, PolitiFact's case seems to rest on semantics rather than substantial inaccuracies, and its claims that the ad is a \\"lie\\" may actually benefit the Democrats since it could lead to an electoral advantage if Republicans attempt to use PolitiFact's argument as their defense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"The process of dieting refers to the management or alteration of food intake in order to control body weight. During dieting, you may consume less food, adopt a specific type of nutrition plan, or even intermittently fast. Different types of diets can have varying effects on digestion.  Now let's see how dieting may influence digestion, and especially the second effect you mentioned - the role of the tongue in pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth: 1. Less Food Consumption: When you eat less food while dieting, there will naturally be less material for the digestive system to process. Thus, overall digestion would likely be less intense as there is less food to break down. Regarding the specific role of the tongue, its job of moving food around during chewing would be 'less' affected. The tongue would still push food around while chewing, but there may be less food to move around and, therefore, the action may be less frequent or less intensive. 2. Specific Nutritional Plans: Some diets emphasize specific types of food (e.g., high-fiber, low-carb, etc.). These might influence digestion depending on which nutrients are emphasized or minimized. For instance, a high-fiber diet could actually stimulate digestion by promoting the movement of food through the digestive tract. On the other hand, a low-carb diet might slow it. In these instances, the tongue's role in moving food around when chewing could be 'more' or 'less' affected depending on the type of diet and consistency of the eaten food. 3. Fasting: In the case of intermittent fasting (not eating for a certain number of hours each day), digestion could be affected in various ways. On fasting periods, less food would be processed, decreasing the activities of digestion, including the tongue's action. While on eating periods, the tongue could work 'more' intensively as one might tend to eat larger meals within the limited eating time frame.  Therefore, it is evident that dieting could result in both 'more,' 'less,' or 'no change' to the tongue's activity due to the complex influence of different diet types on the process of digestion. It’s difficult to identify a universal effect of dieting on this aspect of digestion, as this depends on the specific dieting strategy and the individual’s response to it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

San Diego (CNN)As you're driving along the highway, wouldn't you like to know if there's a police car up ahead so you can slow down and avoid getting a ticket? You'd also probably like to know if there's a speed trap around the next corner, so you don't wind up spending your weekend at traffic school. Well, there's an app for that. Police chiefs, sheriffs and law enforcement groups wish there wasn't. They say they want to protect the lives of police officers, but what if they're just trying to protect the revenue that flows into government coffers due to speeding tickets? Waze is a new and controversial mobile app that tracks cars moving through traffic in real time and shares that information so users can get around traffic jams. This sounds harmless. But there is more. The app also uses a small icon of a tiny face in a police hat to warn users if police are nearby, either in speed traps or parked on the side the road. It obtains that information when other users who are driving further up the road input data into the system. It's ingenious -- and for law enforcement personnel, also frustrating. Police chiefs and sheriffs are not amused at this high-tech example of information-sharing. In fact, they're determined to put a stop to it. Law enforcement leaders claim to be concerned about officer safety. After all, lately, officers have been gunned down simply for wearing a uniform. They say they're worried about everyday citizens keeping track of the comings and goings of officers, and they insist that the app is a high-tech \\"police stalker.\\" They claim that this technology -- while helpful to motorists -- turns officers into \\"sitting ducks\\" for criminals. The folks at Waze, for their part, insist that the app improves the safety of roadways because most users tend to drive more carefully when they think police are nearby. That sounds reasonable. It also sounds as if police doth protest too much, and that they're not telling us the whole truth as to what they're really concerned about. It's not as if motorists can't often times spot police cars and adjust their speed without the help of an app; often, the patrol cars are in plain view on the side of the road. Likewise, those who want to harm law enforcement officers will find a way to do so regardless of what app is or isn't on the market. It's easy to see why Waze -- which was purchased by Google in 2013 for 966 million -- is so popular. There is a huge appetite for this technology. Potential customers include anyone who hates speed traps -- and that probably covers most Americans. In fact, there have been cases where individuals have tried to warn motorists about an oncoming speed trap and the police have come down hard on the good Samaritans. Luckily, the courts have, in turn, come down hard on the police, citing a First Amendment right to alert others as to the presence of police. In February 2014, for example, a county judge in Frisco, Texas,  about an hour north of Dallas, reportedly dismissed a complaint against 33-year-old Ron Martin who was arrested for holding a sign warning drivers of a speed trap. The sign read: \\"Police Ahead.\\" The charge was ridiculous but creative: a misdemeanor count of violating the city's sign ordinance. It's not just signs that are protected speech. Signals are covered too. A few days before the Texas ruling, in St. Louis, a federal judge ruled that motorists \\"have a First Amendment right to flash their headlights to warn\\" fellow drivers that police are nearby or setting a speed trap. In 2012, Michael Elli flashed his headlights to warn oncoming vehicles that police were waiting with radar just up the road. A police officer pulled over Elli, citing him for \\"flashing lights on certain vehicles...warning of RADAR ahead.\\" The city dropped the charge, but the American Civil Liberties Union decided to sue on Elli's behalf, charging that his First Amendment rights were violated. The judge agreed. Let's hear it for common sense. Speed traps are, by their very nature, a form of cheating. Law enforcement officers are bending the rules to hand out tickets. Worse, they're also an example of government-sponsored thievery. Cash-strapped cities and counties have come up with new ways of generating revenue. One of the first places they look are unsuspecting motorists who are in a poor position to complain because -- the authorities are likely to claim -- they wouldn't have received a ticket in the first place if they weren't guilty of speeding. But what are the authorities guilty of? If police have a quota to meet, or a sheriff's substation is competing with other substations as to the number of tickets it hands out, discretion will suffer. People who might not normally get a citation are going to be written up. That's not right. It's one thing for police officers to come across someone speeding in the course of their normal duties, and write that person a ticket. It's another for them to lie in wait for motorists to make mistakes so the government agency they work for can fleece the citizenry. That's not right either. When police set up a speed trap where motorists are likely to be driving over the speed limit -- say, at the bottom of a hill -- and then wait for drivers to meander into their web so they can write tickets that generate revenue for a city, county or state, they're violating a social contract. Those who have sworn an oath to protect us aren't supposed to prey upon us. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. Waze is a controversial mobile app that tracks cars moving through traffic in real time and warns users of nearby police cars, speed traps, or parked vehicles on the side of the road. 2.

Q:Shortly after five, the hospital called. More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Sam McKeon  for the following movie plot:  After witnessing gangster Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes to death in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price...

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the man that pretends to be homosexual to avoid being drafted?, using the article: The story focuses on the Turtles in the days leading up to and following the success of their single \\"Happy Together\\". Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman receive their draft cards and Frank Zappa tells them to seek advice from Herb Cohen, Zappa's manager and Kaylan's cousin, to avoid being drafted in the Vietnam War. Cohen advises Kaylan to show up to the draft board intoxicated from drug use, not to bathe or sleep, and to behave so obnoxiously that the Army will not draft him, leading Kaylan and Volman to engage in a sleepless night of marijuana smoking before their draft review, which they fail due to being high while taking the tests, and Kaylan pretending to be homosexual in front of the physician and expressing psychotic views to the psychiatrist. Because they avoid the draft, the Turtles fly to England where Graham Nash and Donovan play them an advance reel to reel recording of the unreleased Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which the Turtles declare to be the greatest album they ever heard. At a nearby pub, the Turtles have a disastrous meeting with the Beatles, in which Turtles guitarist Jim Tucker is verbally abused by John Lennon, leading the Turtles to leave the bar as Kaylan stays behind and Brian Jones, the founder of the Rolling Stones, introduces Kaylan to Jimi Hendrix, who Kaylan ends up having dinner and a conversation with, while the two drink much alcohol and smoke marijuana, with the evening ultimately ending with Kaylan vomiting on Hendrix' suit. Kaylan ultimately purchases copies of Sgt.

Recommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence-and counterterrorism-is now dysfunctional. Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

Apple: Bring us your weird, 3rd-party and counterfeit chargers FORTUNE — The news media had a field day last month reporting the death by electrocution of a Chinese flight attendant, apparently after she answered her iPhone while it was still plugged into a third-party charger. A Google Search for “Chinese iPhone electrocution” turned up more than 3 million results. Let’s see what the press does with the USB Power Adapter Takeback Program that Apple AAPL announced on Tuesday. Recent reports have suggested that some counterfeit and third party adapters may not be designed properly and could result in safety issues. While not all third party adapters have an issue, we are announcing a USB Power Adapter Takeback Program to enable customers to acquire properly designed adapters. Customer safety is a top priority at Apple. That’s why all of our products — including USB power adapters for iPhone, iPad, and iPod — undergo rigorous testing for safety and reliability and are designed to meet government safety standards around the world. Starting August 16, 2013, if you have concerns about any of your USB power adapters, you can drop them off at an Apple Retail Store or at an Apple Authorized Service Provider. We will ensure that these adapters are disposed of in an environmentally friendly way. If you need a replacement adapter to charge your iPhone, iPad, or iPod, we recommend getting an Apple USB power adapter. For a limited time, you can purchase one Apple USB power adapter at a special price — 10 USD or approximate equivalent in local currency. To qualify, you must turn in at least one USB power adapter and bring your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to an Apple Retail Store or participating Apple Authorized Service Provider for serial number validation. The special pricing on Apple USB power adapters is limited to one adapter for each iPhone, iPad, and iPod you own and is valid until October 18, 2013.

Goldstein Historic Devices for Hearing Collection      Speculation about a supposed time traveller talking on her cell phone at a 1928 Hollywood film premiere has sped across the Internet faster than a DeLorean time machine. But a less mind-bending possibility is that she was just hard of hearing, experts say.      The story first surfaced in a YouTube video that includes film footage showing the 1928 premiere of the Charlie Chaplin film \\"The Circus\\" at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Cali. Irish filmmaker George Clarke points out a woman in the old footage holding what he describes as a cell phone against her ear. The shape implies the woman is a time traveler using a modern mobile device rather than an ear trumpet, Clarke said.      What Clarke didn't consider was that a simple ear trumpet could still explain it all, said hearing device historians, who provided LiveScience with images of sample ear trumpets for comparison. [See the ear trumpets]      \\"As you can tell from these, old-fashioned mechanical or resonating hearing aids were not necessarily long and rounded,\\" said Philip Skroska, an archivist at the Bernard Becker Medical Library of Washington University in St. Louis. \\"Short, compact rectangular forms were not unusual.\\"      In other words, they could look something like a cell phone to imaginative YouTube viewers in the 21st century. [Time Travel Machine Outlined]      Listen to this      19th-century resonator hearing aids such as ear trumpets were still made in large numbers well into the first decades of the 20th century, Skroska explained, and the basic designs didn't change much aside from incorporating newer, plastic-like materials.      \\"Besides, I would expect this woman to be over 50 years old, so using a late 19th century design in 1928 would not be a stretch I think,\\" Skroska said.      Electronic hearing aids also existed before World War II, but in fewer numbers.      \\"Now, I can't really explain why the woman appears to be talking (other than yelling at the man who quickened his pace ahead of her),\\" Skroska said in an e-mail. \\"But I think it's fair to say it would be a hasty judgment to dismiss the possibility that it was a hearing aid she was holding up to her ear.\\"      This explanation might be less exciting than the time travel theory, but it avoids a huge number of theoretical and practical problems associated with sending someone into the past.      Time travel issues      Theorists have kicked around a few scenarios for how people might travel to the past, said Brian Greene, author of the bestseller, \\"The Elegant Universe\\" (Vintage Books, 2000) and a physicist at Columbia University, during a past LiveScience interview. \\"And almost all of them, if you look at them closely, brush up right at the edge of physics as we understand it. Most of us think that almost all of them can be ruled out.\\"      One theory focuses on wormholes – hypothetical tunnels that connect two regions of space-time that could represent two parts of the same universe, or even completely different universes.      But creating a wormhole that punches through space-time looks far beyond anything humans can accomplish with today's technology, said Michio Kaku, author of \\"Hyperspace\\" (Anchor, 1995) and \\"Parallel Worlds\\" (Anchor, 2006), and a physicist at the City University of New York, in a past interview.      Humans would need to somehow harness the energy of a star or possibly matter with negative energy density – an exotic and hypothetical form of matter with the energy of less than nothing. Even if such matter exists, there would likely not be enough of it for a time machine to harness.      Another time travel theory relies upon cosmic strings – narrow tubes of energy that span the entire length of the expanding universe. Predictions suggest that such regions could contain huge amounts of mass and warp space-time in a way that allows for time travel.      The cosmic strings either run on infinitely or form loops \\"like spaghetti or SpaghettiO's,\\" said Richard Gott, author of \\"Time Travel in Einstein's Universe\\" (Mariner Books, 2002) and an astrophysicist at Princeton University. Two such strings parallel to one another could perhaps bend space-time enough to make time travel possible – but it's a challenge that only a \\"super civilization\\" might try, Gott explained in a past interview.      Not what it seems      Any pathways that could theoretically allow for time travel between points in space-time have never been seen, according to Charles Liu, an astrophysicist at the City University of New York, College of Staten Island, and co-author on the book \\"One Universe: At Home in the Cosmos\\" (Joseph Henry Press, 1999).      Besides being \\"very unlikely to exist at all,\\" such pathways are \\"even less likely to be able to transport anything larger than a subatomic particle intact,\\" Liu said.      People of the present also have a track record of trying to fit what they see to known patterns, Liu pointed out. He added that it was no surprise for 21st-century people to see what they think is a cell phone in 1928, just as people claimed to see faces on Mars or the Virgin Mary in toast.      \\"So I'm going to bed tonight confident that the person was not a time traveler from the future,\\" Liu said in an e-mail yesterday. ||||| Search Famecrawler:      writes a humor blog, called The Mommyologist , all about the changes in life that go along with being a parent.

Information:  - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear.  - Japyx is a genus of diplurans belonging to the family Japygidae . These eyeless , predatory hexapods largely shun direct sunlight , remaining under stones and among detritus , where they use pincer - like cerci to catch their tiny prey .  - Earwigs make up the insect order Dermaptera and are found on all continents except Antarctica. With about 2,000 species in 12 families, they are one of the smaller insect orders. Earwigs have characteristic cerci, a pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen, and membranous wings folded underneath short forewings, hence the scientific order name, \\"skin wings\\". Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers. Earwigs rarely use their flying ability.  - The japygids (family Japygidae) are a taxon of hexapods, of the order Diplura. In this family, the paired cerci at the end of their abdomens are pincer-like (superficially similar to the unrelated earwigs) and are used to catch their tiny prey. Seventy genera are recognised, divided among seven subfamilies.  - The order Diplura is one of the four groups of hexapods, alongside insects, springtails and Protura. They are sometimes called \\"two-pronged bristletails\\". Around 800 species have been described, of which around 70 occur in North America, 12 in Great Britain and two in Australia.

Erin went to go visit Arlington Veterans Memorial with Elena because","output":"they both had a deep connection to the military community. Erin's grandfather had served in the army during World War II, and Elena's father was a retired Marine. They both understood the importance of honoring and remembering those who had sacrificed their lives for the freedom and safety of their country. As they walked through the vast, hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery, they were struck by the sheer magnitude of the number of small white tombstones that stretched for miles, each intricately adorned with the symbols, names, and details of the fallen soldiers. It was a sight that evoked a strong feeling of reverence and respect, combined with a somber reminder of the great cost of war. Continuing further into the cemetery, they stumbled upon the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a monument dedicated to the unidentified and unaccounted-for service members throughout the years. They watched in awe as the precisely coordinated Changing of the Guard ceremony took place, led by the stoic members of the elite 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, known as The Old Guard. Erin and Elena couldn't help but feel emotionally stirred by the grace and solemnity of the ritual, which was a powerful symbol of the undying commitment to honor those who had given their lives in service. As they ventured deeper into the memorial park, they came across the Arlington House, the former home of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The historic mansion now stood as a museum and a testament to the complexities of American war history, housing artifacts, and exhibits detailing the lives of the people who once occupied its rooms. Erin and Elena spent hours exploring the house, soaking in the wealth of information, and contemplating the many layers of history and sacrifice that surrounded them. After leaving Arlington House, they wandered towards the Women in Military Service for America Memorial. This extraordinary exhibit honored the role of women in the armed forces, dating back to the American Revolution. As they browsed the countless displays and tributes to groundbreaking female military leaders, they were reminded of the strength and courage that women have displayed throughout the years, often in the face of extraordinary adversity. As the sun began to set over the Arlington National Cemetery, Erin and Elena decided to pay their respects to the victims of the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon. At the memorial site, they were greeted by 184 illuminated benches, each bearing the name of a person lost, suspended gracefully over tranquil pools of water. In the stillness of the evening air, they shared a moment of silence, letting the reality of the tragedy and the sacrifices made on that day wash over them. With heavy hearts and an immense sense of gratitude, Erin and Elena left the Arlington Veterans Memorial that day, their lives forever touched by the stories and spirit of the brave men and women they had come to honor. They resolved to make their trip to the memorial an annual tradition, not only to pay their respects to those who had fallen but to remind themselves of the power and resilience of the human spirit, and the sacrifices made by countless individuals in their pursuit of a better world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The hip-hop star is up for album of the year for To Pimp A Butterfly, a dense, detailed trawl of black music, US politics and his personal demons. His competition comes from Taylor Swift, whose pop smash 1989 is finally nominated, a year after its release. It came out too late to be eligible for last year's awards, a fate which has befallen Adele's 25 this time around. Swift ties with R&B star The Weeknd for second place, with seven nominations apiece, while Ed Sheeran and James Bay represent the UK. Sheeran is up for two of the major prizes - song of the year and record of the year - for his emotive ballad Thinking Out Loud. The former award goes to the writers (in this case Sheeran and Amy Wadge), while the record of the year category takes into account the performance and production of a hit song. Other nominees for song of the year include The Weeknd's breakthrough hit Can't Feel My Face and Mark Ronson's global smash Uptown Funk. Swift is nominated for the tongue-in-cheek single Blank Space, as is Lamar for Alright, the hope-filled centrepiece of his album. The shortlist for the four main categories is as follows: Best album Song of the Year Record of the Year Best new artist See the full list on Grammy.com Lamar's domination of the shortlist is \\"a testimony to his artistry,\\" said Neil Portnow, head of the Recording Academy. \\"He's someone that's very serious about his art and about his craft, and has been working it for quite some time. And this is one of those instances where the work pays off.\\" The hip-hop artist's other nominations include best rap album and best pop duo/group performance for Bad Blood - a remix of one of the tracks on Swift's 1989. He is also shortlisted twice for best rap song, including Kanye West's All Day, which he co-wrote - along with 18 other credited performers, which could make an interesting moment on stage if West wins. Among the most prestigious awards in music, the Grammys feature an exhaustive 83 categories in 30 genres, including the likes of best tropical Latin album and best jazz improvisation. Outside the main categories, the late Amy Winehouse is up for her seventh Grammy thanks to Asif Kapadia's revealing documentary on her life; while a deluxe reissue of The Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers is up for best box set. Justin Bieber, who had been considered a contender for some of the main prizes, only gets one nomination, for best dance recording; while Rihanna also misses out, despite her Paul McCartney duet  FourFiveSeconds being tipped as a nomine for song of the year. British acts Disclosure, Jamie xx and The Chemical Brothers are all in contention for best dance album; and Florence + The Machine have four nominations in categories as varied as best pop album and best packaging.

Sergeant Blackman is said to have been devastated by the death of his wheelchair-bound father shortly before the tour of Afghanistan that was to end in shame. Brian Blackman, 73, was suffering from Parkinson’s disease and died in January 2011. A friend said it had a huge impact on his son, who tragically had been caught in traffic and unable make it to his father’s bedside to be with him as he died. It was against this emotional backdrop of regret and grief that the commando deployed to Afghanistan. Those close to him believe this played a part in the ‘moment of madness’ that ended in the execution of a Taliban fighter – and murder conviction more than two years later. Scroll down for video. Emotional: Alexander Blackman with his wheelchair-bound father Brian who died shortly before his tour of duty. Footage: The incident in which Blackman killed a Taliban militant was caught on camera by another Marine. Ironically, Blackman was a model soldier, a war hero with an exceptional record who had served in a number of conflicts. He proved his courage on six gruelling tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. And in 2001 he was part of the hunt for Bin Laden. He was among Marines flown in to help Special Forces as they fought Al Qaeda gunmen in Bora Bora. Blackman’s closest brush with death came on his tour to Iraq, when he miraculously survived being hit by a grenade during the assault on Basra. Identified: Sergeant Alexander Blackman has been revealed as the Royal Marine who was last month convicted a murdering an Afghan insurgent. Fighting had been intense, with an. officer describing the area as a scene from Dante’s Inferno. While. leading the assault on Basra, Iraq’s second city in a military vehicle,. his rucksack containing ammunition, water and rations was hit by the. warhead of a rocket propelled grenade in an ambush on his vehicle. Marines dived for cover as bullets and RPGs raining down on them, and one rocket smashed into his kit bag diverting it just past his head while bullets burst around them. After the attack, his fellow commandos could not believe that Blackman had not been killed. Despite the difficult campaign – which saw Marines locked in some of the fiercest fighting experienced by British forces – his combat report is said to have been ‘exemplary’ and he was recommended for promotion. His family in Brighton – his father, a former porter and lorry driver, his mother Frances, 74, a former hairdresser, brother and two sisters knew his love of the Marines and the lifestyle they offered. Blackman, a keen cyclist, runner and golfer, excelled while studying sports and physical education at Lewes Tertiary College in East Sussex. He had ambitions of representing Great Britain at canoeing until, aged 17, he was knocked down by a car while cycling. Desperate to challenge himself, he enlisted in the Royal Marines in 1998, passing the arduous tests with flying colours. Tours of Northern Ireland were followed by training in the US and Oman, and in November 2007 he deployed to southern Afghanistan. After returning from that tour he married Claire Warner, 38, an assistant director of operations with the National Trust in Somerset and Gloucestershire, and they settled in Taunton. Incident: The footage filmed by Marine B's helmet camera formed part of the court martial hearing. Revealed: Footage of the incident with Blackman's face uncensored has just been released for the first time. Highly regarded by senior officers,. Blackman had joined 42 Commando and J [Juliet] Company, known for its. discipline, fortitude and bravery – and members were tested to the full. during their six-month spring tour in spring 2011. He had previously seen some action in Afghanistan during the quieter winter months. But this deployment – later named the ‘Tour from hell’ by his colleagues – them attacked almost daily. Despite this hostility, the imposing 6ft 3in Blackman was credited with fostering ‘hearts and minds’ of the local population and helping oversee projects such as the building of a school. But the gruelling impact of losing friends and colleagues was to take its toll. During the proceedings leading up to his conviction for murder, Blackman said around 20 of his friends had been killed or maimed during the tour, including a popular young officer and a marine who had previously won a Military Cross for courage under fire. Film: The Marine could be heard quoting Shakespeare as he shot the Taliban prisoner. Trauma: Friends of Blackman have blamed the incident on the horrors he experienced while on duty. He said other comrades had suffered ‘life-changing’ injuries and described the effect the deaths had on commandos after the body parts of friends were hung in trees by insurgents. ‘It’s not a nice thing for the lads,’ he said. ‘Close friends they have lived with have been killed and parts of their bodies are displayed as a kind of trophy for the world to see.’ The Marines returned home as heroes, with Blackman earmarked for promotion to Colour Sergeant. It would have remained that way had a commando not been arrested by civilian police more than a year later and chilling head camera footage of the Helmand execution discovered on his laptop.

Plot title: Shaitani Ilaaka Movie plot: A grotesque brougham stops in a dark forest and its cowled driver, Lalbai the sorceress, beckons to the bewitched passenger, a newly wed bride. Lalbai leads the bride to the shaitani ilaaka (devil's domain) where she is roused from her spell. The bride is sacrificed, screaming and kicking, at the altar of her aka (the Shaitan, or great devil). Shaitan is an ancient and fearsome demon. Years ago, he roamed free and indiscriminately terrorized the local townsfolk. But he was ultimately defeated, reduced to a formless soul, and held, by a magic charm, to remain imprisoned forever within the shaitani ilaaka. Lalbai brings him a fresh bride every Amavasya night. Shaitan consumes the blood of this bride, and grows stronger with each offering, until he can break the charm, restore all his evil powers and ravage the world again. At the affluent home of rich industrialist Thakur, he has a wife, Roma, and their six-year old daughter, Anju. They have retained a governess, Shalaka, for Anju. Anju seems to be a happy child with one exception. She experiences strange convulsions and horrible nightmares every Amavasya night.

The film follows the lives of four childhood friends: Joon-seok, the leader of the group and whose father is a powerful mob boss; Dong-su, whose father is an undertaker; class clown Jung-ho; and Sang-taek, who was an exemplary student. As children they play together, sell sexually explicit pictures cut from a magazine, and wonder if a South Korean Olympic swimmer could outrace a sea turtle. Jung-ho also showed the rest of them a VCR that his mother had, and this film he found on it. It turns out to be a pornographic movie, and the boys are entranced while arguing over what a \\"menstruation\\" was, with them believing that it was the word that adults used to describe the \\"vagina\\".Fast forward to high school, where they are reunited after separating during middle school. They become smitten with the lead singer of a band of girls their age. Joon-seok invites the band to a party at his house, where each boy pairs off with one girl (though not after some tension over how to do so). Sang-taek receives his first kiss from the lead singer, Jin-sook.Back in school, Joon-seok and Dong-su get in trouble after a confrontation with a teacher; After their friends convince them to go apologize, they are only off with a light suspension. During an outing to the movies, where Sang-taek catches the eye of another school kid whom he had picked a fight with earlier, Joon-seok and Dong-su fend off a whole rival school while Jung-ho protects Sang-taek.

After an attack on his men, Joon-seok visits Dong-su at his headquarters. Joon-seok talks to Dong-su as if nothing has happened, and asks if he would like to accompany him to see Sang-taek off, since he was heading to the United States. Dong-su, however, does not want to, and Joon-seok becomes serious.

But all these human tendencies and phenomena are as yet still embryonic Add punctuation","output":"Indeed, all these human tendencies and phenomena are, as yet, still embryonic. This statement suggests that there are many aspects of human behavior, cognition, emotion, and social organization that are currently in the early stages of development or understanding. While some tendencies and phenomena are well-established and thoroughly understood, there is still an immense amount of uncharted territory waiting to be discovered and studied. In particular, human cognition and the brain – our most complex and intricate organ – continue to elicit fascination and inquiry from researchers around the world. As advancements in neuroimaging and other techniques unfold, we are beginning to uncover new information about how the brain functions, processes information, and adapts to change. Despite these advances, there is still much to learn about the intricacies of the brain and the true scope of our mental capacities. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological progress in recent years has led to new paradigms in the realm of human communication, interaction, and learning. We now have access to a wealth of knowledge and resources at our fingertips through the internet, which has proven to be both empowering and overwhelming. Our ability to navigate this digital landscape and adapt to changes in technology is, in many ways, still at an early stage of development. Similarly, our understanding of human emotions and their influence on our decision-making and behavior is continually evolving. While we have identified basic emotions and some of their impacts on our lives, neuroscientists and psychologists are still exploring more nuanced emotions, their interrelationships, and effects on the human psyche. Recent advances in emotional intelligence research have provided insights into managing emotions effectively to improve relationships, decision-making processes, and overall well-being. However, many facets of our emotional landscape remain underexplored. Furthermore, as our world becomes increasingly interconnected, we are continually exposed to different cultures, languages, beliefs, and social norms. Understanding and embracing this diversity can contribute to global harmony and prosperity. This, too, is a process that is in its infancy, with significant obstacles and misconceptions still hindering our progress in fostering cross-cultural understanding and collaboration. Lastly, the looming threat of climate change and environmental issues provide another area where human behavior, mentality, and awareness need significant growth and development. We are beginning to understand the implications of our actions on the environment, but the pace of change in our behaviors, policies, and technologies has yet to catch up with the urgency of the situation. In conclusion, the statement that \\"all these human tendencies and phenomena are, as yet, still embryonic\\" highlights the immense potential for growth and development in various aspects of our lives. As we continue to expand our knowledge and understanding of ourselves and the world around us, we must seize the opportunity to evolve and adapt. By doing so, we can overcome the myriad challenges facing humanity and strive to create a better world for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In which organisms could evolution occur most rapidly?","output":"To determine in which organisms evolution could occur most rapidly, we must consider key factors that drive and accelerate the process of evolution. Let's break this down step by step: Step 1: Characteristics of organisms with rapid evolution - Short generation times: Faster reproduction rates lead to quicker genetic changes across generations, allowing for rapid adaptation. - Large population sizes: Organisms with larger populations have greater genetic diversity, which can increase the chances of beneficial mutations. - High mutation rates: Organisms with higher mutation rates experience a higher frequency of genetic variation, which helps drive evolution. - Strong selective pressures: Environments with strong selective pressures can induce faster evolutionary adaptation to survive challenging conditions. Step 2: Identifying organisms with these characteristics - Bacteria: Bacteria have short generation times, large population sizes, relatively high mutation rates, and often face strong selective pressures (e.g., antibiotics). They can evolve quickly, developing resistance to drugs and adapting to various environments. - Viruses: Viruses, including RNA viruses like influenza and HIV, have high mutation rates and evolve rapidly to escape immune responses or adapt to new hosts. - Some insects: Insects, such as fruit flies (Drosophila), have fast reproduction rates and large population sizes, which contribute to their ability to evolve quickly. - Small plants and fungi: Some small plants, like the common waterweed, can reproduce quickly and adapt to new environments. Fungi, such as yeast, have relatively short generation times and thus can undergo rapid evolution as well. Step 3: Conclusion Based on the factors that contribute to rapid evolution, it can be concluded that organisms such as bacteria, viruses, certain insects, small plants, and fungi are the ones in which evolution could occur most rapidly. Their short generation times, large population sizes, high mutation rates, and frequent exposure to strong selective pressures collectively accelerate the process of evolution in these organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: Sun Ra (born Herman Poole Blount, legal name Le Sony'r Ra; May 22, 1914 - May 30, 1993) was an American jazz composer, bandleader, piano and synthesizer player, and poet known for his experimental music, \\"cosmic\\" philosophy, prolific output, and theatrical performances. For much of his career, Ra led \\"The Arkestra\\", an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up. Born and raised in Alabama, Blount eventually became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian God of the Sun) and developing a complex persona and mythology that would make him a pioneer of Afrofuturism: he claimed he was an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, and throughout his life he consistently denied any ties to his prior identity. Context: In 1934 Blount was offered his first full-time musical job by Ethel Harper--his biology teacher from the high school, who had organized a band to pursue a career as a singer. Blount joined a musicians' trade union and toured with Harper's group through the US Southeast and Midwest. When Harper left the group mid-tour to move to New York (she later was a member of the modestly successful singing group the Ginger Snaps), Blount took over leadership of the group, renaming it the Sonny Blount Orchestra. They continued touring for several months before dissolving as unprofitable. Though the first edition of the Sonny Blount Orchestra was not financially successful, they earned positive notice from fans and other musicians. Blount afterward found steady employment as a musician in Birmingham.  Birmingham clubs often featured exotic trappings, such as vivid lighting and murals with tropical or oasis scenes. Some believe these influenced the elements Sun Ra incorporated in his later stage shows. Playing for the big bands gave black musicians a sense of pride and togetherness, and they were highly regarded in the black community. They were expected to be disciplined and presentable, and in the segregated South, black musicians had wide acceptance in white society. They often played for elite white society audiences (though they were typically forbidden from associating with the audience).  In 1936, Whatley's intercession led to Blount's being awarded a scholarship at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University. He was a music education major, studying composition, orchestration, and music theory. He dropped out after a year.  Sun Ra soon left college because, he claimed, he had a visionary experience as a college student that had a major, long-term influence on him. In 1936 or 1937, in the midst of deep religious concentration, Sun Ra claimed that a bright light appeared around him, and, as he later said:  My whole body changed into something else. I could see through myself. And I went up... I wasn't in human form... I landed on a planet that I identified as Saturn... they teleported me and I was down on [a] stage with them. They wanted to talk with me. They had one little antenna on each ear. A little antenna over each eye. They talked to me. They told me to stop [attending college] because there was going to be great trouble in schools... the world was going into complete chaos... I would speak [through music], and the world would listen. That's what they told me.  Sun Ra said that this experience occurred in 1936 or 1937. According to Szwed, the musician's closest associates cannot date the story any earlier than 1952. (Sun Ra also said that the incident happened when he was living in Chicago, where he did not settle until the late 1940s). Sun Ra discussed the vision, with no substantive variation, to the end of his life. His trip to Saturn allegedly occurred a full decade before flying saucers entered public consciousness with the 1947 encounter of Kenneth Arnold. It was earlier than other public accounts: about 15 years before George Adamski wrote about contact with benevolent beings; and almost 20 years before the 1961 case of Barney and Betty Hill, who recounted sinister UFO abductions. Szwed says that, \\"even if this story is revisionist autobiography... Sonny was pulling together several strains of his life. He was both prophesizing his future and explaining his past with a single act of personal mythology.\\"  In October 1942 Blount received a selective service notification that he had been drafted into the Military of the United States. He quickly declared himself a conscientious objector, citing religious objections to war and killing, his financial support of his great-aunt Ida, and his chronic hernia. The local draft board rejected his claim. In an appeal to the national draft board, Blount wrote that the lack of black men on the draft appeal board \\"smacks of Hitlerism.\\" Sonny's refusal to join the military deeply embarrassed his family, and many relatives ostracized him. He was eventually approved for alternate service at Civilian Public Service camp in Pennsylvania--but he did not appear at the camp as required on December 8, 1942. Shortly after, he was arrested in Alabama.  In court, Blount said that alternate service was unacceptable; he debated the judge on points of law and Biblical interpretation. Though sympathetic, the judge ruled that Blount was violating the law and was at risk for being drafted into the U.S. military. Blount responded that if inducted, he would use military weapons and training to kill the first high-ranking military officer possible. The judge sentenced Blount to jail (pending draft board and CPS rulings), and then said, \\"I've never seen a nigger like you before.\\" Blount replied, \\"No, and you never will again.\\"  In January 1943 Blount wrote to the United States Marshals Service from the Walker County, Alabama jail in Jasper. He said he was facing a nervous breakdown from the stress of imprisonment, that he was suicidal, and that he was in constant fear of sexual assault. When his conscientious objector status was reaffirmed in February 1943, he was escorted to Pennsylvania. He did forestry work as assigned during the day and was allowed to play piano at night. Psychiatrists there described him as \\"a psychopathic personality [and] sexually perverted,\\" but also as \\"a well-educated colored intellectual.\\"  In March 1943, the draft board reclassified Blount as 4-F because of his hernia, and he returned to Birmingham, embittered and angered. He formed a new band and soon was playing professionally. After his beloved great-aunt Ida died in 1945, Blount felt no reason to stay in Birmingham. He dissolved the band, and moved to Chicago--part of the Second Great Migration, southern African Americans who moved north during and after World War II. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there are several other interesting aspects about this article. Some of these include: 1. Sun Ra's early life and work in the Chicago jazz scene, where he developed his unique persona and mythology that made him a pioneer of Afrofuturism. 2. The influence of Birmingham clubs' exotic trappings, which possibly shaped Sun Ra's stage shows later in his career. 3. Sun Ra's visionary experience of visiting Saturn and being told by the beings there that he would speak through music, and the world would listen. 4. The discussion about how Sun Ra's Saturn vision might be a form of revisionist autobiography, with Sun Ra connecting various aspects of his life through a single piece of personal mythology. 5. Sun Ra's struggle to declare himself as a conscientious objector during World War II and his experiences in prison and Civilian Public Service camp before being reclassified as 4-F due to his hernia. These aspects showcase Sun Ra's ardent commitment to his beliefs, the evolution of his persona, and the unique experiences that contributed to his life and artistic legacy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He made his television debut with Guiding Light in 2001, and gained recognition with his recurring role in the NBC television series Chuck. He played the lead role of con-artist and thief Neal Caffrey in the USA Network series White Collar from 2009 to 2014. Bomer won a Golden Globe Award and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his supporting role as Felix Turner, opposite Mark Ruffalo, in the HBO television film The Normal Heart (2014). Matthew Staton Bomer was born on October 11, 1977 in Webster Groves, Missouri, to Elizabeth Macy (nee Staton) and John O'Neill Bomer IV, a Dallas Cowboys draft pick. His father, John Bomer, played for the Dallas Cowboys from 1972 to 1974. He has a sister Megan Bomer and a brother Neill Bomer, who is an engineer. Bomer credits his own parents for being understanding when they sensed their young child was a little different from other kids. \\"I've always had an active imagination,\\" says Bomer. He is a distant cousin to American singer Justin Timberlake, with whom he starred in the movie In Time in 2011. Timberlake and Bomer share common descent from Edward Bomer, who was born in 1690. Bomer's ancestry includes English, as well as Welsh, Scots-Irish, Scottish, Irish, Swiss-German, and German.  In 1995, at age 17, Bomer made his professional stage debut as Young Collector in a production of Tennessee Williams A Streetcar Named Desire (1947) staged by Alley Theatre, a company in the Downtown, Houston, at the Texas. A few years later he returned to the stage in 1998 in a re-presentation of the play Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice in the play he lived Issachar - who was represented at the Utah Shakespeare Festival in Cedar City, Utah. Speaking about his first role in a production, Bomer said:  I started acting professionally when I was 17. I quit the team and did a production of A Streetcar Named Desire at the Alley Theatre in Houston. I used to drive down at the end of the school day, do the show, do my homework during intermission and drive an hour back to Spring to go to school the next day.  He grew up in Spring, Texas, a suburb of Houston, and attended its Klein High School in 1996, where he was a classmate of future actor Lee Pace and actress Lynn Collins. Pace and Bomer both acted at Houston's Alley Theatre, a non-profit theatre company. Bomer was nurtured throughout middle school by a theater arts teacher who taught him to improvise and give life to the characters he had created in his mind. His senior year, Bomer received a scholarship for some of his monologue performances, which led to his acceptance at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Where he graduated in 2001, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, along with his friend and also actor Joe Manganiello. Who were his parents?","output":"Matthew Bomer's parents are Elizabeth Macy, also called by Staton, and John O'Neill Bomer IV.

Los tres cerebros. Como resolver problemas\\" can be translated to English as, \\"7. The Three Brains. How to Solve Problems.\\" This sentence appears to be a title or heading that introduces a section or chapter discussing the concept of the three brains and how they can be utilized to approach problem-solving. To further elaborate on this concept, the idea of having three brains is based on the Triune Brain model proposed by Dr. Paul MacLean, a neuroscientist from the United States. According to his theory, the human brain consists of three distinct but interconnected sections, each with its own specialized functions: 1. The Reptilian Brain (brainstem and cerebellum) - This is the oldest and most primitive part of the brain, responsible for basic survival instincts, such as self-preservation, territorial defense, and reproduction. It is also in charge of autonomic functions, including heart rate, breathing, and body temperature regulation. 2. The Mammalian Brain (limbic system) - Also known as the emotional brain, it is responsible for processing and regulating emotions, forming memories, and managing basic social behaviors. Key structures within the mammalian brain include the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and thalamus. 3. The Neocortex (cerebral cortex) - The neocortex is the most evolved and largest part of the human brain. It is responsible for complex cognitive functions, such as perception, awareness, decision-making, reasoning, language, creativity, and problem-solving. The neocortex is further divided into four distinct lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital), each responsible for specific functions. In the context of \\"The Three Brains. How to Solve Problems,\\" the idea is to understand the functions of each part of the triune brain and learn how to harness their capabilities effectively to approach and solve problems. This involves recognizing the roles that instinct, emotions, and higher cognitive processes play in decision-making and problem-solving, and learning strategies to integrate these different aspects of the brain to achieve optimal outcomes. Some approaches may include mindfulness practices, emotional intelligence training, or cognitive reframing techniques, among others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jackson), a top Chicago Police Department hostage negotiator, is approached by his partner Nate Roenick (Paul Guilfoyle) who warns him that according to an informant (whom he refuses to name), members of their own unit are embezzling large sums of money from the department's disability fund, for which Roman is a board member. When Roman goes to meet with him again he finds Roenick murdered seconds before other police arrive, pinning him as the prime suspect. Things only get worse for Roman when Internal Affairs investigator Terence Niebaum (J. T. Walsh), whom Roenick's informant suspected of involvement in the embezzlement, is assigned to investigate the murder. After the gun that killed Roenick is linked to a case Roman had worked on, Niebaum and other investigators search Roman's house and discover papers for an offshore bank account with a deposit equal to one of the amounts of money embezzled. Roman is made to surrender his gun and badge and his colleagues are doubtful of his protests of innocence. With murder and embezzlement charges pending, Roman storms into Niebaum's office and demands answers about who set him up. When Niebaum stonewalls, Roman takes Niebaum, his administrative assistant Maggie (Siobhan Fallon), police commander Grant Frost (Ron Rifkin), and two-bit con man Rudy Timmons (Paul Giamatti) as hostages. With the building evacuated and placed under siege by his own CPD unit and the FBI, Roman issues his conditions: finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lt. Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), another top negotiator. Roman believes he can trust Sabian because he negotiates for as long as possible and see using force as a last resort, and being from another precinct eliminates him as a suspect in the disability fund scheme. Sabian clashes with the CPD but is given temporary command of the unit after they hastily attempt a breach that goes poorly, resulting in additional officers becoming Roman's hostages.

It emphasizes the importance of checking your business's bank account at the beginning of each month to track the cash on hand. This practice is crucial for understanding your business's cash flow and managing it effectively. Monitoring your bank account regularly helps you in several ways: 1. Identifying patterns: By evaluating your cash balance at the beginning of each month, you will be able to observe trends in your cash flow, such as peak sales periods or times when expenses are higher. 2. Allocating resources: Regular check-ins on your cash balance will allow you to make more informed decisions about where to allocate resources. If your balance is frequently low, you might cut non-essential expenses, negotiate better payment terms with suppliers, or improve your customer payment collection process to maintain a healthier cash flow. 3. Planning for the future: A consistent understanding of your business's cash flow can help inform your decisions on hiring, marketing, and investing in new equipment or inventory. Knowing when your cash reserves are typically at their highest and lowest will enable you to time these expenses effectively. 4. Maintaining solvency: Gaining a solid grasp of your business's cash flow is vital for ensuring that you always have enough money to meet your financial obligations, such as payroll, rent, and supplier payments. Regularly assessing your cash situation will help you avoid unexpected shortfalls and potential financial crises. 5. Cash flow forecasting: By regularly checking your bank account, you can gather historical data and use it to create forecasts for future cash flow. This can help you anticipate potential issues and make adjustments to your business strategy accordingly. In conclusion, checking your bank account is a key step in managing your business's cash flow, and it helps you make more informed decisions about how to allocate resources and plan for your company's financial future."},{"instruction":"Q:April 1, 2006 Walter died today.

CHAPTER XXXVI  THE CHARLATAN UNMASKED  There seemed for the next few minutes to be a somewhat singular abstention from any desire to interfere with the two people who stood in the centre of the little group, hand-in-hand. Saton, after his first speech, and after Lois had given him her hands, had turned a little defiantly toward Rochester, who remained, however, unmoved, his elbow resting upon the broad mantelpiece, his face almost expressionless. Vandermere, too, stood on one side and held his peace, though the effort with which he did so was a visible one. Lady Mary looked anxiously towards them. Pauline had shrunk back, as though something in the situation terrified her.  Even Saton himself felt that it was the silence before the storm. The courage which he had summoned up to meet a storm of disapproval, began to ebb slowly away in the face of this unnatural silence. It was clear that the onus of further speech was to rest with him.  Still retaining Lois' hand, he turned toward Rochester.  \\"You have forbidden me to enter your house, or to hold any communication with your ward until she was of age, Mr. Rochester,\\" he said. \\"One of your conditions I have obeyed.

The overwhelming ethnic majority in Nanjing is Han Chinese. Han Chinese make up more than 90% of the population in China and are the world's largest ethnic group. Nanjing, being one of the prominent cities in China, reflects this demographic pattern.  In the context of the quote provided, it is important to note that the Hui nationality mentioned is one of China's recognized minority ethnic groups, rather than the city's largest ethnic majority. The Hui people are distinct from the Han Chinese, with their own unique culture, language, and religious practices, predominantly adhering to Islam. The quote specifies that in 1999, 83.76% of the minority population in Nanjing were Hui nationalities, highlighting their significance within the city's broader minority communities. In summary, the overwhelming ethnic majority in Nanjing is Han Chinese, not the Hui nationality as the quote might suggest.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: My Left Foot (1989) Imagine being a prisoner of your own body, unable to make any movements except to move your left foot. The main character in My Left Foot, based on the real story of cerebral palsy   sufferer Christy Brown, can barely move his mouth to speak, but by controlling his left foot, he's able to express himself as an artist and poet. For his moving performance of Brown, Daniel Lewis won his first Academy Award for best actor. Shine (1996) Do you have a talent you're afraid to share with the world? David Helfgott seemed meant from childhood to be \\"one of the truly great pianists,\\" but the pressures of performing (and pleasing his father) resulted in a complete breakdown. Ten years in a mental institution didn't weaken Helfgott's musical gift: When  he was rediscovered, he was playing concertos in a bar. Shine received s even Oscar nominations  , and Geoffrey Rush won best actor for his performance of Helfgott.    Life Is Beautiful (1997) Nothing's more powerful than the love between a parent and a child. In this heartbreaking Italian film, a father (Roberto Benigni) makes an unbelievable sacrifice for his 4-year-old son: trapped in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, the Jewish man convinces his boy that they are playing a complicated game. He manages to spare him the horror of the terrible war, and even in his final moments of life, keeps his son smiling and hopeful. Benigni won the best actor Oscar. Stand and Deliver (1988) Few people can inspire us more than a good teacher. Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos got Oscar nomination for best actor) is a great one. Employed at a high school where kids are expected to fail, Escalante challenges his math students to struggle for better things, like getting good grades in the AP exam. Despite the obstacles in their lives, the classmates accomplish their goals, thanks to Mr. Escalante's support. The real Jaime Escalante, the Best Teacher in America, says that Stand and Deliver is \\" 90% truth, 10% drama.\\" Question: What do the four movies have in common? Options: A: They are all based on real stories. B: The main characters all won Academy Award for Best Actor. C: They are all inspiring stories that make a difference. D: The main characters are all sick to some degree but succeed.","output":"The four given movies are: My Left Foot (1989), Shine (1996), Life Is Beautiful (1997), and Stand and Deliver (1988). Let's analyse each option one by one: Option A: All four movies are indeed based on real stories. So, this could be a possible answer. Option B: The main characters of My Left Foot, Shine, and Life Is Beautiful won Academy Award for Best Actor, but in Stand and Deliver, Edward James Olmos got an Oscar nomination for best actor but did not win. Hence, this option is incorrect. Option C: All the movies indeed tell inspiring stories that make a difference. So, this could be another possible answer. Option D: In My Left Foot, the main character has cerebral palsy. David Helfgott in Shine has a mental breakdown. In Life Is Beautiful, the main character isn't physically sick, but he faces a horrific situation and in Stand and Deliver, Jaime Escalante is not shown as sick. Therefore, this option is incorrect. So, based on the elimination method, the two possible correct answers could be either option A: They are all based on real stories or option C: They are all inspiring stories that make a difference. However, option C is a more encompassing and profound commonality that incorporates Option A as well, given that all the movies are not only real stories but also very inspirational.

In architecture Durer cites Vitruvius but elaborates his own classical designs and columns. In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

To do this, let's subtract 645 from both sides of the equation: -645 = 43*j Now, to find the value of j, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of j, which is 43: (-645) / 43 = j Divide -645 by 43: j ≈ -15 Therefore, the approximate solution for j is -15."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Title: Decent App, Could Use Some Improvement Review: I've been using the FrostWire Android app (com.frostwire.android) for a few months now, and I overall think it's a good app that's worth three stars. It does have its perks and offers some convenient features that make downloading torrents and playing media easier. However, there are areas where the app could improve as well. One of the major positive aspects of the FrostWire Android app is its user-friendly interface. Navigating through the app is easy enough, and the search function is quite helpful! I appreciate the ability to search for torrents and access a selection of quality downloads in just a few clicks. Additionally, the app has a built-in media player, which is a great feature for playing videos and music effortlessly. I find this particularly useful, as it saves me from switching between multiple apps. Despite these advantages, the app comes with a few drawbacks. Firstly, I experience occasional crashes, which can be frustrating, especially when I'm in the midst of torrent downloading. It would be great if the developers could iron out these stability issues. Another area that could use some improvement is the inclusion of intrusive ads. I understand that in-app ads are necessary for generating revenue, but sometimes they go overboard and hamper my user experience. It would be great if they could reduce the amount of ads displayed without limiting the app's features. Lastly, one of my concerns is the speed of downloads. Sometimes, it can get incredibly slow, even with a steady internet connection. I don't know if it's because of the app or the torrent sources, but an enhancement in this aspect would be helpful. In conclusion, the FrostWire Android app serves its purpose relatively well and offers some useful features. However, if the developers could address the stability, ad intrusion, and download speed issues, it has the potential to climb up to a more impressive rating. As it stands, I give the app three stars."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Write an article based on this \\"Germany's Bayer has raised its offer for Monsanto to 65bn (£49bn), or 127.50 a share, in a bid to create a global seeds and pesticides giant.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Bayer Increases Offer for Monsanto to 65 Billion, Aiming to Create Global Agricultural Powerhouse Following a series of negotiations, German pharmaceutical and chemical juggernaut Bayer has upped its bid for American seed and pesticide corporation Monsanto to an astounding 65 billion (£49 billion), equivalent to 127.50 a share. This strategic move serves to establish a worldwide agrochemical empire that could significantly transform agriculture on a global scale.  Step 1: Begin with an introduction that outlines the news and its significance The world of agribusiness and crop biotechnology is on the verge of a tectonic shift, as Germany's Bayer announced its higher offer for US-based Monsanto, valuing the company at 65 billion. This announcement comes amidst an increasing wave of consolidation in the agricultural industry, with major players seeking to join forces and capture a greater market share. Bayer's acquisition of Monsanto, if successful, will propel the combined group firmly to the forefront of the global seeds and pesticide business. Step 2: Detail the history of the deal between Bayer and Monsanto In their quest to dominate the international agricultural market, Bayer has upped the ante by increasing its previous offer of 125 per share to 127.50 a share, which represents a total value of 65 billion. This latest development follows months of negotiations, during which time both companies explored the possibility of an all-cash transaction. With this new proposal on the table, Bayer has shown its determination to successfully secure the deal and establish a thriving partnership with Monsanto. Step 3: Explain the implications of the deal for the global agriculture industry The potential merger between Bayer and Monsanto is projected to create an unparalleled seeds and pesticides giant, with an estimated annual revenue exceeding 25 billion. This new enterprise could dramatically transform agricultural practices worldwide, as the combined entity would possess a significant market share and an extensive portfolio of products that include herbicides, insecticides, and genetically modified seeds. This strong position would enable the merged company to exercise considerable influence over agricultural policy and practices, fostering the adoption of new technologies and the implementation of vertically integrated approaches to farming. Step 4: Address potential concerns regarding the merger While the prospect of a unified Bayer-Monsanto powerhouse may seem appealing to investors, there are concerns that such a colossal agribusiness combination could lead to monopolistic practices, reduced competition, and increased prices for farmers. Industry critics argue that the consolidation of the agrochemical market may limit farmers' choice of suppliers and hinder innovation in the sector. It is crucial that regulatory authorities closely examine the implications of this merger, ensuring that it is in line with antitrust regulations and promoting an environment that fosters fairness, transparency, and growth. Step 5: Conclude with a summary and outlook for the future In conclusion, as Bayer raises its offer for Monsanto to an impressive 65 billion, the agricultural landscape is set for a significant metamorphosis. Should the deal come to fruition, the combined entity could reign supreme as a global seeds and pesticides colossus, wielding consequential influence over the future direction of agriculture. The road ahead, however, is laden with uncertainty, as regulatory and public scrutiny will play a vital role in determining the implications of this merger, and ultimately, its success or failure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: Who kidnaps Elizabeth? Movie title: Young Sherlock Holmes Movie plot: The film opens in late 19th century London one evening. A hooded figure raises a blowpipe and shoots a dart into an older businessman named Bentley Bobster (Patrick Newell) outside a restaurant. He shakes the sting off thinking it an insect. After ordering dinner, however, he suffers a terrifying hallucination in which his dinner, a roasted bird, attacks him. He shakes this off, and returns to his third-floor flat. Another hallucination appears, however, leading him to believe that his apartment is on fire. He throws himself out the window and is killed when he hits the ground in an apparent suicide. The credits roll.The scene switches to a boy's school in London were the teenage John Watson (Alan Cox) is a new student at the Brompton Academy. As he moves into the dorm he finds the next bunk over is occupied by the teenage Sherlock Holmes (Nicholas Rowe). The two become friends and Holmes introduces Watson to Professor Waxflatter (Nigel Stock), a retired teacher with rooms and a laboratory in the school's attic. Waxflatter is bit of a mad inventor who is constantly testing a human-powered flying machine. Holmes also introduces Watson to Elizabeth (Sophie Ward), Waxflatter's teenage niece who shares his rooms and has a budding romantic relationship with Holmes.As we follow Holmes and Watson we see them attend a fencing class. The teacher, Professor Rathe (Anthony Higgins), chooses Holmes as his opponent in a demonstration match. Though Holmes does well, Rathe eventually defeats him. Rathe complements Holmes on the match, but warns him that he lets his emotions get the best of him and it leads him to make rash moves and ultimately lose.We see a second attack take place: The hooded figure enters a church and shoots a dart into the sole occupant, the Reverend Duncan Nesbitt (Donald Eccles). The reverend hallucinates that the stained glass figure of a knight jumps from its window and chases him down the aisle. He runs through the front doors and out into the street where he is run over by a horse-drawn carriage... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Young Sherlock Holmes,\\" the person responsible for kidnapping Elizabeth is not explicitly mentioned in the provided plot summary. However, it's reasonable to assume that the main antagonist or one of his henchmen might be behind the kidnapping, as this would create a conflict for the main characters and further drive the plot. From the given plot, it appears that the main antagonist is the hooded figure who has been causing people to hallucinate and ultimately meet their demise. This person utilizes a blowpipe and darts to induce terrifying hallucinations in their victims, which has led to the deaths of Bentley Bobster and the Reverend Duncan Nesbitt. As the movie focuses on the teenage Sherlock Holmes and his new-found friendship with John Watson, it is highly likely that the duo will work together to solve the mystery surrounding these hallucination-induced deaths. The kidnapping of Elizabeth, who has a budding romantic relationship with Holmes and is the niece of Professor Waxflatter, would serve as a strong motivation for both Holmes and Watson to find the kidnapper and uncover his motives. Considering Elizabeth's close relationship with Sherlock Holmes and given that the main antagonist appears to be targeting prominent individuals in society, it is probable that the hooded figure or one of his associates is responsible for her abduction. Holmes and Watson's investigation will likely lead them to unveil the true identity of this hooded figure and their connection to the victims. They will also need to race against time to save Elizabeth and prevent further harm from befalling London. As they delve deeper into the case, the duo may uncover a much wider conspiracy at play, potentially involving some of the other characters like Professor Rathe, who have been introduced in the plot. In conclusion, although the kidnapper of Elizabeth is not explicitly mentioned in the provided plot, the hooded figure or one of his henchmen is the most likely suspect given the overall storyline. The adventures of Young Sherlock Holmes and John Watson as they try to save Elizabeth and uncover the mystery behind the hallucination-inducing darts will propel the film's plot forward, making for an exciting and engaging movie experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When an animal is woken up during hibernation, it can disrupt the carefully maintained physiological state that conserves energy and resources. The sudden arousal would require the animal to use up stored energy to increase its heart rate, breathing, and body temperature. This could potentially deplete the animal's energy reserves, making it difficult for it to survive the rest of the hibernation period.

Summarize this article: In a 12-minute exchange last year, one disapproving shareholder gave Rupert Murdoch, the company’s chairman and chief executive, a copy of “Man Bites Murdoch,” an autobiographical book about an editor’s clashes with the media giant, and asked if he would be attending the comedian Jon Stewart’s “Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear” in Washington. Mr. Murdoch said he would be in Australia.      But that incident might seem tame once this year’s meeting ends Friday afternoon in Los Angeles. The gathering is expected to be the company’s most contentious in years, with frustrated shareholders taking the microphone to demand accountability after a phone-hacking scandal in Britain that has embarrassed the company.      Investors will also have the chance to vote on the company’s board members, including Mr. Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan. While the family’s 40 percent stake virtually guarantees they will be re-elected, the chorus of discontent has put the company in an uncustomary defensive position.      The most forceful, and potentially most ominous protest is likely to come from Tom Watson, the British Labour Party legislator who has led the investigation into phone-hacking at News Corporation’s British newspaper unit. Mr. Watson, who acquired nonvoting proxy shareholder status to attend the meeting, said he planned to accuse the company of engaging in further criminal wrongdoing involving surveillance techniques that extend beyond the phone hacking. He did not discuss potential evidence.      “A lot of institutional investors do not know the scope nor the implications of what’s happening in the U.K.,” Mr. Watson said in a phone interview. “You can delegate power but not responsibility, and Rupert Murdoch for whatever reason has failed to put in corporate governance arrangements that prohibit crimes from being committed.”      A News Corporation spokeswoman, Teri Everett, declined to comment.      The company has done its part to carefully orchestrate the gathering. For the first time, News Corporation, citing security concerns, has made attendees register and R.S.V.P. before the event. Rather than holding the meeting at its usual venue, the Hudson Theater in New York, it will take place at the 476-seat Darryl F. Zanuck Theater on the gilded Art Deco-style Fox Studios lot near Beverly Hills, Calif.      News Corporation said attendance would be similar to previous years and that it was not uncommon for companies to change locations for annual meetings. The Los Angeles venue was chosen because the company’s entertainment division, which makes shows like “Modern Family” and movies like “Avatar,” is a major contributor to its financial growth, News Corporation said.      Some shareholders will get up to 15 minutes to speak directly to Mr. Murdoch, according to people who have attended previous meetings. “That can be a pretty long 15 minutes,” said Digby Gilmour, head of telecommunications and media research at C.L.S.A. Australia.      Stephen Mayne, a director at the Australian Shareholders’ Association, and the person who presented Mr. Murdoch with the book last year, said he planned to travel from Sydney to attend. A former News Corporation employee and longtime shareholder, Mr. Mayne has attended 12 annual meetings.      Mr. Murdoch has in recent years grown increasingly impatient with shareholder speeches, Mr. Mayne said. “I got 40 minutes of back and forth in 1999,” he said, adding: “But he’s gotten a lot tougher as he’s gotten older.”      Mr. Mayne’s advice for shareholders standing up to confront Mr. Murdoch? “He’ll shut you down. You’ve got to be quick and polite but firm at the same time.”      Any dissent will largely be symbolic. Mr. Murdoch owns nearly 40 percent of voting shares, and 7 percent belong to Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who has expressed his support for the board. As many as 30 percent of shareholders are expected to cast votes against Murdoch family members, several analysts estimated. Shareholder activists will dominate the meeting, since large institutional investors do not typically air grievances in such a public forum, analysts said. “There will be a lot of noise, but at the end, not a lot of change,” Mr. Gilmour said.      The meetings typically begin with Mr. Murdoch opening the floor to questions, Mr. Mayne said. At the end of the exchanges, he gives a state-of-the-company address. That talk could become a more prominent part of the presentation as Mr. Murdoch lays out the shareholder-friendly actions News Corporation has recently taken, said a Deutsche Bank Securities analyst, Doug Mitchelson.      One of them is a 5 billion stock buyback program currently under way, which has countered some investors’ concerns about News Corporation’s decision in July to withdraw its 12 billion bid for the British Sky Broadcasting Group. Chase Carey, chief operating officer, has said he would pursue additional stock buybacks on top of the 5 billion program. “As much as we thought Sky was a good deal, buying back stock is a better deal,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura Securities.      Company executives are sure to point out on Friday that even as most media companies struggle, News Corporation shares are up about 14 percent with a 52-week high of 18.35. The stock closed at 17.05 on Thursday.      Last year, before the revelations of widespread phone-hacking, Mr. Mayne questioned Mr. Murdoch about allegations of hacking in 2006 involving two News of the World journalists, Clive Goodman and Andy Coulson.      “There has been two parliamentary inquiries, which have found no further evidence or any other thing at all,” Mr. Murdoch responded, according to a transcript. “If anything was to come to light, we challenge people to give us evidence, and no one has been able to do so.”      In the end, the meeting will most likely give a platform to critics of the company’s corporate governance and not be a referendum on its financial performance. ||||| Tom Watson, the Labour MP who has been a leading figure in parliament's investigation into the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, plans to make dramatic allegations about News Corporation's use of surveillance at the company's annual shareholder meeting.      Watson, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport committee which has investigated the scandal, said he would be giving News Corp's shareholders details of previously undisclosed surveillance methods used by the firm that were technologically quite distinct from the phone hacking carried out by NoW staff. He refused to go into details about the allegations he would be making or to offer any evidence to corroborate them.      He said: \\"I want to leave investors in no doubt that News Corporation is not through the worst of this yet and there are more questions for the Murdochs to answer.\\"      Watson has flown to Los Angeles to attend the shareholders meeting, which he will gain access to having been given a proxy vote by the US trade union umbrella group, the AFL-CIO. News Corporation is bracing itself for independent shareholders to vote in considerable numbers at the meeting against the reappointment of Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.      The scale of the protest outside the Murdoch family is expected to be substantially over 20% of independent shareholders, with several expected to raise questions at the meeting at Fox studios. But their protest will not be enough to topple the family, because Rupert Murdoch controls 40% of the voting shares.      Nevertheless, before the meeting there were clear signs of tension at the upper levels of News Corp, with particular emphasis on security at the event and worries about what sort of tone the 80-year-old media mogul will strike in front of those who, alongside him, have a stake in the empire he built.      Murdoch's opening address is expected to show less of the contrition than in London in July, when he told MPs: \\"This the most humble day of my life.\\" Instead he is expected to strike a more combative tone, although there are worries that this will alienate some investors and outsiders.      The language is understood to reflect the sentiments expressed 10 days ago in a stock exchange filing in which News Corp, in response to the growing army of concerned shareholders, accused its critics of having a \\"disproportionate focus on the News of the World matter\\" which was in turn \\"misguided\\".      That approach has unsettled some in the company who believe there is a risk that Murdoch's rhetorical defiance will play badly.      Murdoch is frustrated that for all the considerable political and legal problems News Corp faces, the company continues to perform well, with operating profits up by 12% by almost 5bn (£3.2bn), after legal costs, helped by the box office success of the film Rio and the continued growth of US TV channels such as Fox News. Set against that is the £20m settlement fund promised to phone-hacking victims.      There was an unwelcome reminder of the difficulties in the print sector with a separate announcement that News Corp would cut 150 editorial posts at the loss-making Times and Sunday Times, through compulsory and voluntary redundancies and cuts to casual staff. A critical indicator in LA will be whether more than half of the non-family shareholders will vote against the reappointment of the Murdochs. The family is likely to receive support from the Saudi investor Prince Alwaleed – whose Kingdom Holdings has a further 7% of the voting shares and who is close to James Murdoch.      News Corp expects something of a circus at the event, with shareholders and press being bused into the venue - which the company says is aimed to \\"ease the security issues of getting onto a studio lot\\".      Watson joins some of the most critical investors, such as Calpers, which manages money for California's public employees. News Corp chose to hold the meeting in LA, rather than New York where the business has its headquarters, in the hope that it would reduce the attendance of critical fund managers.      Calpers is particularly unhappy with the two-tier voting structure, – which it calls a \\"corruption of the governance system\\" which means that about a third of News Corp shares have voting rights.      The Murdochs control 40% of the votes by owning about 12% of all shares..      In the runup to the meeting, News Corp has had to endure growing speculation about rifts at the top of the company. with the New York Times reporting several disputes between Rupert and his heir apparent James, and even talk that James, the deputy chief operating officer, had briefly considered stepping down. But despite Rupert's advancing years, and the pressure mounting on James as the phone-hacking crisis continues, neither is prepared, nor will they be forced, to step aside as a result of tomorrow's meeting. |||||","output":"News Corporation's annual shareholder meeting is expected to be highly contentious as frustrated shareholders demand accountability after the phone-hacking scandal in Britain.

Here is an article: Ohio high school senior Ryan Chester became the inaugural winner of a new college scholarship on Sunday night, winning 250,000 for his 7-minute film that uses simple props and hand-drawn graphics to explain Einstein’s special theory of relativity. Besides winning that money for himself, Chester also won 100,000 for a new science lab at his school in the Cleveland suburbs, North Royalton High, and 50,000 for his physics teacher, Richard Nestoff. “This is awesome,” Chester, 18, said in an interview Monday, the day after he accepted the award. The scholarship means he can apply to a bunch of colleges he hadn’t considered before because of their cost, he said: “A ton of possibilities are open. Before, I was worried about graduating with debt, and I don’t have to worry about that now,” he said. The scholarship is the newest award in the family of Breakthrough Prizes, which are meant to celebrate the importance of science and recognize brilliance in the fields of math, biology and physics. Founded three years ago by Silicon Valley giants, including Google’s Sergey Brin and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, the Breakthrough Prize offers awards ranging from 100,000 for promising early-career achievements to 3 million for scientists who have made fundamental discoveries about the world. The Breakthrough Junior Challenge asked young people between ages 13 and 18 to create short videos that communicated a big idea in science. More than 2,000 students from dozens of countries applied. Zuckerberg’s wife and partner in education philanthropy, Priscilla Chan, presented the award to Chester in an Oscar-style presentation that was broadcast live Sunday night on the National Geographic Channel. “With the Breakthrough Prize and Junior Challenge, we want to inspire more young people to study science and math, and pursue careers that change all our lives,” Chan said in a statement. Chester’s film takes on one of the biggest ideas in science, Einstein’s theory of relativity. With cartoonish graphics drawn by hand and props from everyday life, like a bowl of popcorn and a moving minivan, Chester explains what Einstein’s famous theory is all about — and why it means that people traveling close to the speed of light age slowly compared to people on Earth. “This is the kind of thing that we’re exposed to all the time in pop culture and films and science shows on TV, but in the video I use physical demonstrations that anyone can think through to have it make sense,” Chester said in an interview posted online. In an interview with The Washington Post on Monday, Chester said the challenge was a chance for him to marry science and film-making, two of his passions. He plans to major in film in college, and perhaps minor in engineering. “I’ve been making movies for over 10 years now. You wouldn’t believe how much film-making equipment I have in my basement,” he said. “You can make movies about anything. It never gets old, you’re always learning something new, you’re always making something unique.” Chester could have chosen any teacher to benefit from his prize. He chose Nestoff, his A.P. Physics teacher, because he is inspiring. “He’s a great teacher. He’s different than any teacher I’ve had — he’s not really afraid to say anything or do anything as long as it makes class more entertaining and helps teach what he’s teaching,” Chester said. “Every day in physics class, you never know what to expect, and that’s an exciting way to learn science.” Nestoff said Chester is an outstanding student, not just because of his ability to understand complex physics concepts or his impressive ACT scores, but because of the easy way he gets along with — and often helps — his classmates. “Ryan is the perfect person to be involved in something like,” Nestoff said in an interview. “He’s such a well-rounded kid. He’s so pleasant.” Nestoff said Monday morning that he was “still on cloud nine” after the awards ceremony, made surreal by the number of Silicon Valley celebrities and great scientific minds in attendance. He said he isn’t sure what he’ll do with the 50,000 prize. He doesn’t want to just throw it into his retirement fund or buy a car, he said. He wants to do something special — maybe start taking some interesting vacations after spending many summers teaching at various camps. But while the money turns heads, he said, what means more to him is the fact that his student appreciates him. “The fact that he thinks a lot of me, that’s the part that’s very gratifying,” Nestoff said. “Do I deserve it? “I don’t think so. But I’m glad he thinks so.” Emma Brown writes about national education and about people with a stake in schools, including teachers, parents and kids.

My then-teenage daughter and I went to a new restaurant. It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance! Question: What is probably true about the restaraunt manager? === The answer to the above question is","output":"that the restaurant manager was likely inexperienced, disorganized, and unable to manage the restaurant effectively. There are several factors that point towards this conclusion: 1. Lack of staff: The restaurant was empty except for the manager, and the lone waitress arrived late and had to change clothes in the restroom. This indicates poor management, as there should have been enough staff to take care of customers efficiently. 2. Poor customer service: The manager told you to find your own table, and it took 10 minutes for any staff member to even check on you. A well-managed restaurant would have had someone to greet and seat you promptly. 3. Misuse of space: The manager reserved the attractive stage-like area, then asked you to move from your table even though the special group did not show up during your visit. This shows a lack of foresight and poor decision-making, as the table could have accommodated your party. 4. Inability to handle problems: The manager did not offer any apology or solution when it was clear that your experience was less than satisfactory. A competent manager would have acknowledged the issues and tried to rectify the situation in some way. 5. Slow service: It took too long to receive your order even after your late waitress eventually took it. This further indicates poor management and disorganization on the part of the restaurant. 6. Ultimately, the restaurant's closure within a month indicates that these problems were not isolated incidents, but rather symptomatic of larger issues within the establishment. The poor customer experience and management evidently led to its financial failure, pointing towards an overall lack of effective oversight and management by the restaurant manager. In summary, the restaurant manager was probably inexperienced, disorganized, and unable to provide customers with a satisfactory dining experience. The combination of long wait times, inadequate staffing, and poor decision-making contributed to the restaurant's rapid closure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's an example to show how honorable actions create happiness. Say a store clerk fails to charge us for an item.If we keep silent,and profit from the clerk's mistake,we would drive home with a sense of sneaky   excitement.Later we might tell our family or friends about our good fortune.On the other hand,if we tell the clerk about the uncharged item,the clerk would be grateful and thank us for our honesty.We would leave the store with a quiet sense of honor that we might never share with another soul. Then,what is it to do with our sense of happiness? In the first case,where we don't tell the clerk,a couple of things would happen.Deep down inside we would know ourselves as a type of thief.In the process,we would lose some peace of  mind  and  selfrespect.We  would also demonstrate that we cannot be trusted,since we advertise our dishonor by telling our family and friends.We damage our own reputations by telling others.In contrast, _ causes  different  things  to happen.Immediately the clerk knows us to be honorable.Upon leaving the store,we feel honorable and our selfrespect is increased.Whenever we take honorable actions we gain the deep internal rewards of goodness and a sense of nobility. There is a beautiful positive cycle that is created by living a life of honorable actions.Honorable  thoughts lead  to honorable actions.Honorable actions lead us to a happier existence.And it's easy to think and act honorably again when we're happy.While the positive cycle can be difficult to start,once it's started,it's easy to continue.Keeping on doing good deeds brings us peace of mind,which is important for our happiness. How will we feel if we let the clerk know the mistake? A) We'll be very excited. B) We'll feel unfortunate. C) We'll have a sense of honor. D) We'll feel sorry for the clerk. The answer is:","output":"C) We'll have a sense of honor. In this situation, choosing to inform the store clerk about the uncharged item reflects an honorable action.

The given list is: [160, 171, 147, 167, 154, 223, 297, 69, 168, 152, 96, 224, 24, 263, 283, 31, 162, 87, 111, 12] and k = 20. First, we start by defining the problem. Given an unsorted list of integers and an integer k, we want to find the kth smallest element in the list. The approach to find the kth smallest element is by sorting the list of integers in ascending order, so the smallest elements come first. After sorting the given list, we get: [12, 24, 31, 69, 87, 96, 111, 147, 152, 154, 160, 162, 167, 168, 171, 223, 224, 263, 283, 297] Now that we have the sorted list, we can find the kth smallest element by simply returning the integer at position k-1 in the sorted list. In this case, k = 20, so the 20th smallest element is at the position 20-1 = 19. Therefore, the answer is the integer at position 19 in our sorted list, which is 297. So, the 20th smallest element in the list is 297."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

A Vote for the East Village Last summer the building was sold. Ms. Gang, a 2001 graduate of New York University, was suddenly faced with a rent increase to 2,900 a month from 1,400, as well as construction noise as the new owners undertook renovations. The need to move, she said, constituted “my own New York sob story, but it was good because it motivated me.” Ms. Gang, 33, is a jazz singer with a standing Wednesday-night gig at the Plaza. She had received an inheritance from her grandparents, and knew it was prudent to spend the money on a home. “My grandparents saved for the express purpose of creating a better quality of life for their children,” she said. “I am remarkably lucky.” Her budget for an apartment, preferably in a prewar walk-up co-op building, topped out at 500,000. Having spent several years in drizzly London, she also wanted a high floor, for the light. “I thought I was the only person crazy enough to enjoy walking up” so many flights, she said. She was in the habit, however, of limiting grocery purchases so she wouldn’t have to carry too much at once. She knew she could get more space for the money in Morningside Heights than in the East Village. The neighborhood felt more adult, too. “The musicians that I know who live on the Upper West Side are much more mature,” she said. “They have families, they have kids, they have strollers, they go shopping at Fairway.” Ms. Gang e-mailed an inquiry to an agent who had a listing for a large studio on the top floor of a co-op on West 109th Street. The price was 425,000; maintenance was in the mid-700s. She was delighted when the agent turned out to be Nina Hennessey of Halstead Property, the wife of a drummer she knew. That studio was already in contract, so Ms. Hennessey showed Ms. Gang another top-floor place — not a walk-up — on the 20th floor of a 1988 condominium tower at the northwest corner of Central Park. The asking price was 469,000; monthly charges were around 800. “The views meant a lot to her,” Ms. Hennessey said. True. But the building was the wrong kind. The neighborhood — with Central Park in one direction and a gas station in another — felt isolated and dull. Ms. Gang realized she did not want to leave the East Village after all: “I walk down the street and see people I know, which is awesome and it made me feel I was part of a community, and I didn’t want to leave that.” Or as Ms. Hennessey put it, “She wasn’t going to feel at home anywhere else.” Now the hunt focused on the slice between 14th and Houston Streets. Many places Ms. Gang saw were in disrepair, but she loved a small studio on East 12th. It was on the top floor of a sixth-floor walk-up, with a pretty brick wall and a beamed ceiling. The listing price was 297,000, with monthly maintenance in the mid 300s. But with inventory low, Ms. Hennessey said, “the little postage stamp of an apartment went to multiple bids.” Ms. Gang’s offer of 306,000 was rejected. The apartment sold for 336,000. Ms. Gang also loved a one-bedroom on the fifth floor of a walk-up on East 11th. The place was listed for 550,000, with monthly maintenance in the high 600s. But if she spent so much money, Ms. Hennessey pointed out, “she wouldn’t have the assets-after-closing picture that is attractive to co-op boards.” In any event, Ms. Gang’s offer of 515,000 was declined. She was disappointed. “That’s what you get when you start looking outside of your price range,” she said. “Don’t do it.” She ignored her own advice when it came to another fifth- and top-floor co-op on East Fourth Street. Two apartments had been beautifully combined into a three-bedroom. “It was an embarrassment of riches,” Ms. Gang said. “I’d never seen anything like it.” She thought the price — 550,000, with maintenance of 700 — was low for the apartment’s size. But the block made the decision for her: she found it unprepossessing, and moved on. Finally, she visited a spacious four-room apartment in a six-story walk-up co-op building on East Second Street. It was on a low floor but had a roof deck, “so I could still walk up if I chose to,” she said. The asking price was 432,000, with monthly maintenance in the low 200s. Ms. Gang decided to go for it, and bought the place for 420,000 in cash. She and her cat, Jezebel, arrived this winter. She is aware of being surrounded by neighbors now that she no longer lives on the top floor. She rents rehearsal space elsewhere, so she doesn’t make noise. Lacking as much light she might like, she treks to the roof every day, even in the cold, for at least some time in the sun. Though her apartment is spacious, it has no closets, and Ms. Gang’s work wardrobe includes floor-length gowns. “When I was looking at apartments with closets,” she said, “that was something I would consider. Could I fit all my dresses?” Now the question is moot. She bought a portable hanging rack. The difference between renting and owning? As an owner, “you will be stopped in the hallway by your neighbors,” she said. “They will say, ‘You want to see how I did mine?’ and invite you into their apartment, which I love.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article tells the story of Ms. Gang, a jazz singer, who faced a substantial rent increase and decided to use an inheritance from her grandparents to purchase a home in New York City. She initially considered Morningside Heights for more space and a more mature atmosphere, but eventually realized she did not want to leave the East Village and its sense of community. After several rejected offers and disappointments, Ms. Gang purchased a spacious four-room apartment in a walk-up co-op building on East Second Street for 420,000 in cash. She now enjoys her new apartment, getting to know her neighbors, and visiting the shared roof deck for sunlight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The reviewer expresses disappointment with the lack of Strong's Hebrew and Greek dictionaries in the NIV Bible and shares their intention to return it in favor of the NAS version, which includes the desired features. The review begins by acknowledging a positive aspect of the product, stating that the NIV is a \\"wonderful Bible for better understanding.\\" However, the central issue raised by the reviewer is that they want their children to access the original words in Hebrew and Greek for a comprehensive understanding and truth in the scripture. Unfortunately, the NIV Bible lacks the Strong's dictionaries, having instead Kohlenberger's version, which is not as detailed, according to the reviewer. The dissatisfaction about the lack of detail in the included dictionaries overshadows any positive points made earlier in the review, leading the reviewer to decide to send the Bible back and purchase a different edition: the NAS (most literal translation) with Strong's Hebrew and Greek Keyword dictionaries. Overall, while there is some praise for the NIV's better understanding, the primary focus of the review is on the disappointment experienced due to the absence of Strong's dictionaries. The fact that the reviewer plans to return the product and purchase a different version demonstrates that their dissatisfaction is significant, ultimately creating an unflattering portrayal of the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is known for his contributions to the fields of cosmology   and quantum gravity , especially in the context of black holes. He experienced extreme difficulties and obstacles in his life, which only made him stronger. Finally he contributed much to the careers he devoted to and became one of the most famous scientists in the world. Hawking was outstanding in his school life. After a successful period of education at St. Albans School, the entrance of Oxford opened to him. In March 1959, at the age of 17, Hawking took the scholarship examination with the aim of studying natural sciences at Oxford. Then Hawking went to Cambridge to do research in cosmology. When Stephen Hawking was dreaming about his future, he faced extreme difficulties and obstacles. Symptoms of disorder first appeared while he was enrolled at Cambridge; he lost his balance and fell down a flight of stairs, hitting his head. The diagnosis   of motor neuron  disease came when Hawking was 21, shortly before his first marriage, and doctors said he would not survive more than two or three years. Hawking gradually lost the use of his arms, legs, and voice, and is now almost completely paralyzed . Despite his disease, he describes himself as \\"lucky\\" --- not only has time to make influential discoveries, but also has, in his own words, \\"a very attractive family\\". As someone has said, when we meet frustration, someone fights, someone cries, someone escapes, someone tries. Hawking succeeds because he tries. Question: What's the main idea of the passage?

Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday.

They adopted an activity curriculum  consisting of running,climbing,swimming and flying.To make it easier to manage the curriculum,all the animals took all the subjects. The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed  feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck. The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a \\"Charlie horse\\" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running.

(March 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Skeeter Bronson (Adam Sandler) is a hotel handyman who was promised by his father, Marty Bronson (Jonathan Pryce), to be the manager of the family hotel. A mysophobe named Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths) agreed to keep that promise when the Bronson family sold their hotel to himâthen built a new hotel instead. Thirty years later, when the story begins, Skeeter is the hotel's handyman while management is held by Kendall (Guy Pearce). Barry's new hotel, the Sunny Vista Nottingham Hotel, is a hit, but he's got plans to build an even more elaborate hotel, one designed around a theme that he's keeping secret. Skeeter's sister and principal of Webster Elementary School, Wendy (Courteney Cox), asks Skeeter to watch her kids, Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) and Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit), while she goes out of town.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: If you really want to go green, here's good news: eating green is good for you. The very foods with a high carbon cost---meat, pork, dairy products, processed snacks---also tend to be filled with fat and calories. A green diet would be mostly vegetables and fruits, whole grains, fish and lean meats like chicken---a diet that's eco- and waistline-friendly. Eating green can be healthier and beneficial to the climate. It may be hard to believe that a meal at McDonald's produces more carbon than your trip to a far away place. More than 37% of the world's land is used for agriculture, much of which was once forested. Deforestation   is a major source of carbon. The fertilizer   and machinery needed on a modern farm also have a large carbon footprint, as does the network of ships and trucks that brings the food from the farm to your plate. The most efficient way to reduce the carbon footprint of your menu is to eat less meat, especially beef. Raising cattle takes a lot more energy than growing the equivalent   amount of grains, fruits or vegetables. What's more, the majority of cattle in the U.S. are fed on grain and loads of it---670 million tons in 2002---and the fertilizer used to feed that creates separate environmental problems. Focus on eating lower on the food chain, with more plants and fruits and less meat and dairy. It's simple. We can change today what goes into our bodies for the health of our planet and ourselves. A:","output":"Which of the following statements is true about adopting a green diet according to the article? A) A green diet is high in meat, pork, and dairy products. B) Eating green mainly consists of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and lean meats like chicken, which is beneficial for both health and the environment. C) Raising cattle for meat has a lower carbon footprint compared to growing grains, fruits, or vegetables.

Article: Have you seen a historical film recently? Do you think it was accurate? Some say that there is no such thing as a historical film. In many cases, Hollywood film-makers simply change the facts. Just look at these supposedly \\"historical\\" films. 1. The Patriot The film was released in 2000 and was directed by Ronald Emmerish and starred Mel Gibson. It is set near Charleston, South Carolina, during the American Revolutionary War(1775--1783) and follows the story of Benjamin Martin and his fight for American freedom against the British. The film was criticized for inventing and exaggerating British cruelty. The most criticized scene was one showing the burning of a church containing people of the town, of which there is no historical record. Another historical inaccuracy was the description of American-owned slaves being freed to serve with the American forces. In reality, many slaves ran away from their American owners and fought with the British against the Americans. 2. Brave Heart The film(1995) starred Mel Gibson was directed by Toby Reisz. It is based on the life of Scottish national hero William Wallace and his fight against English rule in Scotland during the 13th century. The film includes an affair between William Wallace and Princess Isabella (based on Isabella of France). The film implies she is a mother-to-be when William Wallace will be killed. However, historically, the real Isabella was a child of nine still living in France at this time, never having met Wallace. The film also caused controversy because of its anti-English nature. Apparently, when the film was shown in Glasgow, there was a loud noise made by happy American audience. 3. U-571 This 2000 film was directed by Jonathan Mostow and starred Mathew MacConaughey, Havey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi. It took place during the Second World War(1939--1945). In the film, a German submarine(warship underwater) is boarded in 1942 by American soldiers who made themselves up as Germans. They took away the German submarine's code-language machine, which,...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? James Watt  (30 January 1736 (19 January 1736 OS) - 25 August 1819) was a Scottish inventor, mechanical engineer, and chemist who improved on Thomas Newcomen's 1712 Newcomen steam engine with his Watt steam engine in 1781, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world. While working as an instrument maker at the University of Glasgow, Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines. He realised that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder. Watt introduced a design enhancement, the separate condenser, which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of steam engines. From an early age Watt was very interested in chemistry. In late 1786, while in Paris, he witnessed an experiment by Berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. He had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles, and had published his findings, which aroused great interest among many potential rivals. When Watt returned to Britain, he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process. He discovered that a mixture of salt, manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine, which Watt believed might be a cheaper method. He passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali, and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties. He soon communicated these results to James McGrigor, his father-in-law, who was a bleacher in Glasgow. Otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret.  With McGrigor and his wife Annie, he started to scale up the process, and in March 1788, McGrigor was able to bleach 1500 yards of cloth to his satisfaction. About this time Berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process, and published it so it became public knowledge. Many others began to experiment with improving the process, which still had many shortcomings, not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product. Watt's rivals soon overtook him in developing the process, and he dropped out of the race. It was not until 1799, when Charles Tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) that it became a commercial success.  By 1794 Watt had been chosen by Thomas Beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce, clean and store gases for use in the new Pneumatic Institution at Hotwells in Bristol. Watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years, but by 1797 the medical uses for the \\"factitious airs\\" had come to a dead end.

Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Great for a SHORT TERM replacement... Review: I bought this to replace my 'falling apart' original charger. Worked like a charm for 3 months, then I found my computer dying on me. The charging signal would change frequently from charging to not etc.. I ordered a new battery, as i thought it was on its way out. I downloaded coconutbattery, and that explained all i needed it to. It showed the charger as connected, BUT not charging. I scrounged up my old charger, hooked it up, and sure enough, connected AND charging. It is without a doubt the macally charger. So i recommend it if you only plan on using it for 3 months or less. So not only am I out a charger, i ordered a battery for no reason. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is negative. The customer purchased the charger as a short-term replacement, but it caused more problems than it solved according to the user's experience. This led to the users express disappointment and dissatisfaction, which indicates a negative tone. They even ended up ordering a new battery mistakenly believing the old one was the issue.

Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl.

Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier.

Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays.

Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

Please answer the following question: One of the more surprising objects in the Getty Villa’s newly reinstalled gallery of later Roman sculpture is a marble bust of a youth leaning out of a circular frame, mounted high on the gallery wall. J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display. Bringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask—and answer—several questions about it. Who—if anyone—does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history. In its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object’s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation. In early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display. After the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity. To answer our next question of who the tondo represents, we then had to take a... Where was the marble portrait first displayed?

Article: Gauri Nanda sees a wearable computer as a handbag -- one that's built out of four-inch squares and triangles of fiber, with tiny computer chips embedded   in it. It looks, feels and weighs like your typical leather purse. That's where similarities end: This bag can wirelessly keep track of your belongings and remind you, just as you're about to leave the house, to take your wallet. It can review the weather report and suggest that you grab an umbrella. This purse can even upload your favorite songs onto your scarf. Sure, a computing purse and scarf set may seem like the stuff of science fiction. But these devices, part of next generation of wearable computers, could become commonplace within a few years. DuPont created new super strong fibers that can conduct electricity and can be woven into ordinary-looking clothes. And the chipmaker developed chip packaging allowing wearable computers to be washed, even in the heavy-duty cycle. As a result, these new wearable devices are different from the heavy and downright silly versions of the recent past, which often required users to be wrapped in wires and type on their stomachs. Unlike their predecessors, these new wearable computers also make economic sense. When her bag becomes commercially available in two to three years, Nanda expects it will cost around 150, which is the price of an average leather purse. Here's how the bag works: You place a special radio-signal-transmitting chip on to your wallet. A similar radio in your purse picks up the signal and notifies you that you've forgotten to take your wallet. In turn, sensors on your purse's handles will notify the computer that you've picked up the purse and are ready to go.  _ Indeed, more people will want to cross that bridge in the coming years -- making for a booming market for wearable computers that don't like something out of science fiction.

All the while, I feel the weight of a million envelopes raining down on my head until my grandmother calls me and wants to know how I am. \\"I am overcome by too many tasks,\\" I say. \\"Honey, you just take it bit by bit,\\" she says, and she reminds me about the green beans. When I was a little kid I hated green beans. But my mom said I couldn't leave the table until I ate ten green beans. All alone at the table, I stared at the green beans for what seemed like hours. It was a mountain of green beans. I couldn't do it. My grandma came to me and asked if I could eat one green bean. \\"But Grandma, I have to eat ten!\\" She said all I had to do was to eat one green bean. One tiny little green bean. So I ate one. It was bad, but not as bad as I'd thought it would be. Then she asked me again if I could eat one. So I ate one green bean nine more times. My grandma doesn't know about the envelopes, but she tells me anyone can do one thing every day. Back in my room, I lay down on the bed. Just like I used to do when I was a little kid, I hang my head down to look at the pile of envelopes. There it is. But instead of a monster, I see a pile of green beans. Who's afraid of green beans?

Context: Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

During an attack one day, the maintenance man, Mr. Han, comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as an ancient kung fu master.

In this situation, Skylar might be interested in exploring these following options: A. Head to a party: If there's a party nearby and Skylar is interested in attending, this could be a viable option. Going to a party would provide Skylar with an opportunity to socialize, dance, and enjoy herself while staying within her time constraints. She could make a brief appearance, have some fun, and still be home before her curfew. B. Engage in a shorter activity: Since watching the movie is off the table, Skylar may want to engage in a different recreational activity that requires less time. This could include going to a nearby coffee shop or café, taking a walk in the park, browsing a book shop, or even just spending some time chatting with Aubrey. These activities would still allow Skylar to enjoy her time without fretting about her curfew. C. Head home early to avoid problems: Considering the potential consequences of breaking her curfew, Skylar might choose to spend the rest of her available time completing personal tasks or chores before heading home. This choice demonstrates responsibility and respect for her parents' rules, which could result in a more lenient curfew in the future or fewer restrictions on her social life. D. Reschedule the movie outing: Circumstances permitting, Skylar could suggest rescheduling the movie outing with Aubrey to a time when her curfew would not be an issue. This way, they can both enjoy the movie without worrying about the time constraints and make plans for a future date that works for both of them.

Journey is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1973, composed of former members of Santana and Frumious Bandersnatch. The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". With Cain on board, the band began writing material that would eventually lead up to Journey's biggest studio album, \\"Escape\\". Recording sessions began in April 1981, and lasted until the middle of June. Escape was released on July 31, 1981, and immediately the album became a mainstream success. The album, which has thus far sold nine times platinum, went to number one on the album charts later that year, and included three top-ten hits: \\"Who's Cryin' Now\\", \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" and \\"Open Arms\\". The last is Journey's highest-charting single to date, staying at No. 2 for six consecutive weeks and ranking at No.34 on Billboard's 1982 year-end Hot 100. MTV videotaped one of their two sold-out shows in Houston on November 6, 1981, in front of over 20,000 fans.  Capitalizing on their success, the band recorded radio commercials for Budweiser and sold rights to their likenesses and music for use in two video games: the Journey arcade game by Bally/Midway and Journey Escape by Data Age for the Atari 2600.  This success was met with criticism. The 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide gave each of the band's albums only one star, with Dave Marsh writing that \\"Journey was a dead end for San Francisco area rock.\\" Marsh later would anoint Escape as one of the worst number-one albums of all time.  Journey's next album, Frontiers (1983), continued their commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the album charts, selling nearly six million copies. The album generated four Top 40 hits, \\"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\\", which reached No. 8, \\"Faithfully\\", which reached No. 12, \\"Send Her My Love\\" and \\"After the Fall\\", both of which reached No. 23. By this time, Journey had become one of the top touring and recording bands in the world. During the subsequent stadium tour, the band contracted with NFL Films to record a video documentary of their life on the road, Frontiers and Beyond.

Given the following context:  On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820.  Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that \\"the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.\\"Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings \\"please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind.\\"Friedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period. He was also a friend of Georg Friedrich Kersting, and painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Clausen Dahl (1788–1857).

These reasons might include a lack of interest, issues with recording quality, a focus on studio albums or a decision by the band's management or record label. It's even possible that, despite the success of Live At Leeds, they did not think another live album would generate the same response.  In addition, without prior knowledge or additional information regarding The Who's tour schedule at the time, it's impossible to either confirm or deny the claim that their tour schedule was the primary factor in not producing more live albums.  For these reasons, the answer to your question would be that it's impossible to say whether The Who only produced one live album, Live at Leeds (1970), due to their tour schedule. We would need more information about The Who's situation at the time to be able to accurately determine the reasoning behind their decision."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. x = 6, equation weights = [7, 6, 5] A:","output":"The task is asking you to: 1. Take a polynomial equation represented by a list of its weights (coefficients). 2. Substitute a given value of x into the polynomial equation. 3. Calculate the result of the polynomial expression after substituting the given value of x. Here are the guidelines to solve the problem: 1. Identify the given value of x and the list of equation weights (coefficients). In this example, x = 6 and equation weights = [7, 6, 5]. 2. Write down the polynomial equation using the list of weights. Here, with the given weights, the polynomial equation is: 7x^2 + 6x + 5. 3. Substitute the given value of x (in this case, x = 6) into the polynomial equation and calculate the result. Here's how to use these guidelines step-by-step to find the answer: 1. We have x = 6 and equation weights = [7, 6, 5]. 2. The polynomial equation is: 7x^2 + 6x + 5. 3. Now, substitute x = 6 into the equation:    7(6)^2 + 6(6) + 5    = 7(36) + 36 + 5    = 252 + 36 + 5    = 293 So, the result of the polynomial expression with x = 6 and equation weights = [7, 6, 5] is 293."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system.

Arrived at Visé, Louis decided not to lay siege to Maastricht but only to occupy the surrounding forts of Tongeren, Maaseik and Valkenburg so its garrison stayed bottled up. Moving along the Rhine, Rheinberg, Wesel, Burick and Orsoy were taken. Turenne then took Nijmegen , with 4,000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and from there Fort Crèvecœur near 's-Hertogenbosch, which fell after only two days. In view of these defeats, the Dutch public panicked and rioted. Leading politicians Johan and Cornelis de Witt were lynched by an angry Orangist mob, following rumours  that they were planning the assassination of William of Nassau . On 4 July, William was acclaimed stadtholder. As the French had promised the major cities of Holland to the English, they were in no hurry to capture them. The French tried to gain sixteen million guilders from the Dutch in exchange for a separate peace. This demand and other conditions posed by the French stiffened Dutch resistance. Negotiations gave the Republic time to finish the inundations along the Dutch Water Line, started on 22 June 1672. Luxembourg laid siege to Groningen but failed to take it. An attempt was made to invade the Republic by sea; this was thwarted by Admiral Michiel de Ruyter in four strategic victories against the combined Anglo-French fleet . The first of these naval victories was the Battle of Solebay.

The sentence has a negative connotation due to the terms used within it. Here is a breakdown of the sentence and its components which contribute to its negative sentiment. 1. \\"has nothing going for it\\" - This phrase implies that the subject being discussed is lacking positive or beneficial qualities. The word \\"nothing\\" is an explicitly negative term, suggesting that there are no redeeming factors about the subject. This contributes significantly to the overall negative sentiment of the sentence. 2. \\"other than\\" - This is a conjunction that connects the preceding negative statement with another point, which is meant to stand in contrast. In this sentence, however, the following point further supports the negativity of the overall sentiment. 3. \\"exploitive\\" - This adjective has a strong negative connotation as it often refers to taking unfair advantage of a situation or people. It suggests that whatever is being discussed is using an unscrupulous approach to achieve its goals or desired outcome. 4. \\"array of obligatory cheap\\" - This phrase implies that the subject being discussed is of poor quality or relies on cheap tactics to attract attention. The word \\"obligatory\\" also adds a sense of the forced nature of these cheap elements. The combination of \\"cheap\\" and \\"obligatory\\" further enhances the negative sentiment in the sentence.

Write a title for this article: Among these is a handful of ladies (and no, copy editors, you may not change “ladies” to “women”) who strive daily to keep Washington’s name and legacy in the dimming lights of history. Unheralded and largely unknown, they deserve recognition for their valiant and extravagant efforts to preserve one of America’s most valuable assets, including the original ruminations of its greatest thinkers. These would be the members of the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association, who volunteer their time and talents — and open their wallets — to maintain Washington’s home on the Potomac. These efforts have been shepherded the past 30 years by one brave and hearty James Rees (think of having a couple dozen powerful women as your boss), who, like Washington, is also reserved and humble of spirit. To everyone’s dismay, Rees, 60, recently retired as CEO, owing to a debilitating illness that has taken him too soon from his venerable toils. During his 30 years at Mount Vernon, Rees helped lead its transformation from a historic house to a major national attraction, increasing its endowment from just 4 million in 1984 to more than 125 million today, and recently oversaw the groundbreaking for the estate’s newest project — a presidential library that will offer fellowships to scholars in residence as well as safeguard Washington’s books and papers. Latest to the collection is Washington’s original copy of the “Acts of Congress,” a 106-page volume that contains his personal copy of the Constitution, a draft of the Bill of Rights, and other documents pertaining to early acts of the new Congress. Washington’s own handwritten scribbles are penciled in the margins. The Mount Vernon ladies captured the book in a Christie’s bidding war using private funds. Unbeknown to most visitors to Mount Vernon — and certainly the millions who don’t know it exists — Washington’s home was saved and is maintained without a penny of public funds. (Disclosure: I serve on the Mount Vernon advisory board, a collection of private citizens who meet twice a year to offer advice, which the ladies are utterly free to ignore.) The ladies’ association is a lesson in volunteerism worthy of its own chapter. The association was formed in 1853 by South Carolina native Ann Pamela Cunningham, whose mother had noticed a large, dilapidated house perched on a hill along the Potomac River and was outraged to learn it was Washington’s home. Inspired by her mother, Cunningham reached out to Southern women to raise funds to buy the estate and, in 1860, open it to the public, thus beginning a 152-year-old tradition. Since then, more than 80 million have visited the house and grounds, which include an underground museum (so as not to mar the landscape), gardens, a slave burial ground, and the final resting place of George and Martha Washington. Even the opposite shore of the Potomac has been preserved so that visitors can enjoy the same view that Washington did. The Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington, named for its most generous donor, is an overdue addition to Washington’s home. In a time of self-reverential politicians and presidential libraries erected as monuments to ego, it is odd, if also characteristic, that the first president had none. Just as he resisted becoming the nation’s first president, feeling himself unworthy, he would have found a library in his honor, indulging today’s vernacular, “over the top.” Washington no doubt would be disappointed by the boastful tenor and dishonest content of today’s political debate, though he was surely familiar with the rowdy passions that drive it. Thanks to the ladies of Mount Vernon — and to the lovely James Rees — Americans can revisit those passions on the very grounds Washington paced, and perhaps find inspiration there to engage in a more civil discourse, surely not the least among Washington’s legacies.

Charles Krauthammer (; born March 13, 1950) is an American syndicated columnist, author, political commentator, and former physician whose weekly column is syndicated to more than 400 publications worldwide. While in his first year studying at Harvard Medical School, Krauthammer became permanently paralyzed from the neck down after a diving accident, severing the spinal cord at C5. After spending 14 months recovering in a hospital, he returned to medical school, graduating to become a psychiatrist involved in the creation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III, and later developing a career as a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. He was a weekly panelist on PBS news program Inside Washington from 1990 until it ceased production in December 2013. Krauthammer criticized President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to succeed Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. He called the nomination of Miers a \\"mistake\\" on several occasions. He noted her lack of constitutional experience as the main obstacle to her nomination.  On October 21, 2005, Krauthammer published \\"Miers: The Only Exit Strategy\\", in which he explained that all of Miers's relevant constitutional writings are protected by both attorney-client privilege and executive privilege, which presented a unique face-saving solution to the mistake: \\"Miers withdraws out of respect for both the Senate and the executive's prerogatives.\\" Six days later, Miers withdrew, employing that argument: \\"As I stated in my acceptance remarks in the Oval Office, the strength and independence of our three branches of government are critical to the continued success of this great Nation.

Kayla grew their nails longer than Jennifer, because","output":"Kayla had always admired the elegance of long nails. She noticed how they seemed to make every gesture more graceful, adding a touch of sophistication to even the simplest tasks. Therefore, she decided to embark on her own journey of growing her nails to achieve this mystifying beauty. Split ends, snags, and the occasional chip no longer bothered Kayla, as she diligently cared for her nails. She kept a meticulous maintenance schedule: moisturizing her cuticles with nourishing oils and hand creams, filing them regularly to avoid any rough edges, and applying protective nail polishes and treatments that promoted nail strength and growth. Kayla's goal was not only to outgrow Jennifer but to achieve a certain grace and elegance that she perceived was linked to the length of one’s nails. Jennifer, on the other hand, had a more pragmatic view of long nails. She appreciated their appearance but understood that her choice of career and lifestyle limited her own ability to grow her nails too long—lest they be more trouble than they were worth. Jennifer's job as a veterinarian often involved hands-on tasks such as handling animals and performing medical procedures that were difficult with long nails. As such, she prioritized the practicality and hygiene concerns over the aesthetics of having lengthy nails. Kayla's persistence and dedication started to pay off, and her nails gradually grew longer, surpassing Jennifer's relatively short and more manageable nails. Every time they met for lunch or a casual chat, the topic of nails inevitably came up, and Kayla would proudly flaunt her progress. Jennifer would playfully roll her eyes, secretly impressed by her friend's determination in pursuit of her goal. As Kayla's nails grew longer, people around her began to notice and comment on her unique style. Some admired her for her dedication, while others viewed her nails as an expression of vanity and a testament to the importance she placed on her appearance. Yet, Kayla was unperturbed by these various opinions, as she continued to refine her nail care regimen in an attempt to bring them to the absolute pinnacle of elegance. Finally, Kayla reached a point where she was undeniably proud of her nails. They were glossy, well-manicured, and significantly longer than Jennifer's. However, Kayla had noticed that the longer her nails got, the more challenging it became for her to engage in many everyday tasks. Things like typing on her laptop and phone, fastening a necklace or a bracelet, and even preparing a meal had become considerably more difficult. Nevertheless, the sense of accomplishment from achieving her goal was gratifying, but she now understood Jennifer's perspective better. Kayla started to recognize that growing out her nails beyond their current length would be impractical and so she resolved to maintain her nails at a length that balanced elegance and functionality. Jennifer and Kayla's friendship flourished through these shared experiences, their bond strengthening in spite of their slightly competitive nature. They both realized that long nails are a matter of personal preference and priorities. While Kayla grew her nails out for elegance, she came to acknowledge the importance of functionality. Jennifer found an admiration in Kayla's dedication and artistic pursuit, which made her appreciate the beauty of long nails even more. In the end, their quest for the perfect nail length taught them that it was not about outdoing each other, but finding a balance that suited each woman's unique lifestyle and desires."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, this figure excludes mortgage interest payments, British council tax or domestic rates in Northern Ireland. A rise in gas and electricity prices pushed this category to the top of the household spending list in 2013, the ONS said. A previous big hit for family finances was transport, which was second on the list last year at £70.40. Nearly half of this was the cost of running a car, namely petrol, diesel, repairs and servicing. Transport remained a significant expense for families in rural areas of the UK. In these areas, it cost £85.50 a week. Overall, average weekly household spending for households in rural areas was £550.50, compared with £481.70 in urban areas from 2011 to 2013. There was also evidence in the ONS figures of a north-south divide in spending. In 2011 to 2013, families in the South East of England spent the most per week (£585.40), followed by households in London (£579.60), the East of England (£523.40) and the South West of England (£518.20). All four were above the UK average. Families in the the North East of England spent the least at £424.60 per week, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber (£431.10) and Wales (£438.80). The divide between rich and poor is also clear, with the lowest-earning 10% of households spending an average of £189.80 a week. This compared with an average of £1,119.50 a week for the 10% of highest-earning households in the UK. £58.80 a week on average £15.60  on meat and fish £4.30  on fresh veg £3.30  on fresh fruit £4.90 on non-alcoholic drinks Major areas of spending for households in general were recreation and culture (£63.90 a week). This category includes spending on TVs, computers, newspapers, books and package holidays. The figures suggest that recreation takes a bigger chunk of family income than grocery bills. Average weekly spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks in 2013 stood at £58.80, of which £15.60 a week was spent on meat and fish. Summary:","output":"According to the Family Spending Survey compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), housing costs such as rent and fuel were the top expenditure for households in 2013, exceeding transport costs. The average amount spent per household increased from £501 in 2012 to £539.80 in 2006 after considering the rising cost of living. On average, households spent £74.40 per week, or 14% of their spending, on housing, fuel and power in 2013. This figure, however, does not include mortgage interest payments, British council tax or domestic rates in Northern Ireland. A surge in gas and electricity prices pushed housing costs to the top of the list that year. Previously, transport was the most significant family expense, costing £70.40, with nearly half of this attributed to car maintenance such as petrol, diesel, repairs and servicing. Weekly household spending for rural households was higher at £550.50 compared to £481.70 in urban areas from 2011 to 2013. The data also revealed a north-south divide in spending, with families in the South East of England spending the highest amount per week at £585.40, followed by London at £579.60, the East of England at £523.40 and the South West at £518.20. All these regions surpassed the UK average. In contrast, families in the North East of England spent the lowest amount at £424.60 per week, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber at £431.10 and Wales at £438.80. The gap between rich and poor is evident, as the lowest-earning 10% of households spent an average of £189.80 per week, compared to the highest-earning 10% of households, which spent an average of £1,119.50 per week. Major spending areas for households involved recreation and culture at £63.90 per week, including expenses on TVs, computers, newspaper and package holidays. This category took up a larger portion of family income than grocery bills, where average weekly spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks in 2013 was £58.80, including £15.60 a week on meat and fish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -489*h - 10043 = -840*h + 456*h - 1328 for h.","output":"To solve the equation -489*h - 10043 = -840*h + 456*h - 1328 for h, first we need to combine the terms with h on both sides of the equation, and then isolate the variable h. Follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine the terms with h on the right side of the equation. -840*h + 456*h = -384*h This is because -840 + 456 equals -384. So our equation becomes: -489*h - 10043 = -384*h - 1328 Step 2: Add 384*h to both sides of the equation to move the h terms to the left side. -489*h + 384*h - 10043 = -1328 This simplifies to: -105*h - 10043 = -1328 Step 3: Add 10043 to both sides of the equation to isolate the h term. -105*h = 8715 This is because -1328 + 10043 equals 8715. Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by -105 to solve for h. h = 8715 / -105 h = -83 So the solution to the equation -489*h - 10043 = -840*h + 456*h - 1328 is h = -83."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To understand this, let's analyze each sentence and their relationship to each other. Sentence 1: 'Well then.' This sentence typically serves as a transitional phrase in conversation, indicating that the speaker is acknowledging a statement or situation before proceeding to the next point. It does not convey any specific or definitive information about the speaker's opinions or intentions. As a standalone sentence, it leaves the topic or context open for interpretation. Sentence 2: 'Absolutely not.' This statement expresses a clear and emphatic rejection, disagreement, or denial of something. It involves a strong conviction or belief, suggesting that a particular option or idea has been considered and rejected. The relationship between the two sentences is unclear. They may be part of a larger conversation or address different topics entirely.  An entailment occurs when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence, given the content and logical structure of both sentences. In this case, the first sentence ('Well then.') does not provide any information, affirmation, or negation that would guarantee the truth of the second sentence ('Absolutely not.'). There is no clear logical connection or causality between the two statements. To put it simply, just because someone says 'Well then,' it does not directly imply that their next statement would be 'Absolutely not,' or vice versa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1991, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans made up 80% of the Latino population in the United States. Latinos are disadvantaged compared to White Americans and are more likely to live in poverty.

Associated Press. and Daily Mail Reporter. The mommy blogger who is accused of fatally poisoning her 5-year-old son with salt is on suicide watch in a New York jail while she awaits trial. At a hearing on Wednesday, Lacey Spears' lawyer asked the public to 'keep and open mind' about the charges. Spears 'looks forward to her day in court and the opportunity to challenge the allegations,' attorney Stephen Riebling said after a brief court session. 'We continue to trust the people will keep an open mind and not judge Lacey or the facts of this case based on what's been reported,' he said. 'The defense of this case will be focused on the relevant facts, not fiction.' Scroll down for video. Lacey Spears (pictured here in May) is 'devastated' by her son's death and is currently on suicide watch, her lawyer revealed. He would not elaborate. Spears, 26, was not in court on Wednesday. Riebling would not comment on how she is doing behind bars except to say that she is 'devastated' by her son's death. A sister, Rebecca Spears, was in court but would not comment afterward. Lacey Spears, of Scottsville, Kentucky, pleaded not guilty last month on charges of depraved murder and manslaughter in the death of Garnett-Paul Spears. The boy died in January at the Westchester Medical Center when, prosecutors say, his sodium levels rose to an extremely dangerous level with no medical explanation. Spears, then living in Chestnut Ridge, New York, was sharing her son's hospital room - he had been brought there after suffering seizures - and doctors thought she might be harming him. Prosecutors believe she administered sodium through a feeding tube in his stomach. Garnett-Paul Spears died in a New York hospital from unexplained sodium poisoning. Prosecutors say his mother slipped it into his feeding tube. Spears, who is originally from Decatur, Alabama, for years had chronicled on social media what she said were the boy's various medical crises. The depraved murder charge alleges extreme recklessness rather than intentional killing. It carries the same maximum sentence, 25 years to life in prison. Spears' lawyers have not yet filed the paperwork that would be required if they plan to offer a psychiatric defense. They would not comment Wednesday on whether that was being contemplated. Acting state Supreme Court Judge Robert Neary gave the defense until September to file motions. He set October 13 for the next court date.

This phrase is often used in colloquial speech when someone wants to encourage or motivate others to take action and approach a certain task or challenge with enthusiasm and determination. Just like in English, motivational phrases such as these can help promote a positive and proactive atmosphere among people, whether in a group setting or between just a few individuals. Czech, a West Slavic language, is spoken primarily in the Czech Republic, which is located in Central Europe. It is closely related to the Slovak language, which is spoken in neighboring Slovakia. Both languages belong to the larger family of Slavic languages, which also includes Russian, Polish, Ukrainian, and others. Like many other languages, Czech has unique idiomatic expressions and phrases that can be challenging for learners or translators to interpret. For example, \\"Jde se na to!\\" is a phrase that, when translated word-for-word, may not immediately convey its intended meaning to non-Czech speakers. However, once familiar with the meaning, one can easily understand that in the context of certain situations, this phrase can be a powerful and inspirational expression that encourages individuals to take action and embrace challenge. In conclusion, the Czech phrase \\"Jde se na to!\\" is an idiomatic expression that translates to \\"Let's go for it!\\" or \\"Let's do it!\\" in English.

It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use. Smaller violin-type instruments are known, including the violino piccolo and the kit violin, but these are virtually unused in the 2010s. The violin typically has four strings tuned in perfect fifths, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings, though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato). Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition and in many varieties of folk music. They are also frequently used in genres of folk including country music and bluegrass music and in jazz. Electric violins are used in some forms of rock music; further, the violin has come to be played in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The violin is sometimes informally called a fiddle, particularly in Irish traditional music and bluegrass, but this nickname is also used regardless of the type of music played on it.  - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities.

Two teams studied two types of animals: team A studied predators, while team B studied grazers. They learned a lot from this experience.  Hint: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer the question, let's analyze the information in the paragraph step-by-step: 1. We know that team A studied predators, while team B studied grazers. 2. The paragraph mentions that predators play an important role in an ecosystem. 3. It also provides an example of a predator – wolves – as a keystone species that can affect the balance of an ecosystem. Since team A studied predators, and wolves are an example of predators, team A learned about wolves.

Background: William Miller Edwards (June 21, 1905 - June 12, 1987) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Western Reserve University, Vanderbilt University and Wittenberg University in a career lasting more than 30 years, compiling a win-loss-tie record of 168-45-8. Edwards also coached the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) from 1941 to 1942, tallying a 4-9-1 record, and served as an assistant coach for the NFL's Cleveland Browns in the late 1940s. Raised near Massillon, Ohio, Edwards was the son of an immigrant from Wales who worked in the area's coal mines. Context: Edwards resigned from coaching in 1969, when he was 63 years old, although he continued to work at Wittenberg as the school's athletic director. Dave Maurer, his long-time assistant, took over as the school's coach. By the end of his career, Edwards's 168-45-8 overall college record gave him the second-best winning percentage in the country among active coaches with at least 100 wins. Edwards was given a commendation by President Richard Nixon for his achievements as a coach and won a Football Writers Association of America award for contributions to the game. \\"His retirement is Wittenberg's loss, but more than that, it is college football's loss,\\" University of Alabama coach Bear Bryant said at the time.  Edwards retired in February 1973 after 39 years as a coach and administrator and said he would concentrate on hunting and fishing. He was inducted into the Ohio Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1979, Wittenberg's Athletics Hall of Honor in 1985 and into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1986. He was also inducted into the Western Reserve Hall of Fame and the Vanderbilt Hall of Fame in 1986. Edwards died in 1987. He and his wife Dorothy had three children.  The tough but compassionate approach to coaching Edwards espoused influenced many men who worked under him, including Maurer, who led Wittenberg to a 129-23-3 record between 1969 and 1983. Wittenberg's football stadium is named Edwards-Maurer Field in honor of both head coaches. The winner of the Wittenberg-Case Western Reserve football game receives the Bill Edwards Trophy.  Edwards was also close with Steve Belichick, who played for him at Western Reserve and for the Detroit Lions and later served as an assistant under him at Vanderbilt and North Carolina. Belichick's son Bill was named after Edwards, who was also Bill's godfather. Bill Belichick later became an assistant coach in the NFL and is the head coach of the New England Patriots as of 2018. At what is now known as Case Western Reserve University, the football stadium, DiSanto Field, hosts its distinguished guests inside the Coach Bill Edwards President's Suite. Question: what was his impact while the school's athletic director? Answer:","output":"William Miller Edwards had a significant impact during his tenure as the school's athletic director at Wittenberg University. As a respected and successful football coach with an overall collegiate win-loss-tie record of 168-45-8, Edwards brought a wealth of knowledge, experience, and leadership to the athletic department. His accomplishments as a football coach earned him recognition at the highest levels of the sport, and he was able to leverage this to benefit the school and its athletic programs during his time as athletic director. As athletic director, Edwards played a crucial role in shaping and improving Wittenberg's athletic department by promoting a competitive and successful environment for all sports. He oversaw the development and growth of various athletic programs, ensuring that they received the necessary resources and support to excel. More than merely benefiting the football program, Edwards extended his influence to advance other sports at Wittenberg, which broadened the school's athletic accomplishments. As the athletic director, Edwards was responsible for attracting and retaining top coaching talent across all sports at the university. His personal coaching success and reputation made it possible to bring in other successful coaches to the school's athletic programs. In particular, his long-time assistant and successor as the football coach, Dave Maurer, went on to have a remarkable 129-23-3 record during his time at Wittenberg. This continuation of success demonstrates the impressive legacy that Edwards left behind through his work as a coach, mentor, and athletic director. Edwards was also instrumental in fostering a culture of excellence and sportsmanship among Wittenberg's student-athletes. The tough but compassionate approach to coaching that he advocated had a lasting impact on generations of athletes and coaches at the university. He emphasized the importance of character, dedication, teamwork, and perseverance – qualities that extended beyond the football field and into the lives of the student-athletes he helped shape. Consequently, his approach to coaching and guidance went on to influence other coaches, like Steve Belichick, who in turn passed these values onto their players, including Bill Belichick, the head coach of the New England Patriots. In summary, William Miller Edwards' impact as the athletic director at Wittenberg University was multifaceted and far-reaching. He strengthened the athletic department through his leadership, influence, and success across various sports programs, while also attracting top-tier coaching talent during his tenure. His dedication to building a culture of excellence and sportsmanship resonates through generations of athletes and coaches, ensuring that his legacy continues to shape the world of college sports long after his retirement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Measure the rice.\\"","output":"Title: The Art of Mastering Rice Cookery: Selecting The Right Saucepan and Measuring Techniques Introduction Rice is a staple food enjoyed by millions of people across the globe – a versatile ingredient that can define a variety of cuisines, from Asian to Latin American. It is more than just a side dish; it can transform a meal's flavor and texture profile. Nevertheless, the secret to a flawlessly cooked rice begins with the right saucepan and accurate measuring techniques. In this article, we will discuss the crucial steps to meticulously choose the perfect saucepan, properly measure rice, and guide you through the fundamental steps to elevate your meals by cooking impeccable, irresistible rice. Section 1: Selecting the Right Saucepan 1.1 Saucepan Material When selecting a saucepan to cook rice, consider the material and how evenly it distributes heat. The ideal choices are those made from stainless steel, aluminum, or non-stick materials. Stainless steel, with its even heat distribution, is a popular choice. Aluminum, while lightweight, can conduct heat well, while non-stick pans provide the convenience of hassle-free cleaning. Enamel-coated cast iron saucepans are also a suitable option to maintain consistent heat throughout the cooking process. 1.2 Size Matters Rice expands as it cooks, so make sure that your saucepan has enough space to accommodate this expansion. A three quart saucepan with a capacity of around 12 cups is a wise choice for most situations. This size will enable you to cook various types of rice in varying amounts without worrying about it overflowing during the cooking process. 1.3 The Lid The saucepan lid plays an essential role in rice cooking. A tight-fitting lid will keep the steam trapped inside the saucepan, which is crucial for perfectly steamed rice. Glass lids offer the advantage of monitoring the rice's progress without lifting the lid and releasing steam, but well-fitted stainless steel or aluminum lids will also do the job. Section 2: Measuring Rice 2.1 Rice-to-Water Ratio The rice-to-water ratio is essential in ensuring well-cooked rice. Different types of rice generally require varying amounts of water: - White Rice (Short or Medium-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water. - White Rice (Long-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 1.75 cups of water. - Brown Rice (Short or Medium-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water. - Brown Rice (Long-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 2.25 cups of water. - Basmati or Jasmine Rice: 1 cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water. 2.2 Techniques for Measuring To measure rice, use a standard measuring cup to scoop the rice from its container. Level the rice in the measuring cup by sliding a straight-edged utensil, such as a butter knife or a flat spatula, over the top. This method will ensure that you have precisely the intended amount for your recipe. Make sure to adjust the amount according to your desired serving sizes. Section 3: Cooking Rice Perfectly 3.1 Rinsing Rice Prior to cooking, rinse the rice under cold running water in a fine-mesh sieve or strainer to remove excess starch and debris. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear to avoid clumped or gummy rice. 3.2 Proper Cooking Methods Once you've selected the proper saucepan, measured your rice and water, and rinsed the rice, you can proceed with the actual cooking process: - Start by heating your saucepan on medium and add some butter or oil if desired, then add the rice and cook for a few minutes. - Pour the measured amount of water into the saucepan, stirring to ensure the rice is evenly distributed along the bottom. - Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan with its tight-fitting lid. - Allow the rice to steam, avoiding opening the lid, until it absorbs the water and becomes tender. The cooking time varies depending on the type of rice (White Rice: 15-20 minutes, Brown Rice: 45-50 minutes, Basmati or Jasmine Rice: 15-20 minutes). - Let the rice sit, covered, for at least 5 minutes after being removed from heat. This additional resting time will make the rice fluffier. - Finally, use a fork to fluff the rice, gently separating the grains before serving. Conclusion Rice is a beloved part of countless dishes around the world. By selecting the right saucepan, measuring your rice accurately, and employing proper cooking methods, you'll be well on your way to perfecting the art of rice cookery. Follow these simple steps to elevate your dishes and satisfy your palate each and every time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They appreciate the design, finding it convenient for getting into spice jar lids, and have expressed an interest in buying a pair that were accurately calibrated. However, the user clearly states that the measurements of the spoons are off by 25-50%, except for the teaspoon measure. This is a serious flaw, particularly for a product whose primary function is to give accurate measurements for cooking or baking purposes. Taking this into consideration, it can be inferred that the user would likely not recommend this product in its current state to other potential consumers, as the inaccuracies present may lead to potential issues in recipes that require precise measurement. However, the user appears to be open to the possibility of recommending a future version of the product, should the manufacturer rectify the issue mentioned.

The lyrics for \\"My Happiness\\" were written by Bernard Fanning, Powderfinger's lead singer and songwriter. The rest of the band are co-credited with Fanning for composing the track. The song describes feelings of love and separation; Sain's Pennie Dennison said it described \\"the pining feeling you experience when you spend time away from the one you love\\". Fanning called it \\"a sad story of touring and the absence loneliness that comes with it\\". The extensive time spent touring took its toll on the band, and it was on the back of this that Fanning wrote \\"My Happiness\\". Thus, he expressed confusion at its being considered a romantic song.  \\"My Happiness\\" was attacked by some fans as being \\"like Lauryn Hill, bland and boring Top 40 bullshit\\"; guitarist Ian Haug rebutted by pointing out that the song was an example of the new emotional level on which Powderfinger made music, while Fanning was more aggressive in his defence of the song. In response to being dubbed \\"Mr Miserable\\" by The Sun-Herald's Peter Holmes for the lyrics of \\"My Happiness\\" and \\"These Days\\", Fanning pointed out that the songs could be construed either as melancholy, or as part of \\"the most hopeful record ... in a long time\\".  Much of Fanning's writing is inspired by non-rock music, and \\"My Happiness\\" is no exception. Gospel and soul music that is \\"unashamedly about love and how good it makes you feel\\" was common during the Odyssey Number Five recording sessions. Powderfinger worked hard in those sessions to ensure a more polished work than Internationalist; guitarist Darren Middleton concluded that \\"My Happiness\\", \\"The Metre\\", and \\"Up & Down & Back Again\\" were more \\"complete\\" because of the band's efforts. The lighter elements of \\"My Happiness\\" in comparison to some of the band's earlier work saw Fanning reveal his passion for several other musicians, such as James Taylor--something that \\"five years ago ... would have been an embarrassing thing to say\\". Answer this question \\"Besides music any other sources of inspiration for \\"My Happiness\\"?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Besides music, another source of inspiration for \\"My Happiness\\" was the extensive time spent touring by the band, which took its toll on them and led to feelings of absence and loneliness.

Rachel, unlike Katrina,  tries to avoid confrontation as they get very upset.","output":"Rachel, unlike Katrina, tries to avoid confrontation as they get very upset. This stems from Rachel's inherent aversion to conflict and her highly empathetic nature. Whenever faced with a potential confrontation, Rachel's first step is to assess the situation carefully and identify the root of the issue. She believes that by understanding the source of the disagreement, she is better equipped to address it in a calm and non-aggressive manner. After identifying the root issue, Rachel's second step is to put herself in the other person's shoes and try to understand their perspective. She finds that by empathizing with others and validating their feelings, she can amicably resolve issues without causing further emotional distress. This approach not only enables Rachel to defuse tense situations but also helps in maintaining positive relationships with others, something she deeply cherishes. One of Rachel's key tactics in avoiding confrontation is active listening. Instead of trying to impose her point of view, she focuses on listening to others and finding common ground. This allows Rachel to facilitate a more productive conversation and work towards a mutually agreeable solution. In situations where confrontation seems inevitable, Rachel's strategy is to take a step back and give herself time to process and reflect on the situation. By doing this, she can approach the issue with a clearer mind and renewed emotional reserves. Consequently, this enables her to communicate her thoughts and feelings assertively, yet respectfully, helping her maintain a healthy balance between self-preservation and conflict resolution. Overall, Rachel's approach to avoiding confrontation demonstrates her commitment to fostering dialogue and understanding in her interactions with others, prioritizing harmony and empathy over aggression and discord."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests, a move the news organization termed an \\"amicable separation.\\" Mr. Reupke, 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran, had been the information-services company's general manager for only six months. His appointment to that post, which has senior administrative, staff and policy responsibilities, followed a several-year tenure as Reuters's editor in chief. No successor was named, and Mr. Reupke's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said. In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said his departure was for \\"personal reasons,\\" which he declined to specify. \\"There is no business reason for my departure,\\" nor any disagreement over policy, he added. He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager's post hadn't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization. Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve on the company's board of directors. \\"If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board,\\" he said. A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects \\"no change in strategy or profits.\\" Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Philips & Drew in London, said, \\"I suspect (the departure) will be fairly irrelevant for the company. I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations.\\" On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence (14.43). In the U.S. over-the-counter market, American depositary shares for Reuters, each representing three shares in the London market, closed unchanged at 43.875. The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupke's duties is Nigel Judah, 58, finance director and a Reuters board director.

Today, he has three samples of molecule in front of him, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a straight-chain molecule; sample B is a branched-chain molecule; and sample C is a cyclic molecule. Mark's job is to determine the characteristics of each sample.  But I can use this background: A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join together to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules.  What is an answer for this question: Which sample would have higher boiling point, sample A or sample C? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, sample C, which is a cyclic molecule, would generally have a higher boiling point than sample A, a straight-chain molecule. This can be attributed to the structure and properties of cyclic molecules in comparison to straight-chain molecules. Cyclic molecules have carbon atoms arranged in rings, which often contain five or six carbon atoms. These rings can also join together to form larger molecules, resulting in more compact and rigid structures. On the other hand, straight-chain molecules consist of carbon atoms that form a linear \\"backbone,\\" resulting in a more flexible and less compact structure. The structural differences between these types of molecules impact their boiling points. In cyclic molecules, the compact and rigid arrangement of carbon atoms typically creates stronger intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals interactions and, in some cases, aromatic stacking interactions. These stronger forces generally require more energy to break, leading to a higher boiling point for cyclic molecules. In contrast, straight-chain molecules have weaker intermolecular forces due to their more flexible and less compact structures. As a result, these molecules generally require less energy to overcome the forces holding them together, resulting in lower boiling points compared to cyclic molecules. Therefore, in this case, sample C (cyclic molecule) is expected to have a higher boiling point than sample A (straight-chain molecule)."},{"instruction":"Q:M: Yes. Sometimes. I've got to be honest.

At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990.  Question: \\"Historically, Albania enjoyed a general freedom of religion for how many centuries prior to Communism?\\" Answer: \\"9\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

News article: Dr. Benjamin Carson, the famed Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon, apologized Friday for his \\"choice of words\\" and use of examples in discussing gay marriage on Fox News earlier in the week.      During Sean Hannity's show on Tuesday, when asked about the matter before the Supreme Court, Carson said, \\"Marriage is between a man and a woman. No group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn't matter what they are. They don't get to change the definition.\\"            The comparison of gays to members of the North American Boy/Man Love Association and those who engage in bestiality set off a backlash of criticism in the media, online and on campus. There is now a petition circulating at Johns Hopkins Medical to have Carson removed as commencement speaker in May at the School of Medicine.      \\"I think people have completely taken the wrong meaning out of what I was saying,\\" the 61-year-old surgeon said in a telephone interview Friday. \\"First of all, I certainly believe gay people should have all the rights that anybody else has. What I was basically saying is that as far as marriage is concerned that has traditionally been between a man and a woman and nobody should be able to change that.\\"            \\"Now perhaps the examples were not the best choice of words, and I certainly apologize if I offended anyone,\\" he added. \\"But the point that I was making was that no group of individuals, whoever they are, whatever their belief systems, gets to change traditional definitions. The reason I believe the way I do, I will readily confess, is because I am a Christian who believes in The Bible.\\"            The Bible, he explained, \\"...says we have an obligation to love our fellow man as ourselves, and I love everybody the same -- all homosexuals. Everybody who knows me knows I would never say anything to intentionally hurt someone.\\"      Given the \\"if I offended anyone\\" tone and language of the apology, it will be interesting to see how it's received. I hope readers will weigh in here.      The Sun has also obtained a copy of the petition aimed at getting Carson, who is on the eve of retirement this spring, removed as a speaker at the School of Medicine graduation ceremonies in May.            \\"At the time of his nomination, Dr. Carson was known to most of us as a world-class neurosurgeon and passionate advocate for education,\\" the petition says. \\"Many of us had read his books and looked up to him as a role model in our careers. Since then, however, several public events have cast serious doubt on the appropriateness of having Dr. Carson speak at our graduation. If you believe he is an inappropriate choice of speaker at a ceremony intended to celebrate the achievements of our class please complete the petition below.\\"            When asked about the petition Friday, Carson told the Sun, \\"I've caught wind of it and I've sent back a message that this is their graduation, their big day, and if they think me being there is going to be a problem, I am happy to withdraw.\\"      Speaking of his retirement plans, Carson said he has been speaking with several TV outlets about a career in media.      In response to a direct question as to whether he is in discussions with Fox News, where he has been regularly featured since his appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast in February, he said, \\"I would simply say that there is more than one station that has asked if I would have any interest, and I am in the process of considering these things.\\"      Carson expressed a \\"hope\\" that \\"we can get to a level where we can actually have an intelligent discussion without hysteria\\" on such issues as gay marriage.      Good luck with that on highly partisan cable TV channels like Fox News and MSNBC. ||||| Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images      Ever since I joined the bonfire around Ben Carson's interview on Hannity—the one with the NAMBLA gaffe, you remember it—the occasional critic has told me to look back at the substance of the comment. Carson was making a typical slippery slope argument, asking where people would stop once they started redefining marriage. And, yes, Justice Sotomayor asked a question about this at Tuesday's oral argument. It's probably worth it to excerpt that exchange.            David Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you're being asked -- and -- and it is one that I'm interested in the answer: If you say that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with respect to the number of people, with respect to -- that could get married -- the incest laws, the mother and child, assuming that they are the age -- I can -- I can accept that the State has probably an overbearing interest on -- on protecting a child until they're of age to marry, but what's left?      MR. OLSON: Well, you've said -- you've said in the cases decided by this Court that the polygamy issue, multiple marriages raises questions about exploitation, abuse, patriarchy, issues with respect to taxes, inheritance, child custody, it is an entirely different thing. And if you -- if a State prohibits polygamy, it's prohibiting conduct. If it prohibits gay and lesbian citizens from getting married, it is prohibiting their exercise of a right based upon their status. It's selecting them as a class, as you described in the Romer case and as you described in the Lawrence case and in other cases, you're picking out a group of individuals to deny them the freedom that you've said is fundamental, important and vital in this society, and it has status and stature, as you pointed out in the VMI case.      Advertisement            Right: The question is whether you accept some social science. One difference between a guy who wants to have six sister wives and a guy who's always been attracted to guys? The available research suggests that the second couple will raise well-adjusted children. The current thinking on pedophilia (to get back to Carson's NAMBLA) rereference is that, like homosexuality, it's innate. But that leads you to the question of child-rearing and other norms, and the homosexuality-pedophilia comparison withers away.            Sotomayor and Olson tried to reason this out. Carson just sort of assumes the worst. In his book—which is actually competing with Sotomayor's on the bestseller list—he suggests that the effort to \\"redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures\\" played a part in the \\"dramatic fall of the Roman Empire.\\" That's just ahistorical: gay marriage was a legal deviance in the pagan era, banned by Constantius and Constans more than 100 years before the fall.            Look: Being very good, world-historically good, at one thing does not make you a cross-platform expert. Donald Trump is very good at hosting TV shows in which celebrities humiliate themselves, but doesn't seem to know much about public policy. Carson's a brilliant neurosurgeon and a political dilletente. And that's okay! But this fact hurt him after one too many soft-focus Fox News interviews.       ||||| Neurosurgeon Ben Carson apologized Friday for comments he made about gay marriage on Sean Hannity’s TV show earlier this week.      “I think in terms of what was said on Sean Hannity’s show, that was taken completely out of context and completely misunderstood in terms of what I was trying to say,” Carson told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. “As a Christian, I have a duty to love all people and that includes people who have other sexual orientations, and I certainly do, and never had any intention of offending anyone… If anyone was offended, I apologize to you.”      Text Size -      +      reset TOP 5 ways to apologize in politics      The John Hopkins doctor came under scrutiny when he appeared to liken homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality, sparking the outrage of the LGBT community.      “My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It’s a well-established fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn’t matter what they are, they don’t get to change the definition,” the doctor, who is the director of pediatric neurosurgery, said on Hannity’s show Tuesday.      His comments also led to a petition by students at Johns Hopkins University, who want him to be removed as commencement speaker, as was initially planned.

It doesn’t tell us anything about his amazing abilities as a surgeon,” Professor Todd Shepard, co-director of the university’s Program for the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, said in a statement to Media Matters. “It does remind us, however, that those abilities do not mean we should listen to what he says in any other domain.”      Carson said that he would “absolutely” withdraw as commencement speaker if necessary, saying the “last thing” he would want to do is “rain on their parade.”      However, the doctor remained firmly rooted in his belief that the term “marriage” should not be extended to same-sex couples, although he said the couples should be treated “kindly” and have whatever legal agreements they desire in order to transfer property and have visitation rights, among other rights.      (Also on POLITICO: Conservative pundits split on gay marriage)      “Marriage is a very sacred thing and we need to maintain it as a sacred thing. When I say we don’t want to change it or degrade it by calling everything marriage, that’s not aimed at any particular group,” he said. “But the fact of the matter is, the Bible and God have set very specific standards. It’s very clear what’s being said. God doesn’t change, man changes. Our duty is to allow for that change and to still love them and in terms of what happens with them, that’s a decision that’s up to God, that’s not our decision.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Dr. Benjamin Carson, a renowned Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon, apologized for his choice of words and examples when discussing gay marriage on Fox News. During the show, Carson made comparisons of homosexuality to NAMBLA and bestiality, which sparked backlash and criticism. A petition circulated at Johns Hopkins Medical to remove Carson as the commencement speaker in May at the School of Medicine. Carson tried to clarify his words and apologized if he offended anyone, reaffirming his belief in traditional marriage while stating that he believes gay people should have equal rights. The incident led to questions about the appropriateness of having Carson speak at the graduation and raised the issue of whether expertise in one field translates to expertise in all domains."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask for a hard copy of the plan and also inquire how often the plan is updated, what hazards it covers, and any other details you may think of. Discuss with your employer and school and/or daycare center the policies regarding disasters and emergencies, such as how warning information will be provided and disaster procedures followed. Know the following about your children's school emergency plans: how the school will communicate during a crisis; if the school has adequate food, water, and other basic supplies; if the school is prepared to shelter-in-place if need be and where they plan to go if they must get away. Draw a floor plan of your home. Use a blank sheet of paper for each floor. Mark two escape routes from each room. Make sure children understand the drawings. Post a copy of the drawings at eye level in each child's room. Establish a place to meet in the event of an emergency, such as a fire. Complete a contact card for each family member and have family members keep these cards handy in a wallet, purse, backpack, etc. You may want to send one to school with each child to keep on file. Pick a friend or relative who lives out-of-state for household members to notify they are safe. Review existing policies for the amount and extent of coverage to ensure that what you have in place is what is required for you and your family for all possible hazards. Consider purchasing insurance specifically for certain disasters such as flooding, hurricanes, or tornadoes. Make a record of your personal property, for insurance purposes. Take photos or a video of the interior and exterior of your home. Include personal belongings in your inventory. The hearing impaired will need special arrangements to receive warnings; the mobility impaired may require special assistance to reach shelter; and people with certain dietary needs must have appropriate food supplies.   Create a network of neighbors, relatives, friends, and coworkers to aid you in an emergency. Discuss your needs and make sure everyone knows how to operate necessary equipment. If you live in an apartment building, ask the management to mark accessible exits clearly and to make arrangements to help you leave the building. Keep specialized items ready, including extra wheelchair batteries, oxygen, catheters, medication, food for service animals, and any other items you might need. Be sure to make provisions for medications that require refrigeration and keep a list of the type and model numbers of the medical devices anyone requires.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who opposed the inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus? , can you please find it?   The term Belorussia (Russian: Белору́ссия, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, Russia) first rose in the days of the Russian Empire, and the Russian Tsar was usually styled \\"the Tsar of All the Russias\\", as Russia or the Russian Empire was formed by three parts of Russia—the Great, Little, and White. This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the term \\"White Russia\\" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks. During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term Byelorussia was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, Byelorussia became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno during the interwar period.The term Byelorussia (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called Republic of Belarus (Республика Беларусь spelled in Russian), and that its abridged form should be \\"Belarus\\". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their Belarusian language forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993. Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus.Accordingly, the name Byelorussia was replaced by Belarus in English. Likewise, the adjective Belorussian or Byelorussian was replaced by Belarusian in English. Belarusian is closer to the original Belarusian term of bielaruski. Belarusian intelligentsia in the Stalin era attempted to change the name from Byelorussia to a form of Krivia because of the supposed connection... The answer is:","output":"Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus opposed the inclusion of the name change from Byelorussia to Belarus in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There are not very many people who seriously read a newspaper every day. Most people read only the sports pages, the advice or the gossip columns, the comics, and perhaps the classified advertisements. Most people don't take the time to read the real news. They attempt to catch the reader's interest with pictures and exciting headlines. These techniques are used on the front page because it is the first thing you see when you pick up the paper. The first page attracts attention and encourages the reader to look through the rest of the paper. This is why editors always look for a good first page story and headline to make them stop and look. If the headline is horrible enough or frightening enough or wild enough, perhaps they will go on to read the front page anymore. They may read the headlines, but that is all, then they turn to the sports page, or comics, or advertisements. It seems that people do not want the news from a newspaper anymore. They say they get the news on the television now.     More people watch television news because it is easier and more interesting than reading a newspaper. What about you?

Choices: * yes. * it is not possible to tell. * no.","output":"Based on the information provided in the premise, we can analyze and provide a detailed answer to the multi-select problem concerning the hypothesis about the black hats. The premise states that two priests are wearing white robes and black hats, are clasping their hands, and appear to be leading a church service. Our task is to determine whether we can conclude that the hypothesis (the hats are black) is true if the premise is true. The hypothesis clearly states that the hats are black. According to the premise, the two priests are indeed wearing black hats. Since the hypothesis is derived directly from the information provided in the premise, we can safely ascertain the following: Yes - We can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true.  The reasoning behind this conclusion is based on the fact that both the premise and the hypothesis indicate that the priests are wearing black hats. There is a clear consistency between the premise and the hypothesis in terms of the details about the hats' color. As a result, if the premise is deemed to be true, the hypothesis stating that the hats are black would be true as well. It is important to note that the answer is derived specifically from the premise being true and may not apply if the premise were to be altered or proven false. The other choices can be disregarded in this instance because:  * It is not possible to tell - This choice can be dismissed as we have sufficient evidence and a clear connection between the premise and the hypothesis that allows us to reach a conclusion.  * No - This choice can also be dismissed, as there is no contradiction or discrepancy between the premise and the hypothesis. The information given about the hats' color in both the premise and the hypothesis aligns accurately, leading to a consistent and definitive answer.  In conclusion, based on the provided premise, we can ascertain that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The correlation between the premise and the hypothesis concerning the color of the priests' hats allows us to reach this result with confidence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass.

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy. In 1939 military theorist Basil Liddell-Hart predicted that 250,000 deaths and injuries in Britain could occur in the first week of war.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose research at St. Helens formed the basis for his doctoral dissertation?, using the article: Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches. Following his death, Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field., what would be the answer ?

Context:  New England went on the road to face division rival New York in the latest meeting between the two teams at the New Meadowlands Stadium. The Jets had lost their opener to the Baltimore Ravens the previous week. The Patriots droved 51 yards in seven-and-a-half minutes to the Jets 14, but after a false-start penalty, Gostkowski missed a 37-yard field goal. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots went on a 15 play, 75-yard marathon, taking over eight minutes off the clock, scoring on a 6-yard touchdown pass to Welker early in the second quarter. After accruing no passing yards during the first quarter, the Jets marched 73 yards in 12 plays, taking just under 7 minutes off the clock, scoring on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Mark Sanchez to Braylon Edwards. Two possessions later, after two incomplete passes, Brady hit Hernandez for a 46-yard catch-and-run, then hit Moss for a 34-yard touchdown pass on an incredible one-handed catch, beating the vaunted Darrelle Revis, re-taking a 14-7 lead. The Jets answered, marching to the Patriots 31, and Nick Folk  was good on a 49-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 14-10 at halftime. After a Jets punt, the Patriots drove to the Jets 47, but Antonio Cromartie intercepted his pass attempt for Moss at the 3. The Jets raced to the Patriots 17, and Folk was good on a 36-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to just 14-13. The Jets cashed in after a Patriots three-and-out, racing 70 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery (with a successful 2-point conversion), taking a 21-14 lead. On the second play of the Patriots next drive, Cromartie intercepted another pass attempt for Moss at the Jets 41, but couldn't move the ball. After forcing the Patriots to punt, the Jets marched 63 yards in 8 plays, aided by a 23-yard pass interference penalty on Darius Butler, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown toss to Dustin Keller, widening the lead to 28-14 midway through the fourth quarter. The Patriots drove to the Jets 16, but Brady was strip-sacked by Jason Taylor with David Harris  returning it 16 yards to the Jets 41. A 3-yard run by LaDanian Tomlinson on 4th-and-1 allowed the Jets ran out the rest of the clock to win the game. With the loss, the Patriots fell to 1-1. The Jets good defense forced the Patriots into three turnovers, two Brady interceptions. Question: Who kicked the longest field goal? Answer:","output":"Nick Folk kicked the longest field goal, which was a 49-yard field goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. feeling happy  B. get hungry  C. learning  D. grow up  E. injury Answer:","output":"B. get hungry When Jimmy and Tim like playing together, they enjoy engaging in various activities that may include games, sports, or other forms of physical and mental exercise. These shared experiences serve a crucial role in fostering camaraderie, enhancing interpersonal relationships, and contributing to their overall well-being. Playing together for an extended period can be physically and mentally demanding, and such an engagement requires energy. As they participate in these activities, their bodies consume energy, which can lead to feelings of hunger. This natural response is primarily due to the body's need to obtain essential nutrients and fuel to continue functioning efficiently. Moreover, taking a break to eat and replenish their energy reserves allows their bodies to recuperate from the exertions experienced during playtime. Beyond merely satisfying hunger, the consumption of healthy meals also provides the necessary vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients that support various critical bodily functions, further emphasizing the importance of addressing hunger symptoms adequately. In conclusion, the most suitable option to answer the question is Option B, get hungry. This choice accurately reflects the biological response of needing nourishment after engaging in prolonged periods of play or physical exertion.

Article: You can completely submerge yourself in any body of water that is higher than you are tall, or that will cover your head when sitting (or even lying down, such as in a wading pool). The most important factor to consider for picking a spot is to observe your surroundings. Always approach holding your breath underwater with caution, especially in a crowded public pool where people are engaged in many different activities and not paying attention to others.  If you want to sink to the bottom of a pool, you may think choosing a spot near the wall is safest. But, remember that people will be entering the water around all edges of a pool. It may be better to find a relatively isolated place, away from where people may be entering the water and away from large groups. Also, keep your distance from the pool drain, which can exert hundreds of pounds of suction and can cause injury and death.Have a friend keep an eye out for you while you’re below the surface. If you’re swimming underwater, keep an eye out for traffic and remember that other swimmers will not necessarily be looking out for you. Ideally you can chart a clear path ahead of you to the other side, one that will stay clear until you get there. If you're in the shallow side of the pool, you will likely be standing. If you're in a part of the pool where the water is higher than you are tall, your body will assume a vertical position with ease as, generally, your lower body will be heavier than your upper body. Do not hyperventilate. Taking several fast breaths in a row before submerging yourself is known as DUBB, \\"dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors\\" and can cause hypoxic blackout, which can lead to brain damage, fainting, and death. Pull your knees in and hold them close to your chest by wrapping your arms around them. This tucked position changes the amount of space you're taking up in the water and will allow you to fall deeper into the water and to more easily remain underwater. Objects, and bodies, sink in water if they have a higher density than the body of water. An object's density depends on its mass and volume--the amount of space it takes up. As such, taking up less space in the water will help you sink. Release air bubbles slowly through your nose. You can let them out of your mouth as well and they can be bigger, but you'll sink faster. You may also do both and let out small bits of air, puffing your cheeks between blowing air out. Let your head and body sink into the water. When your feet hit the bottom of the pool, sit in a comfortable position, such as cross-legged or holding on to your knees in front of you. When you’re ready or running out of breath, look up to make sure nothing and no one is in your way to the pool’s surface. Whether seated or standing, press firmly into your feet and stretch your arms skyward to shoot or swim upwards. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is as follows: When submerging yourself in water, choose a safe and isolated spot away from people and pool drains. Have a friend monitor your safety, and be cautious of other swimmers when underwater. Avoid hyperventilating or engaging in dangerous breath-holding behaviors. To sink effectively, assume a tucked position, release air bubbles slowly, and let your body submerge.

Premise: \\"right right yeah it's nice to get out in the open air and especially when the weather's not too hot or not raining or whatever but uh\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I like the open air during the spring mostly.\\"?","output":"Given the premise, \\"right right yeah it's nice to get out in the open air and especially when the weather's not too hot or not raining or whatever but uh,\\" we can gather some information and make certain inferences about the individual's preferences regarding the open air and its connection to weather conditions. However, it doesn't provide enough evidence to conclude that it directly entails the hypothesis \\"I like the open air during the spring mostly.\\" To analyze this further, let's break down the components of the premise and hypothesis. Premise: 1. The person enjoys being outdoors and experiencing the open air. 2. The person prefers a specific range of weather conditions, i.e., weather not too hot, not raining, or other unfavorable conditions. Hypothesis: 1. The person likes the open air primarily during the spring season. Now, let's try to connect these components. The premise tells us that the individual likes to spend time in the open air and prefers particular weather conditions that are neither too hot nor rainy. From this statement, we can infer that their preference for open-air activities possibly lies within a specific range of temperature and moisture levels. It is thus reasonable to assume that they enjoy spending time outdoors when the conditions are favorable, which often includes balanced temperatures and moderate levels of precipitation or humidity. The given hypothesis asserts that the person likes the open air mostly during the spring season. Spring typically encompasses mild temperatures and moderate precipitation, which aligns with the preference detailed in the premise. However, there are other seasons where the weather conditions might also suit the person's preferences, such as in the mild days of autumn or even during early summer, depending on the local climate.  That said, the premise doesn't explicitly mention any seasonal preferences, nor does it identify spring as the preferred time for outdoor activities. While it is true that spring generally exhibits weather conditions that meet the criteria described in the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is inherently entailed by the premise. There might be other seasons which still fall within the favorable conditions mentioned in the premise.  In summary, the premise gives us an insight into the person's preferences surrounding weather conditions for open-air activities, but it does not provide enough information to ascertain if spring is their favorite and primary season for outdoor ventures. However, we can acknowledge that the spring season aligns with their preferences, but there can be other seasons that might fit their preference as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira.

Title: The Rocketeer Movie plot: In 1938 Los Angeles, two gangsters in Eddie Valentine's gang steal a rocket pack from Howard Hughes. During their escape, they find themselves on an airfield, where they hide the rocket pack, ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord, whose Gee Bee racer was totaled during the accident, and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden in a bi-plane cockpit. Meanwhile, well-known actor Neville Sinclair, who hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the rocket pack is at the airfield. Cliff's aspiring actress girlfriend, Jenny Blake, has a bit part in the latest Neville Sinclair film. On the set, Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket pack, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local air show, Cliff uses the rocket pack (and Peevy's newly designed face-hiding finned helmet) to rescue his friend Malcolm, who is drunkenly piloting a bi-plane. Having been seen by the newsreel press in the airshow audience (and Valentine's gangsters), \\"The Rocketeer\\" becomes a media sensation. Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to find the rocket pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its detailed schematics drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy, trapped by several Valentine mobsters, learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement in the hunt for the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum.[Note 1] At Sinclair's home, Jenny discovers that he is a Nazi secret agent, and Jenny knocks him out. She is later detained and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Information:  - The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year.  - Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. Bears are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.  - Claudius Ptolemy (\\"Klaúdios Ptolemaîos\\", ; ) was a Greek writer, known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168.  - Ursa Major (also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (second century AD), it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It can be visible throughout the year in most of the northern hemisphere. Its name, Latin for \\"the greater (or larger) she-bear\\", stands as a reference to and in direct contrast with Ursa Minor, \\"the lesser she-bear\\", with which it is frequently associated in mythology and amateur astronomy. The constellation's most recognizable asterism, a group of seven relatively bright stars commonly known as the \\"Big Dipper\\", \\"the Wagon\\" or \\"the Plough\\" (among others), both mimics the shape of the lesser bear (the \\"Little Dipper\\") and is commonly used as a navigational pointer towards the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor. The Big Dipper and the constellation as a whole have mythological significance in numerous world cultures, usually as a symbol of the north.  - Polaris, designated Alpha Ursae Minoris (Ursae Minoris, abbreviated Alpha UMi, UMi), commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Ursa Minor (Latin: \\"lesser-Bear\\", contrasting with Ursa Major), also known as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star.  - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant.  - In modern astronomy, the sky (celestial sphere) is divided into 88 regions called constellations, generally based on the asterisms (which are also called \\"constellations\\") of Greek and Roman mythology. Those along the ecliptic are the constellations of the zodiac.  - Amateur astronomy is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the sky, and the abundance of objects found in it with the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes. Even though scientific research is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets and novae.  - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them.  - NGC 4194 , the Medusa merger , is a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major . A region of extreme star formation 500 ly ( 150 pc ) across exists in the center of the Eye of Medusa , the central gas - rich region .  - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names.  - The Big Dipper (US) or Plough (UK) is an asterism consisting of the seven brightest stars of the constellation Ursa Major; six of them are of second magnitude and one, Megrez (), of third magnitude. Four define a \\"bowl\\" or \\"body\\" and three define a \\"handle\\" or \\"head\\". It is recognized as a distinct grouping in many cultures.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was influenced by Slayer?  As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music....

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What element of Revolver did Klaus Voorman design?  Almost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. \\"Christianity will go,\\" Lennon had said. \\"It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\\" The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – on the eve of the group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American \\"Bible Belt\\". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, \\"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\\" Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \\"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\\"As preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.

Information:  - George Dilboy ( Americanized transliteration of Greek name :   ) , ( February 5 , 1896 -- July 18 , 1918 ) , Private First Class , U.S. Army , Company H , 103d Infantry , 26th Division is thought to be the first Greek - American to receive the Medal of Honor during World War I. He led an attack on a machine gun position and continued to fire at the enemy despite being seriously wounded , killing two of the enemy and dispersing the remainder of the gun crew . General John Pershing listed George Dilboy as \`\` one of the ten great heroes '' who \`\` died in the battlefield of France with super-human heroism and valor . '' Dilboy is buried in Section 18 of Arlington National Cemetery .  - Arlington National Cemetery is a United States military cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., in whose the dead of the nation's conflicts have been buried, beginning with the American Civil War, as well as reinterred dead from earlier wars. The United States Department of the Army, a component of the United States Department of Defense, controls the cemetery.  - A battle rifle is a military service rifle that fires a full-power rifle cartridge, such as 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92x57mm Mauser, .303 British, or .30-06 Springfield. Compared to assault rifles and their intermediate cartridges, the higher-caliber rounds provide greater power and range, though they have greater weight and produce stronger recoil, making them less than ideal for fully automatic fire.  - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags  - Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people (usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group) in whole or in part. The hybrid word \\"genocide\\" is a combination of the Greek word \\"génos\\" (\\"race, people\\") and the Latin suffix \\"-cide\\" (\\"act of killing\\"). The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as \\"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\\".  - The Department of the Army (DA) is one of the three military departments within the Department of Defense of the United States of America. The Department of the Army is the Federal Government agency within which the United States Army is organized, and it is led by the Secretary of the Army who has statutory authority to conduct its affairs and to prescribe regulations for its government, subject to the limits of the law, and the directions of the Secretary of Defense and the President.  - A machine gun is a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm, designed to fire bullets in quick succession from an ammunition belt or magazine, typically at a rate of 300 to 1800 rounds per minute. Fully automatic firearms are generally categorized as submachine guns, assault rifles, battle rifles, automatic shotguns, machine guns, or autocannons. Machine guns with multiple rotating barrels are referred to as \\"rotary machine guns\\".  - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.  - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing.  - An autocannon or automatic cannon is a large, fully automatic, rapid-fire projectile weapon that fires armour-piercing or explosive shells, as opposed to the bullet fired by a machine gun. Autocannons often have a larger calibre than a machine gun (e.g., 20 mm or greater), but are usually smaller than a field gun or other artillery. When used on its own, the word \\"autocannon\\" indicates a single-barrel weapon. When multiple rotating barrels are involved, the word \\"rotary\\" is added, and such a weapon is referred to as a \\"rotary autocannon.\\" Modern autocannons are typically not single soldier-portable or stand-alone units, rather they are usually vehicle-mounted, aircraft-mounted, or boat-mounted, or even remote-operated as in some naval applications. As such, ammunition is typically fed from a belt to reduce reloading or for a faster rate of fire, but a magazine remains an option. They can use a variety of ammunition: common shells include high-explosive dual-purpose types (HEDP), any variety of armour-piercing (AP) types, such as composite rigid (APCR) or discarding sabot types (APDS).  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - A submachine gun (SMG) is an air-cooled, magazine-fed, automatic carbine designed to fire pistol cartridges. The term \\"submachine gun\\" was coined by John T. Thompson, the inventor of the Thompson submachine gun.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency.  - The word bullet is a firearm term. A bullet is a projectile expelled from the barrel of a firearm. The term is from Middle French and originated as the diminutive of the word boulle (boullet) which means \\"small ball.\\" Bullets are made of a variety of materials. They are available singly as they would be used in muzzle loading and cap and ball firearms, as part of a paper cartridge, and much more commonly as a component of metallic cartridges. Bullets are made in a large numbers of styles and constructions depending on how they will be used. Many bullets have specialized functions, such as hunting, target shooting, training, defense, and warfare.   - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names.

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes   with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS.          Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors   in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

Write highlights for this article: Surfing was virtually non-existent in Iran when Easkey Britton first traveled to the 'ultra-conservative' country in 2010. The Irish surfer expected to face anger and disapproval in the Muslim nation where televising female sports is forbidden. Just last year,  a woman was jailed simply for watching a men's volleyball match. But the 29-year-old was shocked to discover a welcoming country as eager to learn the sport as she was to teach them. Overwhelmed by the reaction she returned three years later with filmmaker Marion Poizeau and two female Iranian athletes - professional snowboarder Mona Seraji and diver Shahla Yasini. Marion's documentary 'Into the Sea' charts their incredible journey to the shores of Baluchistan, an area considered so deadly 'even Iranians don't go there'. Scroll down for video. First lesson: Easkey Britton (centre) teaches professional snowboarder Mona Seraji (left) and diver Shahla Yasini (right) how to surf. Acceptance: Men, women and children gathered on Baluchistan's beach to watch Easkey (centre) surf. Letting go: The director of 'Into the Sea' Marion Poizeau told MailOnline: 'A lot of them (children) were very shy at first, but by the time we got into the water, that was gone' Baby steps: Professional surfer Easkey (right) believes young Baluchi girls like this 'are no longer on the sidelines' Making waves: One of Easkey's students Shahla Yasini (pictures) prepares for another ride in Baluchistan. Eager to learn: Easkey (right) teaches a group of young Baluchi boys about surfing as professional snowboarder Mona (left) translates. Champion: Easkey Britton (pictured) was introduced to surfing by her father at the tender age of four and won the Irish National Surfing Championships four consecutive times by 2008. Marion told MailOnline: 'In Tehran, people were saying you're crazy to go to Baluchistan because it's considered a very dangerous place. 'So when I screened my film in the capital, people were saying we didn't know you could go to Baluchistan and come back alive.' Despite its fearsome reputation as a site of brutal secular fighting between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, there is little alternative to the region's 60-mile stretch of sand and five foot waves. For the country's surf-obsessed, it is becoming a necessary pilgrimage. A large crowd began to gather during Mona and Shahla's first lesson under Easkey's expert guidance. They predicted some opposition in the remote section of a largely male-dominated country, but the locals in Chabahar were simply intrigued. Women are allowed to wear bathing suits in Iran's female-only swimming pools and baths, but traditional head-coverings are mandatory on public beaches where men are present. Hundreds stormed the beach to watch the three women riding the waves in their wet-suits and hijabs. And soon the Baluchi locals were begging to take part themselves. The growth of the sport means 'Baluchi girls and women are no longer on the sidelines' according to Easkey, a five-time national champion in her native Ireland. She added: 'Fathers are asking me to take their daughters surfing. 'What is most inspiring is the enthusiasm and vision of young people here, with the young women playing an important change-making role, leading the way in a new frontier sport, writing a new narrative full of possibility despite being ignored by the world outside and limited by the constraints of their own country.' Parting gift: Easkey (pictured) presented her surfboard to local lawmaker Yaqoub Jadgal, who said: 'It (sport) is not just for men, women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors' Causing a stir: Hundreds of local Baluchi people gathered for a surfing lesson from Easkey Britton. Leading the way: Easkey Britton (pictured) said: 'What is most inspiring is the enthusiasm and vision of young people here' Going pro: Diver Shahla Yasini rides a wave on the beach in Baluchistan, considered one of the most dangerous places in Iran. Iranian hospitality: Easkey Britton (top right) and her two students Mona Seraji (centre) and diver Shahla Yasini (left) were invited to dine with a local Baluchi family. But her first surf with Mona and Shahla caused quite a stir and when the village elders and a 'powerful' member of parliament requested to meet them Easkey expected the worst. She was again overwhelmed by the tolerance shown by Yaqoub Jadgal, who said: 'Islam recommends sports, which are beneficial both physically and spiritually. It is not just for men, women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors. 'We will ask female instructors to teach women this sport so they can benefit from this art.' The 'thumbs up' from the community's senior figures mirrored the government's acceptance when they allowed for Marion's film to be screened at the Tehran Film Festival last year. It had such a wide-reaching impact she's now involved in a bid to launch the country's first female surfing federation. She said: 'Hopefully we can organise an international event in the future and convince more Iranians to come with us... but we don't know when it's going to happen because the administration is tricky.' The sport's growing popularity has surprised Easkey, who 'never could have imagined' a religiously devout nation could adopt such a progressive sport into their hearts. Big hit: Marion's film 'Into the Sea' (pictured) was screened at the Tehran Documentary Festival last year. Change: The film was received wonderfully by critics after being screened in a country where even televising female sports is forbidden. She says during 'Into the Sea': 'I came here three years ago and there was nobody surfing and now look at it. More and more people are on the beach every day - boys, girls, everyone joining in. 'People say surfing is a selfish pursuit, it becomes kind of like an addiction and all you care about is finding the next perfect wave, but I really don't believe that anymore. 'I think the most powerful thing about surfing is being able to share that passion and connecting people. This is unbelievable.' Marion added: 'It was very exciting the last day, half the village came to watch the girls surf and the kids were very enthusiastic. 'A lot of them were very shy at first, but by the time we got into the water, that was gone. 'It really breaks down the barriers when we go into the water, it's totally different from the beach. It makes people forget about the rules.' Inspired by their own success, Easkey and Marion also set up the non-profit organisationWaves of Freedom. In its own words, the charity 'uses surfing as a medium for empowerment, transforming the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society, especially women and girls'. Through their first project Surf Seeds, they are trying to establish surfing in Baluchistan through the donation of equipment, formal lessons and workshops on how to build and create surfboards. The two women also created the 'We Surf in Iran' group within the local community in Baluchistan. Now, Iranians travel from all over the country to get lessons in the region they were once afraid of. You can watch the film's trailer HERE.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.  Now, I have a new situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors.  Answer this question please: Which student read more about reactant particles being heated?

Sentence 2: Type-3 worksharing is when the mailer decides something is influenced by something other than the size of discount or his cost of work.

The first sentence focuses more on the decision-making process of the mailer and the factors that influence it, whereas the second sentence simplifies the concept into a more general definition. In order to assess the truth of the second sentence based on the first sentence, let's analyze both sentences in detail. Sentence 1: Type-3 worksharing is where the mailer's decision, whether or not he turns the mail over to a competitor, is influenced by factors other than the size of the discount and his cost of doing the work. This sentence explains that Type-3 worksharing involves a mailer's decision-making process, in which the mailer must decide whether or not to hand over mail to a competitor. The factors that influence this decision do not revolve solely around the size of the discount or the mailer's cost of doing the work, suggesting that there are other variables at play. Sentence 2: Type-3 worksharing is when the mailer decides something is influenced by something other than the size of discount or his cost of work. This sentence offers a more simplified explanation of Type-3 worksharing. It states that the mailer's decision is influenced by factors other than the size of the discount and the cost of work, which aligns with the idea presented in the first sentence. However, it doesn't specifically mention the context of turning mail over to a competitor. Instead, it offers a more generalized idea of what factors influence the mailer's decision. Comparing both sentences, we can conclude that the second sentence is indeed true, as it captures the essence of Type-3 worksharing—that a mailer's decision is affected by factors other than the size of the discount and the cost of work. However, it is important to note that while the second sentence is true, it is less detailed and specific compared to the first sentence that provides context in terms of turning the mail over to a competitor. So, it can be said that the second sentence is true, but it offers a less comprehensive understanding of Type-3 worksharing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Deep house's origins can be traced to Chicago producer Mr Fingers's relatively jazzy, soulful recordings \\"Mystery of Love\\" (1985) and \\"Can You Feel It?\\" (1986). According to author Richie Unterberger, it moved house music away from its \\"posthuman tendencies back towards the lush\\" soulful sound of early disco music.Acid house arose from Chicago artists' experiments with the squelchy Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, and the style's origins on vinyl is generally cited as Phuture's \\"Acid Tracks\\" (1987). Phuture, a group founded by Nathan \\"DJ Pierre\\" Jones, Earl \\"Spanky\\" Smith Jr., and Herbert \\"Herb J\\" Jackson, is credited with having been the first to use the TB-303 in the house music context. The group's 12-minute \\"Acid Tracks\\" was recorded to tape and was played by DJ Ron Hardy at the Music Box, where Hardy was resident DJ. Hardy once played it four times over the course of an evening until the crowd responded favorably. The track also utilized a Roland TR-707 drum machine. Club play of house tracks by pioneering Chicago DJs such as Hardy and Lil Louis, local dance music record shops such as Importes Etc., State Street Records, Loop Records, Gramaphone Records and the popular Hot Mix 5 shows on radio station WBMX-FM helped popularize house music in Chicago. Later, visiting DJs and producers from Detroit fell into the genre. Trax Records and DJ International Records, Chicago labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music inside and outside of Chicago. One 1986 house tune called \\"Move Your Body\\" by Marshall Jefferson, taken from the appropriately titled \\"The House Music Anthem\\" EP, became a big hit in Chicago and eventually worldwide. By 1986, UK labels were releasing house music by Chicago acts, and by 1987 house tracks by Chicago DJs and producers were appearing on and topping the UK music chart. By this time, house music released by Chicago-based labels was considered a must-play in clubs.

The Transylvanian city of Brasov is usually just a day trip from Bucharest. People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off.  Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite. In addition to trying local dishes, we also ate lunch at McDonalds.

The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories.  On 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as Emperor, reviving the title in Western Europe, more than three centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899, after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant, Berengar, in 924.  The title was revived in 962 when Otto I was crowned emperor, fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries. Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire, while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning. Scholars generally concur, however, in relating an evolution of the institutions and principles constituting the empire, describing a gradual assumption of the imperial title and role. 1.

Kulwicki grew up in Greenfield, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee known for its Polish-American neighborhoods, near the Milwaukee Mile racetrack. After his mother died, his family moved in with his grandmother, who died when Kulwicki was in seventh grade. A year later, his only brother died of a hemophilia-related illness. Kulwicki attended Pius XI High School, a Roman Catholic high school in Milwaukee, and received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1977. Kulwicki began his racing career as a 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work involved travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying to find someone to transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. \\"I showed him how\\", Gerry Kulwicki said. \\"And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if you do it for a while, you can do it better.'\\"  Many local-level American racetracks host their own season championships. In Wisconsin, numerous locations held dirt and asphalt short track racing. Kulwicki started driving stock cars at the local level at the Hales Corners Speedway and Cedarburg Speedway dirt oval tracks. In 1973, he won the rookie of the year award at Hales Corners Speedway in the Milwaukee suburb of Franklin, and the next year started racing late models - the fastest and most complicated type of stock cars raced at the local level - at the same track. That season, he won his first feature race, at Leo's Speedway in Oshkosh.  Kulwicki moved from dirt tracks to paved tracks in 1977. He also teamed up with racecar builder Greg Krieger to research, model, engineer, and construct an innovative car with far more torsional stiffness than other late models. The increased stiffness allowed the car to handle better in the corners, which increased its speed. Racing at Slinger Super Speedway, he won the track championship in 1977. In 1978, Kulwicki returned to Slinger; that same year he started racing a late model at Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR), finishing third in points in his rookie season at the track. In 1979 and 1980, he won the WIR late model track championships.  In 1979, Kulwicki began competing in regional to national level events sanctioned by the USAC Stock Car series and the American Speed Association (ASA), while remaining an amateur racer through 1980. When Kulwicki raced against future NASCAR champion Rusty Wallace in the ASA series, the two became friends. Kulwicki's highest finish in the ASA season points championship was third place, which he accomplished in both 1982 and 1985, with five career victories and twelve pole positions. Ask a question about this article.","output":"What was Kulwicki's highest finish in the ASA season points championship and how many career victories and pole positions did he have?"},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it’s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next… to turning them into rose petal jam, of course. My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Manufacturers keeping Canadian prices high: retailers Retailers scheduled to meet with Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty on Tuesday say the minister's consumer \\"crusade\\" to bring Canadian and American prices in line is misdirected. Â Diane Brisebois, president of the Retail Council of Canada, which represents 40,000 stores, said Monday her group called for the meeting to explain how prices are set. \\"Although we appreciate that the minister wants to get involved, his so-called crusade is misdirected,\\" Brisebois said, noting Flaherty should put pressure on the manufacturers to lower prices in Canada. Brisebois said manufacturers are continuing to mark up prices in Canada by 20 to 50 per cent, and therefore retailers have little savings to pass on to the customer. \\"The minister needs to put pressure on that community as he has done to retail,\\" she said. \\"He's not talked about the publishing industry; he's talked about booksellers. Well booksellers don't set the price. The publishing industry, the magazine industry, the car manufacturing industry â those are not retailers. Retailers are given a certain price, they have a markup and they sell the merchandise.\\" The loonie hit 1.0207 US in trading Monday morning. But recent price comparisons have shown identical items are often priced more than 20 per cent higher in Canada than in the U.S. Retailers have defended their prices, saying the price difference is linked to high shipping costs and inventory acquired before the dollar hit parity. Last week, two of Canada's biggest retailers â Wal-Mart and Zellers â announced they were dropping prices on some goods to reflect the loonie's rise.Â Eleanor Friedland, vice-president of the Consumers Council of Canada, said Tuesday consumers should continue to push for lower prices, and she urged retailers to respond. \\"Sometimes for good public relations the retailer is doing it, they may call it a sale, or a special day or what have you, but they are doing it,\\" she said. \\"Consumers keep those voices heard.\\" Friedland also noted that prices will only fall if manufacturers act first. \\"I'd like to see Mr. Flaherty take a very strong hand, but I understand the retailers' argument,\\" she said Monday. \\"I want to see Mr. Flaherty speaking to the manufacturers and pushing them. Once he does that, you'll see it come pushing through, and I think it will be across the board.\\"","output":"Canadian retailers argue that Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty's efforts to align Canadian and American prices are misdirected, as he should instead focus on pressuring manufacturers to reduce prices in Canada.

The service was extremely slow, with the waitstaff rarely checking on us and taking way too long to take our order. Throughout the meal, we had to ask for refills multiple times as our glasses sat empty. As for the food, I was even more let down. The lobster, which should have been the star of the meal, was overcooked and dry, lacking any flavor or moisture. Additionally, the side dishes were bland and under-seasoned, making for an utterly forgettable dining experience. Overall, I cannot recommend The Lazy Lobster, as its lackluster atmosphere, poor service, and subpar food left us wanting more – and not in a good way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Instead, Smith walks to the town hotel, run by Joe Monday (William Sanderson) where Smith orders a drink, books himself a room, and arms himself before announcing his intention to petition Finn for damages. Smith enters Doyle's building, finds Finn, and asks him to pay for the damages to his car. Finn mocks him and threatens to shoot Smith. Smith and Finn get in a gunfight, which Smith wins with alarming speed. Smith departs, leaves the remaining gangsters alive as witnesses, and returns to the hotel bar, much to the surprise of Jericho's residents.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging. Question: What is probably true about John?

Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that people should then go on to reduce their meat consumption even further. Pachauri, who was re-elected the panel's chairman for a second six-year term last week, said diet change was important because of the huge greenhouse gas emissions   and other environmental problems associated with raising cattle and other animals. \\"It was relatively easy to change eating habits compared to changing means of transport,\\" he said. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation has estimated that meat production accounts for nearly a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. These are produced during the production. For example, ruminants  , particularly cows, give off a gas called methane, which is 23 times more effective as a global warming agent than CO2. Pachauri can expect some opposite responses from the food industry to his advice, though last night he was given unexpected support by Masterchef presenter and restaurateur John Torode. \\"I have a little bit and enjoy it,\\" said Torode. \\"Too much for any person is bad.

Supreme Court ruled in his favour, backing previous Appeal Court ruling. Employers now cannot ask about certain minor or old convictions. Article:","output":"Title: Supreme Court Ruling Supports Privacy of Minor Convictions in Employment Screening Introduction: In a recent Supreme Court case, the justices ruled in favor of a man, identified only as 'T', who was forced to disclose minor cautions to new employers. This decision has significant implications for job seekers and employers, as this ruling now prevents businesses from asking about certain minor or old convictions during the hiring process. Step 1: Present the issue: The issue at the heart of this case involved 'T', who complained that being forced to reveal past cautions to new employers breached his human rights. Before the Supreme Court's ruling, companies could inquire about an applicant's criminal history, regardless of the seriousness or age of the convictions.  Step 2: Explain the Supreme Court decision: The Supreme Court's ruling supported a previous Appeal Court decision, backing 'T' in his claim that mandatory disclosure of past offences violated his human rights. Justices acknowledged that while businesses have legitimate reasons to ensure the integrity and safety of their workforce, this should not come at the cost of unfairly stigmatizing individuals with minor offences in their past. Step 3: Detail changes to the employment screening process: As a result of this ruling, employers are now prohibited from inquiring about certain minor or old convictions during the hiring process. This change is driven by the belief that individuals should not be continually punished for past mistakes that have already been paid for, provided they have demonstrated rehabilitation and growth. Step 4: Explain potential benefits for job seekers and employers: This ruling is expected to benefit job seekers who have been held back due to the stigma attached to criminal records, especially among those with minor or old convictions. It also promotes fairness in the job market, as all applicants are now granted an equal opportunity to demonstrate their skills and qualifications without the weight of past mistakes. Moreover, employers can benefit from a more diverse and inclusive workforce. Step 5: Provide a conclusion: In conclusion, the Supreme Court's ruling on the matter of disclosing past offences to new employers has created a more equitable environment in the job market. By preventing companies from asking about minor and old convictions, the court has recognized the importance of granting individuals with criminal records a second chance, protecting their human rights, and demonstrating compassion and understanding for those who have demonstrated personal growth and rehabilitation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The continued rush to purchase firearms in Colorado has overwhelmed the system businesses use to track background check wait times and left thousands of would-be gun buyers on wait-lists that are now many days long.      While staff at the Colorado Bureau of Investigation continue to track the time manually, the information is no longer readily available to gun dealers.      The result is that would-be customers no longer know how long they will have to wait to see if a background check clears.      Thousands of customers remain on the wait list at least 100 hours long.      And with a major gun show coming to metro Denver this weekend, those expecting to walk away with a new firearm that day may be in for a surprise.      The uncharted territory in which the state's gun sellers now find themselves stems from unprecedented interest in guns and CBI's online wait-time clock, which tops out at 99 hours and 59 minutes.      Weeks ago, the background-check process took minutes to complete. Now, CBI's processing time has moved beyond that 99-hour-and-59 minute threshold.      This news comes as one of Colorado's largest and longest-running gun shows heads into town. The Tanner Gun Show will be held at the Denver Merchandise Mart this weekend.      \\"This is new,\\" said Ty Blount, co-owner of the show. \\"The process usually take hours to half a day.\\"      Advertisement      Blount said the situation means that dealers will either mail a patron's gun or agree to meet them another time once their background check has cleared.      While he realizes some may be frustrated by the change, it is important a background check be run on every person attempting to buy a gun, he said.      Background checks at gun shows in some other states aren't required — leading to the national call to close the so-called \\"gun show loophole\\" — but in Colorado, that loophole was closed following the Columbine High School shooting.      \\"It's the same whether you're going to a gun show or to Cabela's,\\" Blount said.      While gun buyers flooded CBI with requests for background checks on Black Friday, the latest surge follows the Dec. 14 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and an outcry for more stringent gun-control laws.      Since that time, the bureau has expanded its hours of operation from 6 a.m. to midnight, said spokeswoman Susan Medina.      About 3,000 checks are being submitted a day — \\"these are unprecedented numbers,\\" Medina said on Sunday.      For perspective, on Dec. 15, there were 573 background checks for firearm purchases in the CBI queue, Medina said. Wait times were just over 15 minutes.      Background checks are cross-referenced through federal and local law-enforcement databases.      Checks to be processed will remain in the system until they are approved or denied, Medina said.

Cars queued up for blocks at the drive-through events, with the city giving cards worth up to 100 for handguns, shotguns and rifles, and up to 200 for assault weapons. There was a bit of haggling involved, but the guns were all taken.      \\"What do you got?\\" an officer in Van Nuys asked a man in his late twenties as he pulled up in a green Mazda.      Photos: L.A. gun buyback      \\"Just one handgun, I've had it since high school,\\" the man replied.      \\"Will you take 50 for this?\\"      \\"Sure.\\"      Many came bearing more than one gun. They pulled 22 pistols from the trunk of one white Honda, a haul that earned the driver 1,000.      Two men in a pickup truck with two children in the back seat handed over a rifle, a pistol and a MAC-12, altered with a silencer.      Organizers and some participants credited collective outrage and anguish over the gun rampage in Newtown, Conn., for the turnout. But motivations were often a bit more complicated.      \\"That young guy shot up all the kids and they blamed the mama because the mama had the weapons in the house,\\" Valerie Butler said, in explaining why she was waiting in line two hours in South Los Angeles to get rid of an old handgun.      Yet Butler, 50, said she was not getting rid of both of her guns.      \\"Just one,\\" she said, and laughed. \\"There's a bunch of nuts out here, and they're coming in when you're sleeping. You got to protect yourself.\\"      Cities across the nation, grasping for ways to react to a series of mass shootings this year, have organized gun buybacks to get weapons off the street.      Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa pushed the city's annual event from Mother's Day to Wednesday in reaction to the killing Dec. 14 of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. By the afternoon, the event had already surpassed the 1,673 guns collected last year, and officials were scrambling to get more gift cards, which were donated by Ralphs.      Many of the drivers said they were turning in their guns because they rarely used them and were eager to snag grocery cards.      \\"If I could get 100 of free groceries, it's worth it,\\" said Charles Edwards, 60, waiting in line next to his old .22 revolver after driving to Los Angeles from Fontana. \\"I wouldn't do it for 40. That's why people are here. They feel bad about all that's happening, but times are tough.\\"      He still has a shotgun at home. \\"That's all I need,\\" he said.      Edwards said authorities needed to better organize the buyback so the lines weren't so long. He watched numerous people sit in line for a spell, then just drive away, he said. \\"I thought I could just drop this thing off. They need to have this move faster.\\"      Most of the weapons recovered were \\"mom and pop guns,\\" police said — hunting rifles, shotguns — but they got a few dozen assault weapons as well.      They checked to make sure the guns were empty, and double-checked by pulling the triggers in clearing barrels — metal rubbish containers filled with sand. Then they put them into trash containers like bundles of sticks after a windstorm.      \\"I had a question, one after another: 'Do we really need this? Does this really make us safer?' \\" Villaraigosa said at a news conference at the Sports Arena. \\"I say, 'Look, the Police Department is here because they believe in this program.' \\"      He said the buyback program had taken in 8,000 guns since it began in 2009 and was just one part of a comprehensive police strategy that has reduced violent crime in recent years. Police Chief Charlie Beck said it was a critical component.      One of the first guns collected was a camouflage Bushmaster XM-15, the same kind of gun used at Sandy Hook Elementary.      But this was one of the rarities. Loretta, 50, from South Los Angeles was bringing in her great-grandfather's antique rifle — one of them anyway. \\"I got the other well-hidden,\\" she said.      Alex Reyes, 47, rode his bike to the Sports Arena from East L.A. with a 68-year-old, six-shot .38 revolver and a .22 target pistol. He said he came in to do \\"a good deed\\" after the Newtown shooting, getting rid of all of his weapons. \\"Just me and Jesus Christ,\\" he said.      Sandra Lefall, 38, came to the site with Newtown heavy in her heart. She had been thinking about coming since she first heard the awful news. \\"I'm bringing in a 9-millimeter handgun because I want to get it out of the house because I have teenage children. I would hate for them to do what that guy in Connecticut did.\\"      By 2 p.m. in Van Nuys, the police began telling people they were out of gift cards.      \\"I'm not giving this away for free,\\" said Sam Ferrell of Reseda as he took a drag of his cigarette in his truck.      Ferrell said he was hoping to sell his stepson's handgun. \\"There are too many kids being killed by these things,\\" he said.      He said he didn't plan to turn in any of his own guns, but that he was glad his stepson didn't have his.      \\"I need my gun, but not everyone who has one needs one,\\" he said.      joe.mozingo@latimes.com      wesley.lowery@latimes.com ||||| Before 20 small children were massacred at school by a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut, Luke Schuster, 6, was shot to death in New Town, North Dakota. Six-year-olds John Devine Jr. and Jayden Thompson were similarly killed in Kentucky and Texas.      This undated photo provided by Robert Sullivan shows Veronica Moser-Sullivan, the youngest person slain in the July 20 attack that left 12 dead and dozens wounded during the Aurora theater shootings.... (Associated Press)      FILE - This Dec. 16, 2012 file photo shows President Barack Obama pausing during a speech at an interfaith vigil for the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, at Newtown High School in... (Associated Press)      Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6, died in a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, while 6-year-old Kammia Perry was slain by her father outside her Cleveland home, according to an Associated Press review of 2012 media reports.      Yet there was no gunman on the loose when Julio Segura-McIntosh died in Tacoma, Washington. The 3-year-old accidentally shot himself in the head while playing with a gun he found inside a car.      As he mourned with the families of Newtown, President Barack Obama said the U.S. cannot accept such violent deaths of children as routine. But hundreds of young child deaths by gunfire _ whether intentional or accidental _ suggest it might already have.      Between 2006 and 2010, 561 children age 12 and under were killed by firearms, according to the FBI's most recent Uniform Crime Reports. The numbers each year are consistent: 120 in 2006; 115 in 2007; 116 in 2008, 114 in 2009 and 96 in 2010. The FBI's count does not include gun-related child deaths that authorities have ruled accidental.      \\"This happens on way too regular a basis and it affects families and communities _ not at once, so we don't see it and we don't understand it as part of our national experience,\\" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.      The true number of small children who died by gunfire in 2012 will not be known for a couple of years, when official reports are collected and dumped into a database and analyzed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects to release its 2011 count in the spring.      In response to what happened in Newtown, the National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun lobby, suggested shielding children from gun violence by putting an armed police officer in every school by the time classes resume in January.      \\"Politicians pass laws for gun-free school zones ... They post signs advertising them and in doing so they tell every insane killer in America that schools are the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk,\\" said NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre.      Webster said children are more likely to die by gunfire at home or in the street. They tend to be safer when they are in school, he said.      None of the 61 deaths reviewed by The Associated Press happened at school.      Children die by many other methods as well: violent stabbings or throat slashings, drowning, beating and strangulation. But the gruesome recounts of gun deaths, sometimes just a few paragraphs in a newspaper or on a website, a few minutes on television or radio, bear witness that firearms too, are cutting short many youngsters' lives.      One week before the Newtown slayings, Alyssa Celaya, 8, bled to death after being shot by her father with a .38-caliber gun at the Tule River Indian Reservation in California. Her grandmother and two brothers also were killed, a younger sister and brother were shot and wounded. The father shot and killed himself amid a hail of gunfire from officers.      Delric Miller's life ended at 9 months and Angel Mauro Cortez Nava's at 14 months.      Delric was in the living room of a home on Detroit's west side Feb. 20 when someone sprayed it with gunfire from an AK-47. Other children in the home at the time were not injured.      Angel was cradled in his father's arms on a sidewalk near their home in Los Angeles when a bicyclist rode by on June 4 and opened fire, killing the infant.      Most media reports do not include information on the type of gun used, sometimes because police withhold it for investigation purposes.      Gun violence and the toll it is taking on children has been an issue raised for years in minority communities.      The NAACP, a civil rights group, failed in its attempt to hold gun makers accountable through a lawsuit filed in 1999. Some in the community raised the issue during the campaign and asked Obama after he was re-elected to make reducing gun violence, particularly as a cause of death for young children, part of his second-term agenda.      \\"Now that it's clear that no community in this country is invulnerable from gun violence, from its children being stolen ... we can finally have the national conversation we all need to have,\\" said Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP.      This year's gun deaths reviewed by the AP show the problem is not confined to the inner city or is simply the result of gang or drug violence, as often is the perception.      Faith Ehlen, 22 months, Autumn Cochran, 10, and Alyssa Cochran, 11, all died Sept. 6. Their mother killed them with the shotgun before turning it on herself. Police said she had written a goodbye email to her boyfriend before killing the children in DeSoto, Missouri, a community of about 6,300.      In Dundee, Oregon, Randall Engels used a gun to kill his estranged wife Amy Engels and son Jackson, 11, as they ate pizza on the Fourth of July. An older sibling of Jackson's also was killed. Engels then committed suicide. The town of more than 5,000 people boasts on its website that it is a semirural town with \\"the cultural panache of a big city.\\"      Many of the children who died in 2012 were shot with guns that belonged to their parents, relatives or baby sitters, or were simply in the home. Webster said children's accidental deaths by guns have fallen since states passed laws requiring that guns be locked away from youths or have safeties to keep them from firing.      But even people trained in gun use slip up _ and the mistakes are costly.      A Springville, Utah, police officer had a non-service gun in his home that officials said did not have external safeties. His 2-year-old son found the gun and shot himself on Sept. 11. The names of the father and son were not released at the time of the shooting.      Obama has tapped Vice President Joe Biden to shape the administration's response to the Newtown massacre. The administration will push to tighten gun laws, many that have faced resistance in Congress for years. The solutions may include reinstating a ban on assault-style rifles, closing gun buying background check loopholes and restricting high-capacity magazines.      Those may have limited effect for children like Amari Markel-Purrel Perkins, of Clinton, Maryland. He shot himself in the chest on April 9 with a gun that an adult had stashed inside a Spiderman backpack.      Like most of the child victims at Newtown, Amari was 6.      ___      Follow Suzanne Gamboa at http://www.twitter.com/APsgamboa      Follow Monika Mathur at http://www.twiter.com/@monikamathur ||||| Arizona’s top law enforcement official wants to allow one staffer in each of the state’s schools to carry a gun, a proposal pitched as a “golden mean” between allowing all teachers to carry weapons and doing nothing.      Attorney General Tom Horne, a Republican elected in 2010 with the motto “Defending Arizona,” has proposed a voluntary program in which every school could nominate one person to receive free firearms training provided by local sheriffs and the attorney general’s office. The individual would be allowed to keep a weapon in a locked place somewhere on campus.      Text Size -      +      reset      “The ideal solution would be to have an armed Police Officer in each school,” Horne said in a statement on Wednesday. “…It may not be possible to afford a Police Officer in every school. In that case, the next best solution is to have one person in the school trained to handle firearms, to handle emergency situations, and possessing a firearm in a secure location. This proposal is analogous to arming pilots on planes.”      Republican state lawmakers throughout the country have proposed allowing concealed carry on school grounds or arming some teachers in the wake of the Newtown Massacre, which left 20 children dead at a Connecticut elementary school. But teachers’ unions have aggressively fought such proposals, with two top national unions saying the focus should be on “ways to keep all guns off school property.”      The NRA has proposed placing an armed guard in every school in the country.      Arizona has some of the nation’s weakest gun laws. It is one of only two states — the other is neighboring Utah — with scores of zero from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.      A press release announcing the plan argues it represents a “golden mean” between “doing nothing” and allowing another massacre and arming all teachers, “which could create more dangers than it prevents.”      Ariz. House Majority Leader David Gowan will introduce the proposal in the legislature, according to the press release, which also said Horne’s plan had the cooperation of three county sheriffs.      Horne previously served as the state’s schools Superintendent from 2003 to 2011. ||||| Classroom teachers could stop school shootings by carrying concealed weapons, say gun-rights advocates who plan to offer the required training Thursday for 200 Utah teachers.      The Utah Shooting Sports Council said it would waive its 50 fee for concealed-weapons training for the teachers. Instruction featuring plastic guns is set to begin at noon Thursday inside a conference room at Maverick Center, a hockey arena in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley.      It's an idea gaining traction in the aftermath of the Connecticut school shooting. In Ohio, the Buckeye Firearms Association said it was launching a test program in tactical firearms training for 24 teachers initially.      \\"Schools are some of the safest places in the world, but I think teachers understand that something has changed _ the sanctity of schools has changed,\\" said Clark Aposhian, one of Utah's leading gun instructors. \\"Mass shootings may still be rare, but that doesn't help you when the monster comes in.\\"      Gun-rights advocates say teachers can act more quickly than law enforcement in the critical first few minutes to protect children from the kind of shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. In Arizona, Attorney General Tom Horne has proposed amending state law to allow one educator in each school to carry a gun.      Educators say Utah legislators left them with no choice but to accept some guns in schools. State law forbids schools, districts or college campuses from trying to impose their own gun restrictions.      \\"We're not suggesting that teachers roam the halls\\" for an armed intruder, said Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's leading gun lobby. \\"They should lock down the classroom. But a gun is one more option if the shooter\\" breaks into a classroom.      A major emphasis of the safety training is that people facing deadly threats should announce they have a gun and retreat or take cover before trying to shoot, he said.      Utah is among few states that let people carry licensed concealed weapons into public schools without exception, the National Conference of State Legislatures says in a 2012 compendium of state gun laws.      Utah educators say they would ban guns if they could and have no way of knowing how many teachers are armed. Gun-rights advocates estimate that 1 percent of Utah teachers or 240 are licensed to carry concealed weapons. It's not known how many pack guns at school.      \\"It's a terrible idea,\\" said Carol Lear, a chief lawyer for the Utah Office of Education, who argues teachers could be overpowered for their guns or misfire or cause an accidental shooting. \\"It's a horrible, terrible, no-good, rotten idea.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"The rush to purchase firearms in Colorado has overwhelmed the system used to track background check wait times, leaving thousands of potential gun buyers on wait-lists that are now several days long. The background-check process, which previously took minutes to complete, now takes over 100 hours, due to the unprecedented interest in gun purchases and the capacity limit of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's online wait-time clock. Gun shows in the state, such as the Tanner Gun Show in Denver, are adapting by having dealers either mail patrons' guns or agree to meet them another time once their background check has cleared."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Lina Stauffenberg stood on a corner outside the U.S. Supreme Court on a brilliant but unseasonably chilly early spring day and defined marriage as that between a man and a woman. \\"A father and a mother is best for children,\\" she said. Laura De Nardis and Deborah Smith stood arm-in-arm near the same spot. \\"We want equality under the law,\\" De Nardis said unequivocally as she wrapped an arm around her partner. 5 things we learned from the justices. Stauffenberg, De Nardis and Smith not only stood apart literally, but also sharply illustrated the divide making history inside the high court -- the question of whether same-sex marriage can be prohibited under the law. As the justices weighed legal arguments over an appeal of California's same-sex marriage ban, demonstrators packed sidewalks around the ornate Supreme Court building. They were jammed shoulder to shoulder as speeches rang out from a makeshift stage. Demonstrators from both sides pumped their fists waved homemade signs. Some broke into chants while others led a small parade that snaked between the crowd. The mood was festive overall. Police cleared the roads and maintained access to the court but otherwise kept a low profile. Grass ringing the court grounds was trampled to mud, which covered the sidewalk. Shoeprints were everywhere. The public sentiment outside the marble court seemed to mirror recent polling showing a growing awareness around the issue, and stronger support for same-sex marriage specifically. A decision that could change America. According to the CNN/ORC International survey, 57% say they have a family member or close friend who is gay or lesbian, up 12 points from 2007. Also, the number of Americans who support same-sex marriage has risen by almost the same amount over the same period - from 40% in 2007 to 53%. \\"It's time that gay and lesbian couples have the same rights as straight couples,\\" says said Olga Liapis-Muzzy, who was outside the court with her partner of three years, Emily Gosnell. Some of those gathered recognized a momentous event. \\"It's a historic day. I want to be a part of history,\\" said Scott Nelson, a New Jersey history teacher who arrived at the Supreme Court at 2 a.m. Someone yells to same-sex marriage supporters: \\"What do we want?\\" They respond: \\"Equality!\\" The person again implores: \\"When do we want it?\\" \\"Now!\\" is the answer. Same-sex marriage opponents were vocal, too. Hear and read the arguments in full. Chris Simon of Maryland owns a detailing company, and held a sign that read: \\"Say No to Same-Sex Marriage.\\" \\"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. This is the way God planned it. Two men and two women can't reproduce. That's going against word of God,\\" he said. Carl Boyd Jr., is a Christian Conservative radio host from Nashville. Dressed in a suit, Boyd debates a woman and a man and then walks away. He then stood on the edge of the crowd. \\"I am out here to stand with the institution of marriage between one man and one woman,\\" he said. \\"Gay rights and civil rights are not the same thing,\\" he added later. As he spoke, however, supporters for same-sex marriage continue to wave signs and cheer. Across the street music starts to play from a boom box and some of the younger supporters of same-sex marriage begin to dance. Soon, the arguments are over inside and lawyers and spectators walk out of the court. People begin to cheer and snap pictures. Those who were inside smiled back and took pictures of the crowd. The symbol that took over social media.

It highlights the divide amongst the public regarding same-sex marriage, with people on both sides demonstrating, expressing their views, and engaging in debates. 1. Lina Stauffenberg, a protester believing in traditional marriage between a man and a woman, stands firmly for her belief that \\"a father and a mother is best for children.\\" 2. Laura De Nardis and Deborah Smith, a same-sex couple, want \\"equality under the law\\" and stand arm-in-arm outside the Supreme Court. 3.

The answer to the question: Who does woman that the outlaw wants to marry still love? is inside the article: Notorious outlaw Wes McQueen breaks out of jail and heads off to the Colorado Territory to meet the man who arranged the escape, his old friend Dave Rickard. Along the way, the stagecoach he is riding in is attacked by a gang of robbers. When the driver and guard are both killed, McQueen kills or drives off the remaining gunmen, earning the gratitude of the other passengers, dreamer Fred Winslow and his daughter Julie Ann. Winslow has bought a ranch sight unseen and looks forward to making his fortune. McQueen arrives at the ghost town of Todos Santos, where Reno Blake and Duke Harris are waiting for him, along with Reno's part-Indian girlfriend, Colorado Carson. After looking them over (and not liking what he sees), he heads off to a nearby town to meet an ailing Rickard, who asks McQueen to pull off one last big train robbery so they can both retire. With the exception of Rickard, McQueen distrusts everybody else in the gang, including ex-private detective Pluthner, who recruited Reno and Duke, and Homer Wallace, the railroad informant. McQueen wants to go straight, but agrees to do the job out of gratitude and friendship. While waiting for the robbery, McQueen decides to keep Colorado with him to avoid stirring up trouble between Duke and Reno.

Article: Think you're too busy to learn another language? Well, you're not the CEO of a 205 billion company, and apparently, even this rather demanding job leaves plenty of time to learn some serious Mandarin.      Case in point: the – video that Mark Zuckerberg just posted to, yes, Facebook. It shows off his 30-minute Q&A at Tsinghua University in Beijing in which he answered every question exclusively in Chinese.      I don't know Mandarin, so I can't say how well he spoke. But the audience was decidedly thrilled. The crowd gasped and applauded as soon as he started speaking, and the good vibes appeared to last throughout the chat. Of course, the 21st century's most fabled boy-genius entrepreneur could probably speak to business school students in pig Latin and still get a rapturous response.      Zuckerberg's proficiency would appear to be the positive result of one of his annual self-improvement challenges. Every year, Zuckerberg picks a skill or a goal to pursue with extreme focus. This year, the plan was to write one thoughtful thank-you note every day. In 2010, his aim was to learn Mandarin.      The effort seems to have paid off in a whole lot of good will from his audience at Tsinghua, where he said he also just joined the board of the university's School of Economics and Management. But the ultimate purpose of Zuckerberg's charm offensive is probably much more ambitious. Right now, Facebook is still banned in China. Maybe next year, his goal will be to get it unblocked. Maybe he can promise the Chinese government a nice thank-you note—written in Mandarin. ||||| In case you were wondering if there is anything Zuck can’t do, there’s seemingly not.      Beyond donating more than 50% of his wealth to charity and rocking a hoodie, the billionaire computer programmer just proved he can speak Chinese.      Facebook FB, +0.24% CEO Mark Zuckerberg did his first ever public Q&A in Mandarin on Wednesday at Tsinghua University in Beijing, according to his Facebook page.      Zuckerberg studied Chinese in order to please his wife’s grandmother who doesn’t speak English, according to a 2011 report from China.org.      In case you don’t know Chinese, Zuckerberg wrote that he “discussed connecting the world, Internet.org, innovation and the early days of Facebook” in the video.      But just how good is Zuckerberg’s Chinese?      Even if his accent indeed is not great, most people agree the Q&A was still pretty impressive. ||||| Whether part of a bid to get Facebook unblocked or, as he professes, because he “wants to study Chinese culture,” founder Mark Zuckerberg awed the internet on Wednesday (Oct 22) with a 30-minute interview at Beijing’s Tsinghua University—in Mandarin. “Mark Zuckerberg nails a Q&A in Chinese like it’s no big deal,” gushed the Silicon Valley Business Journal, observing that he “slayed the crowd.” The Facebook clip of the interview—posted without subtitles—elicited like upon like from adoring fans, noting how “impressive” he was. Behold the first two minutes:      Zuckerberg’s aplomb is indeed impressive. And for someone of his Mandarin level, speaking for 30 minutes and fielding questions isn’t easy. But those blown away by Zuck’s Chinese chinwag might want to know that though he’s clearly memorized a lot of relevant words, those were still shoehorned into a distinctly American-English grammatical order. Pronunciation is also a problem: He showed a plucky disregard for the tones that Mandarin has—one tonal slip-up had him saying that Facebook boasts eleven mobile users instead of 1 billion—and his enunciation was roughly on par with the clarity possible when someone’s stepping on your face.      That said, Zuckerberg didn’t shy away from some tougher topics—and he even tried a few jokes. And regardless of the slip-ups, his audience clearly loved the fact that he made an effort. Here are the most insightful nuggets from Zuckerberg’s interview:      The internet is very important: “The majority of people who don’t have internet, don’t have the internet because they don’t know why they want to use the internet. If you asked me—sorry, if I asked you—if you didn’t have a phone, computer or internet and I asked you, ‘Do you want to use internet?’ You maybe would ask me, ‘Why do I want internet?’ So a lot of problems. But… internet creates work opportunities and economic development. Very important.”      His three reasons for studying Chinese: 1) to speak with his grandma-in-law and other inlaws; 2) China is a great country, and he wants to study its culture; 3) Chinese is hard, and he loves challenges.      The next big things in tech: “Facebook is 10 years old this year. So if I ask 10 years from now, what should we develop? I decided we should develop three things. First, we need to connect the entire world. We need everybody to use the internet. Second, we want to develop (in English) artificial intelligence. I think 10 years from now computers will be better than humans at reading, listening, talking, and other things. So we are developing this. Third, when everyone is using mobile phones, I believe the next platform will be (in English) virtual reality. Oculus is the first product, but we hope there will be many products. Those three things.”      Advice to entrepreneurs: If it fails, try again. “I feel that the best companies are started not because the founder wanted a company but because the founder wanted to change the world…. If you decide you want to found a company you maybe start to develop your first idea. And hire lots of workers. But you maybe have lots of ideas and you don’t know which one is best. If the first idea isn’t good, then your company isn’t good. But if you decide to change the world you should try to develop more ideas. If any idea is very good later you found the company.”      Facebook’s plan in China: “We’re already in China. We help Chinese companies grow their customers abroad. They use Facebook ads to find more customers. For example, Lenovo used Facebook ads to sell its new phone. In China I also see economic growth. We admire it. (in English) It’s, it’s…amazing. We want to help other parts of the world connect to China, such as large cities, national parks, (in English) um, yeah.”      His favorite color: “I can’t choose red or green, because Facebook is blue!”      Advice to founders: don’t give up. “I think the best thing to do is not give up. Founding a company is hard. Most of it isn’t smooth. You’ll have to make very hard decisions. You have to fire a few people. Therefore, if you don’t believe in your mission giving up is easy. The majority of founders give up. But the best founders don’t give up. Therefore, believe in your mission and don’t give up—very important.”      Is his Chinese better than his (Chinese-Vietnamese-American) wife Priscilla’s? “In Chinese, I know more words. But she also speaks Cantonese. Her listening is better than mine. Mine is really awful. One day I asked her why my listening was so bad and she said ‘your listening is bad in English, too.'”      Here’s the full 30-minute interview: ||||| Add a location to your Tweets      When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Learn more ||||| The filmmaker Laura Poitras is concerned with the human effects of surveillance. She wants to understand what pervasive and sometimes aggressive American intelligence gathering does to people. And she wants to understand the human beings who have created it, run it, and become disillusioned by it -- men who now find themselves at war with the system. In her new film, Citizenfour, we get unprecedentedly close to the human source -- Edward Snowden -- of revelations that have rewritten the way that large parts of the world understand the nature of American intelligence, surveillance, and power.      And then Poitras pulls us back.      Poitras, a journalist and documentary filmmaker, is one of the foremost chroniclers of the U.S. war on terror, and Citizenfour is the third in a trilogy of movies examining the human costs of that conflict. (Its title refers to Snowden's moniker when he first contacted Poitras.) Poitras now lives in Berlin, where she is part of a growing expat community working on digital privacy issues. Together with Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist, she serves as the primary conduit for Snowden leaks.      It bears saying that the former NSA contractor indicted in the United States under the Espionage Act chose Poitras, whose work he admired -- particularly her short video for the New York Times -- and knew she had some facility with technical encryption. As someone who has written about Snowden since he first appeared in the summer of 2013, I think the choice of Poitras as an interlocutor was the best of all his wildly successful gambits. Snowden and Poitras first had contact with one another in January 2013; it can be easy to forget how incredible it is that they weren't caught by the NSA. That's a technical feat for which Poitras deserves much of the credit.      Citizenfour is the most complete account of how their relationship developed. It is a story of great daring, one that dabbles in a conspiracy theorist's paranoia and indeed provides a more human portrayal of Snowden. It is not a neutral film in the old-fashioned, journalistic sense of the word -- and that's not a bad thing.      It can be divided into three parts: before Snowden, with Snowden, and after Snowden. B.S. features Bill Binney -- the legendary NSA crypto-mathematician turned whistleblower -- and Greenwald, who argues about civil liberties from his home in Brazil. It also features the Internet activist and hacker Jacob Appelbaum, one of the film's more interesting characters, teaching left-wing activists about electronic surveillance.      Then Snowden appears, much like a bolt of lightning. And with his arrival, Poitras must negotiate her role as a character in her own film. This is a very serious problem for Poitras, for whom appearing in her own work is anathema. Poitras is deeply aware of the observational problem of documentary filmmaking, of the way that the camera's presence alters the reality or truth being filmed. It's a conundrum with an analog in quantum mechanics: The measurement problem.      That she has authored multiple, award-winning articles based on Snowden-provided material further complicates Poitras's entanglement with Snowden. Snowden, then, is someone whom she has to protect as a source and expose as a subject. That's something of a filmic quandary.      Poitras's solution is acting as a semi-passive observer, having the camera at her hip, not blocking her face. \\"The camera doesn't have to be a barrier,\\" she told the New Yorker. \\"It's a witness.\\" In Citizenfour, she appears most as a disembodied voice, reading eerie messages she received from Snowden via encrypted channels.      By my count, Poitras makes one visual appearance in the film: When Greenwald and Poitras first meet Snowden in a Hong Kong hotel, she is caught briefly in a mirror reflection. That moment comes just as the audience meets the source, Snowden, for the first time. He sits on a bed, disheveled, a little dazed, and obviously nervous. The effect is like a shock of the new: This thing that we thought we knew completely presented at a moment just prior to his (public) birth. He has no idea what's coming. It's an incredible piece of footage, which also captures the intimacy of Poitras's cinematic technique.      The movie's high point comes when it's just Poitras and her subject in a hotel room. A talking head on BBC argues in the background that Snowden could have been pulled out of a book by the spy novelist John le Carré. Snowden walks around the room in a black suit jacket and black pants. He tries to get his hair to stay in place with some gel. It doesn't go well. He holds up a green umbrella before a mirror, considering his disguise for escaping the hotel. Too much, he decides. It's a lovingly shot scene. Poitras sees Snowden as a human being. For a moment it's not Snowden \\"the leaker,\\" Snowden \\"the whistleblower,\\" Snowden \\"the traitor.\\" Instead, just a goofy guy, one far removed from the world of le Carré.      And then, just as abruptly as he arrived, Snowden goes underground to seek asylum and, eventually, with the help of WikiLeaks, lands in Moscow. With the protagonist gone, the film sags a bit. Snowden reappears via encrypted chat. But he is distant, more removed. Greenwald moves to the forefront. His testimony to Brazilian lawmakers on U.S. surveillance is of a different register than the poetic footage from Hong Kong. One lives again the drama of the Snowden revelations as they played out on cable television. It's less riveting footage than meditations on Snowden's psyche in Hong Kong's neon dreamscape.      Perhaps as a result, the portrait of Snowden ends up feeling incomplete. The film ends back in Moscow -- after Snowden has secured asylum and the aftermath of his revelations has been documented on screen -- with a meeting between Snowden and Greenwald, who reveals that he has acquired a new source high up in the U.S. intelligence bureaucracy. And so it becomes a film with an easy moral message: Snowden did this for pure purposes at immense risk to himself, and it has resulted in more like him stepping forward. That may very well be true, but it's so unmessy that it's almost unbelievable.      The more complicated aspects of Snowden's personality come as a footnote. We get a brief shot, filmed with a long lens so it feels like they are surveilled, of Snowden and his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, cooking dinner together. That Mills traveled to Moscow to be with Snowden is the film's only real revelation, but she never appears in the movie as a subject. Mills was reportedly willing to go on camera but Poitras turned her down out of an apparent desire to keep the film focused on Snowden and, one senses, the \\"issues.\\" When Snowden appears in Hong Kong chatting with his girlfriend on his laptop, Poitras retreats. We don't know what they say to one another.      Therein lies the point at which Poitras retreats from her subject, perhaps to protect him. And, sure, it would be invasive to ask Snowden to tell us what he's typing out to his girlfriend. But these are the conundrums of trying to establish interiority in a documentary film. And given Poitras's humanistic commitments, it's surprising that she didn't explore this relationship further.      Perhaps more surprising is her unwillingness to more directly confront a bigger question hanging over Snowden: whether the use of illiberal means can ever be justified as a defense of the liberal state. Unmentioned in the film are the Chinese and Russian intelligence services, which move through its background. These organizations have similar, if not as expansive, capabilities as their counterparts in the United States, to say nothing of their ability to imprison political opponents and use physical violence against detainees with impunity. And some of Snowden's revelations did not just deal with the gathering of intelligence against Americans but also with operations against countries such as Iran and Pakistan, both of which have deplorable human rights records and sponsor or condone violence outside their own borders.      And therein lie the questions about Snowden that Poitras -- perhaps too close to the man -- cannot answer. Snowden, as he was presented to the public, remains so uncomplicated that he feels flat. Some of America's intelligence work is indeed deplorable, but so are the intelligence operations of other countries. What the film lacks is how Snowden grappled with the question of how one deplorable thing differs from another.      And in the absence of a more rounded portrait of him, conspiracies flourish. Circumstantial arguments are made about how he is a Russian agent and was recruited long ago. The wild theories don't quite add up -- which is in part why they thrive -- but his defenders don't have a lot of material at their disposal to rebut them either.

The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea.

At theatres  , cinemas and concerts   you can put on anything you like: from beautiful suits and dresses to jeans and sweaters. Anything goes, as long as you look clean and tidy. But in Britain, as well as in the US, men in offices usually wear suits and ties and women wear dresses or skirts (not trousers). Doctors and business people always wear quite formal clothes. And in some hotels and restaurants men have to wear ties and women have to wear tidy dresses. In many ways, Americans are less formal than British people, but they are more careful with their clothes. At home, most Americans wear informal   or sports clothes. But when they go out in the evening, they like to look nice. In good hotels and restaurants, men have to wear jackets and ties, and women have to wear pretty clothes.

The outlaws have stolen the father's grey horse with a double SS brand. Max sets out to avenge their deaths and uses this clue to trail the men. During his travels in the desert, Max uncovers an old and rusty gun. When he comes upon Jonas Cord, Sr, a traveling gunsmith, he tries to rob him. Cord,  recognizing that Max's revolver is not loaded and is useless, convinces Max that his plan has failed. Max tells Cord of his vengeful journey. Cord takes pity on him, takes him in, feeds him and teaches him how to shoot. Max hunts the killers, who have separated. He tracks down Jesse Coe to Abilene, Texas. With the help of dancehall girl Neesa, a woman from the same tribe as his mother, he confronts him in a salon. Coe escapes and a knife fight ensues in a nearby corral. Coe is killed but Max is severely wounded. Neesa takes him to her tribe's camp, where she nurses him back to health. They become lovers. Once he recovers, Max leaves Neesa to continue his pursuit. He reads that Bowdre is in a prison camp in Louisiana for a failed bank robbery. He commits a bank robbery, deliberately gets caught, and is sent to the same prison where Bowdre is serving time. Bowdre does not recognize Max whose plan is to convince Bowdre to join him in an escape attempt and kill him in the swamp. Pilar, a local Cajun girl working in the rice fields near the convicts' camp, gives Max comfort. She knows nothing about Max's plan to kill Bowdre but knows her way around the swamp.

After their brutal act, the outlaws also stole the grey horse with a double SS brand belonging to Max's father. This horse served as a major clue to Max in his vengeful journey as he trailed the outlaws who had separated after their crime. During his journey, Max came across an old, rusty gun that was, however, not loaded and thus useless. His path crossed with a traveling gunsmith named Jonas Cord, Sr, whom he initially intended to rob.

Even though Coe initially escaped and a knife fight ensued between the two, Max ended up mortally wounding Coe. However, in this fight, Max himself was severely injured but was taken care of by Neesa, and the two developed a romantic relationship. After recovering, Max, in his consistent pursuit of revenge, left Neesa and learned about Bowdre's presence in a prison camp in Louisiana.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), one of the asylum's orderlies, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. At the moment she is lobotomized, Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster.

A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case states that \\"the air isn't able to be filtered.\\" If this scenario were to occur, it could significantly impact the process of oxygen being brought into the body. The filtration of air is crucial for removing harmful particles, allergens, and pathogens, as well as ensuring that adequate levels of oxygen reach the lungs for proper oxygenation of the blood.  If the air isn't filtered, several potential issues could arise: 1. Airborne contaminants could enter the respiratory system, leading to respiratory infections, illness, and inflammation. This may, in turn, compromise the lungs' ability to effectively absorb oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, indirectly affecting the overall oxygen availability for the body. 2. The presence of unfiltered air might also interfere with the natural process of gas exchange. If harmful particles and irritants are present due to the lack of filtration, the delicate surfaces of the alveoli in the lungs may be damaged, preventing optimal gas exchange and reducing the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed and delivered to the body. 3. Additionally, the immune system's response to heightened levels of contaminants could lead to inflammation and a reduced ability to take in oxygen, creating further difficulties in oxygenating the body.

In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  Two countries used different methods to produce their energy. Albania used fossil fuels, while Croatia used Nuclear fission.  Which country caused more acid rain?","output":"Based on the information provided, we can determine that Albania, which used fossil fuels to produce energy, likely caused more acid rain than Croatia, which used nuclear fission. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are known to release various pollutants into the atmosphere when burned to generate electricity. One of the primary pollutants emitted is sulfur dioxide (SO2). When sulfur dioxide combines with water vapor and other substances in the atmosphere, it forms sulfuric acid, a primary component of acid rain. Acid rain can have numerous harmful effects on ecosystems, soil, and water sources. On the other hand, nuclear fission is a relatively clean process in terms of air pollution and acid rain. Nuclear power plants do not emit sulfur dioxide or other harmful substances that would contribute to the formation of acid rain. Instead, they produce electricity by splitting the nucleus of radioactive elements, such as uranium or plutonium. While nuclear fission does produce radioactive waste, which presents its own set of environmental and health concerns, it does not directly contribute to acid rain. As a result, we can deduce that Albania, which relied on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs, likely caused more acid rain than Croatia, which utilized nuclear fission for energy production."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:Если вы хотите восстановить свою внешность, вам нужно порезать стиль. Solution:","output":"Part #1: Given a sentence in Russian Usage: \\"Если вы хотите восстановить свою внешность, вам нужно порезать стиль.\\" This is a sentence in Russian that discusses the need to change one's style to improve their appearance. It meets the criteria since it is a complete thought expressed in the Russian language. Part #2: Generate a new Russian sentence by performing small changes Usage: \\"Если вы хотите улучшить свою внешность, вам стоит изменить стиль.\\" Here, the input sentence has been slightly altered to convey the same meaning with different words, changing \\"восстановить\\" to \\"улучшить\\" and \\"порезать\\" to \\"изменить\\". These replacements preserve the message of the input sentence while changing its form. Part #3: Changes are semantically related and syntactically similar to the input Usage: In the suggested sentence, \\"улучшить\\" is semantically related to \\"восстановить\\" as both imply improving one's appearance. Similarly, \\"изменить\\" is also related to \\"порезать\\" as both denote change, although in a different context. These changes reflect the original sentence's structure and meaning while ensuring that they are different enough to be considered as a new sentence. Part #4: The generated sentence should have high commonsense plausibility Usage: The generated sentence, \\"Если вы хотите улучшить свою внешность, вам стоит изменить стиль\\", conveys the message that if a person wants to enhance their appearance, they should consider changing their style.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Sudden Impact tends to be treated as Eastwood's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director. The reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support. In some places it actually owes more to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry film. One might argue if that is so- at the end of the day it's a film about guilt, justice and retribution. For me, at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy. However, in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film. Forget the \\"Go ahead punk, make my day scene\\", that's iconic but not original. But look at the views of San Fransisco taken from the air, zooming in on the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where Sondra Locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital. Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. So all in all Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is as a director. And if I remember correctly it was actually the first time Eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology. Also, I think this is the first well paced film Eastwood directed. Although Eastwood has enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy etc.) Thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive.

Re-population of the recently vacated Arab dwellings by Jews had been official policy since at least December 1948, but the process began slowly.  The Israeli national plan of June 1949 designated al-Majdal as the site for a regional Urban area of 20,000 people. From July 1949, new immigrants and demobilization soldiers moved to the new town, increasing the Jewish population to 2,500 within six months. These early immigrants were mostly from Yemen, North Africa, and Europe. During 1949, the town was renamed Migdal Gaza, and then Migdal Gad. Soon afterwards it became Migdal Ashkelon. The city began to expand as the population grew. In 1951, the neighborhood of Afridar was established for Jewish immigrants from South Africa, and in 1953 it was incorporated into the city. The current name Ashkelon was adopted and the town was granted Local council (Israel) status in 1953. In 1955, Ashkelon had more than 16,000 residents. By 1961, Ashkelon ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers with a population of 24,000. This grew to 43,000 in 1972 and 53,000 in 1983. In 2005, the population was more than 106,000.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump, after a tactical retreat this week on immigration policy, demonstrated Friday that there is no strategic shift to his overall tough approach to those attempting to illegally enter the country, and vowing to \\"end the immigration crisis, once and for all.\\" U.S. immigration laws, Trump declared, are \\"the weakest in the history of the world.\\" Trump made the remarks in an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, where he presided over an event with so-called \\"Angel Families,\\" those who have had relatives killed by people who entered the country illegally. \\"Your loss will not have been in vain,\\" the president told the families, who held large photos of their slain relatives. \\"We will secure our borders … the word will get out. Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children. Question: After this story, the Angel Families probably still: Answer: Options are: [A]. feel immigrants are less likely to commit a crime. [B]. condemn Trump for the zero tolerance policy. [C]. condemn the media for ignoring the stories of victims. [D]. not enough information.

Stimuloitu emissio Could you please translate this to English?","output":"\\"Stimuloitu emissio\\" is a Finnish term that translates to \\"stimulated emission\\" in English.  Stimulated emission is a quantum mechanical process in which a particle, such as an electron or an atom, is induced to emit radiation by external factors, such as the interaction with electromagnetic fields. This process is a significant aspect of lasers (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) and masers (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) technologies. In these devices, a population of particles is excited to a higher energy level through various methods, such as illumination with light or electrical pumping. When an incoming photon interacts with an excited particle (atom or molecule), the particle may be stimulated to emit an additional photon with the same energy (wavelength), phase, and direction as the incoming photon. This process of photon-induced emission is called stimulated emission. As more emitted photons interact with other excited particles, a chain reaction occurs, and the process continues, amplifying the intensity of light or electromagnetic radiation. The concept of stimulated emission was first proposed by Albert Einstein in 1917, but it wasn't until the 1950s and 1960s that it led to the development of masers and lasers. Lasers have diverse applications in various fields, including medicine, telecommunications, entertainment, military, and scientific research. In summary, \\"stimuloitu emissio\\" translates to \\"stimulated emission\\" in English, a fundamental principle in the functioning of lasers and masers, which contribute significantly to technology and advancements in numerous fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Tiger Woods has been clubbed into the long grass by EA Sports after the games manufacturer ended its association with the world's most famous golfer. Woods, 37, won the last of his 14 major titles back in 2008, but this year returned to world No.1 after replacing Rory McIlroy at the top of the rankings. There were 14 editions of the video game bearing his name, which was played by millions of golf fans across the world. Writing on EA's official website, the company's vice-president and general manager Daryl Holt commented: \\"EA Sports and Tiger Woods have made a mutual decision to end our partnership, which includes Tiger's named PGA Tour golf game. We've always been big fans of Tiger and we wish him continued success in all his future endeavors. \\"EA Sports golf fans have always loved authentic courses and players, but they've also asked for more choice and customization in how and where they play.\\" EA had previously stuck with Woods through his acrimonious divorce in August 2010 at a time where several other sponsors severed ties with the American. Gatorade, AT&T and Accenture and Tag Heuer all withdrew sponsorship or did not renew their deals following the revelations of Woods' infidelity and subsequent divorce from Elin Nordegren -- costing him 20 million in earnings. From the endorsements he held in 2009, just two remain: Nike, which teamed up with Woods when he turned professional in 1996; and NetJets, a plane ownership-sharing company. \\"For most mortal sportsmen, losing the EA deal would constitute a real body blow. At an estimated 6.2 million a year, it's a very significant chunk of change,\\" Sami McCabe, CEO of Clarity PR, told CNN. \\"However, Tiger Woods is in a unique category in terms of earning potential from sponsorship deals -- particularly from his sportswear sponsor Nike, which ensures he dwarfs the majority of his peers -- in any sport. \\"So I don't see this news being a source of sleepless nights from a financial perspective. However, it might be the cause of concern for the longevity and sustainability of 'Brand Tiger.' \\" According to market tracking company NPD Group, EA sold 771 million worth of games boasting the Tiger Woods name. DFC Intelligence, a consulting firm which deals with the gaming market, states that EA made 3.79 billion last year -- with its Battlefield and Madden NFL games the top sellers. But while the loss of the EA partnership should not cause major damage to the Woods brand, McCabe does believe the move remains significant. \\"Losing a marquee sponsorship deal says two things: first, he's no longer the force he once was on the golf course; and secondly, EA will no doubt be replacing him with someone else,\\" he said. \\"Rory McIlroy would seem the most obvious choice -- assuming his form picks up. So this might be perceived as the first major step in a changing of the guard. \\"Losing EA Games won't make much of a dent on Tiger's bank balance, but it does make a dent on his ubiquity. \\"And that ubiquity is the single biggest reason why he's able to command such astronomical sponsorship deals. \\"That said, a couple of major wins would surely turn the tide back in his favor.\\" EA started making golf simulation games back in 1990, with PGA Tour golf coming out on PC, Amiga and the Sega Megadrive. In 1998 it produced the \\"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 99\\" which became a huge hit on Playstation and blazed the trail for further success. But in recent years EA has begun to take a step back, with the 2010 cover of the game the first to feature another golfer alongside Woods -- Northern Ireland's rising star McIlroy. A few months later on a newer version it simply showed Augusta, home of the Masters, with no trace of Woods on the cover. Rickie Fowler joined Woods on the front of \\"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13\\" in the U.S., while Arnold Palmer was used in the latest version.","output":"1.
