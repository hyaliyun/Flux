Step 1: Understand each statement - \\"Crowd of people standing outside\\" indicates that there is a group of individuals gathered in an outdoor area. - \\"The area is devoid of life\\" suggests that there is no sign of living organisms in a particular region. Step 2: Compare the two statements Compare these two statements to see if they are logically consistent with each other. Since there is a crowd of people standing outside, this means that there are living organisms (humans) in the area. Therefore, it cannot be true that the area is devoid of life. Conclusion: \\"The crowd of people standing outside\\" does not mean \\"The area is devoid of life\\" because people are living organisms and their presence contradicts the notion that the area lacks life."},{"instruction":"Q:- These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots and passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Chlorophyll absorbs the sun&#x27;s energy - It is this energy that is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen is released from the leaves into the atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are used to form glucose or food for plants. What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process described above, which is a simplified explanation of the process of photosynthesis in plants, is the absorption of water by the plant roots. Photosynthesis is a vital process for plants to produce glucose through the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, which is ultimately used by the plant as a source of nourishment. A detailed understanding of this first step involves several sub-steps: 1. Water absorption: Plant roots are responsible for absorbing water and essential nutrients from the soil. The root system is formed by the main root (called the tap root) and numerous lateral (branching) roots, which spread out and penetrate the soil to access its resources. The root hairs, which are extensions of the root epidermis, are crucial in facilitating the absorption process by increasing the surface area for water and nutrient uptake. 2. Osmosis: Water moves into the roots through a passive transport process called osmosis, driven by a difference in concentration of water molecules in the soil and the plant root cells. The water potential (an indication of the free energy of water molecules) is generally lower in the root cells than in the soil, which causes water to move into the root tissues. Osmosis ensures that the plants obtain a steady supply of water for their survival and growth. 3. Transportation through the xylem: Once absorbed by the roots, the water travels through specialized vascular tissues called xylem, which are responsible for conducting water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the other parts of the plant. The xylem consists of elongated, dead cells called tracheids and vessel elements, which form a continuous network of interconnected tubes. The water in the xylem moves upwards through a combination of processes, such as capillary action, root pressure, and transpiration pull. In summary, the first step of the described process, which is integral to the overall process of photosynthesis, consists of the absorption of water by plant roots, followed by its transportation through the xylem vessels in the stem to reach the leaves, where the subsequent steps of photosynthesis occur. This step is essential for providing the raw materials and maintaining the hydration necessary for the energy conversion and synthesis of glucose in plants."},{"instruction":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

The resulting sound of the band was a mixture of progressive rock, folk rock, and fusion with classical elements. Along with High Tide and East of Eden, Curved Air were one of the first rock bands after It's a Beautiful Day and the United States of America to feature a violin. Curved Air released eight studio albums, the first three of which broke the UK Top 20, and had a hit single with \\"Back Street Luv\\" (1971) which reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. Context: Having retained a good working relationship, Sonja Kristina and Mike Wedgwood formed a new band with Kirby Gregory (electric guitar), Eddie Jobson (keyboards, violin), and Jim Russell (drums). Jobson had come from a band called Fat Grapple, who had been one of Curved Air's support acts on tour. This new band played a much more conventional brand of rock than the former Curved Air, with almost none of the classical influences of that group. However, on the suggestion of manager Clifford Davis, they continued using the name Curved Air so as to give them a commercial leg up. Kristina later commented: What I wanted to do with the band at the time was get more of a rock edge to it, and Kirby's guitar playing really excited me - he was just really wild. And Jim was the same way, a very solid rock drummer. Mike and I really wanted to continue, and it was our manager Clifford Davis who said we would do a better business continuing to call the band Curved Air. So we kept the name and followed along the same pattern as before, as a writer's band. Everybody in the new band contributed material except for Jim Russell, who really wasn't a writer. Before it had mainly been Darryl and Francis, but I had managed to get some of my compositions in. The use of the Curved Air name was not enough, however. Whereas all three of the original Curved Air's albums had broken the UK top 20, the new band's sole album, Air Cut, failed to even chart. Due to artistic differences with Jobson, Kirby Gregory and Jim Russell both left the group to form Stretch. Warner Brothers realized that the current Curved Air was in essence not the same band they had signed, and so the remaining trio recorded a demo tape for the label. The demos failed to convince Warner Brothers, and they discontinued the contract. (These demos were later issued as part of the Lovechild record.) With no contract and only half a lineup, in summer 1973 Curved Air broke up. Jobson replaced Eno in Roxy Music, while Wedgwood joined Caravan. Question: How did that demo do. Whats the answer?","output":"The demo that Curved Air recorded for Warner Brothers didn't do well.

Movie title: Beneath Still Waters Movie plot: Studying under a disciple of Aleister Crowley, the leader of an upper class group invokes a supernatural force that slowly devours the village of Marienbad and its inhabitants, threatening to spread beyond its geographical limits. The mayor from the town nearby commissions the building of a dam which would flood the valley and therefore submerge the village forever sealing the evil force under water after leader and his followers were incapacitated to be kept from escaping. However, fate ensured the leader's freedom as he remained in the depths when the waters covered Marienbad. Now 40 years later an array of disappearances and deaths in mysterious circumstances are threatening the town next to the reservoir that now covers Marienbad. A:","output":"In the movie \\"Beneath Still Waters,\\" the leader and his followers were incapacitated due to several factors that contributed to their inability to escape the consequences of their actions. The following points provide a detailed explanation of why the leader and his followers were incapacitated: 1. The power of the supernatural force: The leader, who studied under a disciple of Aleister Crowley, invoked a powerful supernatural force that overwhelmed and consumed the village of Marienbad and its inhabitants. The strength and uncontrollable nature of this force may have played a significant role in incapacitating the leader and his followers, preventing them from escaping the ill effects of their own actions. 2. The villagers' resistance: While the leader and his followers may have been under the impression that they controlled the supernatural force, the villagers, as well as the mayor from the nearby town, may have taken steps to counteract the leader's influence. They may have managed to immobilize the leader and his followers using means opposing the supernatural force. 3. The construction of the dam: In an attempt to protect the surrounding areas from the malevolent force, the mayor commissions the building of a dam which would result in flooding the valley where Marienbad is located. This action may have caught the leader and his followers off-guard, incapacitating them as a result of being unprepared for such a drastic measure. 4. The leader's eventual entrapment: While fate played a role in allowing the leader to survive the inundation of Marienbad, the fact that he remained submerged within the depths of the water for 40 years indicates that he may have been incapacitated due to factors such as drowning, lack of sustenance, or immobilization. As the supernatural force was controlled by the leader, it would make sense that his followers were also incapacitated by the same factors. They, too, may have suffered from the consequences of their actions, the villagers' resistance, and the construction of the dam, leading to their inability to escape the flooding of Marienbad. Now, 40 years later, the leader's return results in a series of mysterious disappearances and deaths, threatening the nearby town. The incapacitation of the leader and his followers serves as a key plot point in the movie's story, highlighting the consequences of delving into supernatural forces that are far beyond human control."},{"instruction":"Just the boy is sitting in a chair doesn't mean he is tired.

Cloud computing is a term used to describe the delivery of computing services, such as storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, over the Internet. These services are provided by remote data centers owned and maintained by third-party companies. Cloud computing allows users and organizations to access various resources and applications through the internet without having to invest in building and maintaining their own physical infrastructures. This provides a wide range of benefits, such as flexibility, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and reliability. There are several types of cloud computing models, including: 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): In this model, a cloud provider offers virtual machines, storage, and networking resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. Users can rent these resources, eliminating the need to buy and maintain physical servers and networking equipment. Examples of IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS provides users with a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. This allows developers to focus on writing code rather than managing servers, storage, and networking components. Examples of PaaS providers include Microsoft Azure App Service, Google App Engine, and Heroku. 3. Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS is a distribution model where a third-party provider hosts and maintains applications and makes them available to users over the internet. Users can access these applications from anywhere, usually through a web browser, without the need to install or maintain any software. Examples of SaaS applications include Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365, and Google Workspace. 4. Function as a Service (FaaS): Also known as serverless computing, FaaS allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. In this model, the cloud provider automatically manages all the resources needed to run the application, and users pay only for the compute time they consume. Examples of FaaS providers include AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions. In conclusion, cloud computing refers to the use of remote, unspecified computer servers for storing and processing data, providing significant benefits to individuals and organizations in terms of flexibility, scalability, cost savings, and reliability."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

Let's consider each option and evaluate how it relates to the couple's concern: 1. Bad feelings: Divorce can cause children to experience bad feelings such as sadness, anger, and confusion. This option is a possibility. 2. Emotional distress: Divorce can cause significant emotional distress for children, as they may struggle to adjust to the changes and experience feelings of insecurity. This option is also a strong possibility. 3. Richer: Divorce will potentially affect the financial situation of the family but being \\"richer\\" seems unlikely. Additionally, it doesn't address the couple's concern regarding the well-being of their children. This option can be ruled out. 4. Freedom: Divorce might bring some sense of freedom to the couple, but it doesn't directly address their concern for the children. While children could potentially experience more freedom with two separate households, it doesn't reflect the main issue the couple wants to avoid. This option can be ruled out. 5.

As the 15th anniversary of the horrific attacks approaches Sunday, the political world is bitterly divided on how to address terrorism and national security. Donald Trump dominated the GOP primaries after breaking with key elements of his party's post-9/11 ethos. He blamed former President George W. Bush, whose original response to the attacks sent his approval ratings to historic highs, for the terrorist strike. And Trump has proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States.

Basketball games can be really fun and sometimes surprising things happen during them. In the fourth quarter, when everyone was watching the game very closely, a fan in the audience decided to do something a little bit wild and silly. This fan really wanted to meet a famous basketball player named Kyrie Irving, who was playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers. So, instead of waiting until the end of the game or trying to meet Kyrie somewhere else, the fan thought it would be a good idea to run onto the basketball court while the players were still playing! Everyone was so surprised to see the fan running onto the court. But the people who make sure everyone is safe at the basketball game, called security guards, were very fast and smart. Within just a few seconds, they gently tackled and handcuffed the fan to make sure that nobody got hurt. A camera was also there to capture this unexpected moment. People watched the video later and thought it was very strange and funny. This was actually the second time that something like this had happened to Kyrie Irving during a basketball game this season.

Options: - get punished - vengeance - going to prison - joy - going to jail reasoning:","output":"If you kill people, the most likely outcomes are: 1. Going to prison or jail: When a person commits murder, they will typically face arrest by law enforcement and be sent to jail or prison. In most jurisdictions around the world, taking another person's life is considered a serious crime that is punished with long-term imprisonment or, in some cases, the death penalty. Reasoning: Legal systems are designed to protect the rights and safety of individuals, and taking someone's life is a serious violation of those rights. As a result, the legal consequences are severe and aimed at deterring such behavior. 2. Get punished: In addition to imprisonment, a person who kills someone could also face other punishments such as fines, community service, or the loss of certain rights, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case. Reasoning: Punishment is used not only as a deterrent but also as a way to hold individuals accountable for their actions and the harm they caused to others. 3. Vengeance: It is possible that the friends or family members of the person killed may seek revenge against the killer. This course of action is not legal or advisable, but it could happen in some situations. Reasoning: When grief and anger become overwhelming, individuals might decide to take justice into their own hands, despite the legal repercussions. While some individuals might experience a temporary sense of joy or relief after committing murder, this option is not a guaranteed or universal outcome. Furthermore, the other consequences outlined above are generally more significant and long-lasting consequences of taking someone's life. It is crucial to remember that taking any life is a grievous act, and the consequences can be irreversible and life-altering for all parties involved. The best course of action is always to find non-violent solutions to conflicts and problems."},{"instruction":"This is some data: Camp Hill POSTAL_CODE 10970.

In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Sardou In the text, it says \\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer.\\" Victorien Sardou is the person who warned that other composers were interested in adapting La Tosca."},{"instruction":"Question: If I want to keep my floor covering down, what should I put the tack in?

Agrippina's motive to marry Claudius was primarily driven by her ambition to secure power and future prospects for her son Nero, whom she bore from her previous marriage to Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. Agrippina persuaded Claudius to adopt Nero as his own son and nominate him as his successor, despite Claudius already having a natural son, Britannicus. As Agrippina consolidated her power, rumors spread that she became involved in a series of poisoning plots, the most infamous being the poisoning of her husband, Emperor Claudius. It is believed that in 54 AD, Agrippina had Claudius poisoned by giving him a dish of deadly mushrooms or adding the poison to his food during a banquet. This plot to eliminate Claudius was driven by her fear that he might favor his biological son Britannicus over her son Nero for succession. Once Claudius died, Nero was declared the next emperor. With her son on the throne, Agrippina attained significant power and influence during Nero's early reign. However, this did not last, as Nero later eliminated anyone, including his mother, whom he perceived as threats to his authority. In conclusion, Agrippina the Younger married her uncle, the Roman Emperor Claudius, and is rumored to be the mastermind behind his poisoning. This notorious intrigue was part of her ambitious plan to secure the throne for her son, Nero, and exercise significant influence in the Roman Empire."},{"instruction":"Title: The best razor for all legs!

Where would he go to plug in? Here are possible answers to this question: - toy store - basement - school - rest area - building I believe the correct choice is \\"rest area\\", here's why: A:","output":"Indeed, the correct choice is \\"rest area\\". Here's why: An RV (Recreational Vehicle) typically needs to connect to an external power source for many of its electrical systems to work effectively, such as cooking appliances and other amenities. In order to plug in an RV for electricity, the owner would need to find a location equipped with RV hookups or designated RV parking areas, which provide electrical outlets to connect to. Out of the given options, a rest area is the most appropriate place for John to plug in his RV for electricity. Rest areas, also known as service areas or travel plazas, are strategically located along highways and major roadways. They are specifically designed to accommodate travelers by providing various amenities, including restrooms, fuel stations, food options, and RV parking spaces with electrical hookups. These facilities are intended to make long-distance travel more comfortable and convenient. The other options provided are not suitable for plugging in an RV: 1. Toy store: A toy store is a retail establishment that sells toys and games to customers and is not designed to cater to RV travelers. Electrical hookups suitable for RVs would not be available there. 2. Basement: A basement is a subterranean level of a building, often used for storage or living spaces. It is not suitable for parking or hooking up an RV, due to space constraints and lack of appropriate electrical connections. 3. School: Schools are educational institutions where students attend to learn various subjects. While schools may have large parking lots, they are unlikely to have designated RV hookups or parking spaces. 4. Building: A generic building is an enclosed structure used for various purposes, but it is unlikely to offer RV hookups or designated parking for RVs unless it is a specific type of establishment, such as an RV park or campground. In summary, John can plug in his RV at a rest area with designated RV parking spaces and electrical hookups, ensuring his RV gets the needed electricity so that he can cook his lunch."},{"instruction":"Une partie importante de ces aspects devrait être rendue publique, bien que j'admette que certains détails techniques doivent rester confidentiels.

Alberta's mother Mary, a strong-willed and compassionate woman, started researching everything she could about anemia, determined to find a way to improve her daughter's health. Her father, John, took Alberta to countless medical appointments, seeking the best treatment possible. Alberta's younger brother James also wanted to help. Despite his young age, he felt responsible for his sister because he had always been her protector. James started tagging along with Alberta and their father to every medical appointment, constantly asking questions and listening keenly to what the doctors had to say. During this entire journey, Alberta's family made it a point to remain positive and focused on promoting Alberta's emotional well-being. They believed that if Alberta had a strong, positive mindset, it would only give her the best chance to combat the weakening anemia. Together, they tackled Alberta's anemia head-on, and their powerful, unified support gradually helped her regain her health. With time, Alberta started feeling better and was able to return to her normal life. She knew, though, that this would not have been possible without the unwavering love and strength provided by her family. Through this trial, the bonds between Alberta and her family only grew stronger than ever. They learned that it was not just the limitations of their bodies, such as Alberta's anemia, that defined their strength. The strength of their love and unity as a family truly outshined any physical weaknesses they faced. In the end, it was the anemia that was weak, as it stood no chance against a family so full of love and determination. Alberta would forever be grateful for her family's support and knew she could always count on them, no matter what challenges life threw their way."},{"instruction":"Global investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston, or CSFB, has announced the appointment of former Merrill Lynch banker Zhang Liping as its country head for China.

Q: Paragraph: The ability to use double-stranded RNA to inhibit gene expression sequence-specifically (RNA interference, or RNAi) is currently revolutionizing science and medicine alike. Numerous pre-clinical studies are evaluating RNAi as a novel therapeutic modality in the battle against gain-of-function autosomal dominant diseases, cancer, and viral infections. One emerging concern is that RNAi mono-therapies might ultimately fail to control viruses that can escape silencing by mutation and/or RNAi suppression. Thus, sophisticated strategies are being developed that aim to avert viral resistance by combining RNAi effectors with each other or with further gene expression inhibitors. Several reports already validate this new concept of \\"combinatorial RNAi\\" (coRNAi) and illustrate its versatility by describing co-expression of RNAi triggers directed against single or multiple, viral or cellular, targets. Other studies document the successful delivery of these triggers with additional RNA-or protein-based silencers. Moreover, vectors have been engineered to blend RNAi-mediated gene inhibition with conventional gene replacement strategies. Collectively, these efforts open up exciting new therapeutic avenues but could also augment the inherent risks of RNAi technology, including immune responses, off-targeting, and oversaturation of endogenous pathways. Here, we critically review all coRNAi strategies and discuss the requirements for their transition into clinical application.

According to a research report appearing in the April 2015 issue of The FASEB Journal, fenofibrate, also known by the brand name Tricor®, may benefit a wide range of health issues, such as pain, appetite stimulation, nausea, as well as immune and various psychiatric and neurological conditions. This suggests that fenofibrate may be the starting point for a new class of cannabis-like drugs to treat these types of conditions. \\"By illustrating the relationship between fenofibrate and the cannabinoid system, we aim to improve our understanding of this clinically important drug,\\" said Richard S. Priestley, Ph.D., a researcher involved in the work from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nottingham Medical School in Nottingham, United Kingdom. \\"Our study provides the basis for the investigation of new drugs targeting these important receptors.\\" To make this discovery Priestly and colleagues cultured cells containing cannabinoid receptors and exposed them to a tracer compound, which binds to cannabinoid receptors. They found that fenofibrate was able to displace the tracer, suggesting that it also binds to the receptors. Furthermore, they discovered that fenofibrate actually switched the cannabinoid receptors \\"on,\\" not only in these cells, but also in sections of intestine. This led to the relaxation of the tissue in a way that mimicked what marijuana does. Despite the fact that fenofibrate has been used for many years, and its mechanism of action was presumed to be through a completely different family of receptors, this suggests that at least some of the effects of fenofibrate may be controlled by cannabinoid receptors. Furthermore, these cannabinoid receptors may be a future target for drugs used to treat pain and a variety of immune and psychiatric diseases. \\"It may be difficult to persuade people in Colorado, Washington, and the District of Columbia that there are people who want the beneficial effects of marijuana without actually getting high,\\" said Gerald Weissmann, M.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal, \\"but there are people who do not want to get stoned just to get the relief that marijuana brings.

This discovery indicates that fenofibrate could be the starting point for a new class of cannabis-like drugs to treat these types of conditions. The research was conducted at the University of Nottingham Medical School, where researchers cultivated cells containing cannabinoid receptors and exposed them to a tracer compound. Fenofibrate was found to bind to the cannabinoid receptors, and it even activated these receptors in certain cells and sections of intestine. This activation led to the relaxation of the tissue in a way that resembled the effects of marijuana. This suggests that at least some of the effects of fenofibrate may be controlled by cannabinoid receptors, which in turn may be a future target for drugs used to treat pain and a variety of immune and psychiatric diseases. The findings have broad implications, especially for those who seek the medicinal benefits of cannabis without experiencing the psychoactive effects. According to Dr. Gerald Weissmann, editor-in-chief of The FASEB Journal, \\"this new work suggests that possibility.\\" This research not only expands the potential uses of fenofibrate, but also further highlights the potential applications of cannabis-like drugs in the treatment of various health conditions."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve -5*y + 2*y = 9 for y.

Sir Georg Solti, (born György Stern; 21 October 1912 – 5 September 1997) was a Hungarian-born orchestral and operatic conductor, best known for his appearances with opera companies in Munich, Frankfurt and London, and as a long-serving music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Born in Budapest, he studied there with Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner and Ernő Dohnányi. In the 1930s, he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini. His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis' influence on Hungarian politics, and being of Jewish background he fled the increasingly harsh Hungarian anti-Jewish laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist. After the war, Solti was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In 1952 he moved to the Oper Frankfurt, where he remained in charge for nine years. He took West German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the Covent Garden Opera Company, London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels.

Her political heyday may be long gone, but the same gravitas was instantly recognisable in Lady Thatcher during a rare public outing last week to enjoy the spring sunshine in a London park. Accompanied by Kate, her ever-faithful carer of the past ten years, the 86-year-old former prime minister sat contentedly watching a group of boys playing football. She was in remarkably good spirits, happy to chat with admirers who stopped to speak to her as she relaxed on a park bench. To the evident delight of Lady T, a young hound which had been sprinting around the park jumped up on to the bench. She didn’t hesitate to stroke the dog affectionately. Contented lady: Baroness Thatcher was immaculately dressed and in good spirits during a visit to a London park. As ever, Lady Thatcher was dressed immaculately, this time in her favourite long green overcoat with a lemon yellow scarf and mitten gloves. Her make-up was flawless. A hairdresser, who visits at least once a week, ensures those distinctive blonde tresses — though whiter than they once were — are never out of place. But it was the comfortable sandals, rather than elegant heels and padded shoulders — the signature of her days in Downing Street — which betrayed her advancing years and unsteadiness on her feet. A walking stick perched at the end of the bench was another indication. But, in typically Thatcherite fashion — refusing to accept any sign of weakness (particularly in others), she often stubbornly refuses to use the stick. Still fiercely proud, the woman who used to survive on four hours’ sleep a night makes few allowances for her own physical frailties. Firm friends: Baroness Thatcher seemed to delight in the company of a dog that bounded over to her. Lady Thatcher — who was Britain’s. longest-serving prime minister in more than a century and, of course,. the first and so far only woman to conquer the summit of British. political life — has suffered a series of strokes in recent years, which. triggered the onset of dementia. Her. mental frailty was the theme of the controversial recent film, The Iron. Lady, which focused on her twilight years. (Neither she nor her son and. daughter, Sir Mark and Carol, have seen the movie.) Nowadays, Lady Thatcher spends most of her time in her elegant four-storey home in Belgravia with Kate, a trained private nurse, who works full-time with the former PM. Kate also lives in, serving as Lady Thatcher’s cook, her dresser and, most importantly, devoted friend and companion. Another carer, a Yorkshire-born nurse called Anne, has also been employed in the past six months to share the responsibilities. And the police protection officers are never far away. Aside from the odd visit to the park,. there are also occasional lunches at Lady Thatcher’s favourite Goring. Hotel, also in Belgravia, where Kate Middleton and her family stayed. the night before the royal wedding. Only. two weeks ago, she was there with Mark Worthington, who was her. personal private secretary for almost 20 years. But, most days, she is. simply content to sit at home in her favourite armchair in the drawing. room, listening to classical music. She. skims the newspapers, watches the news on television — although her. favourite television programme is Songs Of Praise — and reads selected. mail. Hundreds of letters pour into her House of Lords office each week,. and she still signs books and photographs for well-wishers. A small but steady stream of visitors forms the devoted and highly protective inner-circle. Cynthia. Crawford, known as ‘Crawfie’, who was Lady Thatcher’s dresser,. confidante and travelling companion in Downing Street, comes to stay in. London for a week at a time. Sir Bernard Ingham, the curmudgeonly. Yorkshireman who was her Downing Street press secretary, is another. regular visitor, along with Alison Wakeham. Her. husband John, the former Cabinet minister, was badly injured in the IRA. bomb which killed his first wife, Roberta, at the Grand Hotel in. Brighton 1984. Alison had been his secretary at the time of the. terrorist attack. Dame Sue Tinson, a former boss at ITN, and Conor Burns, the MP for Bournemouth West, are also regulars. Sadly,. there are infrequent appearances from her children, as Mark lives in. Spain and Carol in Switzerland. Sir Mark’s two children, Michael, 22,. and Amanda, 18, from his first marriage to American-born Diane Burgdorf —. whom he divorced in 2005 — are only occasional visitors, since they. both live in Texas. After a. long day in Downing Street, Lady Thatcher used to kick off her shoes in. the flat upstairs and unwind with a stiff whisky. These days, it is a. weak gin and tonic before dinner. Because her short-term memory is. poor, she is now most comfortable in small groups of friends. She avoids. events with large crowds, and will be absent when the Queen attends a. ceremony in Parliament tomorrow to mark her Diamond Jubilee. Lady and the scamp: The dog entertains the former Prime Minister, her helper Kate (centre) and a woman park-goer. Formidable: Former Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher in her heyday (left) and (right) the years are beginning to take their toll on The Iron Lady. A force to be reckoned with: Lady Thatcher with Geoffrey Howe... but these days she is simply content to sit at home in her favourite armchair in the drawing room, listening to classical music. ‘Lady Thatcher will watch it on the television at home,’ says a friend. ‘She is still very interested in what’s going on. And she still has very strong views — as you can imagine.’ There have also been a clutch of invitations to mark the 30th anniversary of victory in the Falklands War next month — one of the defining moments of her premiership. But she has declined them all. Her friends insist that she is comfortable and content. As one says: ‘There are flashes of the old Lady T, when you have to have your wits about you. And whenever you go round, she is always immaculately dressed as if she’s off to a night at the opera. But it’s a quiet life these days, and early to bed.’ Looking at her sitting on the park bench, however, there is one thing that is conspicuous by its absence: her famous handbag. As Prime Minister, she once declared women ‘are generally better at wielding the handbag than the bayonet’. Now, though, it seems Britain’s greatest-ever woman politician no longer has need to wield either.","output":"Lady Thatcher, the 86-year-old former Prime Minister, recently enjoyed a rare public outing in a London park, accompanied by her carer Kate.

Biographer Hannah Fink estimated that Oliver produced 290 works over a career of 22 years. Of these, public art works are Oliver's best known sculptures. These include Eyrie, created for Adelaide's Hyatt Hotel in 1993, and Magnolia and Palm, commissioned in 1999 by the Sydney Botanical Gardens, as part of the Sydney Sculpture Walk. That same year, Big Feathers was commissioned for the Queen Street Mall in Brisbane.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground. Question: What is probably the sergeant's status at the end of the story? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"The sergeant is most likely dead by the end of the story. The narrative describes a situation in which a huge boulder, launched by a stone-caster from the enemy's Cathar fortress, hits the parapet where Roland and his comrades are positioned. The stone, described as being as big as a wine barrel, strikes the sergeant, crushing him to the ground. Given the size and force of the thrown boulder, this would almost certainly result in fatal injuries. Therefore, it can be inferred that the sergeant is probably killed by this assault. The sudden and violent nature of this event underlines the serious dangers faced by these crusaders in their siege against the Cathar stronghold, and gives the reader a very stark reminder of the hazards of medieval warfare. The sergeant's death emphasizes the urgency of the situation and reinforces the tension that Roland feels knowing that his beloved Diane is in the besieged fortress, under threat not only from the ongoing siege but also from the potential massacre that would follow if the stronghold fell to the crusaders. This tragic event showcases the harsh realities of war, where laughter and camaraderie can instantly be replaced by loss and grief."},{"instruction":"South Wales Police said it had worked with Bishop Vaughan School on a \\"sensitive safeguarding issue involving two pupils\\" on Wednesday.

But look a little closer and there are indications that set this particular remake apart from any other. As the dancers jump, grind and thrust, the footage zooms into red scars that dissect their skin and large lumps on their bodies. That’s because the women in the recreation of Eric Prydz’s ultra-sexy Call On Me video are all cancer patients. The ladies who took part in the remake of Eric Prydz's Call On Me are at various stages of battling cancer. The Norwegian patients and survivors prove that they’re not defined by their illness when they set out to re-enact one of the sexiest music videos ever. The idea was conceived by Aktiv Against Cancer, an organisation that wants people to be active after they are diagnosed with cancer, and after their treatment. Their aim was to demonstrate the positive effect of physical activity on the body and mind. And that no one should let cancer kill their confidence. The organisation believes that physical activity should be a part of cancer treatment. The video ends on the shot of the group's 'dance instructor' walking towards the lone male dancer in the class. As she gets closer to him she takes off her long, blonde wig. Not what it looks like: At first glance, it seems to be just another video but close-ups show the scars of recovering patients. Getting sexy back: The video was made by Aktiv Against Cancer which believes activity helps aid recovery. Aktiv Against Cancer was founded by nine-times New York marathon champion Grete Waitz, who after her own diagnosis, joined forces with Helle Aanesen in November 2007 and started the organisation. The group made the video not just to prove that cancer patients and survivors can still be sexy after a diagnosis but also to show that physical activity helps in recovery. The dancers in this video were given training and and then flown to London, where they were taken to the same studio where the original video was shot. One woman who took part in the video said: 'We believe in confidence. That's why we set out to remake one of the most daring music videos ever, starring cancer patients. 'We did this to raise awareness. We did this to prove that cancer doesn’t have to kill your confidence.'","output":"This article is about a special dance video.

The paragraph indeed explains that two protesters, who were allegedly affiliated with Greenpeace, wore yellow safety jackets during their protest at the CBI conference. However, the text does not mention any specific or explicit statement made by Greenpeace about the yellow safety jackets themselves. The jackets were described as part of the protestors' attire, but no link is drawn to any communicated message or statement by Greenpeace referring to these jackets. The main focus of the protestors' actions, and therefore presumably Greenpeace's message, was their opposition to nuclear power, as evidenced by their banners reading, \\"NUCLEAR: WRONG ANSWER.\\" The use of 'radioactive confetti' seems to dramatize their protest against the potential increase of nuclear power stations in the UK. Their yellow safety jackets may have been merely a costume choice to blend in or to symbolize something connected to their cause.

Matthew founded a new business while Derrick stayed at home and watched TV all day because","output":"Matthew had always been an ambitious and proactive individual, constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn, grow, and challenge himself. He was driven by a relentless passion for entrepreneurship, determined to make a name for himself in the world of business. He had spent countless hours researching, honing his skills, and laying the groundwork for the launch of his new venture. He was fueled by a firm belief in hard work, persistence, and resilience – qualities he knew would be fundamental to the long-term success of his enterprise. His heart was set on turning his dream of building a thriving company from the ground up into a reality. Derrick, on the other hand, had a vastly different approach to his daily life. He was much more content with remaining within the confines of his comfort zone, rarely venturing out to challenge or better himself. He often found himself passively watching TV all day, indulging in superficial distractions that provided fleeting moments of entertainment. While he did occasionally fantasize about his aspirations and the things he wished to accomplish, he was ultimately held back by a potent combination of inertia and self-doubt. These contrasting mindsets between Matthew and Derrick exemplified their individual attitudes towards life's possibilities, with Matthew embracing action and growth, while Derrick defaulted to passivity and stagnation. Their diverging paths highlighted the effects of determination, ambition, and personal drive on one's ability to capitalize on opportunities and shape their own destiny. In Matthew's case, his unwavering commitment to his entrepreneurial goals ensured that he would tirelessly strive to make his vision a reality, refusing to let obstacles or setbacks deter him from the path to success. As Matthew's business took shape and began to gain traction, the gap between him and Derrick only widened, further underscoring the importance of a proactive and goal-oriented mindset. Matthew's decision to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams gave him a distinct sense of purpose and direction, enabling him to experience personal and professional growth on a scale that Derrick could not match. In staying true to his ambitions, Matthew had woven a tapestry of hard-earned achievements, profound learnings, and deepened self-awareness – all invaluable assets that would continue to serve him well in the days to come. In conclusion, Matthew founded a new business while Derrick stayed at home and watched TV all day because their sharply differing outlooks, priorities, and life choices led them down markedly separate paths. While Matthew was intent on achieving his dreams and pushing the boundaries of his potential, Derrick was more comfortable remaining idle and unchallenged within the familiar comforts of home. Ultimately, their contrasting attitudes demonstrated the powerful impact that personal drive, proactivity, and a willingness to chase one's dreams can have on shaping a person's reality and unlocking their full potential."},{"instruction":"Answer this question: when was the eight hour work day established??","output":"To answer this question, I will search for information regarding the establishment of the eight-hour workday. 1. Perform an online search to gather information about the eight-hour workday's origin and establishment. 2. Review the information from trustworthy sources to determine when and where the eight-hour workday was established. 3. Summarize the findings in a concise response. Step 1: Performing an online search I will search for information on the establishment date of the eight-hour workday. Step 2: Reviewing the information After conducting my research, I have found that the eight-hour workday was established in different countries at different times. The modern concept of an eight-hour workday began during the Industrial Revolution, where labor unions advocated for better working conditions. In the United States, the eight-hour workday was promoted by the labor unions in the late 19th century. One notable event was the Haymarket affair in 1886, which was a turning point for the eight-hour workday movement. The Ford Motor Company was one of the first major companies to adopt an eight-hour workday in 1914. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 established the 44-hour workweek with an eight-hour workday for most American workers. In the United Kingdom, the Factory Act of 1850 limited the working hours to 10.5 hours per day, and it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that the eight-hour workday became more widespread. Australia and New Zealand were among the first countries globally to implement the eight-hour workday, with the Eight Hours Movement in Australia starting in 1856 and New Zealand’s Eight-Hours Act in 1874. Step 3: Summarizing the findings The establishment of the eight-hour workday occurred at different times in various countries, with Australia and New Zealand implementing it in the mid-19th century. In the United States and the United Kingdom, its widespread acceptance took place in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. The exact date of the established eight-hour workday varies depending on the country and the specific laws and regulations that implemented it."},{"instruction":"If It is the centerpiece of the annual music festival, here in June (see below)., can we conclude that \\"The annual music festival takes place in June.\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the given information, it is reasonable to conclude that \\"The annual music festival takes place in June.\\" The sentence provided – \\"It is the centerpiece of the annual music festival, here in June (see below)\\" – suggests that the annual music festival occurs during the month of June, with a specific event or performance serving as its centerpiece. The phrasing \\"here in June\\" implies that the focus of the festival is during that month, and the term \\"annual\\" indicates that this festival takes place every year. Additionally, the parenthesis \\"see below\\" is likely referring to additional information or details associated with the music festival that might be available to explain further. In conclusion, given the context and wording of the statement, it is a valid deduction to assert that \\"The annual music festival takes place in June.\\" However, to have a better understanding and more comprehensive insight into the music festival, it would be beneficial to explore the additional information mentioned in the \\"see below\\" section, as it could provide further details on the schedule, programming, and various other aspects of the event."},{"instruction":"This is a paraphrasing task.

They are perennial plants with thick, creeping underground rhizomes and large rhubarb-like leaves during the growing season. Can we infer the following? Petasites thrives in wet climates","output":"To infer whether Petasites thrive in wet climates, let's analyze the information provided step-by-step: 1. Petasites is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. This information establishes the classification of the plants, but does not directly indicate the specific climate preferences. 2. They are commonly referred to as butterburs and coltsfoots. This information provides the common names, but also does not mention preferred climate conditions. 3. Petasites are perennial plants. This indicates that they live for more than two years, but it does not suggest a specific climate preference. 4. The plants have thick, creeping underground rhizomes. Rhizomes are modified subterranean stems that help plants spread and store nutrients. Rhizomes can be found in plants that thrive in various climate conditions, so this information does not provide a clear indication of preferred climate. 5. Petasites have large rhubarb-like leaves during the growing season. The size and likeness of the leaves to rhubarb might suggest that they prefer a climate similar to where rhubarb grows, but this information alone does not provide enough evidence to infer anything about preferred climate. Based on the information provided, we cannot directly infer that Petasites thrives in wet climates.

There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. - The Jubilee line is a London Underground line. Opened in 1979, it is the newest line on the network, although some sections of track date back to 1932 and some stations to 1879. Its western end beyond Baker Street was previously the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line, while the new build was completed in two major sections: initially in 1979 to Charing Cross tube station in central London; then extended in 1999 with the Jubilee Line Extension to Stratford station in east London. The later stations are larger and have special safety features, both aspects being attempts to future-proof the line. Following the extension into east London, serving areas once poorly connected to the Underground, the line has seen a huge growth in passenger numbers and is currently the third busiest on the network, with over 213 million passengers per year. The Jubilee line is coloured silver/grey on the Tube map, to mark the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II after which the line was named. - West Hampstead is an area in the London Borough of Camden in north-west London. Mainly defined by the railway stations of the same name, it is situated between Childs Hill to the north, Frognal and Hampstead to the north-east, Swiss Cottage to the east, South Hampstead to the south-east, Kilburn to the west and south-west, and Cricklewood to the north-west. The area is mainly residential with several small shops, restaurants, cafes, bakeries concentrated on the northern section of West End Lane and around West End Green. It is served by three stations: West Hampstead on the Jubilee line, West Hampstead Overground station and West Hampstead Thameslink station. - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Hampstead (or ), commonly known as Hampstead Village, is an area of London, England, northwest of Charing Cross.

Excessive drinking gradually makes your brain shrink and can cause serious damage. Over-drinking can cause learning disabilities and damage your memory. It distorts your vision and leads to blackouts. Teenagers often think that drinking will give you more energy, but alcohol isn't an energy drink; it's a depressant. Drinking and driving is one of the top causes of death for teen boys. An alcohol-related motor vehicle crash kills one person every 33 minutes and injures someone every two minutes. The rate of teenagers driving drunk is so high that the government is trying to pass new laws restricting teen driving. When we get to high school, friends start pressuring us to drink.

Options: - possessing - plethora - enough - satisfaction - availability Explain why a human would choose \\"enough\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"enough\\" to answer the question above because it is the most appropriate and contextually accurate option among the given choices. The question focuses on the insufficiency of supplies, which led to the inability to finish the job despite the effort put in by the individuals involved. The word \\"enough\\" directly addresses this aspect of quantity and sufficiency in relation to the supplies needed to complete the task. Let's analyze each of the other options to understand why \\"enough\\" is the best choice: 1. Possessing: This option doesn't fit well into the context of the question. The word \\"possessing\\" refers to having or owning something, but it doesn't imply the insufficiency of the supplies in relation to the completion of the job. Conversely, it could be interpreted as if they had the supplies, but the question indicates they didn't have the necessary supplies to finish the job. 2. Plethora: This option also doesn't fit the context of the question. \\"Plethora\\" denotes an abundance, excess, or large quantity of something. Using this word would imply that the individuals had more than enough supplies, which contradicts the main idea expressed in the question, i.e., the lack of supplies was the reason why the job wasn't completed. 3. Satisfaction: The term \\"satisfaction\\" refers to a feeling of contentment or happiness when a desire or expectation has been fulfilled. It doesn't directly address the aspect of supply sufficiency and could be considered irrelevant in the given context. 4. Availability: Though this option might seem relevant initially, it doesn't precisely imply the insufficiency of supplies. \\"Availability\\" implies whether the supplies can be accessed or obtained rather than referring to the required quantity for the completion of the job. It is possible that the supplies were available, but the individuals did not have enough of them. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"enough\\" as the answer to this question because it accurately reflects the insufficiency of supplies, which is the primary focus of the question, and fits the context perfectly. The other options either do not address the pertinent aspect of supply quantity or do not align with the given situation and its requirements."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the following passage \\"A further example is the goby fish, which sometimes lives together with a shrimp.

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. and the situation: Two gardeners started their planting season at the same time. Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest. Answer the following question: Which gardener observed more improved water absorption from the soil? The answer to this question is:","output":"Bill observed more improved water absorption from the soil. Step 1: Identify the key factors in the background information. - Mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between a fungus and plant roots. - The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant's root system. - Larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption. Step 2: Apply the background information to the situation. - Bill used mycorrhizal fungi compost for his garden. - This means that Bill's plants formed symbiotic associations with the fungi in the compost. - As a result, the mycelia of the fungi increased the surface area of the root systems of Bill's plants. Step 3: Compare the situations of both gardeners. - Hank used regular topsoil, which did not have the mycorrhizal fungi. - Therefore, Hank's plants did not have the increased root surface area provided by the fungi as Bill's plants did. Step 4: Determine the result. - Due to the increased root surface area and the symbiotic relationship with the mycorrhizal fungi, Bill's plants had improved water absorption from the soil compared to Hank's plants."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Tar Creek (2009) is a documentary film directed by Matt Myers. It explores the environmental, health, and social problems resulting from the Tar Creek Superfund site in northeastern Oklahoma. Specifically, the film examines the aftermath of lead and zinc mining in the area, which has left a legacy of pollution and health issues for the local population, especially the Quapaw Tribe. The Tar Creek Superfund site is one of the most toxic sites in the United States, and the documentary highlights the efforts to clean up and revitalize the region. On the other hand, Hot Girls Wanted (2015) is a documentary film directed by Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus, and produced by Rashida Jones. This documentary investigates the amateur pornography industry and the young women who enter it, hoping to make money and gain fame. The film primarily focuses on the exploitation and reality of the participants in this industry, often highlighting the emotional, psychological, and physical impacts that the work has on these young women. The documentary provides a candid look into the lives of these women and their experiences in a highly stigmatized and controversial line of work.

According to the biblical narrative, Adam and Eve were the first man and woman created by God. They lived in the Garden of Eden, which was a paradise created for them by God, where they lived in harmony with nature and without sin.

Let's say \\"y\\" represents the total number of cookies you have in the jar. Now, suppose you take away 177,167 chocolate chip cookies (-177,167*y) and add 176,658 sugar cookies (+176,658*y). After doing this, you remove 1,018 cookies (-1018). At the end, you end up with an empty jar, meaning you have 0 cookies left (0). So, the equation will look like this: 0 = -177,167*y + 176,658*y - 1,018 To solve for y, first, gather the cookies (or y terms) together. When you do this, you will find that you actually have: 0 = -177,167*y + 176,658*y - 1018 0 = (-177,167 + 176,658) * y - 1018 0 = -509 * y - 1018 Now, let's put the un-cookie-related number (the -1,018) on the other side of the equation by adding 1018 to both sides: 0 + 1,018 = -509 * y - 1,018 + 1,018 1,018 = -509 * y Finally, we need to find out how many cookies \\"y\\" represents. So, let's divide both sides of the equation by -509: 1,018 ÷ -509 = (-509 * y) ÷ -509 -2 = y So, in the end, y = -2. This means that you had a total of -2 cookies in the jar. However, since it's not possible to have a negative amount of cookies, this problem might have been a little bit confusing to understand, but that's how you'd solve it mathematically."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Once there lived a man in a small town.

The results of their study led to a theory opposite to a central one of aerodynamics , which says that the power needed to fly increases with weight. For birds, obviously, the cost of flying with heavy fat is much smaller than we used to think. Researchers found that red knot wading birds double their normal body weight of 100 grams before making their twice-a-year nonstop flight between the British Isles and the Russian Arctic. Distance: 5,000 kilometers. Another study in the magazine Nature measured the advantage of flying in an aerodynamic group which allows birds to save energy by flying smoothly and quietly in the lead bird' s air stream. Flying in groups, their heart rates were 14.5 percent lower than flying alone, according to Henri, a French scientist. The findings help explain how birds complete difficult migrations. Researchers had thought that thinner, stronger birds would have the best chance to survive. The first study suggests that building up fat to be burnt as fuel during the migration is worth more than the energy it takes to carry the additional weight. In the study, researchers said their team studied the birds flown at different body weights during 28 simulated flights. They forced a small amount of special water into the birds' bodies so that they could measure the amount of energy burnt during the flight. Question: A _ red knot wading bird has a better chance to survive during its migrating flight. Yes or no, is the answer \\"fatter\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"fatter.\\" The study conducted by European scientists found that red knot wading birds have a better chance of survival during their migration flights when they double their normal body weight before embarking on their journey. This finding contradicts the central theory of aerodynamics, which states that the power required to fly increases with weight. The researchers discovered that for birds, the cost of flying with heavy fat is much lower than previously believed. This suggests that accumulating fat as fuel for migration is more advantageous than the energy required to carry the additional weight. Red knot wading birds, doubling their normal body weight of 100 grams, embark on their twice-a-year nonstop flight that covers 5,000 kilometers between the British Isles and the Russian Arctic.

These findings help explain how birds complete their challenging migrations. Prior to this discovery, researchers believed that thinner, stronger birds had the best chance of survival.

Article:","output":"Title: EU Regulations Require Amendment for Increased Testing of Cancer Drugs on Children, Experts Insist Introduction Cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and although great strides have been made in the development of treatments, the fight against cancer is far from over. One area that requires significant focus is the administration of potentially life-saving cancer drugs to children. Experts believe that changes in European Union (EU) regulations are essential in order to facilitate and expand the testing of these cancer drugs, leading to improved outcomes for pediatric patients. Current EU Regulations Limiting Cancer Drug Trials on Children At present, the regulatory framework within the European Union places considerable limitations on the testing of cancer drugs for children. Although cancer treatments have advanced significantly in recent years, the approval process for utilizing such drugs for pediatric patients has been arduous and time-consuming. This is primarily due to the stringent guidelines, safety concerns, and ethical considerations that govern clinical trials in the EU. In order for a drug to be tested on children, it first needs to be established as safe and effective for adult patients. Unfortunately, this limits the possibility of finding novel treatments specifically tailored for pediatric cancers. Many childhood cancers are significantly different from those that affect adults, and children's bodies also respond differently to treatments. Consequently, this discrepancy between adult and pediatric cancer characteristics and drug reactions leads to gaps in available and targeted treatments for children. The Need for Regulations Change Experts argue that the current regulations are insufficient in addressing the unique complexities of pediatric cancer treatments and may be causing significant delays in the progress for potentially life-saving drugs. They stress the importance of amending EU regulations to facilitate more comprehensive and timely testing of cancer drugs on children. This would involve critically reevaluating the current guidelines and, possibly, designing new policies that strike a balance between safety, ethical concerns, and rapid access to effective treatment options. By changing the regulations, researchers would have increased opportunities to test a wider range of drugs, including those that are developed specifically for pediatric cancer patients. The expansion of drug tests could lead to the discovery of more effective treatment options, thus significantly improving the survival rates and quality of life of children affected by cancer. Possible Drawbacks and Concerns Although the benefits of advancing pediatric cancer drug research are evident, this proposition is not without its challenges and concerns. An increase in drug trials on children raises questions about their informed consent and the ethical implications of subjecting them to potential risks and side effects. Additionally, resource allocation is another significant challenge. The funds and personnel necessary for conducting extensive clinical trials might need to be diverted from other areas of medical research, potentially raising questions about the prioritization of research efforts. Conclusion The European Union's current regulatory framework limits the potential for testing and approving life-saving cancer drugs for pediatric patients. It is crucial for experts and policymakers to work together to review and amend these regulations, focusing on fostering innovation in this field while accounting for safety and ethical concerns. By altering the regulations to accommodate more extensive drug testing on children, we may ultimately see a significant positive impact on pediatric cancer survival rates and quality of life. The fight against cancer in children cannot afford delays, and regulatory change is the essential first step in achieving tangible progress for these young patients."},{"instruction":"Skylar promised others they would eat lunch together, but Skylar ate lunch with their family instead.

Since he didn't get caught by his wife, he went back the next day and took another 3 cookies out of the jar. But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back. His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies. So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later. The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar. How many cookies remained in the jar? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Lou Senior took 3 cookies and ate them the first day. Initial number of cookies in the jar: X Remaining cookies after Lou Senior took them the first day: X - 3 Step 2: The next day, Lou Senior took another 3 cookies, but returned 2 after eating just one. Remaining cookies after Lou Senior took 3 cookies on the second day: (X - 3) - 3 = X - 6 Remaining cookies after Lou Senior returned 2: (X - 6) + 2 = X - 4 Step 3: Louie Junior took 7 cookies from the jar and hid them. Remaining cookies after Louie Junior took 7: (X - 4) - 7 = X - 11 Step 4: Debra sees that 1/2 of the cookies are missing. Thus, (X / 2) = (X - 11) To find the remaining cookies, we need to solve for X: X - 11 = X / 2 Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2(X - 11) = X 2X - 22 = X Subtract X from both sides: 2X - X = 22 X = 22 Now that we know the initial number of cookies present in the jar was 22, we can find the remaining cookies in the jar: Remaining cookies = X - 11 Remaining cookies = 22-11 Therefore, there were 11 cookies remaining in the jar when Debra looked into it."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: If \\"A man in a wild red outfit talking on a cellphone.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The man is wearing a black outfit.\\"?

Piranhas Although only a small number of piranhas are considered to be dangerous to humans, the red-bellied piranha is definitely one of those. Evidence has shown that a large group of piranhas can absolutely eat a herd of large animals crossing the river, leaving only bones. This fish lives in the freshwater streams of South America, and they can smell the blood from far away and launch attacks swiftly. It is said that they are only dangerous to humans if the water volumes are less and lower. Anacondas This South American monster of a creature often appears in the films or your nightmares!They have weighed over 230 kilograms. It is often considered to be the biggest snake in the world. You certainly don't want to get caught alone with this snake due to its method of attacking and killing its victim. It is indeed a remarkably different brand of snake type as it regularly coils around all over its target, increasing the pressure until eventually its victim dies. Its jaws are powered by large muscles that produce enough power for its over 100 sharp teeth to pass through the thick skin of an crocodile. They don't have poison. Sometimes they prefer to camouflage themselves so they look like their surroundings and swiftly draw back when humans are near. Golden Poisonous Frogs The golden poison frog might be the most-deadly of the South American animal, which is protected by means of poison. This very small frog, less than 55 mm in length, packs enough punch to take down a pair of African bull elephants. This apparently harmless frog has always been known to have killed people who have touched it directly. It's also been noted that chicken and dogs have died by contacting things on which a golden poison frog had wandered! In intense colors, they normally look attractive to their targets.

Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (; 27 October 1919 27 July 1980), known as Mohammad Reza Shah, was the Shah of Iran from 16 September 1941 until his overthrow by the Iranian Revolution on 11 February 1979. He took the title Shhanshh (\\"Emperor\\" or \\"King of Kings\\") on 26 October 1967. He was the second and last monarch of the House of Pahlavi of the Iranian monarchy. Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi held several other titles, including that of rymehr (Light of the Aryans) and Bozorg Arteshtrn (Head of the Warriors). His dream of the Great Civilization in Iran led to a rapid industrial and military expansion as well as economic and social reforms. - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. - Twelver (Athn'ashariyyah or Ithn'ashariyyah ) Shia Islam or Imamiyyah is the largest branch of Shia Islam. Twelver belief is based on the Quran and the message of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad attested in hadith, and on hadith taught by their Imams. The term \\"Twelver\\" refers to its adherents' belief in twelve divinely ordained leaders, known as the Twelve Imams, and their belief that the last Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, lives in occultation and will reappear as the promised Mahdi. According to Shia tradition, the Mahdi's tenure will coincide with the Second Coming of Jesus Christ (\\"Isa\\"), who is to assist the \\"Mahdi\\" against the \\"Masih ad-Dajjal\\" (literally, the \\"false Messiah\\" or Antichrist). - The Iranian Revolution (also known as the Islamic Revolution or the 1979 Revolution;) refers to events involving the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty under Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, who was supported by the United States and its eventual replacement with an Islamic republic under the Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution, supported by various leftist and Islamist organizations and Iranian student movements. - Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei (; 19 April 1939) is the second and current Supreme Leader of Iran and a Muslim cleric. Ali Khamenei succeeded Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian Revolution, after Khomeini's death, being elected as the new Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts on 4 June 1989, at age 49. Current Iranian president Hassan Rouhani arranged for Khamenei to get his first major post in the provisional revolutionary government as deputy defense minister. Khamenei also served as the President of Iran from 1981 to 1989. In 2012, 2013, and 2014 \\"Forbes\\" selected him 21st, 23rd, and 19th, respectively, in the list of \\"The World's Most Powerful People\\". - Shah (pronounced , \\"king\\") is a title given to the emperors, kings, princes and lords of Iran (historically also known as Persia). It was also adopted by the kings of Shirvan (a historical Iranian region in Transcaucasia) namely the Shirvanshahs, the rulers and offspring of the Ottoman Empire (in that context spelled as \\"eh\\"), Mughal emperors of the Indian Subcontinent, the Bengal Sultanate, as well as in Georgia and Afghanistan. In Iran (Persia and Greater Persia) the title was continuously used; rather than King in the European sense, each Persian ruler regarded himself as the \\"Šhanšh\\" (King of Kings) or Emperor of the Persian Empire. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'position held' with 'grand ayatollah'. The answer to this question is:","output":"Sayyid Ruhollah Msavi Khomeini, known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, held the position of 'grand ayatollah'."},{"instruction":"Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Use tax. Yes or no? Answer: With few exceptions, no state's vendors will charge the native state's sales tax on goods shipped out of state, meaning all goods ordered from out-of-state are essentially free of sales tax. Question: what are use taxes? Answer:","output":"Use taxes are a type of tax imposed by states in the United States to ensure that all purchases made by residents, both within and outside the state, are subject to the same tax treatment. This tax is typically applied to goods and services that are purchased from out-of-state vendors and then used, consumed, or stored within the purchaser's state of residence. The main purpose of use taxes is to prevent residents from evading sales tax by purchasing goods from out-of-state vendors that do not charge the native state's sales tax. While it is true that in many cases, out-of-state vendors do not charge the native state's sales tax on goods shipped out of state, use taxes are designed to make up for this potential revenue loss. Generally, use tax rates are equivalent to the sales tax rates within a given state. Use taxes are the responsibility of the purchaser, not the seller. This means that individuals and businesses are expected to self-report and pay use taxes on applicable purchases, although compliance can often be low due to a lack of public awareness and difficulties in enforcement. In summary, use taxes are imposed by states to ensure that all purchases made by their residents are subject to the same tax treatment, regardless of where the goods or services are purchased. These taxes are primarily aimed at preventing tax evasion and ensuring a level playing field for in-state vendors who must charge sales tax on their goods."},{"instruction":"Question. Given the sentence \\"An elderly woman walks with a cane and a shopping bag.\\" is it true that \\"A grandmother going home after shopping.\\"? Answer. it is not possible to tell What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","output":"To justify the answer that it is not possible to tell whether \\"A grandmother is going home after shopping\\" from the given sentence, consider the following step-by-step reasoning: 1. Analyzing the provided sentence: The original sentence states, \\"An elderly woman walks with a cane and a shopping bag.\\" From this, we know that the subject is an elderly woman, and she is walking with a cane and carrying a shopping bag. 2. Addressing the assumptions: The assumption \\"A grandmother going home after shopping\\" implies two key pieces of information - the woman's relationship to others (grandmother) and her current activity (going home after shopping). 3. Identifying missing information: The given sentence does not provide any information about the woman's relationships, such as whether she is a grandmother or not. Similarly, it does not specify whether she is going home after shopping or walking somewhere else. a. Relationship Status: There is no mention of the elderly woman's family or her being a grandmother in the given sentence. An elderly woman may or may not be a grandmother, so this assumption is unsubstantiated. b. Current Activity: The sentence states that she is walking with a shopping bag, indicating that she was likely shopping at some point. However, it does not specifically mention that she is going home after shopping. She could be going to another store, meeting someone, or performing some other activity. 4. Drawing the conclusion: Based on the missing information mentioned above, it is not possible to determine that \\"A grandmother is going home after shopping\\" from the initial sentence. The original sentence does not provide enough context to definitively confirm or refute this assumption."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

The rising took place during the War of the Austrian Succession, when the bulk of the British Army was in Europe, and was the last in a series of revolts that began in 1689 and continued in 1708, 1715 and 1719. Charles launched the rising on 19 August 1745 at Glenfinnan in the Scottish Highlands, capturing Edinburgh and winning the Battle of Prestonpans in September. The Jacobite army invaded England in early November, reaching Derby on 4 December, where they were forced to retreat by a lack of expected English support, by superior numbers of government forces, and by differences in opinion amongst the Jacobite command. Despite victory at Falkirk Muir in January 1746, the Battle of Culloden in April ended the Rebellion and significant backing for the Stuart cause.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"If the air is not converted to oxygen in the lungs, it is directly impacting a step of the process in the respiratory system. The primary purpose of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which is necessary for the human body to function properly. This exchange occurs in the alveoli, tiny air sacs within the lungs, where oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is released from the blood into the air sacs to be exhaled. Several factors or conditions can result in the disruption of the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs, such as: 1. Respiratory diseases: Conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or pneumonia can impair lung function, thus affecting the ability of the lungs to efficiently deliver oxygen to the bloodstream or remove carbon dioxide. 2. Impaired alveolar function: Conditions like emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis can damage the alveoli and hinder gas exchange. 3. Hypoxia: Inadequate oxygen supply to the body can be a result of high altitudes, smoke inhalation, or various medical conditions that impede the lungs' function. 4. Airway obstruction: Mucus, foreign objects, or swelling can block the airways, disrupting the flow of air and potentially leading to inadequate oxygenation of the blood. When the lungs' ability to convert air to oxygen is directly impacted, it can have severe consequences on the body's overall function, as oxygen is critical for cells to generate energy, maintain body temperature, and perform numerous other essential biological processes. A lack of oxygen may lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, confusion, and in severe cases, organ failure and death. Immediate medical intervention may be necessary to address any conditions that are directly impacting the lungs' ability to convert air to oxygen and ensure proper respiratory function is maintained."},{"instruction":"how many episodes is there in game of thrones series 7??","output":"To find out the number of episodes in Game of Thrones Season 7, I would first research the information online using trusted sources such as IMDb or the official HBO website.

The more happy people you know, the more likely you are yourself to be happy. And getting connected to happy people improves a person's own happiness. Researchers have been analyzing a collection of facts from tracking sheets dating back to 1971, following births, marriages, deaths, and divorces. Volunteers also listed the information of their closest friends, co-workers, and neighbors. They assessed happiness with a simple, four-question test. \\"People are asked how often during the past week, one, I enjoyed life, two, I was happy, three, I felt hopeful about the future, and four, I felt that I was just as good as other people,\\" Fowler said. The 60 percent of people who scored highly on all four questions were regarded as happy, while the rest were considered unhappy. People with the most social connections -- friends, spouses , neighbors, s -- were also the happiest, the data showed. \\"Each additional happy person makes you happier,\\" Christakis said. And happiness is more infectious than unhappiness, they discovered. If a social contact is happy, it increases the possibility that you are happy by 15 percent. A friend of a friend, or the friend of a spouse or a sibling , if they are happy, increases your chances by 10 percent. A happy third-degree friend -- the friend of a friend of a friend -- increases a person's chances of being happy by 6 percent. But every extra unhappy friend increases the possibility that you'll be unhappy by only 7 percent. The finding is interesting and useful. Among other benefits, happiness has been shown to have an important effect on reduced death rate, pain reduction, and improved heart function. So better understanding of how happiness spreads can help us learn how to promote a healthier society.

R. R. Tolkien's fictional legendarium, Beleriand was a region in northwestern Middle-earth during the First Age. Events in Beleriand are described chiefly in his work \\"The Silmarillion\\", which tells the story of the early ages of Middle-earth in a style similar to the epic hero tales of Nordic literature. Beleriand also appears in the works \\"The Book of Lost Tales\\", \\"The Children of Húrin\\", and in the epic poems of \\"The Lays of Beleriand\\". - The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the \\"New York Herald Tribune\\" for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature. - In the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Edain were men (humans) who made their way into Beleriand in the First Age, and were friendly to the Elves. - Haleth is a fictional character from J.R.R. Tolkien 's Middle - earth legendarium . She was a leader of the Second House of the Edain , called the Folk of Haleth after her . At the time of her birth , the Second House of Men had settled in Thargelion , in East Beleriand , living in separate homesteads and having no lords of their own . But in Y.S. 375 of the First Age Morgoth sent out an Orc - raid against them . The Men were caught off - guard , and a great part of their people was wiped out . The remnant was gathered under one Haldad and his twin children , daughter Haleth and son Haldar ; and they held out for days in a stockade until the Noldor rescued them , by which time both Haldad and Haldar were slain . Caranthir offered to Men his lands to live in protected , but Haleth refused , for now she was chosen a Chieftain , being of great heart and no less in valour than her kinsmen . Next year she led her people to Estolad ; and after a time again urged them to move further westward . They passed through the horrors of Nan Dungortheb only by the strength of Haleth 's will , and at last came to the woods of Talath Dirnen . Later many removed the forest of Brethil , which was a part of Doriath outside the Girdle of Melian , but now was granted to them by Thingol . Haleth ruled the Folk of Brethil until she died . She was buried in a green mound in the heights of the Forest , which was called therefore the Ladybarrow ( Haudh - en - Arwen in Sindarin and Tûr Haretha in their own tongue ) . The next Chieftain of Brethil was her nephew Haldan . - Norse mythology is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. - Middle-earth is the setting of much of J.

A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways. - The Straits of Florida, Florida Straits, or Florida Strait is a strait located south-southeast of the North American mainland, generally accepted to be between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Florida Keys (U.S.) and Cuba. It is 150 km (93 mi) wide at the narrowest point between Key West and the Cuban shore, and has been sounded to a depth of 6,000 feet. The strait carries the Florida Current, the beginning of the Gulf Stream, from the Gulf of Mexico. - South Florida is a region of the U.S. state of Florida, comprising the southernmost part of the state. It is one of Florida's three most common \\"directional\\" regions, the others being Central Florida and North Florida.

It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building having multiple floors.

Nick thought that parents just don't understand but Ryan thought that they did understand.","output":"Nick and Ryan had been friends since childhood. They were practically inseparable and spent most of their time together either exploring the town or just chatting in the treehouse that Nick built in his backyard. Though they were hardly ever seen apart, they were as different as chalk and cheese. One of the strongest bones of contention between them was whether or not parents truly understood their teenage children. Nick, the more rebellious and adventurous of the two, had a complicated relationship with his parents. They were often overprotective and strict, which bothered Nick to no end. He felt suffocated by their constant meddling and scolding, and believed that they were trying to control him rather than understand him. He longed to break free from the shackles of parental surveillance and prove that he could take care of himself, make his own decisions, and become his own person. On the other hand, Ryan, known for his level-headedness, had a loving and nurturing upbringing, complete with open communication and understanding. Whenever he faced challenges or heartbreaks, he knew he could count on his parents for guidance and emotional support. This experience fostered the unwavering belief in Ryan that parents, in general, did indeed understand their children. He saw his own family as an exemplary prototype and struggled to fathom why Nick could not appreciate the value of good parents. Despite their differences, Nick and Ryan's friendship was steadfast. However, as they entered their teenage years together, their contrasting views on the parent-child relationship began to create friction between them. They would engage in heated debates, each defending their stance passionately. Nick felt that Ryan's idyllic outlook was unreal and unattainable, while Ryan believed that if Nick tried to communicate openly with his parents, he would be surprised at how understanding they could be. Their clashing beliefs threatened to drive a wedge between them and their once-unbreakable friendship. One day, an opportunity arose for the two friends to put their theories to the test. The school was organizing a week-long camping trip in a national reserve, but both sets of parents forbade Nick and Ryan from going on this adventure. Nick was adamant that it was yet another example of parents not understanding, while Ryan thought their decision was made out of genuine concern. Regardless, the boys decided to sign up for the trip secretly. The scenic reserve and challenging hikes forged stronger bonds among the students and teachers. As the days passed, Nick found his rebellious spirit waning, as he began to realize that perhaps his parents' reservations were well-intentioned after all. Ryan, on the other hand, noticed that the constant feeling of being on-guard led him to question whether or not his parents were overprotective. Finally, on the last night of the camping trip, an unexpected storm blew in. A torrential downpour caused flash floods at the campsite. The students and teachers were immediately in a state of panic. However, much to the amazement of Nick and Ryan, their parents arrived just in time, along with other members of the community, to help secure the campsite and evacuate the students. As it turned out, the parents had discovered that Nick and Ryan had disregarded their prohibition against joining the camping trip. Rather than getting angry and lashing out, they banded together with other concerned parents, keeping a discreet watchful eye from a safe distance, ready to swoop in should any emergencies arise. In the aftermath of the storm, Nick finally understood that his parents were not purposely stifling him out of malice, but rather, genuinely concerned for his well-being. At the same time, Ryan came to the realization that parents might not always understand every aspect of their children's lives or needs in spite of their love for them. Instead of letting their contrasting viewpoints divide them, the boys learned valuable lessons from each other, cultivating a new space for open-mindedness and empathy. Nick and Ryan grew closer than ever, their unwavering friendship prevailing against all odds. They now appreciated that misunderstanding was a part of life and that the key to maintaining any relationship, be it with friends or family, lay in communication, patience, and understanding. Together, they continued to navigate the challenges of teenage life, knowing that their friendship would last a lifetime."},{"instruction":"How do you say \\"Each registration is for a single user only.\\" in Spanish?","output":"In Spanish, you can translate \\"Each registration is for a single user only.\\" to \\"Cada registro es solo para un único usuario.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Each registration\\" can be translated to \\"Cada registro.\\" \\"Cada\\" is used to express \\"each\\" or \\"every,\\" and \\"registro\\" is the translation for \\"registration.\\" 2. \\"is for\\" can be translated as \\"es para,\\" which conveys the idea of something being intended or designated for someone or something. \\"Es\\" is the verb \\"to be\\" (ser) for the third person singular, and \\"para\\" means \\"for.\\" 3. \\"a single user\\" can be translated to \\"un único usuario.\\" \\"Un\\" is the Spanish word for \\"a\\" (indeterminate article), \\"único\\" expresses the idea of \\"single\\" or \\"unique,\\" and \\"usuario\\" is the translation for \\"user.\\" 4. \\"only\\" can be translated as \\"solo\\" in this context, which emphasizes that each registration is for one user only, without exception.

Movie plot title: Gravity Movie plot: Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a biomedical engineer from Lake Zurich, Illinois, is aboard the NASA space shuttle Explorer for her first space mission, STS-157. Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is commanding his final mission. During a spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, Mission Control in Houston warns the team about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of debris in space. Mission Control orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re-entry immediately because the debris is speeding towards the shuttle. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter. High-speed debris from the Russian satellite strikes the Explorer and Hubble, detaching Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), recovers Stone and they return to the Explorer. They discover that it has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew is dead. They decide to use the MMU to reach the International Space Station (ISS), which is in orbit about 1,450Â km (900Â mi) away. Kowalski estimates they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again. En route to the ISS, the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the substantially damaged but still operational ISS, they see that its crew has evacuated in one of its two Soyuz modules. The parachute of the remaining Soyuz has deployed, rendering the capsule useless for returning to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese space station Tiangong, 100Â km (60Â mi) away, in order to board a Chinese module to return safely to Earth. Out of air and maneuvering power, the two try to grab onto the ISS as they fly by.

Therefore, it contradicts the principle of sufficient reason, and there could exist two distinct universes that were in all ways indiscernible, thus contradicting the identity of indiscernibles.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"The act of denying the truth of a statement by asserting the opposite is called \\"contradiction.\\" Step 1: Analyze the given information to understand the context. - The provided idea revolves around a concept put forth by Leibniz, involving two proposed universes and their positions in absolute space. - Leibniz's argument states that the given situation is impossible, as it goes against the principle of sufficient reason and the identity of indiscernibles. Step 2: Identify the relevant concept in the context. - The act of denying the truth of a statement is brought up in Leibniz's rejection of the possibility of the two proposed universes as an example in the context. Step 3: Define the concept related to negating a statement. - A \\"contradiction\\" is a statement that denies or asserts the opposite of a claim or statement. Step 4: Apply the concept to the context. - In the given context, Leibniz is contradicting the claim that the example of the proposed universes is possible based on their position in absolute space. Therefore, the answer is: Contradiction."},{"instruction":"The provided file includes English sentences, and we ask you to translate those to the Hindi language.

What number comes next in the following series? 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, x Options: (A) 1093 (B) 1100 (C) 1301 (D) 1400 (E) 1713","output":"Alright, let's first analyze the given series: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364. It doesn't seem to be an arithmetic or geometric progression. Let's try to find the pattern by calculating the differences between consecutive terms: (13 - 4) = 9 (40 - 13) = 27 (121 - 40) = 81 (364 - 121) = 243 Okay, I see that each difference is a multiple of 9: 9, 27, 81, 243. Now let's check the differences between these differences, to see if we can find another pattern: (27 - 9) = 18 (81 - 27) = 54 (243 - 81) = 162 Here, we have 18, 54, and 162, which are also multiples of 9. Now let's check the ratio between consecutive differences: 27/9 = 3 81/27 = 3 243/81 = 3 Here, we can observe that the series seems to keep multiplying each new difference by 3. We can follow the same pattern to find the x in the series. Our last difference was 243, so we have: 243 * 3 = 729 Now let's add this difference to the last term of the series, which was 364: 364 + 729 = 1093 Therefore, the next number in the series is 1093.

Options: - garage - movies - in europe - paris - bus Explain why a human would choose \\"in europe\\" to answer the question above:","output":"\\"In Europe\\" is an option that a human might choose to answer the question of what kind of tour someone is likely to see the Eiffel Tower on. However, the most accurate and specific answer would be \\"Paris,\\" as the Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. Here's why a human might choose the \\"in Europe\\" option instead: 1. General knowledge: Someone may choose \\"in Europe\\" if they're aware that the Eiffel Tower is in Europe but unsure of the specific city or country it's located in. They may recognize that the other options (garage, movies, bus) aren't relevant and choose \\"in Europe\\" because it's the general area where the landmark exists. 2. Contextual association: The Eiffel Tower is one of Europe's most iconic landmarks, and some people might associate it with Europe as a whole rather than specifically with Paris. If someone isn't confident in their geography but knows that the Eiffel Tower is a famous European attraction, they may choose \\"in Europe\\" as the answer. 3. Misunderstanding the question: If a user isn't clear on the question's intent, they might think that \\"in Europe\\" refers to a wide-ranging tour of Europe that happens to include the Eiffel Tower. In this sense, \\"in Europe\\" would still be a correct answer, though \\"Paris\\" would be more appropriate. 4. Lack of knowledge on other options: For some people, the Eiffel Tower might not be well-known enough to pinpoint it to a specific location. In this case, they might choose \\"in Europe\\" because it seems like the most general answer compared to the other options, which are unrelated or too specific. 5. Regional identification: Sometimes, people may identify certain landmarks as representative of a specific region rather than a particular city. This could be because these iconic structures possess a cultural or historical significance that spans beyond their immediate location. In conclusion, while \\"in Europe\\" might be an option that some people choose to answer the question of what kind of tour someone is likely to see the Eiffel Tower on, the most accurate and specific answer would be \\"Paris\\" because that's where the landmark is located."},{"instruction":"Trivia question: In which county are Corfe Castle and the Isle of Purbeck? And the answer is?","output":"Corfe Castle and the Isle of Purbeck are located in the county of Dorset in South West England. Dorset is a picturesque county with a rich historical background. It features scenic coastlines, picturesque countryside, and quaint villages. Dorset is well-known for its natural beauty, making it a popular tourist destination. The Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, off the Dorset coast, is famous for its stunning geological formations and fossil-rich beaches. Corfe Castle is an iconic and significant historical site in Dorset. The castle was originally built by William the Conqueror in the 11th century as a royal fortress, and the structure that remains today dates back to the 12th and 13th centuries. Over the subsequent years, Corfe Castle changed hands between several English monarchs. It was besieged by the Parliamentarian forces during the English Civil War in the mid-17th century and eventually was partially demolished to prevent it from being used as a military stronghold. In the 1980s, the remaining ruins were placed under the care of the National Trust, which has since restored and maintained the site for visitors to explore and appreciate. The Isle of Purbeck, on the other hand, is not an actual island but rather a peninsula that extends from the county of Dorset into the English Channel. Stretching approximately 60 square miles, the Isle of Purbeck is known for its striking landscapes of chalk cliffs, sandy beaches, and dramatic heathlands. The area boasts numerous natural and historical attractions such as Lulworth Cove, Durdle Door, Old Harry Rocks, and Swanage Railway. The Isle of Purbeck has also been a source of inspiration for many writers, including Enid Blyton and Thomas Hardy. In summary, Corfe Castle and the Isle of Purbeck are located in the beautiful county of Dorset in South West England. Both attractions showcase the rich history, cultural heritage, and natural beauty that makes Dorset a popular destination for tourists and locals alike."},{"instruction":"Write highlights for this article: By. Graham Smith. UPDATED:. 08:09 EST, 17 February 2012. A friendly rivalry has long existed between the U.S. and Canada and many Americans enjoy nothing more than poking fun at their neighboring nation. But, with the exception of the War of 1812 two centuries ago, the two countries have stood side-by-side and are today the world's largest trading partners. In a further boost to this mutual love-in, a poll has - rather surprisingly - revealed that Americans rate Canada as their favourite country. A landslide 96 per cent of U.S. citizens surveyed rate Canada favourably, a four per cent rise on this time last year. Border crossing: Americans rate Canada as their favourite country, with 96 per cent signalling their approval for their next-door neighbour, according to a poll. More surprisingly, Australia came second in the Gallup poll with a 93 per cent approval rating. Britain rounded out the top three, proving that the enduring. 'special relationship' between the U.S. and UK is supported by the. American public too. Germany and Japan came fourth and. fifth respectively, followed by another unexpected choice in sixth place. with 75 per cent approval - France. It has been less than ten years since relations between the U.S. and France were at a low. In the second Gulf war against Iraq,. the U.S. dubbed the French ‘cheese-eating surrender monkeys’ and. re-branded French Fries as ‘Freedom Fries’ when the nation failed to. support the 2003 invasion. Popularity contest: Iran came bottom in the Gallup poll, hardly surprising considering the escalating showdown between the Islamic Republic and the West over its nuclear program. Equally surprising is the growth in favourability towards Mexico. Ravaged by an ongoing war on drug. gangs that has seen more than 40,000 people killed, six per cent more. Americans than a year ago approve of the country. This comes just days after the U.S. State Department this week recommended Americans avoid travel to all or parts of 14 of 31 Mexican. states in the widest travel advisory since the country stepped up its drug. war in 2006. The advisory said U.S. citizens have been victims of drug violence, including killings, kidnappings and car-jackings. Sydney Harbour: Australia came a surprising second in the survey of American opinions of other nations. Great Britain was named third most popular proving that the enduring 'special relationship' between the U.S. and UK is supported by the American public too. Less surprising are the countries that Americans most dislike. The escalating showdown between Iran. and the West over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program has led just 10. per cent of U.S. citizens to view the country favourably. Second least popular is North Korea, with a 13 per cent approval rating. A U.S. liaison will hold talks with. North Korea on its nuclear program in Beijing next week, the first such. negotiations since the death of the nation's long-time dictator Kim Jong. Il. North Korea is followed by Afghanistan with 14 per cent approval. How the American public's opinion of Pakistan, Afghanistan and North Korea has changed over the last decade. Pakistan has fallen three points to 15 per cent in the last year. Pakistan fell three points to 15 per. cent, a predictable fall in popularity among the American public given. the circumstances surrounding the killing of Osama Bin Laden in May last. year. The unilateral American raid which. killed the world's most wanted man in an army town led to a fresh wave. of suspicion against Western diplomats by the Pakistani security. establishment, which was apparently stung by the realisation that the. CIA agents were operating in the country without its knowledge. Tension remains after U.S. Defence. Secretary Leon Panetta last month said Pakistan officials must have. known that Bin Laden was holed up in a remote compound in Abbottabad.","output":"1.

Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Paragraph: Bill and Bob were two brothers. they were both into physical exercise, but Bill chose weight lifting, and Bob running. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brother had smaller muscles? Answer:","output":"Given the information provided in the background, Bill focused on weight lifting, which resulted in increased size and strength of his skeletal muscles due to contracting against resisting forces. On the other hand, Bob chose running as his exercise routine, which improved his cardiac muscle strength and efficiency due to faster contractions and increased heart pumping capacity. Based on this information, Bob is likely to have smaller muscles compared to Bill, as his exercise routine is more focused on cardiovascular fitness and not on increasing muscle size like weight lifting does for Bill."},{"instruction":"Instructions: Write a correct answer for the question.

Its first line-up consisted of singer and rhythm guitarist Kai Hansen, bass guitarist Markus Grosskopf, lead guitarist Michael Weikath, and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg. After the release of a self-titled EP and their debut album Walls of Jericho in 1985, it expanded into a quintet with the addition of singer Michael Kiske, Hansen choosing to focus on guitar instead. Under this line-up, they released the Keeper of the Seven Keys albums (1987 and 1988), which established Helloween as a notable heavy metal band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre. The year 2000 saw the release of The Dark Ride, a more experimental and darker album than their previous releases. It came complete with downtuned guitars and a gruffer singing style from Deris. Immediately following the tour, Helloween parted ways with guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch. One version of events states that Weikath, Deris, and Grosskopf felt that Kusch and Grapow, in particular, were spending more time on and paying more attention to their new side-project, Masterplan (Grapow's output on Helloween albums had dropped to barely one song per album by that point); since the others believed that Kusch and Grapow were not one hundred percent dedicated to Helloween, they were dismissed. They were replaced by guitarist Sascha Gerstner (ex-Freedom Call, Neumond) and drummer Mark Cross (ex-Metalium, Kingdom Come, At Vance, Firewind), culminating with the recording of another studio album, titled Rabbit Don't Come Easy, in 2003. The band met Sascha via a recommendation by producer Charlie Bauerfeind. According to Grosskopf, one day he was recording something with Freedom Call \\"and later on we called him up and he went to first meet Weiki because it was very important that Weiki finds a player that he can play with and also communicate and understand. [...] So we got him on the island where we recorded and let him hang out with us a little and then he decided 'Good, let's go'.\\" Later in 2012, on an interview with Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, Roland stated: Cross could not finish the album due to mononucleosis, completing only two tracks; the drum tracks were completed by Motorhead's Mikkey Dee. Stefan Schwarzmann, former drummer of Running Wild and Accept would shortly thereafter take over the drumming duties. Despite a somewhat tepid response to the album, Helloween nonetheless completed a successful world tour, highlighted by the return of classic songs such as \\"Starlight\\", \\"Murderer\\", \\"Keeper of the Seven Keys\\" and \\"How Many Tears\\" to the setlist. Additionally, the band toured the United States for the first time since 1989, playing to sold-out crowds at nearly every venue.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of more sunshine for the plants does not have a direct effect on the process of boiling salt water and collecting water vapor to separate salt from water. However, it might have an indirect effect. More sunshine can lead to increased evaporation rates in natural bodies of water, which may affect the overall water cycle and the availability of fresh water in certain regions.

Your task is to summarize them. Picking up on the ancestral tradition, South Carolinians have spent much of the last two years asserting various forms of independence from the federal government and attempting to block different federal laws. Now a state senator from the Palmetto State has decided it’s time for South Carolina to create its own currency. State Sen. Lee Bright (R-Roebuck) says that federal spending and increased monetary intervention by the Fed have placed the entire US Federal Reserve system on a path to monetary collapse. And when the crash comes, state residents will need to rely on the stable South Carolina currency to weather the storm. “If folks lose faith in the dollar, we need to have some kind of backup,” Bright told Stephen Largen of the Spartanburg Herald-Journal on Friday. Bright’s proposed legislation states that “many widely recognized experts predict the inevitable destruction of the Federal Reserve System’s currency through hyperinflation in the foreseeable future; and … South Carolina can avoid or at least mitigate many of the economic, social, and political shocks to be expected to arise from hyperinflation, depression, or other economic calamity related to the breakdown of the Federal Reserve System only through the timely adoption of an alternative sound currency that the state’s government and citizens may employ without delay in the event of the destruction of the Federal Reserve System’s currency. The legislation calls for the creation of a joint legislative subcommittee which would study the “the need, means, and schedule for establishing such an alternative currency.” Others in the state are less than impressed with the idea. “It’s a waste of time; it’s a waste of resources,” says Phil Bailey, direct of the state Senate Democratic Caucus. “I mean who’s paying for this study? Will they be paid in actual dollars or gold doubloons?” (ed.note: Special thanks to TPM Reader TK for sending along word of this developent.) ||||| Continuing a pattern of attempts to assert South Carolina's independence from the federal government, State Sen. Lee Bright, R-Roebuck, has introduced legislation that backs the creation of a new state currency that could protect the financial stability of the Palmetto State in the event of a breakdown of the Federal Reserve System. Bright's joint resolution calls for the creation of an eight-member joint subcommittee to study the proposal and submit a report to the General Assembly by Nov. 1. The Federal Reserve System has come under ever-increasing strain during the last several years and will be exposed to ever-increasing and predictably debilitating strain in the years to come, according to the legislation. “If there is an attempt to monetize the Fed we ought to at least have a study on record that could protect South Carolinians,” Bright said in an interview Friday. “If folks lose faith in the dollar, we need to have some kind of backup.” The legislation cites the rights reserved to states in the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings in making the case that South Carolina is within its rights to create its own currency. “The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the states may adopt whatever currency they desire for the purposes of performing their sovereign governmental functions, even to the extent of adopting gold and silver coin for those purposes while refusing to employ a currency not redeemable in gold or silver coin that Congress has designated ‘legal tender.'...” Bright's legislation states. The legislation claims “many widely recognized experts predict the inevitable destruction of the Federal Reserve System's currency through hyperinflation in the foreseeable future.” Per the legislation, South Carolina's new currency could consist of “gold or silver, or both.” Bright said in explaining his introduction of the legislation that Virginia and Georgia are considering similar measures to protect their states against economic calamity in the event of the collapse of the Federal Reserve System. Phil Bailey, the director of the state Senate Democratic Caucus, described the currency bill as a distraction from the real issues facing the state. “Not any thing in that bill is going to create a job or improve education,” Bailey said Friday. “It's a waste of time; it's a waste of resources. I mean who's paying for this study? Will they be paid in actual dollars or gold doubloons?” Bright responded by saying that his proposal is “something we ought to study” and “if there's no support for the bill in the body, it won't go anywhere.” Bright's bill has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee, but he said he's working with Sen. David Thomas, R-Greenville, on the legislation, and Thomas could redraft it so that it's referred to the Banking and Insurance Committee, of which Thomas is the chair. Bright also has introduced legislation in the ongoing legislative session that would make a firearm, firearm accessory or ammunition that is commercially or privately manufactured in South Carolina and does not leave this state exempt from federal regulation, including registration. During the 2010 session, Bright sponsored legislation passed by the state Senate that in addition to affirming South Carolina's Second-, Ninth- and 10th-amendment rights, also targeted federal health care legislation by saying state residents are not subject to any law that interferes with patients' rights to choose their own health care provider or pay for medical services directly. “If at first you don't secede, try again,” Bright said with a laugh after the legislation passed last year. Secession-style language and proposals seeking to transfer power from the federal government to states and localities have become increasingly common in recent years during the fight over federal health care reform, perhaps most notably in Texas, where Republican Gov. Rick Perry in 2009 suggested the Lone Star State could secede in the future should the federal government not change its fiscal polices. |||||","output":"The text primarily details the proposal by State Sen. Lee Bright of South Carolina to develop an independent state currency. This action is an extension of South Carolina's efforts to assert its independence from the federal government and prevent the potential impact of a collapse of the Federal Reserve System on the state's economy. Bright believes that the US Federal Reserve System is heading towards a monetary collapse due to federal spending and increased intervention by the Fed. In anticipation of such an event, he argues that having a stable South Carolina currency would help residents weather the crisis. He proposes the creation of a joint legislative subcommittee to investigate the establishment of such a currency. This bill posits that numerous experts predict the inevitable breakdown of the Federal Reserve System's currency due to hyperinflation in the foreseeable future. To insulate itself from the economic, social, and political aftermath of such a development, South Carolina must adopt an alternate sound currency that the state government and citizens can use immediately if and when the Federal Reserve System's currency is destroyed. The proposed currency could consist of gold, silver, or both, and echoes suggestions that Virginia and Georgia are considering similar measures. Bright's legislation cites the rights reserved to states in the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings supporting the states' right to adopt their currency for executing independent government functions. However, Phil Bailey, director of the state Senate Democratic Caucus, criticizes the idea as a diversion from pressing state issues and as a wasteful use of time and resources. In the past, Bright has also proposed legislation to exempt locally manufactured firearms, accessories, or ammunition from federal regulations. He has pushed for more power to be transferred from the federal government to states, especially in the field of healthcare. The concept of a state adopting its own currency signals a continuation of his previous secession-style advocacies."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"An older man is pouring something out of a bag into the water.\\" is it true that \\"A man pours something into the water.\\"?

All the adults in the town. A:","output":"Title: \\"Isaac's Requiem\\" Genre: Mystery / Psychological thriller Plot: In the idyllic small town of Winterhaven, a series of mysterious deaths begin to occur, targeting the adult population. As the body count continues to rise, the police and the community's townsfolk grow terrified and suspicious of one another. As the investigation intensifies, clues begin to point towards Isaac Graham, a shy and introverted 17-year-old with a troubled past. Isaac is an enigmatic young man, living with his abusive father (George) and submissive mother (Marilyn) on the outskirts of Winterhaven. His only comfort comes in the form of his desire to rid his town of the adults controlling their lives. This desire is based on his traumatic childhood experiences and the adults who ignored and failed him, and his belief that a world run by children would be free from pain, suffering, and cruelty. Isaac forms a secret alliance with a group of similarly disillusioned teenagers who share his vision of a utopian society. With Isaac as their leader, the group starts a secret network to systematically eliminate the adults in town, one by one. Using their extensive knowledge of the inner workings of Winterhaven, they expertly cover their tracks, leaving the targeted adults appearing to perish from natural causes or accidents. As the police race against time to solve the mystery, Isaac's group begins to struggle with the moral implications of their actions. Torn between their loyalty to Isaac and their emerging doubts about their crusade, the group becomes divided. This fracture leads to one member betraying Isaac and exposing the truth to detective Laura Finch - a young investigator sent to Winterhaven to uncover the reason behind the deaths. Laura, who has established a close bond with Isaac, is deeply torn by the revelation but ultimately decides to engage with the teenager to confront his actions and negotiate a peaceful resolution. However, Isaac has become increasingly unstable and refuses to back down, leading Laura to gather the teens against Isaac, ultimately dismantling the group and their mission. In the powerful climax, Isaac, emotionally defeated and alone, chooses to take his own life, leaving Winterhaven to finally find peace and rebuild. In the wake of the tragedy, the town is forced to confront the harsh truth behind their previous ignorance and neglect of Isaac and his peers. The movie serves as a chilling reminder of the consequences of a broken society and the responsibility of adults to care for the younger generations, offering hope that such a tragedy can be prevented through empathy and understanding."},{"instruction":"Add spaces: Additionally,itmaybeasignificantadvantagetocarryoutrollingofpipestobeusedforlinepipes,heatexchangersorinstrumentationinstallations.","output":"Sure, here's the sentence with spaces added: Additionally, it may be a significant advantage to carry out rolling of pipes to be used for line pipes, heat exchangers or instrumentation installations."},{"instruction":"Information: - Lille is a city in northern France, in French Flanders.

Check if any of the mentioned styles of music correspond to a dance form originating in Montevideo. Step 1: The keywords in the question are \\"unique form of dance\\" and \\"Montevideo\\". Step 2: The sentence mentions three main styles of music in a city, which are Tango, candombe, and murga. Although these styles are often associated with dance, the sentence does not explicitly mention dance forms. Step 3: Investigating each of the three mentioned music styles: - Tango: Tango is a style of music and a dance form that originated in the Rio de la Plata region of Argentina and Uruguay. Montevideo is a city in Uruguay; however, Tango is not unique to Montevideo as it also has close ties with Buenos Aires, a city in Argentina. - Candombe: Candombe is a music and dance style with African roots that originated in the neighborhoods of Montevideo, Uruguay. This satisfies the condition of being a unique form of dance originating in Montevideo. - Murga: Murga is a form of popular musical theater that originated in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Which of the following best explains why the car stops? Pick the answer from these options Choices: (a). Some of the energy of the car was lost to friction. (b). Some of the energy of the car was destroyed. (c). The amount of kinetic energy increased. (d). The amount of useful energy increased.","output":"To find the best explanation for why the car stops, let's analyze each option. (a). Some of the energy of the car was lost to friction. - When the car runs out of fuel, the engine is no longer providing the force to keep the car in motion. Even though it's on a level road, friction between the tires and the road surface, as well as air resistance, work against the car's motion. This causes the car's kinetic energy to be converted into heat, eventually bringing the car to a stop. (b). Some of the energy of the car was destroyed. - According to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be destroyed, only converted from one form to another. Thus, this option is incorrect. (c). The amount of kinetic energy increased. - The car slows down as it runs out of fuel, so its kinetic energy (the energy of motion) would decrease, not increase. This explanation is not valid. (d). The amount of useful energy increased. - As the car runs out of fuel, the useful energy available to keep the car moving decreases, not increases. This option is not a valid explanation. Considering all the options, the best explanation for why the car stops when it runs out of fuel is: (a). Some of the energy of the car was lost to friction."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: In a 1965 film, by what name is Eric Stoner better known?","output":"In the 1965 film \\"The Cincinnati Kid,\\" the character Eric Stoner is better known by his nickname \\"The Cincinnati Kid.\\" The movie is an American drama directed by Norman Jewison and stars Steve McQueen as Eric Stoner, a young poker player looking to make a name for himself in the world of high-stakes poker.

Eric, a diligent and soft-spoken employee, with an impressive knowledge of electronics, was arranging a shelf when Ian approached him with a complicated query. \\"Excuse me,\\" Ian began, \\"I've been trying to design a custom computer system with unique hardware and software configurations, specifically for high-performance gaming and virtual reality applications. Could you give me some insights on the types of components I should be looking for, taking into account the compatibility, power-efficiency, and potential bottlenecks of each component?\\" Eric took a moment to process Ian's question, recognizing that this was not a typical customer inquiry. He then asked Ian to follow him to the computer hardware section, where they began discussing the various options available. First, they started with the central processing unit (CPU). Eric explained that for high-performance gaming and VR applications, a multi-core CPU with high clock speeds would be essential for seamless performance. They looked at options from both Intel and AMD, discussing the pros and cons of each brand. Next, they moved on to the graphics processing unit (GPU). Eric emphasized the importance of acquiring a GPU capable of handling the intense graphics requirements of both gaming and virtual reality. He informed Ian about Nvidia's GeForce RTX series and AMD's Radeon RX series, both of which offer excellent performance, ray tracing capabilities, and power efficiency. Ian asked about configuring multiple GPUs in a single system, to which Eric replied that while it was possible, the diminishing returns on performance and potential compatibility issues made it less recommended for most users. After discussing the CPU and GPU, Eric and Ian talked about other crucial components such as memory (RAM), storage devices (SSDs and HDDs), and motherboards. They explored different brands, speeds, and capacities, ensuring that the components would be compatible not only with each other but also with the desired CPU and GPU. Eric also highlighted the importance of a high-quality power supply unit (PSU) to provide stable and efficient power to the system. He suggested looking at options with an 80 PLUS certification to ensure efficiency and reliability. Finally, they discussed the various cooling solutions available for maintaining optimal temperatures within the custom build. Ian learned about air cooling, liquid cooling, and the importance of case fans for effective heat dissipation. Throughout their conversation, Ian took notes and asked questions about specific components and combinations.

As per a report from a security company, the hack attack has managed to compromise sensitive user data. This raises concerns about the security of gaming platforms and highlights the need for strong cybersecurity measures. Step 1: Detail the extent of the hack The hack attack on Dota 2's official chat forum resulted in unauthorized access to the platform's database. This has left user data such as email addresses, usernames, hashed passwords, and other personal information, potentially vulnerable for misuse. As many gamers use the same credentials on multiple platforms, this breach can expose players to further attacks on other gaming networks. Step 2: Explain the risks associated with the breach The stolen information from the hack attack can have serious consequences for the affected users. Cybercriminals can leverage this information to carry out phishing attacks or even sell the data on the dark web. Additionally, users who have employed the same login credentials on other platforms may face increased vulnerability on other gaming networks or even their personal accounts, such as social media and email. Step 3: Discuss how Valve is handling the situation Valve, the game developer and owner of Dota 2, has acknowledged the breach and is taking steps to address the situation. They have initiated an investigation into the hack attack and urged users to change their passwords on the chat forum and on any other platform where they used the same login credentials. Valve is said to be working closely with cybersecurity experts to strengthen the overall security of their platform and prevent future breaches. Step 4: Provide advice for users to protect themselves from future attacks To safeguard against potential future attacks, it is crucial for gamers to follow precautionary measures. These actions include using strong, unique passwords for each account across different platforms, enabling two-factor authentication whenever possible, and employing the use of a reliable password manager to keep their account credentials safe. Users should also be wary of unsolicited emails and messages and report any suspicious activity to the concerned authorities. Conclusion: The recent hack attack on Dota 2's official chat forum highlights the continually evolving threat landscape in the gaming industry. As cybercriminals continue to target gaming forums and platforms, it underscores the importance of both developers and users to establish robust cybersecurity measures. Valve's response to the breach will play a critical role in safeguarding the user data and trust in the company. Meanwhile, users should be vigilant and proactive in protecting their personal information so that they can enjoy a safe and enjoyable gaming experience."},{"instruction":"Did Jesus go to school to study railroad engineering?

Russian news reports say Verzilov a member of Russian punk protest group... (Associated Press) MOSCOW (AP) — A member of Russia's Pussy Riot protest group says a severely ill fellow activist was being taken to Germany on Saturday for treatment after his suspected poisoning. Maria Alekhina told The Associated Press that Pyotr Verzilov was being flown to Berlin, but she did not give details. Independent news site Meduza reported that Verzilov's partner, Veronika Nikulshina, said a doctor from a Berlin clinic who is friends with the ill man's father suggested medical care outside Russia. Verzilov was hospitalized in Moscow on Tuesday and had remained in intensive care, Pussy Riot members said this week. Alekhina told the AP he regained consciousness Friday. She also said she thinks he was poisoned for political reasons. Verzilov, Nikulshina and two other Pussy Riot members served 15-day jail sentences for running onto the Moscow field where soccer's World Cup final was being played in July. Their protest of what they described as the excessive powers of Russia's police briefly disrupted the match with a very large broadcast audience. Verzilov's fell ill as new allegations arose over the March nerve-agent poisoning of a Russian former double agent and his daughter in the British city of Salisbury. British authorities last week named two men — alleged to be agents of Russia's military intelligence service — in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The authorities showed surveillance-camera images of the pair in Salisbury. The two men told Kremlin-funded satellite TV channel RT on Thursday they were in Salisbury only as tourists, to see the city's noted cathedral, and denied working for military intelligence. Several Kremlin opponents have died from poisoning or suspected poisoning during the past 15 years. Alexander Litvinenko, a former member of Russia's domestic security service, succumbed slowly in London after ingesting a radioactive isotope in 2006. He fell ill hours after meeting with two Russians whom Britain claimed were the assassins. Journalist Anna Politkovskaya, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, became sick after drinking tea on an Aeroflot flight in 2004. She was travelling to southern Russia to try to help negotiate the Beslan crisis in which Chechen militants took hundreds of schoolchildren hostage. Poison was mentioned as a possible cause of her symptoms. Politkovskaya survived, and was shot to death in the elevator of her apartment building two years later. Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent opposition figure, nearly died of kidney failure after a suspected poisoning in 2015 and fell severely ill again in 2017. ___ Jim Heintz in Moscow contributed to this story. ||||| Alexander Zemlianichenko / AP / Scanpix / LETA Doctors at Moscow Sklifosovsky Institute treating Pyotr Verzilov have ruled out the risk of a brain hemorrhage, Verzilov’s partner, fellow Pussy Riot member Veronika Nikulshina, told Meduza. He was hospitalized on September 11 in critical condition after the sudden loss of his vision, speech, and mobility. Earlier on September 13, the news agency Interfax reported that Verzilov was “in fact, in a pre-stroke condition,” saying his blood work revealed “no drugs other than the ones the doctors gave him.” Nikulshina calls these claims “absurd nonsense,” saying that doctors at the Sklifosovsky Institute specifically evaluated Verzilov’s stroke risk and ruled it out “conclusively.” Elena Verzilova, Pyotr’s mother, told Meduza that her son’s ultrasound and CT scan “showed no vascular changes whatsoever.” “This is absolutely poisoning. Poisoning by . It’s something like the atropine Cyclopentolate — what’s found in medicines. But the issue here is the large dosage,” Nikulshina told Meduza. According to Elena Verzilova, “these aren’t the kind of drugs that are easy to remove [from his system].” Verzilov is currently unconscious in intensive care. According to friends, he’s in “medicated sleep,” because he “starts to become overactive when awake,” raising his blood pressure. Doctors apparently haven’t ruled out putting Verzilov on a ventilator. His friends say new information won’t be available until the morning of September 14, when his latest test results are in. A member of Pussy Riot and the publisher of the investigative news website Mediazona, which conducts often daring reporting on Russia's criminal justice system, Verzilov has been a prominent figure in Russia’s anti-Kremlin opposition movement since the late 2000s, when he performed in the controversial “Voina” artist-activist group alongside his then wife, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova. On September 11, paramedics brought Verzilov to Moscow’s Bakhrushin City Clinical Hospital, where he was treated at the toxicology wing before being transferred to the Moscow Sklifosovsky Institute on September 13.

(EW.com) -- Nine years ago, Frankie Valli was rescued from oldies-station oblivion with the smash Broadway musical \\"Jersey Boys.\\" The show chronicles the real-life rise-and-fall-and-rise-again of four crooners from the mobbed-up mean streets of 1960s New Jersey who called themselves the Four Seasons and cranked out a seemingly endless string of hit records, including the love ditty ''Sherry,'' the triumphant ''Walk Like a Man,'' and the bouncy bubblegum bop of ''Big Girls Don't Cry.'' The songs are timeless. But so are a lot of songs from that Motown and Phil Spector era. What made the Four Seasons magical was Valli's voice -- an impossibly high-pitched nasal falsetto that sounded like a prepubescent angel who'd huffed a tank of helium. With \\"Jersey Boys' \\" receipts still pouring in on the Great White Way, the notion of adapting the musical into a splashy song-and-dance Hollywood biopic must have been too juicy to resist. In fact, the only thing that might seem surprising about the \\"Jersey Boys\\" movie is the man squinting behind the camera, Clint Eastwood. But the pairing actually makes more sense than you'd think. Anyone who saw Eastwood's 1988 Charlie Parker film, \\"Bird,\\" knows that the guy's always been a not-so-closeted hepcat with a discerning set of ears. The biggest problem is that the film, written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, never makes a convincing case for why Valli the man or the singer matters beyond the music in the way that \\"Ray\\" and \\"Walk the Line\\" did for Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. Such are the perils of adapting a somewhat one-dimensional stage show. Fortunately, Eastwood is far wiser on the casting front. As Valli, John Lloyd Young is pretty close to perfection. That's no shocker, really, as he won a Tony in 2006 for his portrayal of Valli on the boards. With his slicked-back pompadour and wardrobe of sharkskin suits, Young looks more like the late Bruno Kirby than Valli. But when he opens his mouth, you believe you're listening to the real deal. He finds every ounce of sweat, aftershave, and salad dressing that made up Valli's one-of-a-kind voice. As his fellow Four Seasons, Michael Lomenda, Erich Bergen and Vincent Piazza are equally spot-on, even if all of their bada-bing lingo occasionally makes them sound like they're competing in a Chazz Palminteri impersonation contest. (Both Lomenda and Bergen starred in the stage version as well.) Eastwood has never been the kind of filmmaker to grab you by the lapels or hot-dog with flashy storytelling tricks. You can walk in halfway through just about any of his movies and know exactly where you are. His laid-back traditionalism has always been part of his appeal, though. And in chronicling the careers of Valli & Co., he charts a predictably linear through-line: the band's hardscrabble Italian-American roots, which lead them to a sentimental wiseguy (Christopher Walken) who takes them under his wing; their first flirtation with fame; the downward slide of excess, money trouble, and infighting; and a redemptive third act in which they let bygones be bygones when they're inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. The movie's decades-spanning scope requires the 34-year-old Young to play Valli from age 16 to 60. As good as he is, he isn't done any favors by Eastwood's makeup team. You'd think that after all the grousing over Leonardo DiCaprio's distracting mugful of old-age putty in \\"J. Edgar,\\" the director would have paid more attention to the unconvincing wrinkles and jowls in the final stretch of \\"Jersey Boys.\\" But alas. Still, as flat and pitchy as the film sometimes feels, what saves it are those nostalgic, soaring doo-wop numbers (especially ''Sherry'') and Eastwood's measured doses of directorial playfulness, such as when the actors cheekily break the fourth wall and talk directly to the audience, as they did on Broadway. This trick doesn't always work, but when it does, and Valli or one of his bandmates turns to the camera, winks, and dishes about how the reality of events clashes with what we're actually witnessing on screen, it gooses the film with a giddy jolt of jukebox electricity.

The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words. You should create more such trigger words and use them in your twin sentences. | Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | | age | old | new | | altitude | low | high | | area | small | vast | | brightness | dark | light | | clarity | obscure | clear | | cleanness | dirty | clean | | complexity | simple | complex | | cost | cheap | expensive | | density | sparse | dense | | depth | shallow | deep | | distance | near | far | | electric conductivity | low | high | | flexibility | rigid | flexible | | granularity | fine | coarse | | hardness | soft | hard | | length | short | long | | magnitude | small | large | | mass | small | large | | odor | weak | strong | | pressure | low | high | | resistance | low | high | | shape | round | sharp | | shape | flat | spiky | | size | small | large | | sound | quiet | loud | | sound pitch | low | high | | speed | slow | fast | | stability | unstable | stable | | strength | weak | strong | | temperature | low | high | | texture | smooth | rough | | thermal conductivity | low | high | | thickness | thin | thick | | volume | small | large | | weight | light | heavy | | width | narrow | wide | | location | in | out | | location | up | down | | location | above | below | | location | on | off | | location | to | from | Input: Context Word: foundation.

Written by Frederic Lanoir and Arthur Qwak, the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story, with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around, which can either be wastelands, or globes of greenery. The story's a simple one, which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragon's unwanted visit to plunder and destroy, and the resident knights have all but been annihilated. Enter the king's granddaughter Zoe (Marie Drion) who gathers Lian-Chu (Vincent Lindon), a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant, and his partner-in-arms Gwizdo (Patrick Timsit), who balances the partnership with his cunning brain. Lian-Chu and Gwizdo (together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires) share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement, but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free, hence their career in monster-extermination which doesn't exactly pay off. That's basically the whole gist of it, but what makes this film a spectacle, is its CG graphics, which is solidly rich, detailed, and an eye-popping marvel to behold. It has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action,, and during those fight sequences, there's nary a boring moment. Photo-realistic moments of non-existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make-belief, and it's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three-suns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs (here's having at you George!) And I couldn't get enough of the finale battle as well, though the usual brick-bats will find some fault at the indestructibility of the principle characters. I guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computer-animated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of Pixar's. And this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of Zodiac: The Race Begins and Legend of the Sea can learn from  to keep the story effectively simple, and let your moving artwork do all the talking.

So here's FOX Sports football analyst Petros Papadakis being equally high on the Sun Devils while bringing us closer to reality. Papadakis included ASU as one of his four teams for next year's playoff. Bold, yes. Out of the realm of possibility? No. With Marcus Mariota leaving Oregon for the NFL, the Pac-12 South champion in 2015 could have a shot at making the College Football Playoff. Getting out of the division will again be the tricky part, but both Arizona schools are positioned to be in the mix. Arizona won the division title in 2014 because of the math, but fans were still left wondering which Pac-12 South team was the best. UCLA finished 10th in the final USA Today Coaches poll of the season, ahead of 14th-ranked ASU and 17th-ranked Arizona. The Bruins also finished 10th in the Associated Press poll, again in front of 12th-ranked ASU and 19th-ranked Arizona. USC and Utah weren't far behind. Vetting the final rankings is a process for bragging rights more than a useful projection for next season, but that's why we're moving on with the help of some smart college football folks. Here are where three experts pick the Wildcats and Sun Devils heading into 2015: FOX Sports' Stewart Mandel: ASU (12th), Arizona (17th) ESPN's Mark Schlabach: Arizona (13th), ASU (15th) USA Today's Paul Myerberg: ASU (11th), Arizona (15th) Now, to what factors have helped the rivals gain positive reviews heading into 2015, and why both ASU and Arizona should challenge for the Pac-12 South title: Coaching staff continuity can't be overlooked, and it's an important factor for Arizona and Arizona State. Rich Rodriguez's close-knit coaching staff seems stable, while Todd Graham's lead assistant, offensive coordinator Mike Norvell, didn't receive a head coaching offer strong enough to pull him out of Tempe. Meanwhile, the Utah Utes wait anxiously to see if reports of head coach Kyle Whittingham wanting out will come true. Even if they don't, Utah took a big blow when offensive coordinator Dave Christensen left for Texas A&M despite a successful first season with the Utes. The Utes also lost defensive coordinator Kalani Sitake and defensive line coach Ilaisa Tuikai. USC should be in decent shape in the second year under Steve Sarkisian, though the Trojans did lose offensive line coach Tim Drevno, who will become Jim Harbaugh's offensive coordinator at Michigan. And there will always be rumors that UCLA coach Jim Mora could leave for the NFL, though nothing to this point seems past the point of speculation. Do-it-all Sun Devil D.J. Foster will return foe his senior year with ASU, and the Sun Devils know what they'll get out of quarterback Mike Bercovici. Sixteen starters will be back for Graham's team, and that's good enough reason for Papadakis to make a surprising pick despite the departure of receiver Jaelen Strong. At Arizona, quarterback Anu Solomon will likely return as a smarter, more determined player in 2015 after he put the blame on himself following the Wildcats' Fiesta Bowl loss to Boise State. Rodriguez hasn't handed him the starting job, but it would be a surprise if he wasn't behind center with stud running back Nick Wilson by his side. And the Wildcats can't be discussed without mentioning linebacker Scooby Wright, who piled up numerous national awards as a sophomore. Elsewhere in the Pac-12 South, there are significant holes to fill. UCLA will move on without Brett Hundley leading the offense, while Utah will miss standout defensive end Nate Orchard. USC returns Cody Kesler at quarterback but will need to replace defensive end Leonard Williams, running back Buck Allen and receiver Nelson Agholor. If there is any team equipped to deal with such losses, it's the Trojans. USC is arguably the favorite to win the division, and part of the reasoning is its fourth-ranked recruiting class, per Scout. Graham's incoming class at ASU is ranked 20th -- the third-best in the Pac-12 and behind only the Trojans and No. 9 UCLA. Arizona's class finds itself down the ladder at 35th, but there's something to be said for Rodriguez's eye for talent. Just look at Wright, and it's clear the Wildcats know what types of players fit their system and identity, even if the number of stars don't impress.

The football analyst, Petros Papadakis, predicts that the Arizona State Sun Devils might be one of the four teams in next year's playoffs. With a key player from a big competitor, the Oregon Ducks, leaving for the professional league, analysts think that Arizona's teams might have a good chance. The article also says that continuity in a coaching team could help put Arizona on top. Meanwhile, certain players, like the Sun Devils' quarterback, Mike Bercovici, and the Arizona Wildcats' quarterback, Anu Solomon, are expected to help their team's chances. However, the article also says that there are some things to watch.

Chris Kirk shot a bogey-free final round to clinch the Deutsche Bank Championship at TPC Boston with Rory McIlroy unable to mount a challenge on the final day. The American, who was joint third with McIlroy and Jason Day on 10 under going into the final day, carded five birdies in a final-round 66 to beat Australia's Geoff Ogilvy and fellow Americans Russell Henley and Billy Horschel by two shots. 'Biggest win I ever had,' Kirk said on pgatour.com shortly after sealing victory on 15 under overall. 'I may be a little bit more calm, but I was still freaking out a bit inside.' Glory: Chris Kirk (right) is presented with the winner's trophy by CEO of Deutsche Bank Jacques Brand. What might have been: Rory McIlroy trudges off the 18th green after a disappointing final round. Kirk's victory in the second of the four play-off events means the 29-year-old American now leads the FedEx Cup standings. It is only his third PGA Tour career title. He wasted no time in eating into Henley's two-shot overnight lead by birdieing the third and fourth holes, while a further birdie on the ninth meant he had picked up three shots in the opening nine holes. Kirk made par on the next three before birdieing again on the 13th and repeating the feat for the fifth and final time of his round on the 16th before finishing with two more pars. In the swing: Kirk takes his approach shot on the sixth hole at TPC Boston on Monday. In the long grass: World No 1 McIlroy hits out of trouble on the sixth hole on his way to a fifth place finish. Going for the flag: Kirk chips to the second green during the final round of the Deutsche Bank Championship. Best man won: McIlroy congratulates Kirk after their round on the biggest win of his career to date. Kirk's victory gives United States captain Tom Watson plenty to ponder ahead of the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles later this month. Watson chooses his three wildcard picks on Tuesday and Kirk has done his chances of selection no harm at all. 'I definitely put myself in contention for one,' Kirk said when asked about his Ryder Cup chances. 'If I get picked, great. If not, I'm still happy with my win today.' World No 1 McIlroy, who had catapulted himself into contention with a flawless seven-under 64 on Sunday, could not secure his fourth title in five tournaments after recording four bogeys in his final-round 70 to finish joint fifth with Australia's John Senden on 11 under. They were two shots shy of the second-placed trio of Ogilvy, Henley and Horschel. Martin Kaymer and Day were tied for seventh on 10 under, while Sweden's Carl Pettersson and Jimmy Walker of America were two of seven players tied for ninth place on nine under. World No 2 Adam Scott had to be content with a joint 16th-placed finish with six others on eight under, while England's Ian Poulter was a further shot back to finish alongside Jim Furyk and Rickie Fowler. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A golfer named Chris Kirk played a really great game and won the Deutsche Bank Championship at a place called TPC Boston. He didn't make any mistakes and scored five birdies in the final round, which helped him win.

One of the most significant challenges faced by educators is to determine the most effective teaching methods that cater to individual learning styles and provide students with better opportunities to excel academically. There are various teaching methods, such as traditional lecture-based, inquiry-based, and project-based learning, utilized in schools worldwide. However, there has been a growing interest in the widespread adoption of technology in education, aiming to enhance the learning experience and improve overall academic outcomes. The use of online platforms, educational applications, and digital tools, including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems, are now considered a vital component of the modern education landscape. AI has the potential to revolutionize the ways in which teaching and learning occur, offering personalized learning plans, adaptive assessment and feedback, and efficient management of educational resources. Moreover, AI can help struggling students by identifying the root cause of their difficulties and providing customized remedial plans, ensuring that each student receives the necessary support. At the same time, advanced learners can benefit from AI-provided, tailored academic resources that enable them to further explore their interests and maintain an appropriate level of challenge. Hypothesis: The incorporation of AI-based systems in the education sector can significantly improve overall academic outcomes and cater to individual learning styles by providing personalized learning plans, adaptive assessments, and customized support for struggling students. If this hypothesis is proven to be true, it will not only pave the way for an efficient and effective education system but will also promote more inclusive learning environments for students with different backgrounds and abilities. This trajectory will require careful planning, research, and implementation. Studies will need to be conducted on the effectiveness of AI-based systems relative to traditional teaching methods and the potential consequences for educators, students, and parents. Ultimately, the successful integration of AI in education will rest on a strong foundation of collaboration between educational stakeholders, developers of AI-based applications, and policymakers."},{"instruction":"Paula Carlton claimed £107,705 over a 10 year period.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Intriguing Love Affair Uncovered Between Wellington's Descendant and Benefit Claimant Introduction: A scandalous story has emerged that connects a direct descendant of the famed Duke of Wellington and a woman who fraudulently claimed more than £100,000 in benefits over a decade. Paula Carlton, the woman at the center of the tale, has been found to be in a romantic relationship with the Duke's great-great-great-great grand-nephew, Richard Wellesley, while successfully claiming housing benefits by alleging him to be her landlord. Step 1: Detail the situation The investigation, which covers a 10 year period, discovered that Paula Carlton falsely claimed a total of £107,705 in benefits. In her claim, she stated that she was renting a property from Richard Wellesley, an alleged landlord, while in fact, they were living together as a couple. Step 2: Discuss the significance of the Duke of Wellington connection The Duke of Wellington is well known as the British military leader who helped defeat Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. Richard Wellesley, his descendant, now finds himself embroiled in a controversy with Paula Carlton as the main subject. Step 3: Include Paula Carlton's perspective As the details of the case unfold, it is essential to consider Carlton's motives behind her actions. Authorities are looking into the matter to determine if she was fully aware of the consequences of her fraudulent claims or if she acted under a mistaken belief of entitlement. Step 4: Discuss the consequences for Paula Carlton It is unclear at this stage what penalties Paula Carlton will face for her fraudulent claims. Judging by the significant amount of money involved, she could potentially face severe legal consequences. As the investigation continues, the full extent of the repercussions will become evident. Step 5: Discuss the impact on Richard Wellesley As a direct descendant of the iconic Duke of Wellington, Richard Wellesley's involvement in this case raises questions about his knowledge and role in the deception. It remains to be seen if he will face any repercussions or scrutiny as a result of his connection to the fraudulent claims. Conclusion: This intriguing story highlights the lengths some individuals will go to for financial gain, even when misrepresenting their relationships. While the investigation into the romance between Paula Carlton and Richard Wellesley unfolds, the question arises if love can truly cloud one's judgment to such an extent, resulting in deceitful claims and scandalous headlines.

A young boy sits against a pillar at Sannomiya Station, dying of starvation. Later that night, a janitor removes his body and digs through his possessions, finding nothing but a candy tin containing ashes and a few fragments of bone which he throws away into a nearby field. From the tin springs the spirit of the young boy followed by his little sister along with a cloud of fireflies. The spirit of the young boy, Seita (Tsutomu Tatsumi, English: J. Robert Spencer), narrates the story of how he and his sister, Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi, English: Rhoda Chrosite), fared in the wake of the firebombings of Kobe during the war.14 year-old Seita and 4 year-old Setsuko live with their mother (Yoshiko Shinohara), English: Veronica Taylor) comfortably in Kobe while their father serves as a captain in the Imperial Japanese Navy. One day, air raid sirens go off as a fleet of American B-29 Superfortress bombers flies overhead. The children's mother, who suffers from a heart condition, puts Setsuko in the care of her older brother and instructs him to secure the home while she goes ahead to a bomb shelter.

Hakken, his wife and their two sons, 2-year-old Chase and 4-year-old Cole, were at a marina on the communist-ruled island when CNN found them aboard their small sailboat Tuesday. Florida authorities believe Hakken sailed there after abducting the two boys from the Tampa home of their grandmother, who was granted custody after Hakken's 2012 arrest on drug charges in Louisiana. \\"This all just seems like the government is yet again making real criminals out of non-violent peaceful freedom lovers,\\" wrote one commenter on \\"Adam Vs. The Man,\\" a libertarian web forum. The family's Cuban sojourn may be short-lived, as the government there announced Tuesday that it would hand them over to U.S. authorities. A man identifying himself as Hakken -- \\"a father, a registered professional mechanical engineer and a veteran of the USAF\\" -- joined the Adam Vs. The Man discussion board in February 2012 under the handle \\"Sailingbull.\\" \\"I am absolutely devoted to life, liberty, the rights of the individual and the Constitution of the United States of America,\\" he wrote. \\"Mr. Ron Paul is the ONLY politician I have ever admired or supported. It is unimaginable what the forces at be are doing and want to do to him.\\" Paul, the former Texas congressman, ran for president as a Republican in 2008 and 2012 and once as the Libertarian Party nominee, in 1988. Hakken vounteered to help Paul supporters scout out campsites near last year's Republican convention in Tampa, posting photos of site possibilities on the message board. CNN has not been able to independently confirm Hakken's identity on site, and Adam Vs. The Man founder Adam Kokesh did not respond to requests for comment. But in a post last week, after news that Hakken was wanted in connection with the abduction, he noted, \\"I feel like we're in a position to help here. Maybe to reach out to him. Certainly seems like a stupid way to go about this, regardless of what your moral assessment is.\\" Both Hakken and his wife, Sharyn, held professional engineering certificates -- hers in civil engineering, his in the mechanical and fire-protection specialties, according to state records. After high school, he attended the Air Force Academy in Colorado from June 1996 to May 1998, academy spokesman Meade Warthen told CNN. Online, Hakken said he left because of a previously undiagnosed spinal condition; Warthen said the academy couldn't comment on the reason for his withdrawal. The couple's legal woes began last June with what police called a \\"disturbance\\" at a hotel in Slidell, Louisiana, just east of New Orleans. \\"When police arrived, both Mr. and Mrs. Hakken were acting in a bizarre manner that alarmed officers,\\" a Slidell police statement recounts. \\"They were talking about 'completing their ultimate journey' and were traveling across the country to 'take a journey to the Armageddon.' Let it be noted that both of their children were present in the hotel room at the time.\\" Police said they found both drugs and weapons in the room and called in the state Office of Child Services, which \\"determined that the children were in danger\\" and took them into their custody. Hakken was charged with marijuana possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and the use of a controlled substance around minors; \\"Officers also took custody of several weapons for safe keeping.\\" The Office of Child Services told CNN it would not comment on the case. The children were put into foster care with a family in Tangipahoa Parish, north of Lake Pontchartrain. Two weeks after the arrest, the foster mother called 911 and told dispatchers, \\"I need a cop now. I have a guy at my house with a gun.\\" \\"I have two foster children, and it's their dad ... I don't hear banging, but I'm not getting out 'til a cop car gets here,\\" she said. Hakken left without the boys, who later were sent to live with Patricia Hauser, Sharyn Hakken's mother, in Tampa. On April 2, a Louisiana court terminated the couple's parental rights, investigators say. The following day, Hillsborough County authorities say Hakken entered Hauser's home, tied her up and took off in her Toyota Camry with the boys. Three and a half hours later, surveillance video captured their recently-purchased sailboat heading into the Gulf of Mexico. CNN's Kim Segal and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.

Options: - being dead - misery - kill yourself - loss of someone - scars Hmmm, let me think.","output":"I believe you are asking for possible reasons someone might commit suicide. There are a variety of factors that can contribute to someone feeling suicidal, and it's important to know that these reasons can vary from individual to individual. Here are some possible reasons: 1. Severe mental health issues: Mental health problems such as clinical depression, bipolar disorder, or anxiety disorders can make individuals more susceptible to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. 2. Loss of a loved one: Grieving the loss of someone close, including a family member, partner, or friend, can lead to intense feelings of sadness and even hopelessness, which may result in suicidal thoughts. 3. Severe trauma or abuse: Experiencing or witnessing traumatic events, such as natural disasters, accidents, war, or abuse, can lead to emotional difficulties and a higher likelihood of self-harm. 4. Substance abuse: Alcohol or drug addiction can put people at an increased risk of suicide due to the negative impact on their mental state and emotions. 5. Feelings of hopelessness and isolation: A sense of hopelessness and a lack of social support can result in a person feeling trapped and unable to see other options, which might lead to suicidal thoughts. 6. Chronic or terminal illness: Dealing with a serious or terminal illness can lead to feelings of despair and thoughts of suicide, especially if the pain is unbearable or life feels too difficult to manage. These are just a few possible reasons someone may commit suicide, and it's also important to remember that there might be other reasons not listed here.

Looking at the given choices, Option [1] provides a justification for why Orchids are Randy's favorite flowers, but it does not explain why they are not Jason's favorite flowers. So this option is not relevant for our sentence completion. However, Option [2] provides context for why Orchids are not Jason's favorite flowers - because he grew up around them as a child. It could be inferred that growing up around Orchids might have led him to develop a preference for other flowers. So, the most suitable option to complete the sentence is [2]. The complete sentence would be: \\"Orchids are the favorite flowers of Randy but not Jason because Jason grew up around them as a child.\\""},{"instruction":"b) Retenues de garantie non restituées Which language is this?","output":"The language used in the sentence \\"Retenues de garantie non restituées\\" is French. The French language, \\"français\\" or \\"la langue française,\\" is a Romance language that originated in France. It's the official language in more than 28 countries, including Belgium, Canada, Rwanda, Cameroon, and Haiti. This language is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations. French is known for its beautiful phonetic sound, richness in literature, and complex grammatical setup. It's arguably one of the most romantic languages globally and is commonly used not only in daily conversation but also in high arts like literature, sophisticated gastronomy, and haute couture. The sentence \\"Retenues de garantie non restituées\\" translates to English as \\"Retention guarantees not returned\\". In a contractual context, these might refer to certain financial guarantees held back (retained) and not yet returned or refunded to the other party. The context though can vary, so understanding its use requires a better understanding of the situation at hand. Just like any other language, French has many dialects and regional differences. Its vocabulary and syntax have been influenced by other languages, including Latin, Celtic, and Frankish and going further into history, Greek and Etruscan. Growing globalization has influenced French, too, leading to the adoption of many English words – a phenomenon that leads to ongoing debates about the preservation and protection of the French language. Its grammatical structure and vocabulary base make French a relatively difficult language to learn for native English speakers, though its widespread use makes it a popular choice for second-language learners worldwide."},{"instruction":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Inadditiontoinsertabackgroundimageinthispartisanimagesliderthatwillinspireyouruserstobookatableinyourrestaurant.","output":"Step 1: Identify the main components and ideas in the given character list.

Duane Edward Buck already had eaten a final meal of fried chicken, fried fish, french fries, salad, jalapeno peppers and apples when news came of the court's decision on Thursday evening, Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark said. \\"Praise the Lord Jesus,\\" Clark quoted the condemned man as saying. \\"God is worthy to be praised. God's mercy triumphs over judgment, and I feel good.\\" Buck had been set to die by lethal injection, but the court delayed the execution to give it time to review the way a lower court handled the case. While that happens, Buck remains on death row. Buck was convicted of the 1995 killings of Debra Gardner and Kenneth Butler. According to Texas officials, Buck shot Gardner in front of her daughter, who begged for her mother's life. A third person, Phyllis Taylor, was shot, but she sought clemency for Buck this week. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, however, recommended against granting Buck clemency Buck's attorney, Katherine C. Black, said the recommendation, \\"fails to recognize what the highest legal officer in the state of Texas has acknowledged: No one should be executed based on a process tainted by considerations of race.\\" Black is referring to U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who was the state's attorney general in 2000, when he spoke of seven death row inmates, including Buck. Cornyn said he believed the inmates had been unfairly sentenced to death based on testimony that was racially tainted by psychologist Walter Quijano, who repeatedly told juries that black or Hispanic defendants were more likely to commit future crimes. 1.

Let's break down the premise and hypothesis: Premise: \\"People at a party standing around an illuminated fountain.\\" This statement suggests that there are people gathered at an event, and they are standing around a lit-up fountain. Therefore, we can assume that there are people attending the party. Hypothesis: \\"Nobody at a party.\\" This statement proposes that there are no attendees at the party.

The hypothesis states that there is nobody at a party, which contradicts the premise that explicitly mentions the presence of people at the party standing around the illuminated fountain.

But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. A:","output":"Which factor is primarily causing robins to sing at night and potentially affecting their health according to the study conducted by Dr. David Dominoni? A. Noise pollution from cities B. Territorial disputes with other birds C. Artificial light from street lamps, takeaway signs, and homes D. Presence of heavy industrial machinery Explanation: The article mentions that Dr. David Dominoni's study has found that artificial light from sources such as street lamps, takeaway signs, and homes affect robins' biological clock, causing them to be wide awake and sing when they should be asleep. As a result, lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk."},{"instruction":"Paul knew that the plan was insane and probably illegal. Certainly the stuff he'd been helping Chloe and her gang of followers do for the last few hours was technically illegal. He'd asked them why they were helping him, what did they hope to gain? They'd told him that this is what they did for fun. Chloe assured him that they \\"lived for this kinda shit.\\" Ok, fine. He could sort of see that. Once he was there, helping them come up with the plan and then actually carrying it out, it sure as hell was exciting - probably the most exciting thing he'd ever done. Now that he was home and alone with his misgivings and paranoia, it all seemed like a really stupid idea.

It was five in the morning when Paul got back to his apartment. He'd told Chloe that he wanted to get a few hours sleep before the big meeting, but he now realized that there was no way he was going to be able to relax.

Professional counselors and therapists are trained specifically to help with coping skills such as anxiety triggers. Find therapists in your area by getting a list of providers through your health insurance. Consider contacting your school counselor, university counseling center, or your work’s Employee Assistance Program for referrals to counseling. Find out about if the therapist has expertise in your anxiety triggers. You can even ask the therapist what kind of evidence-based practices they use. Different types of therapy techniques include CBT, DBT, Solution Focused, Strengths Based, and Prolonged Exposure Therapy. Research the techniques the therapist uses to learn more about them. There may be other treatment options to help with your anxiety if it continues to impair your daily life. Unavoidable anxiety triggers mean that you may have to encounter certain people or situations regularly and feel overwhelmed often. Talk with your health care provider or a mental health specialist about medication options if other strategies are not working for you. A doctor or psychiatrist can prescribe medications to help with your symptoms. Talk with your primary care provider about options or a referral to a specialist for advice. Talk with a mental health specialist about your medication treatment, and whether it has been beneficial. Often a combination of medication and therapy are best for severe anxiety. Many people face anxiety that is overwhelming and unavoidable. Depending on the type of anxiety that you’re facing, talk with a counselor or therapist about support groups in your area. Support groups are often less expensive than individual therapy. Working as a group on your anxiety symptoms can help you feel less isolated or judged. A support group is a safe space to engage with others about your concerns. Many support groups are led by trained mental health professionals or peer support specialists who have been through the same anxious feelings as you. Avoid isolating yourself when anxiety hits. Often this action will in turn make you feel less willing to handle anxiety the next time. After an anxiety-provoking situation has occurred, instead focus on turning to friends or family that support and reassure you. Have two or three friends or family that you can call when you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Talk with them in advance about them acting as your “calling buddies.” Do activities with your friends or family. If you are hesitant to do things in groups, then find activities to do with just one friend or family member. Trust and confide in them. The people that love and care about you often want to be helpful and supportive as you learn to handle your anxiety.","output":"You may consider therapy if you are having difficulties managing anxiety and triggers. Professional therapists can assist you in developing coping mechanisms. Find local providers through your health insurance or get referrals from a school counselor, university counseling center, or work's Employee Assistance Program. Check if the therapist specializes in dealing with your anxiety triggers and uses evidence-based practices. They may use techniques like CBT, DBT, Solution Focused, Strengths Based, and Prolonged Exposure Therapy. If therapy isn't helpful, discuss medication options with your health care provider or mental health specialist. A combination of medication and therapy could be optimal for severe anxiety.

When anxiety hits, avoid isolation. Instead, reach out to supportive friends or family members whom you can rely upon during anxious moments. Share in activities with them to ease your anxiety.

The noise startles both Robert and Cassandra. Cassandra is Jane's sister and Robert is her fiance. Both Robert and Cassandra run out of their own rooms to see what the noise is and Robert catches a glimpse of Cassandra in her night gown which prompts the latter to smile slyly and then rush back to her own room.Mrs. Austen, who was trying to sleep, complains that Jane needs a husband. Rev. Austen, lying next to her, comments that because he has set an example of perfection, Jane can not be satisfied with anything less. The couple then playfully banter before rising for church.Meanwhile, Tom Lefroy is in London. He is the nephew of a very prominent judge but enjoys sowing his wild oats. Tom spends a lot of his time boxing, drinking, and enjoying the company of prostitutes and mistresses. His family is very poor, but his stern uncle has taken him under his wing in hopes that Tom will prove to be a respectable lawyer one day. Tom is friends with Henry Austen, a recent Oxford graduate who will be returning home soon.One day, Tom comes in late to court where his uncle is presiding. It is the last straw. His uncle speaks with him in private, saying that he is fed up with Tom.

He opened the jar of pickles when no one else at home could. He was the only one in the house who wasn't afraid to go into the basement by himself. Whenever it rained, he got into the car and brought it around to the door. When anyone was sick, he went out to get the prescription filled. He set mousetraps.

These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!). Question: Who ate the cake?

(2) He is remembered in his diocese as bringing \`\` a spirit of peace , a desire to bring the great spirit and pastoral libéralité '' Do these two sentences mean the same thing? - no. - yes.","output":"While both sentences convey a similar meaning, they are not exactly the same. In Sentence 1: \\"In his diocese, he will be remembered as 'a spirit of peace, a desire to bring the pastoral spirit and great libéralité.\\" This sentence implies that the person is still alive and predicts that he will be remembered in the future for his contributions to his diocese, which include being a spirit of peace, having a desire to bring the pastoral spirit, and demonstrating great libéralité (a French term implying generosity or open-mindedness). In Sentence 2: \\"He is remembered in his diocese as bringing 'a spirit of peace, a desire to bring the great spirit and pastoral libéralité.'\\" This sentence implies that the person has already passed away, or that his contributions to the diocese have already been acknowledged and appreciated. However, the wording is slightly different, as it states that he brought a \\"great spirit\\" instead of a \\"pastoral spirit,\\" which could result in a slightly different interpretation.

The best advice is to hire a Registered Land Surveyor in your home state to mark the property line for you before you begin construction. Your city or town usually does not keep very detailed records of your property's boundary information. GIS (geographic information system) maps and Assessors maps are highly inaccurate when it comes to property boundaries. You can search for PropertySurvey Pins on your property. These are also located on the corners of a lot. Just because an old fence or other “assumed” property boundary wasis in place that does not always mean that it is correct. Choose a fence height before getting too far into the project. Six foot is normal for a privacy fence, a livestock fence four feet high is usually sufficient, and picket fences are often three feet high. Fence height is important in the early stages, as it determines things like post hole depth. Most cities have a height ordinance, so be sure to check this before you choose your fence height. Place stakes at the corners roughly where you wish your fence to go. Tie a string around the stakes and run the string between stakes. Use a square or square-level to make sure that the corners\\" where our stakes are placed are squared (the two sides form a 90° angle). You can also square the corners by measuring the strings. Measure 3' on one side and 4' on the other. If the distance between the two marks (diagonally) is equal to 5', then the corner is square. Measure out lengths of 8' or less along the strings once you've square your corners and stake those locations to indicate the location for your support posts. You generally want to take the total distance and divide it by 8 but if you have a length of fence that is not divisible by 8, you'll need to break it down into smaller sections. For example, a 24' fence would need 2 middle posts to create the three 8' sections, but a 25' fence would need 3 middle posts at 6.25' for each section in order to look even and be structurally sound. To find the length and number for odd fence lengths, go up to the next number of posts and then divide the total length of the fence by the number of resulting sections. Use a post-hole digger to dig holes at the locations you staked. The posts will need to be buried at least 33% as deep as they are tall (example: an 8' high fence needs a hole 2.5' deep), so your hole will need to be at least that depth plus a few extra inches. The hole should be wide enough that there is room around the post when you put it in. Because soil conditions vary, and the height of the fence, the type of fencing, and other factors must be considered in determining how deep the post should be, you will have to calculate the hole depth for yourself. Place 3-4\\" of gravel at the bottom of the hole. Place the post in the hole and get it into alignment. Check to make sure that the corners are still square, use a post leveler to make sure it is straight, and make sure it is sitting at the correct height. Carefully holding your post in place, pour in instant concrete until the hole is 2/3 full. Add water to the top and use a stirring stick to mix the cement. Prop the post into place (stabilize using temporary nailed boards if necessary) and allow the concrete to set following the manufacturer's instructions. Fill any remainder of the hole with dirt once the concrete has set. Pull a builder's line from one end post to the other, at an equal height above the ground, preferably at the top of the post (if your posts were placed correctly). This will help you keep the height of the fence the same along the way. Cut 2x4 rails (or horizontal support boards) to the appropriate length to reach between the centers of the posts. If you can, use a single rail for the entire length of the fence section. Rails should be no more than 24\\" apart, so most fences will have 2-3 rails. Attach the rails using decking screws. With your support boards in place, you can attach your pickets (vertical boards, also called privacy boards). There are many different styles and ways of doing this, depending on how you want your fence to look. The most basic is a board on board fence, where the fence boards are nailed (using a nail gun, nailed at the support boards) with the distance of less than one board between them. Place the first board up and then use a level to “plumb” (vertical level) the board. Then, nail or screw the board in place. Use a spacer and then place the next board. Use the level periodically to check that it is “plumb.” These boards are usually 1X6 rough sawn lumber but you can buy other pre-cut fencing boards as well. If nailing the boards by hand, use 8d spiral shank galvanized nails. Once you're done, you will want to treat the boards to increase the longevity of your fence. You can paint your fence, stain it, or simply apply a weather-proofing finish to keep your fence looking great for years to come. Enjoy! This will usually either contain silicone solids, or linseed oil. If you plan on painting a finish paint, stick with an oil-based sealer, and use an oil-based polyurethane paint or exterior enamel for the finish paint.","output":"To build a fence, it is crucial to first determine your property line by hiring a Registered Land Surveyor. Make sure to choose the fence's height beforehand, keeping in mind local height ordinances. Start by placing stakes at the corners of the area you want to cover and tie a string between them, ensuring the corners are squared and forming 90-degree angles. You can also use the 3-4-5 rule to square the corners. Once the corners are squared, measure out lengths of 8 feet or less along the strings to mark the locations for your support posts. Use a post-hole digger to dig holes at these locations. The holes should be deep enough to bury a suitable portion of the post, which is dependent on various factors such as fence height, soil conditions, and the type of fencing. Place gravel at the bottom of each hole and position the posts accordingly. Use a post leveler to ensure the posts are straight and aligned. Pour instant concrete into the hole up to 2/3 of its depth, mix with water, and let it set. Once the concrete has set, fill the rest of the hole with dirt. Pull a builder's line between the end posts to keep the fence height consistent.

American stories speak of Johnny Appleseed, who went throughout America collecting apple seeds and planting apple trees. He had a great love for nature and went through fields and farms adding richness and beauty to the country. One of the first sayings taught to school children is, \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\\" This short saying encourages children to eat fresh fruit to keep healthy. If someone always says good words to a person, people will call him an _ . This, however, is not a good name. If someone is very dear to us, we say that he or she is the \\"apple of our eye\\". Most people believe that the fruit which Eve gave to Adam was an apple, even though the Bible never says so. The apple, therefore, is a deep part of the language and stories of America. An apple is also delicious. Apples can be cooked in many ways, used as a dessert , and made into sweet juice. In many parts of the country during the harvest season, a popular activity is to go into an apple garden to pick apples. Washington, D. C. and New York are both famous for their apples.

The band claims to play \\"loud, heavy, noisy, punk rock\\" and is influenced by 1980s hardcore punk and post-hardcore bands. The band have released several 7\\" singles and four albums, and are currently signed to Sub Pop. In March 2013, Pissed Jeans was named one of Fuse TV's 30 must-see artists at SXSW. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Post-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that derives from hardcore punk, maintaining hardcore's aggression and intensity, but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression initially inspired by post-punk and noise rock. Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. - Noise rock is a style of experimental rock rooted in noise music. The genre, which gained prominence in the 1980s, makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock music, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock. - Hope For Men is a 2007 album by Pissed Jeans . The lyrics of many of the songs are about very mundane subjects , such as eating ice cream and scrapbooking , in sharp contrast to the frenzied vocals and loud , off - key instrumentals . The tracks \`\` Scrapbooking '' and \`\` The Jogger '' are essentially spoken - word tracks , the latter with a crashing guitar backdrop . - Sub Pop is a record label founded in 1986 by Bruce Pavitt. In 1988, Sub Pop Records LLC was formed by Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman in Seattle, Washington. Sub Pop achieved fame in the late 1980s for first signing Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and many other bands from the Seattle alternative rock scene. They are often credited with taking the first steps toward popularizing grunge music, and have continued to achieve critical and commercial success in the new millennium, with bands such as Fleet Foxes, Foals, Beach House, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, Sleater-Kinney, Blitzen Trapper, No Age, Wolf Parade and The Shins on their roster. In 1995 the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats.

Detect tooth decay. Gander at your gums. Check for cavities. Examine your fillings to identify any potential problems. Check for chips. Article:","output":"Title: Taking Charge of Your Oral Health: Steps to Identify Common Dental Issues Introduction Oral health is an integral aspect of maintaining overall health and well-being. The mouth serves as the entry point for our digestive and respiratory systems, requiring regular care and attention. By ensuring good oral hygiene practices, you can prevent a myriad of dental issues, such as gum disease, tooth decay, cavities, and more. To help you stay on top of your oral health, here is a step-by-step guide to identify common dental issues. Step 1: Find any buildup of plaque or tartar on your teeth Plaque is a transparent, sticky film that continuously forms on the teeth. Left unattended, it hardens into tartar, which is a yellow or brownish deposit that can lead to gum diseases and tooth loss. To identify any buildup of plaque or tartar, use a mirror to examine your teeth thoroughly, paying close attention to the gum line. If you spot any yellow or brown deposits, this indicates a need for a dental cleaning. Step 2: Detect tooth decay Tooth decay, the process of enamel erosion that damages the tooth structure, is a common dental issue experienced by individuals of all ages. To detect tooth decay, inspect your teeth for any white spots, discolorations, or dark patches. Tooth decay typically begins with white spots and can progress to deep cavities if left untreated. Step 3: Gander at your gums Healthy gums are essential for overall oral health. They should be firm, pink, and free from any swelling, redness, or bleeding. Examine your gums using a mirror, and notice if there are any abnormalities or signs of inflammation. If you find any, schedule an appointment with your dentist to address the issue promptly. Step 4: Check for cavities Cavities are permanently damaged areas on the surface of a tooth that can lead to toothaches and sensitivity. Use a mirror to examine your teeth closely and look for any tiny openings or indentations. Cavities can start out small but grow larger over time, leading to more severe dental issues if not treated. Step 5: Examine your fillings to identify any potential problems Fillings are a standard dental procedure that repairs cavities. Over time, however, they may wear out and require replacement. Inspect your fillings regularly for any signs of wear or cracks. If you notice any abnormalities, consult your dentist to determine whether a filling replacement is necessary. Step 6: Check for chips Chipped teeth not only affect the appearance of your smile but can also lead to sensitivity and difficulty chewing. Examine your teeth closely and run your tongue along their surfaces to feel for any sharp edges or irregularities. If you notice any chips, visit your dentist to discuss treatment options. Conclusion Maintaining good oral health is essential for overall well-being. By regularly inspecting your teeth, gums, and existing dental work, you can identify potential issues early on and seek prompt treatment. Additionally, practice good oral hygiene habits such as brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily, and scheduling regular dental check-ups to keep your teeth and gums healthy and strong."},{"instruction":"SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.

The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles.

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

Many people in Japan were disappointed with their performance and were looking for a change, which eventually led to the Liberal Democratic Party returning to power."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Sai\\" A:","output":"Since there is no actual review provided, I cannot give a rating to the review.

Typically, this involves using an access point, such as a router or a switch, to facilitate communication between the devices. However, many people are still unaware of the fact that it is possible to establish a direct network between two PCs without using an access point. One solution is by utilizing a crossover Ethernet cable. In this article, we will explore the benefits of setting up a direct network, how it works, and the step-by-step process for setting one up using a crossover Ethernet cable. Why Set Up a Direct Network? There are several advantages to setting up a direct network between two computers: 1. Cost Savings: By skipping the need for additional hardware, such as routers and switches, users can save money on equipment. 2. Simplified Setup: A direct network is easier and faster to set up than a traditional network. 3. Direct Data Transfer: A direct connection allows for faster transfer of data between the two connected computers, as it bypasses the need for an intermediary device. 4. Increased Privacy: In a direct connection, there is no chance of third-party interference, making it a more secure way to transfer sensitive data. Understanding Crossover Ethernet Cables The key to creating a direct network between two PCs without an access point lies in the use of a crossover Ethernet cable. Unlike standard Ethernet cables, which have identical pin configurations on both ends, crossover cables have different pin configurations. This unique design allows two devices (such as PCs) to communicate directly with each other, without the need for an intermediary device. Setting Up a Direct Network using a Crossover Ethernet Cable Step 1: Obtain a Crossover Ethernet Cable To set up a direct network between two PCs, you will first need to purchase a crossover Ethernet cable. These cables are available at most electronics stores and online retailers. Make sure to choose a cable of appropriate length, depending on the distance between the two computers. Step 2: Connect the Crossover Ethernet Cable Connect one end of the crossover Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port on the first PC, and the other end into the Ethernet port on the second PC. Step 3: Configure the IP Addresses For the direct connection to work, you will need to assign static IP addresses for both PCs. To do this in Windows, follow these instructions: 1. Open the Control Panel and navigate to Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings. 2. Right-click on the Ethernet connection and select \\"Properties.\\" 3. Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click on \\"Properties.\\" 4. Choose \\"Use the following IP address\\" and enter an IP address for the first PC (for example, 192.168.0.1) with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. 5. Repeat this process for the second PC, choosing a slightly different IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.2). 6. Click \\"OK\\" to finish the configuration. Step 4: Test the Connection To verify whether the direct network has been set up successfully, try pinging the other PC. To do this, open the Command Prompt and type \\"ping\\" followed by the IP address of the other computer (e.g., \\"ping 192.168.0.2\\"). If the line says \\"Reply from...\\", it means the connection is successful. Conclusion Setting up a direct network between two PCs without an access point is not only possible but relatively simple with the help of a crossover Ethernet cable. This method offers a cost-effective, easy-to-implement solution for users who need a direct connection between computers to transfer data at high speeds and with increased privacy."},{"instruction":"In 1919 Father James Burns became president of Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis.

In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009. In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s. In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque.

At the time, RKO was turning out classic noirs by the dozens. But whatever the value of those shadowy downers, they reflected a war-time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the Eisenhower era. Few films of the late-40's are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy. Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) works as an ad-man on Madison Ave. where in his little daughter's words-- he sells things to people that they don't need, at prices they can't afford. He's making good money, but like thousands of others, he's tired of living in a cramped urban \\"cave\\". So, with wife Myrnah Loy, they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the Connecticutt countryside. Needless to say, in the arms of nature, they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion. There's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script. I don't know if writers Panama and Frank got an Oscar, but they should have. Of course, the humor revolves around all the problems that pop-up when city people build a big house on rural land. The annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage, with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving Grant a hard time. Of course, no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than Grant, so it's just one well-placed laugh after another, particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own. Yet, oddly, the film appears to have no comedic high-point. Instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don't peak at any particular point. That's a real movie triumph for any era. Reaching back 60 years later, we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind. With their live-in maid, the Blandings may not be a typical American family, but that post-war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical. And what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than Blandings as an \\"ad-man\\" tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more \\"ham\\". More than anything, however, there's the movie's sunny optimism. Oh sure, the feeling falters at times, yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the Blandings just stick to their dream carries them through. Indeed, life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge, so I expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day. It's that easily over-looked subtext, along with the sheer entertainment value, that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post-war period.

He is also an entrepreneur and anti-doping advocate. LeMond was born in Lakewood, California, and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, near Reno. He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy, with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations. LeMond is a longtime vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning of his relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari. His outspokenness placed him in the center of the anti-doping controversy. LeMond has consistently questioned the relationship between riders and unethical sports doctors like Ferrari, and has pointed out that doping products ultimately victimize the professional cyclists who make use of them. Said LeMond: \\"When I speak out about doping people could translate it and think it was about the riders. Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders. I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price.\\" LeMond's most notable conflicts have been with fellow Tour riders Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis. He has also been critical of Alberto Contador, the UCI, and its former president, Pat McQuaid. In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond: \\"It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.\\" McQuaid rejected LeMond's call for new leadership and was dismissive of LeMond. Ultimately McQuaid was defeated in his bid for a third term by British Cycling president Brian Cookson at the September 2013 UCI Congress in Florence, Italy.

Vitamin C supplements are measured in micrograms—see part one for the required amounts of vitamin C for different people. Many foods contain vitamin C, and consuming these can help you increase your vitamin C intake. Raw pineapple has 16mg of vitamin C, asparagus has 31 mg, raw broccoli has 89 mg, sun-dried tomatoes in oil have 101 mg, and raw parsley has 133 mg. Citrus is an especially good source of vitamin C. One cup of grapefruit, for instance, provides an entire day's worth of vitamin C, while a glass of orange juice is the equivalent of 165 percent of your daily vitamin C intake. Fresh squeezed orange juice or a physical orange is better for you than processed orange juice. What's more, the vitamin C in citrus will help curb stress by lowering stress hormone levels and possibly by reducing blood pressure, boost your energy by helping you to absorb iron better, and provide other essential phytonutrients that work in tandem with vitamin C, some of which aid memory. Check out the nutritional chart produced by your government's health department with respect to recommended daily intake of vitamin C. You'll be surprised how easy it is to vary your diet to include plenty of vitamin C sources. In the United States, the National Institutes of health have some recommendations. Vitamin C does not last in storage, so it is steadily lost the longer it is stored. As such, be prepared to eat your food as fresh as possible rather than leaving it to linger in the refrigerator or pantry. For example, leaving your broccoli in the fridge and then boiling it will reduce the vitamin C content considerably, compared to freshly picking the broccoli and steaming it that same day. It's good to grow your own vegetables if possible, even if you just grow broccoli on a balcony or potatoes in a bag or barrel. Wash fresh fruits and vegetables and then allow them to dry. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator and eat them within a few days. Do not soak them or store them in water because the vitamin C dissolves out of the plant into the water. Vitamin C also leaches out in cooking water. Fresh food is the best source of vitamin C and most fruit and vegetables contain vitamin C. In particular, aim to eat food from the cabbage family, red and green peppers, potatoes, blackcurrants, strawberries, citrus fruit, and tomatoes. This includes broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and collard greens. Eat the vegetables raw or steam them, using only a small amount of water to maximize the amount of vitamins the vegetables retain. Have a salad with spinach leaves instead of lettuce. Spinach is a better source of vitamin C when eaten raw. Toss in green and red bell peppers and tomatoes for added vitamin C. Vegetables lose micronutrients when cooked. Potatoes are also a good source of vitamin C. In spite of what you may have heard, the skin does not have the highest concentration of vitamin C, but its fiber is good for you. When having a baked potato, be sure to also eat the skin. Juice is calorie dense and you lack the roughage and other benefits of eating the fruit when consuming it as juice. However, you can enjoy juice as a means of increasing your vitamin C intake by doing the following: Juice with pulp is better for you than juice without it because vitamin C is better absorbed if it is consumed in the presence of bioflavonoids, which are found mostly in fruit pulp. Make fresh squeezed orange juice or purchase frozen concentrate instead of premixed, ready-to-drink refrigerated cartons. Frozen concentrates have significantly more vitamin C in them because the pasteurization process destroys some of the vitamin C in premixed juices. Make your own vitamin C booster by making rosehip syrup. As an added bonus, this syrup is one that children will like.

Torchbearers will carry the flame along 200 miles of London streets this week. The Olympic Games open in the city on July 27. The buildup to the Games has been overshadowed by a fiasco over security guards. Article:","output":"Title: The Olympic Flame's Journey through London Amid Security Guard Fiasco Introduction: This week, the iconic Olympic flame will make its way through the streets of London, carried by torchbearers along a 200-mile route leading to the opening of the Olympic Games on July 27. But while this monumental event begins to unfold, it is marred by the ongoing security guard fiasco that has entangled the city in recent weeks. In this article, we take a glimpse at the journey the flame will embark on, led by a Royal Marine commando, and discuss the somber backdrop of the security guard crisis that continues to overshadow the upcoming Olympic Games. The Flame's Arrival: The Olympic torch relay holds a special place in the hearts of sports enthusiasts and casual onlookers alike, as it represents the unity, dedication, and indomitable spirit of athletes worldwide. As such, the organizers have orchestrated a grand entrance for the flame, with a Royal Marine commando bringing it into the Tower of London via helicopter. This thrilling spectacle will undoubtedly draw the attention of Londoners and the world, serving as an awe-inspiring start to a week-long relay leading up to the Games themselves. Torchbearers and the 200-mile Journey: Over the course of this week, the Olympic flame will be transported through 200 miles of London streets, passed from one torchbearer to another. Each torchbearer has been carefully selected, many due to their inspiring stories and dedication to their communities. As they carry the torch, they will simultaneously represent and celebrate the spirit of the Olympic Games, embodying the values of perseverance, teamwork, and sportsmanship that have come to be synonymous with this international event. The Security Guard Fiasco: Unfortunately, as the Olympic flame makes its way through the city, its bright glow has been tarnished somewhat by the ongoing fiasco regarding security guards for the Games. The buildup to the Olympics has been plagued by scandals involving the contractors responsible for providing security, with reports of insufficient guards, undertrained staff, and compromised safety measures. This has led to increasing concerns over the safety of the athletes, spectators, and the city itself during the Games, casting an unfortunate shadow over what should be a time of global unity and celebration. Conclusion: In the face of the security guard fiasco, the Olympic flame's journey through London serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration. The image of a Royal Marine commando carrying the torch into the Tower of London, coupled with the hundreds of torchbearers who will follow in his footsteps, is a poignant testament to the strength and resilience that the Olympic Games represent. One can only hope that the city's authorities can resolve the security concerns and allow the true spirit of the Olympics to shine through when the Games commence on July 27."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

Question: Milo knows that his wooden table has less resistance then his throw rug. He slid his cranberry across both surfaces and the cranberry moved less quickly across the (A) throw rug (B) wooden table A:","output":"The cranberry moved less quickly across the throw rug. To understand why the cranberry moved less quickly across the throw rug compared to the wooden table, we first need to understand the concept of friction. Friction is a force that opposes motion when two surfaces are in contact. It's generally responsible for the resistance we feel when we attempt to move something across a surface - the more friction, the harder it is to move an object. There are two main types of friction: static friction and kinetic friction. Static friction is what keeps an object at rest, whereas kinetic friction is the resistance experienced by an object already in motion. Both types can be at play when sliding a cranberry across a surface. Friction is also dependent on the nature of the surfaces interacting. Rougher surfaces have a greater frictional force compared to smoother ones because the irregularities of the rougher surface act like miniature obstacles to the object's movement. In our scenario, the wooden table is a smooth surface. It has fewer surface irregularities that would obstruct the motion of the cranberry. As a result, there is less friction between the table and the cranberry, which allows the fruit to slide more easily and move more quickly. On the other hand, a throw rug is a soft, textured fabric surface, which has considerably more surface irregularities than a wooden table. These irregularities increase the frictional force between the rug and the cranberry, making it harder for the cranberry to move. Therefore, when Milo slides the cranberry across the throw rug, it moves less quickly compared to when it slides across the wooden table. So, option (A) is correct. The cranberry moved less quickly across the throw rug than the wooden table due to the increased friction the rug provides. In addition, it's significant to note how the difference in the materials and textures of the surfaces - a smooth, hard wooden table versus a soft, textured throw rug - can greatly affect the friction and thereby the speed at which objects move across them. This principle is widely used in various applications, from making roads to designing sports equipment."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

According to the 1478 census Selânik (), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniote Jews community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the citys population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regimes invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city. How many more Jewish households were there in Selânik in 1519 than there had been in 1500?","output":"In the year 1500, there were 3,770 Jewish households in Selânik. By the year 1519, the number of Jewish households had increased to 15,715. To find out the increase in the number of Jewish households from 1500 to 1519, you can simply subtract the number of Jewish households in 1500 from the number in 1519. So, 15,715 (the number in 1519) minus 3,770 (the number in 1500) equals 11,945. Therefore, there were 11,945 more Jewish households in Selânik in 1519 than there had been in the year 1500. This significant increase may be attributed primarily to the influx of Sephardic Jews who migrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain under the 1492 Alhambra Decree. This historical event led to a considerable shift in the population composition of Selânik, with Sephardic Jewish households constituting 54% of the city's total population by 1519. The Ottoman regime’s invitation to Jewish settlement could have been viewed as a strategic move to counterbalance the ethnic Greek population and prevent it from dominating the city."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen?

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside.

Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back.

Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas \\"in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.\\" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended.

Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet (; 2 June 1857 – 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924. Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory. In his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras.

If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave.

Pick from: [I] yes; [II] it is not possible to tell; [III] no;","output":"[III] no Based on the premise provided, \\"An expensive brand like Carlos I is much smoother,\\" we can infer that Carlos I is a high-quality and costly product. The statement implies that the brand prides itself on providing a refined and superior experience for its consumers, most likely targeting a more affluent or discerning clientele. Therefore, from this information alone, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Carlos is suitable for the penny pincher\\" is not true. A \\"penny pincher\\" typically refers to someone who is thrifty or frugal with their money and prioritizes cost-saving measures over luxury or indulgence. They carefully evaluate the value and necessity of a product or service before making a financial commitment, often opting for more affordable alternatives if available. In this context, purchasing an expensive product like Carlos I appears to be in direct contrast with the value-seeking principles of a penny pincher. Moreover, a frugal consumer is likely to prioritize functional benefits and needs rather than seek a smooth and luxurious experience, which is what Carlos I seems to offer. For these reasons, the hypothesis \\"Carlos is suitable for the penny pincher\\" fails to align with the core values and preferences of a frugal individual. It is important to note, however, that personal tastes and priorities can vary significantly from one individual to another, and some penny pinchers may make occasional exceptions for a particular product that brings them immense satisfaction.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. and the situation: In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. Answer the following question: Which lake will have more dead zones? A:","output":"Lake Montopeke is more likely to have more dead zones. This is because the farm next to Lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis, which dissolves the fertilizer in the soil. The runoff from the rain then carries the dissolved fertilizer away, and it ultimately ends up in the nearby Lake Montopeke. This introduction of nitrogen from the fertilizer promotes excessive algae growth in the lake. As the algae use up carbon dioxide and then die, decomposers break down the dead tissue, using up the oxygen in the water. This process can lead to the creation of dead zones, or areas with too little oxygen to support most aquatic life. On the other hand, the farm adjacent to Lake Costanza receives less rain, and as a result, there is less opportunity for runoff carrying dissolved fertilizer into the lake. Therefore, Lake Costanza is less likely to be subjected to the same degree of nutrient enrichment and subsequent dead zone formation as Lake Montopeke."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Can we infer the following? \\"Child labor\\" is illegal in Canada, but it is legal in the United States.","output":"In order to infer whether the statement is true or false, we need to gather information about child labor laws in both Canada and the United States. Step 1: Research Canadian child labor laws I researched Canadian child labor laws and found that the minimum working age varies by province, but generally, it is set between 14 and 16 years old. There are also restrictions on the type of work and hours that minors can be employed, which are designed to protect children and ensure they have access to education. Step 2: Research U.S. child labor laws I researched the child labor laws in the United States and found that under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the minimum working age is 14 for non-agricultural jobs and the U.S. has strict rules regarding the hours and conditions under which minors may work. Step 3: Analyze the information Based on the information gathered, both Canada and the United States have laws in place to protect children from harmful or exploitative work that could affect their health, safety, and access to education. Conclusion: The statement \\"Child labor is illegal in Canada, but it is legal in the United States\\" is not accurate because both countries have regulations against exploitative or harmful child labor. The laws may differ slightly in terms of the minimum working age, restrictions, and type of work, but they both aim to protect children from exploitation and harmful work conditions."},{"instruction":"Where would the heifer go to join her herd?

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation in the given situation is that the lungs remove more oxygen from the air than usual. Let's analyze the steps and determine how this specific perturbation might affect the process of oxygen diffusion into cells from capillaries, focusing on the distinction between direct, indirect, and no impact on the process. 1. Air goes into the lungs: This step remains unchanged because the perturbation only affects the amount of oxygen removed from the air, not the physical process of air entering the lungs. 2. The lungs remove more oxygen from the air: This is the supposed perturbation and directly impacts this step of the process. The increased efficiency in oxygen removal leads to a higher concentration of oxygen in the air within the lungs, which might result in the increased availability of oxygen to diffuse. 3. Oxygen diffuses from alveoli in the lungs to the bloodstream: With a higher concentration of oxygen in the lungs resulting from the perturbation, the diffusion from alveoli to the bloodstream will be indirectly impacted. Higher concentration gradients tend to increase the rate of diffusion, thereby potentially allowing more oxygen to enter the bloodstream. 4. Hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen: Increased oxygen concentration in the bloodstream means that there is more available oxygen for hemoglobin to bind. Since the concentration of hemoglobin remains constant, this step will be indirectly impacted, and the overall oxygen-carrying capacity increases. 5. Red blood cells carry oxygen all around the body: Functionally, this step shouldn't be affected but with an increased oxygen-carrying capacity, the amount of oxygen transported will increase indirectly. This could lead to more oxygen being delivered to the tissues and cells throughout the body. 6. Oxygen diffuses into cells from capillaries: This final step will be indirectly impacted by the perturbation. The increased concentration of oxygen in the bloodstream results in a higher oxygen partial pressure in the blood. According to Fick's law of diffusion, this will increase the rate of diffusion from capillaries into cells, leading to more oxygen being available for cellular respiration. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation directly impacts the step of removing oxygen from the air in the lungs. This, in turn, indirectly impacts several other steps in the process of oxygen diffusion into cells from capillaries, ultimately leading to more oxygen being available for diffusion into the cells."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere What might be the last step of the process?

Context: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

If you wanted to use a more informal version of \\"you,\\" you could replace \\"vás\\" with \\"tě\\" or \\"tebe\\" (both mean \\"you\\" in the singular, informal form). 6. \\"měl\\" – This is the past masculine singular form of the auxiliary verb \\"mít\\" ('to have') used in conditional constructions. In English, this translates to \\"should have\\" or \\"ought to have.\\" 7. \\"zavolat\\" – This is the infinitive form of the verb \\"zavolat\\" ('to call'). So altogether, the phrase \\"Omlouvám se, vím, že jsem vás měl zavolat\\" translates to \\"Sorry, I know I should have called you\\" in English.

The main reason for cutting off the power is to ensure safety while working with electrical wiring. With the power off, we can follow the subsequent steps to wire a light without the risk of electrical shock. Here's a step-by-step guide to wiring a light after cutting off the power: 1. Gather the necessary tools and materials, such as a screwdriver, wire stripper, wire nuts, and the light fixture itself. 2. Identify the wires in the ceiling box. Typically, you will find a black or red wire (hot/live), a white wire (neutral), and a green or bare copper wire (ground). 3. Carefully strip the insulation from the ends of the wires, exposing about half an inch of the conductive core. 4. Follow the light fixture instructions to correctly attach the wires. Usually, this involves connecting the black or red wire from the ceiling box to the black or red wire from the light fixture (hot/live wires); the white wire from the ceiling box to the white wire from the light fixture (neutral wires); and the green or bare copper wire from the ceiling box to the green or bare copper wire from the light fixture (ground wires). 5. Use wire nuts to secure each connection, ensuring a strong and safe connection. 6. Gently fold the wires back into the ceiling box, taking care not to pinch them. 7. Attach the light fixture base to the ceiling box according to the manufacturer's instructions. 8. Install the light bulbs and any additional components, such as a cover or shade. 9. Turn the power back on at the junction box by switching the breaker so the fuse for the circuit supplying electricity to the fixture reads \\"on.\\" 10. Test the light switch to ensure the wiring is correct and the light functions as intended. By following these steps, the process of wiring a light becomes manageable and relatively simple once the power is off."},{"instruction":"The Japanese \\"Run Lola Run,\\" his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about anyone's face.

The early release was due to prosecutors recently discovering that state law doesn't permit an inmate to serve more than one year at a state jail (as opposed to a prison), leading a judge to modify Miller's sentence from two years to one, Variety reports. The judge also took into account the fact that Miller's lawyers—who the Hollywood Reporter says tried to get him out twice before—and the DA's office had struck a \\"two-for-one\\" agreement of possible early release for good behavior before Miller entered his plea last year. Miller, who had pleaded guilty to criminal trespassing and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Sarah Jones, will continue his 10-year probation, which includes a mandate saying he can't direct a film or otherwise have any supervisory role overseeing safety in a film production. On Feb. 20, 2014, Jones was working on the set of the Gregg Allman biopic, filming a scene on train tracks in Wayne County, Ga., when she was struck by a train and killed, per the Reporter; eight others were injured, Variety notes. The movie production company had reportedly been denied access to the tracks and shot there anyway, leading to Miller becoming the first known filmmaker to be convicted and jailed for an on-set death. Jones' parents tell Variety they initially agreed to the plea deal placing Miller in jail instead of prison due to his health and say they never would have agreed to it if they had known he'd be released after one year. \\"We don't mean to inflict more pain to Mr. Miller's family,\\" Jones' father, Richard Jones, said in court Wednesday. \\"It's about making the film industry a better, safer place.\\" Others expressed their outrage more forcefully. \\"It's a complete miscarriage of justice and merely a slap on the wrist,\\" one of Jones' former colleagues tells the Reporter. \\"One year in jail is hardly accountability.\\"","output":"\\"Midnight Rider\\" Director Randall Miller's Shock Early Release: Examining the Controversy and Its Impact on Film Industry Safety In a surprising turn of events, \\"Midnight Rider\\" director Randall Miller was released from a Georgia jail on Wednesday, after serving only half of his plea-deal term for his role in the tragic death of 27-year-old camera assistant Sarah Jones on the film set in 2014. This unexpected early release has sent shockwaves through the film industry and has sparked intense debate on the need for increased safety measures and accountability in film production. Miller's early release was due to the recent discovery by prosecutors that Georgia state law does not allow an inmate to serve more than one year in a state jail, as opposed to a prison. This led to a judge modifying Miller's sentence from two years to one, as reported by Variety. The Hollywood Reporter also noted that the judge took into account a \\"two-for-one\\" agreement of possible early release for good behavior that Miller's lawyers had previously struck with the District Attorney's office before he entered his plea last year. The ramifications of Jones' tragic death and Miller's subsequent early release extend far beyond the individuals involved, with significant implications on the film industry at large. The events have brought critical attention to on-set safety and accountability, seeing as the production company had reportedly been denied access to the train tracks where Jones was killed, but proceeded to film there regardless. This disregard for safety ultimately led to Miller becoming the first known filmmaker to be convicted and jailed for an on-set death. Jones' parents, who initially agreed to the plea deal placing Miller in jail instead of prison due to his health, told Variety they would not have agreed to the deal had they known he'd be released after one year. In a statement, Jones' father, Richard Jones, expressed his hopes for the film industry to learn from this tragedy: \\"It's about making the film industry a better, safer place.\\" As the film community grapples with the fallout from this shocking ruling, various stakeholders are raising their voices in frustration and disappointment. One of Jones' former colleagues told the Reporter, \\"It's a complete miscarriage of justice and merely a slap on the wrist. One year in jail is hardly accountability.\\" Despite his early release, Miller is still subject to the conditions of his 10-year probation, which includes a mandate stating that he cannot direct a film or have any supervisory role overseeing safety in film production. In light of this controversial ruling, the broader film industry must now reflect on the importance of prioritizing safety on sets, learning from the tragic loss of Sarah Jones, and ensuring that such a tragedy never occurs again. As Richard Jones poignantly stated, the ultimate goal must be to make the film industry a better, safer place for all those involved. Success will be measured not just in the prevention of future on-set accidents, but also in the establishment of clear, well-enforced safety protocols that protect everyone working in film production. With safety at the forefront of the conversation, the industry will move forward with a greater sense of responsibility, learning from this heartbreaking incident and working to ensure on-set safety for every member of a production crew."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about the following things: come, wall, water","output":"When you come near the wall, you can see the water splashing on it from the fountain."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The opening shots show Xanadu, Kane's vast, elaborate, and now unkempt estate in Florida. Interspersed with segments of his newsreel obituary are scenes from his life and death. Most puzzling are his last moments: clutching a snowglobe, he mutters the word \\"rosebud.\\" Kane, whose life was news and whose newspapers not only reported but formed public opinion, was central to his time, a larger-than-life figure. The newsreel editor feels that until they know who or what Rosebud is they won't have the whole story on Kane. He assigns a reporter called Thompson (William Alland) to investigate Rosebud.Thompson digs into Kane's life and hears a lot of stories, but none of them reveal the meaning of Rosebud. The reporter sees Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), the tycoon's ex-wife; she's drunk and won't speak to him. Then he reads the unpublished memoirs of Mr. Thatcher (George Coulouris), Kane's early financial adviser and childhood guardian, who later became a prime target of the Kane newspapers' trust-busting attacks. In one of many flashbacks, the Thatcher memoir shows Kane's mother signing guardianship of the boy and his fortune over to Thatcher, despite his father's objections. When Charles objected violently to being sent away with Thatcher, Kane Sr. remarked, \\"what the kid needs is a good thrashing.\\" Mrs. Kane responded, \\"That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him.\\" (Some present-day fans of the film interpret this to mean that Mr. Kane was abusive. 1940s audiences were more likely to have believed that Mrs. Kane was over-protective and that if Charles had been allowed to grow up enjoying the love and discipline of his parents, his life would have turned out better.)Years later, as he was about to get control of his business affairs, Kane's interest in newspapers was piqued when he noticed that he owned the struggling New York Daily Inquirer.

However, later she agrees to give an interview, which happens in the nightclub she's performing in. During her interview, Susan shares about her life with Kane and about their tumultuous personal relationship. She describes how Kane forced her into a singing career, despite her lack of talent and passion for it. Kane even went to the extent of constructing an opera house for her, where she would perform. However, these performances only resulted in public humiliation for her, as her lack of talent was painfully clear. In all of this, her portrayal of Kane is of a man who was forcefully trying to mold her into his idea of perfection while disregarding her own desires, leading to their ultimate marital downfall. She also reveals how Kane's obsession with controlling every aspect of their lives led to her feeling suffocated and unhappy. It's her memories of these days which prompted her departure from Xanadu, the sprawling estate Kane had built. Following a dramatic argument, she left Kane, ringing in the end of their relationship. Later, while Thompson reads the manuscript of Kane's former guardian, Thatcher, he discovers that Susan had attempted suicide while she was living with Kane in Xanadu, showing her deep unhappiness in the relationship.

Possible A: catch cold, catching a movie, dropping out, employability, boredom Why is \\"catch cold\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Catch cold\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for a few reasons. First and foremost, catching a cold refers to the instance of falling ill with a common viral infection. Cold, or the common cold, is a mild but highly contagious illness that affects the upper respiratory system, including the nose and throat. Symptoms include a sore throat, cough, runny or stuffy nose, and sometimes fever, headache, and general body discomfort. When a person catches a cold, they usually experience varying degrees of discomfort which make it difficult to concentrate, participate effectively in school activities, or perform their best academically. To maintain a healthy and conducive learning environment, schools often have guidelines in place that encourage students to stay home if they are unwell to prevent the spread of such infections among their classmates and staff. This is particularly relevant because the common cold is easily transmitted through the air and close personal contact, such as touching a surface with the virus (e.g., door handles, books, or other communal items). The presence of an ill student in the school environment not only affects their own well-being, but also puts the health of others at risk. Therefore, they are advised to stay home, rest, and recuperate, and seek medical attention if necessary. This recommendation ultimately serves to safeguard the health of the entire school community and optimizes learning conditions. Comparatively, the other possible answers given – catching a movie, dropping out, employability, and boredom – do not align with human common sense in the context of temporarily preventing someone from attending school. Catching a movie is a leisure activity that should not interfere with school attendance; dropping out refers to a permanent discontinuation rather than a temporary absence; employability does not immediately affect one's presence in school; and boredom, while affecting the engagement of a student in school, does not typically prevent attendance. In conclusion, \\"catch cold\\" is an answer based on human common sense because it recognizes the importance of health, both for an individual student and for the overall school community. By acknowledging that catching a cold can temporarily prevent a person from attending school, it highlights a socially responsible approach to prioritizing health, education, and the well-being of others."},{"instruction":"Solve -162*k - 335 + 5519 = 0 for k.. What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation -162*k - 335 + 5519 = 0 for k, follow these step-by-step calculations: Step 1: Simplify the equation. Combine the constants (i.e., the numbers without the variable k). -335 + 5519 = 5184 Now, the equation is -162*k + 5184 = 0. Step 2: Rearrange the equation to isolate the variable k. Add 162*k to both sides of the equation to get rid of the term with k on the left side. -162*k + 162*k + 5184 = 162*k + 0 5184 = 162*k Step 3: Solve for k. Now, divide both sides of the equation by -162 to isolate k. 5184 / 162 = k Step 4: Calculate the value of k. 5184 / 162 = 32 So, k = 32.

When a car pulls up, Boyle goes outside and gives the driver a satchel containing the 9mm and proceeds to his own car â but is shot in the back by the unseen driver.

First question: \\"How do I use any image as hike chat theme instead of using default chat themes?\\" This question is about an app called Hike and how to change the background in it. You know when you make a pretty drawing and you want to use it as your wallpaper? It's something like that. To do this, you'll need to go into the Hike app, and find a place to choose or add a new picture you really like, instead of using the ones they give you. Second question: \\"How can I use AOL chat rooms on my Mac?\\" This question is about using a different kind of chat in a thing called AOL on your computer, like a Mac. Imagine having play dates with your friends, but you're all in different rooms and can only talk by writing notes to each other. That's what AOL chat rooms are like. You'll need to go to the AOL website and download their program to find and join chat rooms you like. Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not the same. It's like one is asking how to paint your room a new color, and the other is asking how to visit different rooms in a big house. They're both about chatting with friends, but the first one is about making your chat look pretty with a picture, and the second one is about joining different places to chat with people.

Answer:","output":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of someone buying the product for several reasons, which I will detail below: 1. Unremarkable consistency and texture: The reviewer mentions that the consistency of the bar is \\"fairly typical,\\" with a gummy texture. This description does not make the product stand out from its competitors and might even give the impression that better options are available. 2. Dominant flavor not as expected: The reviewer states that the dominant flavor resembles a cherry \\"fruit chew,\\" which may not appeal to the preferences of all potential buyers. If a consumer is looking for a more pronounced cashew flavor, this particular product may not meet their expectations. 3. Subtle cashew flavor: The reviewer highlights that the cashew flavor is subtle and not significant enough to be worth buying the product if that's the primary interest. This statement implies that the product may not deliver on its promise of a unique cashew flavor, which might discourage potential buyers who are specifically seeking a cashew-flavored product. 4. Comparisons to better options: The reviewer expresses that they have enjoyed many other bars much more than the product in question. This indicates that there may be superior alternatives available on the market, which could lead potential buyers to explore those other options instead. 5. Limited situations for consumption: The reviewer mentions that they would eat the bar only if it was the only thing handy on a long hike, but would not intentionally purchase it given the variety of choices. This implies that the bar would not be a preferred option for regular consumption, further decreasing the chances of a potential buyer choosing this product. In conclusion, the review would likely decrease the chances of someone buying the product, as it suggests that there are better and more flavorful options available in the market. The lack of a strong cashew flavor, unremarkable texture, and comparisons to superior alternatives are all factors that could dissuade potential buyers from purchasing this particular product."},{"instruction":"I love going to the spa. Honestly, who doesn't. These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!). Why did the therapist work mainly on the author's back? A. not enough information B. because that is what happened to the beautiful model C. because that is the only area to do a massage D. She had been carrying her children","output":"D. She had been carrying her children The therapist worked mainly on the author's back because she had been carrying her children (15kgs of Crazy Kid and 9kgs of Kiki) which had been causing her back problems for a couple of months.

Let's break down how we got this translation: - The verb \\"are\\" translates as \\"jsou\\" in Czech. It is a form of the verb \\"být\\" (to be) in the third person plural. - The noun \\"things\\" translates as \\"věci\\". Czech, just like English, places the subject of a sentence before the verb. - The word \\"you\\" translates as \\"ty\\" in Czech, but in an informal context, we can omit pronouns before verbs. Therefore, we don't include \\"ty\\" in the translation. - The contraction \\"don't know\\" translates as \\"neznáš\\". This is a form of the verb \\"znát\\" (to know) in the second person singular, with the negative particle \\"ne\\" prefixed to it. In Czech, the negative particle is attached to the verb rather than used as a separate word like \\"don't\\" in English. Finally, we put all these components together following the subject-verb-object order typical of Czech sentences, and we get \\"Jsou věci, které neznáš\\". The phrase \\"které\\" is a relative pronoun used to introduce relative clauses, similarly to \\"that\\" or \\"which\\" in English. This structure allows consolidating the concepts expressed in English as \\"You don't know\\" and \\"things\\" into a single Czech sentence. Note that this translation uses an informal form \\"neznáš\\" which is appropriate when addressing a friend or a person of the same age or younger. In a formal context or when addressing an older person, we would use the polite form \\"neznáte\\", and the sentence would be \\"Jsou věci, které neznáte\\"."},{"instruction":"Context: The franchise was founded in 1999, and played eleven seasons in Atlanta, Georgia as the Atlanta Thrashers before moving to Winnipeg in 2011.

She also mentioned that she quit her job and called Child Protective Services. \\"I felt sick to my stomach,\\" Kristi Galbraith told WFAA. \\"I felt extreme guilt for possibly missing signs of what was going on.\\" The parents pulled their son from the school immediately. Distraught, the Galbraiths voiced their concerns to other parents at the school and sent out an email detailing their son's horror, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Several other parents said they noticed their kids coming home unusually thirsty. The school allegedly refused to give their students water so the staff wouldn't have to change so many wet diapers, the lawsuit claimed. And then, the Galbraiths met Lori Almquist. Her boy had been taped just like the Galbraiths', she said. She got a call from Decker a day after the Galbraiths learned their son had been duct taped. Because her son refused to nap, Decker decided to use the tape on him, too, Almquist told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth in June. The August lawsuit said Decker took responsibility for the incident, confessing to the horrified mother that she did something \\"incredibly stupid and one of the dumbest things she had ever done.\\" She also mentioned that other parents were \\"freaking out\\" and that \\"this whole thing has been blown out of proportion\\" — an apparent attempt to quell backlash from the Galbraiths' email. Together, the Galbraiths and Almquist waited for authorities to get involved. When weeks ticked by and nothing happened, the Galbraiths filed their lawsuit. The suit names the academy, its parent company and its owners: Decker and her daughter, Ashlea J. Pena, the newspaper reported. The family wants up to 1 million in damages. \\"Unfortunately, I think it happens a lot more often than we care to think,\\" Jeff Rasansky, the Galbraiths' attorney, told the newspaper. He continued: \\"Parents have to take a leap of faith in leaving their kids at day care centers and are always going to believe that folks are going to take care of their kids the same way they'd take of their own and oftentimes may not trust their instincts or gut.\\" ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes.

He was attested since the Old Kingdom together with his wife Amaunet. With the 11th dynasty (21st century BC), he rose to the position of patron deity of Thebes by replacing Monthu. - The son of Shoshenq I and his chief consort, Karomat A, Osorkon I was the second king of Egypt's 22nd Dynasty and ruled around 922 BC 887 BC. He succeeded his father Shoshenq I who probably died within a year of his successful 923 BC campaign against the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Osorkon I's reign is known for many temple building projects and was a long and prosperous period of Egypt's History. His highest known date is a \\"Year 33 Second Heb Sed\\" inscription found on the bandage of Nakhtefmut's Mummy which held a bracelet inscribed with Osorkon I's praenomen: \\"Sekhemkheperre\\". This date can only belong to Osorkon I since no other early Dynasty 22 king ruled for close to 30 years until the time of Osorkon II. Other mummy linens which belong to his reign include three separate bandages dating to his Regnal Years 11, 12, and 23 on the mummy of Khonsmaakheru in Berlin. The bandages are anonymously dated but definitely belong to his reign because Khonsmaakheru wore leather bands that contained a \\"menat-tab\\" naming Osorkon I. Secondly, no other king who ruled around Osorkon I's reign had a 23rd Regnal Year including Shoshenq I who died just before the beginning of his Year 22. - King Usermaatre Setepenre/Setepenamun Shoshenq III ruled Egypt's 22nd Dynasty for 39 years according to contemporary historical records. Two Apis Bulls were buried in the fourth and 28th years of his reign and he celebrated his Heb Sed Jubilee in his regnal year 30. Little is known of the precise basis for his successful claim to the throne since he was not a son of Osorkon II and Shoshenq's parentage and family ties are unknown. - Usermaatre Setepenamun Osorkon II was the fifth pharaoh of the Twenty-second Dynasty of Ancient Egypt and the son of Takelot I and Queen Kapes. He ruled Egypt around 872 BC to 837 BC from Tanis, the capital of this Dynasty. After succeeding his father, he was faced with the competing rule of his cousin, king Harsiese A, who controlled both Thebes and the Western Oasis of Egypt. Osorkon feared the serious challenge posed by Harsiese's kingship to his authority but, when Harsiese conveniently died in 860 BC, Osorkon II ensured that this problem would not recur by appointing his own son Nimlot C as the next High Priest of Amun at Thebes. This consolidated the pharaoh's authority over Upper Egypt and meant that Osorkon II ruled over a united Egypt. Osorkon II's reign would be a time of large scale monumental building and prosperity for Egypt. - Pedubastis I or Pedubast I was an Upper Egyptian Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt during the 9th century BC. Based on lunar dates which are known to belong to the reign of his rival in Upper Egypt Takelot II and the fact that Pedubast I first appeared as a local king at Thebes around Year 11 of Takelot II's rule, Pedubast I is today believed to have had his accession date in either 835 BC or 824 BC. This local Pharaoh is recorded as being of ancient Libyan ancestry and ruled Egypt for 25 years according to the redaction of Manetho done by Eusebius. He first became king at Thebes in Year 8 of Shoshenq III and his highest dated Year is his 23rd Year according to Nile Level Text No. 29. This year is equivalent to Year 31 of Shoshenq III of the Tanis based 22nd Dynasty of Egypt; however, since Shoshenq II only controlled Lower Egypt in Memphis and the Delta region, Pedubast and Shoshenq III were not political rivals and may even have established a relationship. Indeed, Shoshenq III's son, the general and army leader Pashedbast B \\"built a vestibule door to Pylon X at Karnak, and in one and the same commemorative text thereon named his father as [king] Sheshonq (III)\\" but dated his actions here to Pedubast I. This may show some tacit support for the Pedubast faction by the Tanite based 22nd dynasty king Shoshenq III. - Heqakheperre Shoshenq II or Shoshenq IIa was a pharaoh of the 22nd dynasty of Egypt. He was the only ruler of this Dynasty whose tomb was not plundered by tomb robbers. His final resting place was discovered within an antechamber of Psusennes I's tomb at Tanis by Pierre Montet in 1939. Montet removed the coffin lid of Shoshenq II on March 20, 1939, in the presence of king Farouk of Egypt himself. It proved to contain a large number of jewel-encrusted bracelets and pectorals, along with a beautiful hawkheaded silver coffin and a gold funerary mask. The gold facemask had been placed upon the head of the king. Montet later discovered the intact tombs of two Dynasty 21 kingsPsusennes I and Amenemope a year later in February and April 1940 respectively. Shoshenq II's prenomen, Heqakheperre Setepenre, means \\"The manifestation of Ra rules, the chosen one of Ra.\\" - Hedjkheperre Setepenre Shoshenq I (Egyptian \\"ššnq\\"), (reigned c.943-922 BCE) also known as Sheshonk or Sheshonq I (for discussion of the spelling, see Shoshenq) was a pharaoh of ancient Egypt and the founder of the Twenty-second Dynasty. Of ancient Libyan (Meshwesh-Berber) ancestry, Shoshenq I was the son of Nimlot A, Great Chief of the Ma, and his wife Tentshepeh A, a daughter of a Great Chief of the Ma herself. He is presumed to be the Shishaq mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, and his exploits are carved on the Bubastite Portal at Karnak. - King Hedjkheperre Setepenamun Harsiese or Harsiese A, is viewed by the Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen in his \\"Third Intermediate Period in Egypt\\", to be both a \\"High Priest of Amun\\" and the son of the High Priest of Amun Shoshenq C. The archaeological evidence does suggest that he was indeed Shoshenq C's son. However, recent published studies by the German Egyptologist Karl Jansen-Winkeln in \\"JEA\\" 81 (1995) have demonstrated that all the monuments of the first (king) Harsiese show that he was never a High Priest of Amun in his own right. Rather both Harsiese A and his son [...du] whose existence is known from inscriptions on the latter's funerary objects at Coptos are only attested as Ordinary Priests of Amun. Instead, while Harsiese A was certainly an independent king at Thebes during the first decade of Osorkon II's kingship, he was a different person from a second person who was also called Harsiese: Harsiese B. Harsiese B was the genuine High Priest of Amun who is attested in office late in Osorkon II's reign, in the regnal year 6 of Shoshenq III and in regnal years 18 and 19 of Pedubast I, according to Jansen-Winkeln. - Thutmose I (sometimes read as \\"Thothmes,\\" \\"Thutmosis\\" or \\"Tuthmosis I\\", meaning \\"Thoth-Born\\") was the third pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Egypt. He received the throne after the death of the previous king, Amenhotep I. During his reign, he campaigned deep into the Levant and Nubia, pushing the borders of Egypt farther than ever before. He also built many temples in Egypt, and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings; he is the first king confirmed to have done this (though Amenhotep I may have preceded him). - Shoshenq C was the eldest son of the 22nd Dynasty pharaoh Osorkon I and queen Maatkare, the daughter of Psusennes II, and served as the High Priest of Amun at Thebes during his father's reign. Consequently, he was the most important official in Upper Egypt after the king himself. He has generally been equated with Heqakheperre Shoshenq II by the English Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen and viewed as a short-lived co-regent to his father based on the Nile God British Museum statue 8 which identifies him as the son of Osorkon I and Queen Maatkare, daughter of Hor-Psusennes but this assumption is unproven. In the statue, Shoshenq C is called \\"the Master of the Two Lands\\" and the formula \\"beloved of Amun\\" is enclosed within a royal cartouche. However, in the text of the statue, he is not given a specific throne name or prenomen, the use of a cartouche by a royal prince is attested in other periods of Egyptian history such as that of Amenmes, son of Thutmose I, and the documents depicts Shoshenq C as a simple High Priest of Amun on the side of the legs of the Nile God, rather than a king. - Upper Egypt (', shortened to ' ) is the strip of land on both sides of the Nile that extends between Nubia and downriver (northwards) to Lower Egypt. - Harsiese B was a High Priest of Amun in 874 BC. Earlier Egyptologists assumed he was both the High Priest of Amun ( HPA ) and son of the High Priest Shoshenq C , who may have become a king at Thebes . However , recent research by Karl Jansen - Winkeln shows that all the monuments of the first ( King ) Harsiese A demonstrate that he was never High Priest of Amun in his own right , merely a regular Priest of Amun . While the earlier Harsiese was certainly a king at Thebes , he is clearly a different person from the later Harsiese , Harsiese B , who is attested as a High Priest of Amun . Jansen - Winkeln further shows that Harsiese A 's son , ( ... du ) , was only an ordinary Priest of Amun . Harsiese B is first explicitly attested as High Priest of Amun late under Osorkon II 's reign on Statue CGC 42225 , which bears this king 's cartouche . He likely assumed the office at Thebes when the current High Priest , Takelot F , proclaimed himself as king Takelot II in the final 3 years of Osorkon II 's reign . Statue CGC 42225 was dedicated by the \`\` Letter Writer to Pharaoh '' , Hor IX , who is mentioned on the walls of Temple J at Karnak . Temple J was built in the final years of Osorkon II 's reign by the then serving HPA , Takelot F. Hor IX later served under Pedubast I and Usermaatre Meryamun Shoshenq VI , who were direct contemporaries of Shoshenq III of the Twenty - second Dynasty . Shoshenq III once even dispatched his second son , Pashedbast B , to Thebes where the latter \`\` added a vestibule door to Pylon X at Karnak , dating it to the reign of Pedubast . '' Hor IX served beyond the 25 - year reign of Pedubast I and lived into Shoshenq VI 's reign under whom his funerary cones were inscribed . Consequently , the High Priest of Amun Harsiese can only be Harsiese B since he was a close contemporary of Hor IX and served late in office under Osorkon II. In contrast , Harsiese A died before the twelfth regnal year of Osorkon II. Harsiese B is also attested in office in the sixth regnal year of Shoshenq III in... - Kenneth Anderson Kitchen (born in 1932) is a British Bible scholar, Ancient Near Eastern historian, and Personal and Brunner Professor Emeritus of Egyptology and Honorary Research Fellow at the School of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool, England. He is one of the leading experts on the ancient Egyptian Ramesside Period (i.e., Dynasties 19-20), and the Third Intermediate Period, as well as ancient Egyptian chronology, having written over 250 books and journal articles on these and other subjects since the mid-1950s. He has been described by \\"The Times\\" as \\"the very architect of Egyptian chronology\\". - Titkheperure or Tyetkheperre Psusennes II <nowiki>[</nowiki>Greek <nowiki>]</nowiki> or Hor-Pasebakhaenniut II <nowiki>[</nowiki>Egyptian \\"r-p3-sb3--<n>-nwt\\"<nowiki>]</nowiki>, was the last king of the Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt. His royal name means \\"Image of the transformations of Re\\" in Egyptian. Psusennes II is often considered the same person as the High-Priest of Amun known as Psusennes III. The Egyptologist Karl Jansen-Winkeln notes that an important graffito from the Temple of Abydos contains the complete titles of a king \\"Tyetkheperre Setepenre Pasebakhaenniut Meryamun\\" \\"who is simultaneously called the HPA (i.e., High Priest of Amun) and supreme military commander.\\" This suggests that Psusennes was both king at Tanis and the High Priest in Thebes at the same time, meaning he did not resign his office as High Priest of Amun during his reign. The few contemporary attestations from his reign include the aforementioned graffito in Seti I's Abydos temple, an ostracon from Umm el-Qa'ab, an affiliation at Karnak and his presumed burial which consists of a gilded coffin with a royal uraeus and a Mummy, found in an antechamber of Psusennes I's tomb at Tanis. He was a High Priest of Amun at Thebes and the son of Pinedjem II and Istemkheb. His daughter Maatkare B was the Great Royal Wife of Osorkon I.

Select from the following. [-] World. [-] Sports. [-] Business. [-] Science/Tech.","output":"This piece of news is related to the topic of Business. The news article discusses the opening of the Tokyo stock exchange, specifically the Nikkei average, which opened with a 0.54 percent increase. The increase was driven by banks and exporters having a stronger finish on Wall Street as well as declining oil prices. These factors helped reduce concerns about the global economic outlook. To provide you with more context about this topic, let me explain a few key terms and background information. - Nikkei average: The Nikkei 225, or simply the Nikkei, is a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which represents the performance of the 225 top-rated companies listed on the exchange. It is a price-weighted index, so the value of each stock in the index is proportional to its price. - Wall Street: Wall Street is a street in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City, which has come to represent the financial markets of the United States, particularly the New York Stock Exchange and the major investment banks, brokers, and trading firms. - Global economic outlook: The global economic outlook refers to the prospects for the world economy, taking into consideration factors such as economic growth, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, and trade patterns. Market participants closely follow the global economic outlook to make informed decisions about their investments. In this news article, the factors that contributed to the positive performance of the Nikkei average include: 1. Stronger finish on Wall Street: A stronger finish on Wall Street indicates that the U.S. stock market closed higher, providing a positive signal for global markets, including the Tokyo stock exchange. This usually has a ripple effect on stock markets around the world and boosts investor confidence. 2. Declining oil prices: Oil prices have a significant influence on the global economy. When oil prices decline, it generally benefits economies that are net importers of oil, as it lowers their production costs and supports economic growth. Japan, being a major industrialized nation and a net importer of oil, benefits from lower oil prices, and this is reflected in its stock market performance. In conclusion, this news highlights a positive start to the trading day for the Tokyo stock exchange, driven by banks, exporters, a stronger finish on Wall Street, and declining oil prices. These developments contributed to mitigating concerns over the global economic outlook and represent an improvement in the overall business environment."},{"instruction":"Jeff Howell: how can I fill the gaps between paving slabs? The mortar between bricks (for which also read “stones” in the following) should be viewed as a sacrificial medium. It should be softer and more breathable than the bricks themselves, allowing movement and the passage of moisture. It is natural for the mortar to weather away over the years, leaving the bricks intact. After perhaps a century or so, re-pointing might be needed. Unfortunately many home owners, and some ignorant surveyors, view even minor erosion of the pointing as a defect, and think the wall should be spruced up by raking out and repointing. You have to understand that all raking-out will cause some damage to the edges of the adjacent bricks, no matter what tools are used. The joints will become wider, meaning that the re-pointing will take up a larger proportion of the wall’s area and change its appearance. Re-pointed walls often look as if they have been redrawn using a blunt pencil. In the event that re-pointing is really necessary, it should be done using a soft lime-and-sand mortar – this is especially important for pre-1939 buildings. If lime-built brickwork is repointed with hard cement-based mortar, the pointing is quite likely to work itself loose within a few years, but not before it has hastened decay of the masonry by cracking, spalling and frost damage. Q: For years I have been filling in the spaces between paving slabs that were put down when the house was built. Overall it is a considerable area. Every year the cement once again breaks up and the spaces are back. What I would envisage would be a sort of large icing bag (like for cakes) which one would squeeze and fill in the spaces permanently with a liquid substance. At 84 years old I feel that I will only do this once more – is there a way? A: Just like the previous questioner, you have the idea that a better application tool will solve your problem. And as with my previous answer, I have to report that the problem lies with the materials, not the tools. If your paving slabs are bedded on sand, then they will move around in response to all sorts of influences – thermal and moisture expansion/contraction, impact from human traffic, and growth of tree roots. There is no point filling the joints with anything other than sharp sand. If the slabs are bedded on concrete or cement-based mortar, you’ll have more of a chance with pointing or grouting. The same principles apply as before – the mortar should be softer than the paving slabs. Try a 6:1:1 mix of sharp sand, cement, and hydrated lime. Rake the joints out fully and brush or vacuum the dust out. Damp-down the joints with a fine spray from a hosepipe, and press the mortar (which should be of a stiff consistency) firmly into them. When the mortar has started to cure (after an hour or two) tool it smooth with a brick jointer or piece of metal pipe. Cover it up to protect it from frost, and in dry weather keep it moist and covered with polythene for a least a week. You must accept, though, that exterior paving slabs are constantly exposed to the ravages of the weather, and no matter how well you do the job, it won’t last forever. *Send your questions to Jeff at Life, The Sunday Telegraph, 111 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1W 0DT, email askjeff@telegraph.co.uk.

It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race whi1e they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel. The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other.

The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant; the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra is the key to finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried. The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Abner has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter Marion. Jones visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander, Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece, but when Jones returns to the bar to fight the Nazis and save Marion, her bar is accidentally set on fire; during the fight, the headpiece ends up in the fire and Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece, and flees the tavern screaming.

As the task force was studying the issue, 900,000 was cut from state support for civil equal justice services. That prompted the state's two main legal services providers - Columbia Legal Services and Northwest Justice Project - to cut their staffs, Alexander said. The change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court to 200. The total fee would be split, with 54 percent going to counties and 46 percent going to the state for a newly created equal justice account. Alexander also requested money for five additional Superior Court judgeships and one additional District Court judgeships, arguing that increased caseloads require more judges. Two of the Superior Court judges and the District Court judge would be in Clark County, with one Superior Court judge added in the joint district that serves Benton and Franklin counties and one each in Kittitas and Kitsap counties.

As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers.

After completing eighth grade there, Kennedy was sent to the prestigious Choate Rosemary Hall, a boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut, where he spent his high school years. While studying at Choate, Kennedy developed his interests in politics, history, and leadership and also faced some health challenges, including a diagnosis of the autoimmune disorder called Addison's disease. Upon graduation, Kennedy went on to attend three different higher education institutions, due to several reasons, including health and academics. These institutions were the London School of Economics, Princeton University, and eventually, Harvard University. It was at Harvard that he completed his undergraduate degree in international affairs and wrote his senior thesis, “Appeasement at Munich,” which later became the best-selling book “Why England Slept.” In addition to his academic pursuits, Kennedy's upbringing included a focus on physical fitness, athletic competitions, and outdoor activities like sailing and swimming. Spending summers at the large family estate in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, he and his siblings were encouraged to be highly competitive and to develop strong interpersonal skills. These experiences undoubtedly helped shape the resilient, charismatic leader that John F. Kennedy eventually became. In conclusion, while John F. Kennedy's upbringing took place across several locations within the United States and beyond, it was in Brookline, Massachusetts, where he spent his earliest years, and the Boston area remained an integral part of his life and personal identity."},{"instruction":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Looking which airport for Playa den Bossa","output":"Looking, which airport for Playa den Bossa?

Harvesting machine H, working alone at its constant rate, harvested 40 acres of wheat in 8 hours. Then harvesting machine K was brought in, and harvesting machines H and K, working together at their respective constant rates, harvested the remaining acres of wheat in 6 hours. Harvesting machine K harvested how many acres of wheat per hour? Options: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 15 Random thoughts:","output":"Let's break down the problem step-by-step and determine the rate of harvesting machine K. Step 1: Find the rate of harvesting machine H. The problem states that machine H harvested 40 acres of wheat in 8 hours. To find the rate, we divide the acres harvested by the time taken. Rate of H = total acres harvested / time taken Rate of H = 40 acres / 8 hours = 5 acres/hour Step 2: Determine the remaining acres of wheat to be harvested. Initially, there were 100 acres of wheat. We know that machine H harvested 40 acres, so we subtract that from the initial 100 acres. Remaining acres = Total acres - Harvested acres by H Remaining acres = 100 - 40 = 60 acres Step 3: Calculate the combined rate of both machines, H and K, working together. The problem states that machines H and K worked together to harvest the remaining 60 acres in 6 hours. To find their combined rate, we can use the same formula we used earlier for machine H. Combined rate of H and K = total acres harvested / time taken Combined rate of H and K = 60 acres / 6 hours = 10 acres/hour Step 4: Determine the rate of harvesting machine K. We now know the combined rate of H and K (10 acres/hour) along with machine H's rate (5 acres/hour). We can now find the rate of machine K by subtracting the rate of H from the combined rate. Rate of K = Combined rate of H and K - Rate of H Rate of K = 10 acres/hour - 5 acres/hour = 5 acres/hour Now, looking at the options given: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 15 The closest matching option to our calculated rate for machine K (5 acres/hour) is option A (4 acres/hour). Although it's not an exact match, it's the closest among the given options. So, the answer is: (A) 4"},{"instruction":"FYI - I faxed latest CSA and correspondence to you for our conference call tomorrow. SS P.S. Do you know what the problems are? I haven't heard a word.

Loosely based on Coffinman, a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, the film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nokanshi--a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he earns their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Japanese funerals are highly ritualized affairs which are generally--though not always--conducted in accordance with Buddhist rites. In preparation for the funeral, the body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. The encoffining ritual (called nokan), as depicted in Departures, is rarely performed, and even then only in rural areas. This ceremony is not standardized, but generally involves professional morticians (Na Guan Shi , nokanshi) ritually preparing the body, dressing the dead in white, and sometimes applying make-up. The body is then put on dry ice in a casket, along with personal possessions and items necessary for the trip to the afterlife. Despite the importance of death rituals, in traditional Japanese culture the subject is considered unclean as everything related to death is thought to be a source of kegare (defilement). After coming into contact with the dead, individuals must cleanse themselves through purifying rituals. People who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are thus considered unclean, and during the feudal era those whose work was related to death became burakumin (untouchables), forced to live in their own hamlets and discriminated against by wider society. Despite a cultural shift since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the stigma of death still has considerable force within Japanese society, and discrimination against the untouchables has continued. Until 1972, most deaths were dealt with by families, funeral homes, or nokanshi. As of 2014, about 80% of deaths occur in hospitals, and preparation of the bodies is frequently done by hospital staff; in such cases, the family often does not see the body until the funeral. A 1998 survey found that 29.5% of the Japanese population believed in an afterlife, and a further 40% wanted to believe; belief was highest among the young. Belief in the existence of a soul (54%) and a connection between the worlds of the living and the dead (64.9%) was likewise common. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what is the cultural background?","output":"The cultural background in the context of the article refers to traditional Japanese culture, where death and everything related to it is thought to be a source of kegare (defilement). This leads to people who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, being considered unclean and subjected to prejudice and discrimination in society."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi...., what would be the answer ?

When you buy an item or service, you are essentially exchanging your money for that particular product, and this spending becomes a necessary component of the buying process. Going shopping is another option; however, it does not directly address the act of buying, as it is entirely possible to go shopping without making a purchase. Shopping is just the preliminary action to making a decision about what to buy and comparing different options before committing to a purchase. Paying is also somewhat relevant but doesn't necessarily answer the question as directly as \\"spend money.\\" To pay suggests that a transaction has already occurred, and now the required funds need to be transferred or exchanged. \\"Have in mind\\" and \\"a shop\\" are the least relevant options among the ones listed.

The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - Afri (singular \\"Afer\\") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).

The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will tend to increase the dispersal of the seeds. - The Suez Canal (\\"\\") is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez. It was constructed by the Suez Canal Company between 1859 and 1869. After 10 years of construction, it was officially opened on November 17, 1869. The canal offers watercraft a shorter journey between the North Atlantic and northern Indian Oceans via the Mediterranean and Red seas by avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans, in turn reducing the journey by approximately . It extends from the northern terminus of Port Said to the southern terminus of Port Tewfik at the city of Suez. Its length is , including its northern and southern access channels. In 2012, 17,225 vessels traversed the canal (47 per day). - Cellulose is an organic compound with the formula , a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of (14) linked -glucose units. Cellulose is an important structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes. Some species of bacteria secrete it to form biofilms. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth. The cellulose content of cotton fiber is 90%, that of wood is 4050% and that of dried hemp is approximately 57%. - The State of India, also referred as the Portuguese State of India (\\"Estado Português da Índia\\", EPI) or simply Portuguese India (\\"Índia Portuguesa\\"), was a state of the Portuguese Overseas Empire, founded six years after the discovery of a sea route between Portugal and the Indian Subcontinent to serve as the governing body of a string of Portuguese fortresses and colonies overseas. - The São Francisco River or Rio São Francisco is a river in Brazil.

The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did Elizabeth do after Heath adviser her?","output":"After being advised by Prime Minister Edward Heath to call a general election in February 1974, Queen Elizabeth II took several steps to enact the electoral process. While it is not explicitly mentioned what she did immediately following Heath's advice, we can infer her actions based on the established norms and procedures surrounding the call for a general election. 1. Returning to Britain: As the general election was called during her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, the Queen must have made arrangements to curtail her visit and fly back to Britain. Her presence in the country was necessary for overseeing the electoral process and ensuring a smooth transition of power, if required. 2. Dissolving the Parliament: Once back in Britain, the Queen would have taken the formal step of dissolving the Parliament, as advised by the Prime Minister, to pave the way for the general election. This dissolution is a crucial part of the election process, as it allows for new representatives to be elected into the House of Commons. 3. Initiating the electoral process: After dissolving the Parliament, the Queen would have set a date for the general election, which would have been within a specified time frame, as mandated by British electoral law. The general election date would have been announced, and the various political parties would begin campaigning for votes. 4. Monitoring the election: The Queen would have kept herself informed of the electoral process's progress through her advisors, ensuring that the election was conducted fairly and transparently. 5. Results and government formation: Following the general election, which resulted in a hung parliament – meaning no single party had secured an outright majority – the Conservatives, under Edward Heath, attempted to form a coalition government with the Liberals. However, negotiations failed, and Heath resigned as Prime Minister. The Queen then invited Labour Party leader Harold Wilson, the Leader of the Opposition, to form a government. In summary, after being advised by Edward Heath to call a general election in February 1974, Queen Elizabeth II returned to Britain, dissolved the Parliament, initiated the election process, monitored its progress, and ultimately enabled the formation of a new government under the Labour Party's leadership with Harold Wilson as Prime Minister."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is the name of the 2013 Indian romance film starring an Indian actress born in 1987?

A: A:","output":"An arid environment, such as a desert, can quickly deplete an animal of several vital resources, posing significant challenges to their survival. The primary resource depleted in this type of environment is water, but many other factors also come into play. Some of these factors include finding shelter, acquiring nutrients, maintaining body temperature, and coping with changes in the environment. Here is a detailed explanation of each of these factors: 1. Water depletion: The most crucial resource that deserts deplete from animals is water, as the extremely low precipitation levels and high evaporation rates make it difficult for them to retain a stable source of hydration. The limited availability of water in deserts severely affects animals' physiological functions and processes. An animal's body constantly loses water through normal bodily functions such as sweating, breathing, and waste excretion. In arid environments, this becomes problematic due to the scarcity of water sources from which animals can replenish their lost fluids. Consequently, maintaining proper water balance is critical for survival and must be done through various adaptations and resourceful behaviors. 2. Nutrient depletion: In addition to water scarcity, the desert environment also presents challenges in acquiring proper nutrients. The harsh and nutrient-poor conditions limit the growth and abundance of vegetation, impacting herbivores that rely on plants for sustenance. As a consequence, entire food chains and webs may be affected, as predators also struggle to find prey. Animals have adapted to these limitations through processes such as maintaining a lower metabolism or exploiting specific niches in the environment, allowing them to consume a less diverse diet. 3. Shelter and safety: Deserts lack adequate shelter options for many animals due to the limited availability of suitable habitats and the extreme variations in temperature. Unlike more temperate climates, shade is often hard to come by, and finding shelter from extreme heat, cold, or predators can be challenging. Consequently, animals must adapt to their environments, sometimes by living underground or employing other creative solutions, like creating burrows or using natural crevices for protection. 4. Body temperature regulation: Deserts are characterized by extreme temperature fluctuations, being scorching hot during the day and freezing cold at night. Animals inhabiting such climates must regulate their body temperatures to avoid overheating or hypothermia. To maintain their body temperature, animals may adopt behavioral adaptations such as seeking shelter during the hottest parts of the day, being active at night, or undergoing aestivation to avoid heat stress. 5. Adaptation to changing environments: Desert environments are unpredictable, experiencing erratic rainfall patterns, sudden flash floods, and localized seasonal variations. These conditions may lead to periodic resource abundance or scarcity, which animals must adapt to for survival. Many desert animals employ behavioral adaptations such as migration, altered activity patterns, and adjustments in their diet to face these challenges. In conclusion, the arid environment of a desert can quickly deplete an animal of several vital resources, with water being the most critical. Factors like finding shelter, acquiring nutrients, maintaining body temperature, and coping with environmental changes contribute to the difficulties animals face in desert habitats. As a result, animals must rely on various adaptations and resourceful behaviors to survive and thrive in such challenging conditions."},{"instruction":"Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Young d'Artagnan leaves his parents and travels from his native Gascony to the capital of France because he wants to prove himself an excellent fencer and to become a musketeer.

Here's the chain of thought: 1. The pizza has 16 slices in total. 2. The family ate three-fourths of the pizza. 3. To find out the number of slices eaten, multiply the total number of slices by the fraction that represents the portion eaten: 16 slices * (3/4) = 12 slices. 4. Now we know that the family ate 12 slices. 5. To find out how many slices are left, subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 16 slices - 12 slices = 4 slices. 6.

Options: - read stories - compete - help - solve problems - give orders Reasoning process:","output":"To reason which option best fits the given situation, let's evaluate each option in the context of two people doing the same thing: 1. Read stories - Two people could read stories in parallel, but this option does not involve much interaction or shared activity between them. 2. Compete - Competition usually arises when two people are engaged in a similar task and are comparing their performance or trying to outperform each other. This option seems plausible. 3. Help - Help is often provided when one person is struggling with a task and the other person is in a position to assist them. In the context of both doing the same thing, helping could be feasible if they are collaborative, but it's not as strong as 'compete.' 4. Solve problems - This option implies a cooperative approach to solving problems together. Though it is possible that two people doing the same thing may cooperate to solve problems, it doesn't necessarily describe the interaction between them by default. 5. Give orders - Usually, giving orders implies a hierarchical relationship between the two people, with one person in a position of authority. This option does not seem appropriate in the context of two people doing the same thing, as they would likely be in similar positions, with neither having authority over the other. Based on the reasoning process, the most suitable answer is \\"compete\\". This is because when two people are doing the same thing, they typically compare their performance or try to outperform one another, leading to competition."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence which is either in the Hindi language or English language.

Does it follow that \\"He let her take longer than he expected\\"?","output":"It is not necessarily implied that \\"He let her take longer than he expected\\" when we say \\"He let her take her time.\\" The phrase \\"He let her take her time\\" simply suggests that he allowed her to proceed at her own pace, without rushing or pressuring her. He might have understood that she needed time for a particular reason, such as to process information, make a decision, or complete a task. On the other hand, \\"He let her take longer than he expected\\" implies that he initially anticipated her to finish or reach a certain point more quickly, but ultimately, he decided to let her take more time than he had initially estimated. It could be because he observed that she needed more time, recognized unforeseen challenges or complications that she encountered, or simply because he wanted to show patience and understanding. In conclusion, while \\"He let her take her time\\" might sometimes result in her taking longer than he expected, it does not directly imply this outcome.

For example, there are still unresolved questions regarding the exact processes that led to the formation of individual planetary bodies, the migration of planets, and the formation of the outer Solar System. Additionally, scientists are continually refining their understanding of the Solar System's formation and evolution based on new observations and data.

His mother, Rose Tristano (nee Malano), was also born in Chicago. His father, Michael Joseph Tristano, was born in Italy and moved to the United States as a child. Lennie was the second of four brothers. In Ind's view, Tristano \\"was always so gentle, so charming and so quietly spoken that his directness could be unnerving.\\" This directness was noted by others, including bassist Chubby Jackson, who commented that Tristano had almost no tact and would not worry about being rude or making others feel incompetent. Some of his students described Tristano as domineering, but others indicated that this impression came from his demanding discipline in training and attitude to music. Writer Barry Ulanov commented in 1946 that Tristano \\"was not content merely to feel something, [...] he had to explore ideas, to experience them, to think them through carefully, thoroughly, logically until he could fully grasp them and then hold on to them.\\" Tristano criticized the free jazz that began in the 1960s for its lack of musical logic as well as its expression of negative emotions. \\"If you feel angry with somebody you hit him on the nose - not try to play angry music\\", he commented; \\"Express all that is positive. Beauty is a positive thing.\\" He expanded on this by distinguishing emotion from feeling, and suggested that playing a particular emotion was egotistical and lacking in feeling. Tristano also complained about the commercialization of jazz and what he perceived to be the requirement to abandon the artistic part of playing in order to earn a living from performing. Later commentators have suggested that these complaints ignored the freedom that he was given by Atlantic and blamed others for what in many cases were the outcomes of his own career decisions. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What did the eople he taught say","output":"about Tristano's teaching style? Some of the people Lennie Tristano taught described his teaching style as domineering.

Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"To determine how many packs of notebook paper Chip will use after 6 weeks, we need to first find out how many pages he will use in total. 1. Calculate daily usage of pages per class: Chip takes 2 pages of notes per day for each of his 5 classes. So, he uses (2 pages per class) × (5 classes) = 10 pages per day. 2. Calculate weekly usage of pages: Since Chip takes notes 5 days a week, he will use 10 pages per day × 5 days = 50 pages per week. 3. Calculate 6 weeks' worth of pages: As Chip takes notes for 6 weeks, his total usage will be 50 pages per week × 6 weeks = 300 pages. 4. Calculate how many packs of notebook paper are needed: Finally, we need to find out how many 100-sheet packs of paper he needs to buy. Since he uses 300 pages in 6 weeks, Chip will need 300 pages ÷ 100 pages per pack = 3 packs of notebook paper.

Private Paul G. Bennett, 21, of C Battery, U.S. 17th Field Artillery Regiment, was a four-year veteran of the U.S. Army, and had served in the division since March 1943. Records show he had no medical history until 6 August 1943, when a friend was wounded in combat. According to a report, he \\"could not sleep and was nervous.\\" Bennett was brought to the 93rd Evacuation Hospital. In addition to having a fever, he exhibited symptoms of dehydration, including fatigue, confusion, and listlessness. His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers. The shells going over him bothered him. The next day he was worried about his buddy and became more nervous. He was sent down to the rear echelon by a battery aid man and there the medical aid man gave him some medicine which made him sleep, but still he was nervous and disturbed. On the next day the medical officer ordered him to be evacuated, although the boy begged not to be evacuated because he did not want to leave his unit. On 10 August, Patton entered the receiving tent of the hospital, speaking to the injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. \\"It's my nerves,\\" Bennett responded. \\"I can't stand the shelling anymore.\\" Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: \\"Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying.

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Hypothesis: Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain resort near Los Angeles. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's first examine both the premise and the hypothesis closely. Premise: \\"Los Angeles's closest mountain retreats are Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead, which lie east of the city less than two hours away.\\" The premise states two key pieces of information: 1. Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain retreats to Los Angeles. 2. These retreats are less than two hours away from the city and are located east of it. Hypothesis: \\"Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain resort near Los Angeles.\\" This hypothesis suggests that Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain resorts to Los Angeles, which aligns with the first piece of information mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis seems to be directly related to the information provided in the premise. Now, to analyze if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to determine if there is any discrepancy, contradiction, or missing information between the two statements. Upon close inspection, both the premise and the hypothesis convey the same core idea – that Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain retreats/resorts to Los Angeles. There is no contradiction or information gap between the two statements. The only difference is in the wording used, wherein the premise uses \\"retreats\\" and the hypothesis prioritizes \\"resort.\\" However, it becomes apparent from the context that these terms are being used interchangeably and refer to the same locations – Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead. In conclusion, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as it is directly supported by the information provided and maintains the same core idea about the proximity of these mountain retreats/resorts to Los Angeles. This assertion remains consistent between the premise and the hypothesis, and there is no discernible discrepancy, contradiction, or missing information."},{"instruction":"Choose from: 1). No. 2).

His father, Taraqai, was a minor noble of the Barlas, a Mongolian tribe that had been turkified in many aspects. According to Gerard Chaliand, Timur was a Muslim, and he saw himself as Genghis Khan's heir. Though not a Borjigid or a descendent of Genghis Khan, he clearly sought to invoke the legacy of Genghis Khan's conquests during his lifetime. Context: Timur spent the next 35 years in various wars and expeditions. He not only consolidated his rule at home by the subjugation of his foes, but sought extension of territory by encroachments upon the lands of foreign potentates. His conquests to the west and northwest led him to the lands near the Caspian Sea and to the banks of the Ural and the Volga. Conquests in the south and south-West encompassed almost every province in Persia, including Baghdad, Karbala and Northern Iraq. One of the most formidable of Timur's opponents was another Mongol ruler, a descendant of Genghis Khan named Tokhtamysh. After having been a refugee in Timur's court, Tokhtamysh became ruler both of the eastern Kipchak and the Golden Horde. After his accession, he quarreled with Timur over the possession of Khwarizm and Azerbaijan. However, Timur still supported him against the Russians and in 1382 Tokhtamysh invaded the Muscovite dominion and burned Moscow. In 1395 Tamerlane reached the frontier of Principality of Ryazan, took Elets and advancing towards Moscow came near the banks of the Don River. Great Prince Vasily I of Moscow went with an army to Kolomna and halted at the banks of the Oka River. The clergy brought the famed Theotokos of Vladimir icon from Vladimir to Moscow. Along the way people prayed kneeling: \\"O Mother of God, save the land of Russia!\\" Suddenly, Tamerlane's armies retreated. In memory of this miraculous deliverance of the Russian Land from Tamerlane on August 26, the all-Russian celebration in honor of the Meeting of the Vladimir Icon of the Most Holy Mother of God was established. Question: What happened at the beginning of Timur's expansion period? Answer:","output":"At the beginning of Timur's expansion period, he focused on consolidating his rule at home and extending his territory through various military campaigns and expeditions. During this time, he sought to subjugate his domestic foes and gradually expand his empire in multiple directions. To the west and northwest, Timur's conquests led him to the lands near the Caspian Sea and to the banks of the Ural and Volga rivers. This expansion brought him into contact with various potentates and tribes that he sought to dominate or incorporate into his empire. In the south and southwest, he undertook significant campaigns in Persia, capturing almost every province, including Baghdad, Karbala, and Northern Iraq. These conquests further solidified his empire's foundation and allowed him to project power across a wide geographical area. One of Timur's most formidable opponents was the Mongol ruler Tokhtamysh, a descendant of Genghis Khan. Despite initially hosting Tokhtamysh as a refugee, Timur later found himself in conflict with him over the possession of Khwarizm and Azerbaijan. Although they had their differences, Timur still supported Tokhtamysh against the Russians, leading to the latter's invasion of the Muscovite dominion and the burning of Moscow in 1382. As Timur moved further westward, he eventually reached the frontier of the Principality of Ryazan in 1395. He captured the city of Elets, and his forces continued their advance towards Moscow, nearing the banks of the Don River. However, their progress was halted after the Russian clergy brought the revered Theotokos of Vladimir icon from Vladimir to Moscow, and the people prayed fervently for the protection of their land. In response to these prayers, Timur's forces retreated, marking a turning point in his western expansion. In summary, the beginning of Timur's expansion period was characterized by a series of military campaigns and expeditions aimed at consolidating his rule at home and extending his territory. He successfully conquered lands to the west, northwest, south, and southwest, while encountering formidable opponents such as Tokhtamysh and the Russians. His expansion, however, eventually met resistance, leading to a halt in his western conquests."},{"instruction":"(options at the end).

President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un seemed to be in attendance. In reality, they were professional impersonators who sparked a commotion in the stands and were promptly escorted out by security. \\"We wanted to surprise everyone and bring world peace and then we’re being escorted out by security guards, which I think is really unfair,” said the Kim Jong Un impersonator, later identified as Howard. “Doesn’t everyone want peace?” The pair was mobbed by reporters, seeking reactions and insights into their unexpected presence. As commented humorously by the Los Angeles Times, this scrum of reporters proved that \\"reporters in other countries chase stupid stories, too.\\" Howard and his counterpart, Trump impersonator Dennis Alan, kept up their charade while interacting with the press. In character as Kim Jong Un, Howard claimed that he and the fake Trump were \\"getting along great\\" and expressed his belief that their real-life counterparts would feel the same if they ever meet. \\"Because in my opinion, they're pretty much the same person,\\" he stated. He even joked about their respective nuclear buttons, saying, “Both of our buttons are very big. We both agree on that, so there’s going to be peace.” Though briefly detained by security, the impersonators were allowed back to their seats after they proved they had legitimately purchased tickets for the ceremony. \\"We paid good money for it. We’re not thieves, you know. I can afford it. We’re rich,\\" said Howard, still portraying the North Korean leader. While their stunt might have been a lighthearted attempt to bring levity and promote peace, it highlighted the stark absence of official interaction between the US and North Korean delegations at the Olympic Games. Despite the ongoing tensions between North Korea and the US, the Olympics provided an opportunity for diplomacy and dialogue between North and South Korea, which marched together under one unified flag during the opening ceremony. It remains to be seen if the goodwill and cooperation displayed at the Winter Olympics will translate into lasting progress in inter-Korean relations, or if the impersonators’ momentary unity will be the only semblance of peace we will witness during these tumultuous times. Regardless, the memorable appearance of Howard and Dennis Alan at the opening ceremony has reminded the world of the importance of striving for peace and unity, even in the face of overwhelming opposition."},{"instruction":"Find the right ending to this passage.

Yemen, one of the poorest Arab countries, is the base for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), one of the most active branches of the network founded by Osama bin Laden, and militants have launched attacks from there against the West. U.S. sources have told Reuters that intercepted communication between bin Laden's successor as al Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, and the Yemen-based wing was one part of the intelligence behind their alert last week. Britain, which has already advised for more than two years that its citizens in Yemen should \\"leave now\\", announced it was temporarily evacuating all its embassy staff. Yemen is one of a handful of countries where Washington acknowledges targeting militants with strikes by drone aircraft. In the latest strike on Tuesday, a U.S. drone fired five missiles at a car travelling in the central Maarib province killing all four of its occupants, local tribal leaders said. Yemen's state news agency Saba said four al Qaeda militants were killed in the attack. The U.S. State Department's announcement urging Americans to leave the country follows a worldwide travel alert on Friday which prompted Washington to shut diplomatic missions across the Middle East and Africa. Some of its European allies have also closed their embassies in Yemen. \\"The Department urges U.S. citizens to defer travel to Yemen and those U.S. citizens currently living in Yemen to depart immediately,\\" the statement posted on its website said. \\"On August 6, 2013, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from Yemen due to the continued potential for terrorist attacks,\\" it added. Previous U.S. travel warnings to Yemen had also advised citizens not travel to the country, but the language of the latest announcement appeared to reflect a more imminent threat. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S. relations with Yemen remained strong despite the measures taken. \\"So this was, again, just to reiterate, a response to an immediate specific threat, but we continue to work with them on a number of issues,\\" Psaki told journalists at a news briefing in Washington. Britain also said on Tuesday it had withdrawn all staff from its embassy in the capital Sanaa, adding there was \\"a very high threat of kidnap from armed tribes, criminals and terrorists\\". The Netherlands advised its citizens to leave Yemen as a matter of urgency, local news agency ANP reported. France said it had not changed its previous advisory asking citizens to \\"be very cautious and to move around as little as possible,\\" Helene Conway-Mouret, junior Minister for French nationals abroad, told BFM TV. EVACUATION Restoring stability to Yemen - a country close to major shipping lanes and torn by regional and sectarian separatism and tribal violence as well as the al Qaeda insurgency - has been a priority for the United States. In a statement issued in Washington, Pentagon spokesman George Little said the U.S. Air Force \\"transported personnel out of Sanaa, Yemen, as part of a reduction in emergency personnel\\" in response to a request by the State Department. He did not specify which types of personnel were involved or where they were taken. \\"The U.S. Department of Defense continues to have personnel on the ground in Yemen to support the U.S. State Department and monitor the security situation,\\" the statement said. Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu-Bakr al-Qirbi criticized the measures but said they would not affect relations with the United States. \\"Unfortunately, these measures, although they are taken to protect their citizens, in reality they serve the goals that the terrorist elements are seeking to achieve,\\" Qirbi told Reuters. \\"Yemen had taken these threats seriously and had taken all the necessary measures to protect all the foreign missions in the country,\\" he added. The country's Supreme Security Committee issued a statement saying it had information al Qaeda was plotting attacks during Eid al-Fitr, this week's Muslim holiday that marks the end of the Ramadan fasting month. The committee also published a list of 25 senior al Qaeda militants it said were being sought by security forces and offered a bounty of 5 million Yemeni riyals (23,000) for information leading to their capture. \\"Information has become available that terrorist elements of the al Qaeda network were planning to carry out terrorist acts targeting public installations and facilities, especially in a number of Yemeni provinces, in the latter days of the holy month of Ramadan and during the Eid al-Fitr holiday,\\" it said. STABILITY Long-serving leader Ali Abdullah Saleh stepped down following months of protests against his rule in 2011, part of Arab uprisings that toppled three other heads of state. His replacement, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, met U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington last week. Yemen is home to 56 of the 86 detainees still being held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and security in Yemen is a key element of any deal to send them back so that Obama can fulfill a pledge to close the U.S. prison camp. Washington's warnings last week concerned possible attacks in the region, based on intelligence including intercepted communication between al Qaeda leaders. Some officials pinpointed Yemen as the main concern. No figures on the number of Americans in Yemen were immediately available. Washington had consistently cautioned citizens against travelling to Yemen since the protests in early 2011 that eventually forced Saleh to step down. Al Qaeda's Yemen-based branch AQAP has been behind plots against Western targets and neighboring Saudi Arabia. It claimed responsibility for a failed attempt by a Nigerian man to blow up a Detroit-bound trans-Atlantic airliner with explosives hidden in his underwear on Christmas Day, 2009. The United States has acknowledged killing Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen and al Qaeda preacher, in a drone strike in Yemen in September 2011. The Obama administration's policy allowing the killing of a U.S. citizen has been controversial. (Additional reporting by Phil Stewart, Tabassum Zakaria, Susan Cornwell, Paul Eckert and Lesley Wroughton in Washington, Ingrid Melander in Paris, Thomas Escritt in Amsterdam; Writing by Sami Aboudi; Editing by Peter Graff and Mike Collett-White) ||||| The White House has warned the terror alert which forced US embassy closures across the Middle East and Africa could continue for another four weeks as it revealed its intelligence indicated an ongoing threat \\"from now until the end of August\\". It was widely reported on Monday that the closures follow an intercepted communication between al-Qaida leader Ayman Zawahiri and the chief of the terrorist organization's Yemeni affiliate. Supporters of the NSA's surveillance tactics have used the latest threat to justify their opposition to reining in the agency's domestic spying activities. But the information related to the latest threat was collected overseas under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act – not the bulk surveillance programs disclosed by the Guardian and the Washington Post thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden. White House spokesman Jay Carney distanced himself from those linking the scare to recent debates about the agency's surveillance power in the US. The White House and State Department also both sought to downplay the impact of the shutdown on the effectiveness of US diplomacy in the region, stressing the embassy closures should not be seen as indefinite. \\"This is a temporary measure and it is out of an abundance of caution,\\" said Carney. \\"We are engaged around the world and that engagement creates some risk. This decision is designed to reduce that risk but our engagement will continue.\\" In contrast to NSA supporters who have been quick to link the surveillance debate with the current scare, the White House sought to downplay any political implications. \\"I am not going to blend those two stories together,\\" added Carney. \\"We have a threat that we have advised the public about and we have a set of issues regarding the unauthorised disclosure of classified information that has led to a debate about the balance between protecting our security and maintaining privacy – I wouldn't blend the two issues.\\" The White House did however re-iterate its threat to boycott a planned bilateral summit with President Putin in Moscow in retaliation for its decision to grant temporary asylum to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Asked if there was any relationship between the embassy alerts and the recent NSA controversies, Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said \\"I can assure that in no way, at all, period, affects\\" the State Department's threat assessment. While the administration did not make the link, others did. On Sunday, Rebublican senator Saxby Chambliss said the NSA had identified threats that were the most serious for years and akin to levels of \\"terrorist chatter\\" picked up before 9/11. \\"These [NSA] programs are controversial, we understand that,\\" he told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. \\"But they are also very important … If we did not have these programs, then we simply would not be able to listen in on the bad guys.\\" Critics of the NSA surveillance programs were measured in their responses. Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democract who has been a longstanding voice against the bulk collection of phone records, said the latest threat was \\"serious\\". As a member of the Senate intelligence committee, Wyden receives classified briefings, but he added: \\"While I can't go into specific details, the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee noted yesterday that this information was collected using section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, rather than the Patriot Act. I still haven't seen any evidence that the NSA's dragnet surveillance of Americans' phone records is providing any unique value to American counterterrorism efforts.\\" Privacy campaigners criticised the linking of the latest terror alerts with the debate over the domestic powers of the NSA. Amie Stepanovich, a lawyer with the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said: \\"The NSA's choice to publish these threats at this time perpetuates a culture of fear and unquestioning deference to surveillance in the United States.\\" News of the fresh terror alert came as Congress looked increasingly likely to pursue fresh attempts to limit the NSA's domestic powers when it returns in September. \\"The NSA takes in threat information every day. You have to ask, why now? What makes this information different?\\" added Stepanovich. \\"Too much of what we hear from the government about surveillance is either speculation or sweeping assertions that lack corroboration. The question isn't if these programs used by this NSA can find legitimate threats, it's if the same threats couldn't be discovered in a less invasive manner. This situation fails to justify the NSA's unchecked access to our personal information.\\" US embassies have been closed temporarily in response to similar perceived terrorist threats, but rarely for this long. Four embassies were closed for the first anniversary of 9/11 in 2002; six African embassies were closed for 3 days in June of 1999; and 38 embassies shut for 2 days in December 1998. \\"I don't want anyone to think we're leaning toward indefinite closure,\\" Harf said, emphasizing that many of the embassies would largely have been closed or on relaxed hours due to the Eid holiday. Harf said the threat \\"looks credible\\" in response to a question about whether it might have been a decoy once revelations of NSA surveillance became public. \\"We continue to refine our assessment of the threat,\\" Harf said. ||||| A suspected U.S. drone killed four alleged al-Qaida members in Yemen on Tuesday, as the U.S. and British embassies evacuated staff amid reports of a threatened attack by al-Qaida that has triggered temporary shutdowns of 19 American diplomatic posts across the Muslim world. Yemeni officials have suggested al-Qaida threats to multiple potential targets in the Arabian Peninsula country in recent days, including foreign installations and government offices in the capital Sanaa as well as to the strategic Bab al-Mandeb straits at the entrance to the Red Sea to the south. It is not clear if these reports are the same as the intelligence that led to the embassy shutdowns, reportedly instigated by an intercepted message between al-Qaida chief Ayman al-Zawahri and his deputy in Yemen about plans for a major terror attack. The State Department on Tuesday ordered non-essential personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Yemen to leave the country. The department said in a travel warning that it had ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from Yemen \\"due to the continued potential for terrorist attacks\\" and said U.S. citizens in Yemen should leave immediately because of an \\"extremely high\\" security threat level. Britain's Foreign Office also said it has evacuated all staff from its embassy in Yemen due to increased security concerns. The Foreign Office said the British Embassy staff were \\"temporarily withdrawn to the U.K.\\" on Tuesday. It declined to comment further. Meanwhile, there has been a spike in apparent U.S. drone strikes against al-Qaida leaders. The attack Tuesday was the fourth in two weeks. Yemen officials say the drone fired a missile at a car carrying four men in the al-Arqeen district of Marib province, setting it on fire and killing all of them. They believed that one of the dead is Saleh Jouti, a senior al-Qaida member. To the west, in the capital Sanaa, residents awoke to the sound of an aircraft buzzing overhead. Officials said it was an American, and photos posted on Instagram appeared to show a P-3 Orion, a manned aircraft used for surveillance. All officials spoke anonymously as they were not authorized to brief the media. The rare overflight of the capital came shortly before the announcements of the evacuations. Yemeni authorities released the names of 25 wanted al-Qaida suspects on Monday, saying they were planning terrorist attacks in the capital, Sanaa, and other cities across the country. A statement from Yemen's Interior Ministry said the suspects were going to target foreign offices and organizations, as well as Yemeni government installations in the impoverished Arab country. It said security was beefed up around embassies, ports, airports, oil installations and power stations. Officials say potential U.S. targets in Sanaa could include the embassy and other buildings used by the United States to house personnel, as well as a military camp a few kilometers (miles) outside used by U.S. aircraft. The Yemeni statement said security forces will pay 23,000 to anyone who comes forward with information that leads to the arrests of any of the wanted men. They included allegedly senior figures in al-Qaida's Yemen branch, including Saudi nationals Ibrahim Mohammed el-Rubaish and Ibrahim Hassan el-Assiri. El-Rubaish was released from Guantanamo in 2006 and is believed to have played significant roles in al-Qaida's expanding offshoot in Yemen. He is a theological adviser to the group and his writings and sermons are prominent in the group's literature. Military officials meanwhile said the threat may be related to the Bab al-Mandeb, pointing to a visit by Defense Minister Gen. Mohammed Nasser Ahmed on Sunday to Yemeni military forces positioned at the Red Sea entrance some 276 kilometers (171.5 miles) south of Sanaa. Officials said that the visit came after intelligence that al-Qaida could be targeting foreign or Yemeni interests at the vital Red Sea corridor, which is a main thoroughfare for international shipping but also a crossing point of for smuggled weapons and illegal immigrants between east Africa and Yemen. Ahmed urged the forces to stay \\"on alert against any sabotage operations aiming at destabilizing the country,\\" according to officials. They also spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Washington considers the al-Qaida branch in Yemen to be among the terror network's most dangerous branches. The United States has also assisted Yemen's military in fighting the militants who, at one point during the country's recent political turmoil, had overrun large sections of land in the south. The group has also carried out bold assassination attacks on Yemeni security forces, killing hundreds over the past two years. |||||","output":"The United States flew some of their people out of Yemen because they were worried about possible attacks.

Given these facts, sperm had to swim from what to what reproductive organs for zygotes to occur. among the following options: - barnacles - male to female - animals - ocean water - male to male - mouth of rivers - female to male - female to female Answer:","output":"In order for fertilization to occur and zygotes to form, sperm must swim from the male reproductive organs to the female reproductive organs. This process is essential for sexual reproduction in animals, including humans. In the context of the provided options, sperm must swim from \\"male to female\\" reproductive organs to achieve fertilization and eventually form zygotes. Here is a detailed explanation of the process: 1. Sperm production: The process begins with the production of sperm cells in the male reproductive organs, specifically within the testes. The sperm cells undergo maturation and are stored in the epididymis, where they become motile and capable of fertilizing an egg. 2. Ejaculation: During sexual intercourse, sperm cells are released from the male reproductive system through ejaculation. The sperm cells are mixed with seminal fluid produced by the accessory glands, forming semen. The semen functions as a vehicle for the sperm, providing nutrients and protection as they travel through the female reproductive system. 3. Sperm meets egg: To reach the female reproductive organs, sperm must swim through the vagina and then ascend the cervical canal into the uterus. From the uterus, the sperm must navigate through the fallopian tube(s) in search of the mature egg released from the ovary during ovulation. Only a small fraction of the ejaculated sperm will successfully navigate this intricate path. 4. Fertilization: Once a sperm cell encounters an egg, it must penetrate the outer layers of the egg and fuse with it, thereby releasing its genetic material into the egg. This fusion is called fertilization, and it results in the formation of a single-celled zygote. 5. Zygote formation and development: After fertilization, the new zygote begins its development process, starting with cell division. As the cells continue to divide and specialize, the zygote transforms into a blastocyst and then an embryo. If implantation into the uterus lining is successful, it will grow into a fetus and eventually a fully formed offspring. In summary, for zygotes to form, sperm must successfully swim from the male reproductive organs to the female reproductive organs, where fertilization of an egg can occur. This essential process forms the basis of sexual reproduction in animals."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A cyclist wearing a red helmet is riding on the pavement.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A cyclist wearing a red helmet is outside.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Establishing a link between the premise and the hypothesis: To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to check if the information in the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis. 4. Examining the connection: Riding on the pavement is typically understood as an action that takes place outdoors (since pavements are generally located outside). 5. Conclusion: Given this understanding, when the premise says the cyclist is riding on the pavement, it is implied that the cyclist is outside. Therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premises.

Every autumn Kiss hire a huge cruise liner to sail around the Caribbean for a week with 2,300 of their diehard fans. This year will be their sixth voyage, or Kiss Kruise VI. The band perform two shows on the ship, and fans get to meet and hang out with the four band members. There are 13 bars on board, plus 12 restaurants, a swimming pool, a gym, a spa, a casino, an indoor theatre and a tattoo parlour for getting a new Kiss ink work. Members of the so-called Kiss Navy fly into Miami from around the world to attend, and Kiss vocalist and bass guitarist Gene Simmons says the cruise is one of the highlights of his annual calendar. \\"It's rock and roll all night and party every day,\\" he says. \\"Anyone who has ever been on one of our cruises comes back raving to their friends. \\"Imagine 2,300 crazy friends, swimming, shopping, gaming and visiting exotic ports of call with us.\\" While Kiss might not be to everyone's taste, the rock group has helped to transform the once staid world of cruise lines. Whereas cruises were traditionally the preserve of elderly holidaymakers, over the past decade - and especially in the past five years - there has been an exponential growth in the number of \\"themed cruises\\" - cruises aimed at people with a specific interest. This has opened up the world of cruising to a much younger demographic, and given the cruise industry hundreds of millions of dollars in additional earnings. From music cruises - at which Kiss are leading the way - to cruises for people with specific political views, or cruises for poker players, or fans of Italian food, there is a ship sailing for pretty much everyone. For example, if you are passionate about your constitutional right to bear arms, you might be tempted to join the Freedom Alliance and National Rifle Association's cruise down the River Danube in June. Guest speakers include US Republican politician - and former speaker of the US House of Representatives - Newt Gingrich. Or if you are transgender, Transgender Vacations organises cruises around the Caribbean. Disney holds regular sailings for fans of the Star Wars movies, where you can dress up as a stormtrooper or ewok and meet some of the actors. Howard Moses, founder and president of the Cruise & Vacation Authority, says that more than 700 themed cruises now set sail around the world each year, compared with less than 30 a decade ago. \\"Themed cruises are absolutely by far the biggest growth area in the industry,\\" says Mr Moses, whose organisation is based in the US state of Georgia. \\"It has enabled the cruise industry to reach beyond people who are our traditional customers, to people who are passionate about a certain subject. \\"For music cruises, there can be a very young crowd. \\"And for the political cruises we joke that the attendees are often people who said they would never go on a cruise, yet they have the time of their lives, and are the first to lead the conga line.\\" At Atlanta-based Sixthman, the world's largest organiser of music cruises, its communications manager Alaidriale Derway says the business has just wrapped up its busiest ever spring sailing season, with 10 back-to-back cruises. Sixthman now has more than 500 acts on its books, including Kiss. Other acts for whom it organises cruises include Weezer, Paramore, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Kid Rock. The company charters the ships and helps to organise support acts. Ms Derway says: \\"More and more artists want to get involved. \\"Cruises are a great way for artists to interact with their fans in a much more intimate environment, and collaborate with each other. \\"In terms of the cost for a fan, they pay a set fee, and then pretty much everything is free except for alcohol and soda. All the food is included unless someone wants to pay for more speciality dining.\\" She adds: \\"Lots of people really hesitate to do the whole cruise thing, there is still a bit of a stigma attached, but you can really connect with people who are passionate about the same things as you are.\\" While the music cruise industry is very much based in the US, themed cruises are also a growing phenomenon on the other side of the Atlantic. Mike Bugsgang, chief executive of the UK-based Association of Group Travel Organisers, says there has been a big rise in the number of cruises that include visits to locations that have featured in well-known movies. One such cruise organised by Fred Olsen Cruise Lines is called \\"UK Scenes from the Silver Screen\\". Sailing around the UK and Ireland, the itinerary includes trips to settings from TV series Game of Thrones and the Harry Potter movies. Back in the US, Kiss' Gene Simmons doesn't just have to prepare for performing live on the Kiss Kruise, he also has to brush up on his wedding officiating. An on-board extra for Kiss' hard-partying fans is the chance to splice more than just the mainbrace. They can tie the marital knot, with Mr Simmons or a fellow band member performing the service. But one thing a Kiss Kruise is not is restful. As Mr Simmons admits: \\"It's tough to get to sleep on the cruises... it is fair to say, both the band and the fans are completely exhausted once we leave the cruise.\\"","output":"Themed cruises, aimed at passengers with specific interests, are experiencing exponential growth and transforming the cruise line industry.

From head to feet, owls' bodies are built to hunt. Scientists are studying all the things that make owls such great hunters. Most owls hunt at night. The birds have excellent hearing, which helps them find their next meal in the dark. Owls have one ear that is larger and set higher than the other. When an owl hears a sound, it listens closely. Is the sound lounder in its right ear or left ear? Does the upper or lower ear detect the sound first? The information helps the owl find the location of its prey without ever seeing it. Owls don't depend just on their hearing to hunt. After a sound draws an owl's attention, it zeroes in with sight. Many birds have eyes on either side of their heads. But an owl's eyes face forward, like a person's. Images from each eye combine to form a 3-D picture, similar to how we see. That helps owls better judge a prey's size, distance, and speed. An owl's eyes are so large that they can gather lots of light. That helps the owl see better when hunting at night. An owl's eyes are also fixed in their sockets . It can't roll them like we can. Instead, an owl keeps prey in its sight by turning its head. Owls can move their beads nearly upside down and turn them 270 degrees around. Their necks have 14 vertebrae . That's twice as many neck bones as a person has. The blood vessels thread through holes in an owl's vertebrae. The researchers found that these holes are very large so that the extra space provides an air cushion that protects the vessels. Detecting prey is only the first step for owls. Next they must catch their meals. An owl can fly inches over your head and you can't hear anything. The secret to owls' silent flight is their feathers. Fine \\"hairs\\" cover the surface of an owl's wing feathers. And the feathers' edges have soft barbs . Together, they make the sound of air rushing over the owl's wings quieter and less clear.

But it can and does look down its nose at you. It can be insistent, if not a nag. Horses are expressive, but those who want to decipher their expressions have a few hurdles yet to jump. But the chase is on. Scientists at the University of Sussex have compiled a directory of facial expression in one of humanity’s oldest four-legged friends. Their Equine Facial Action Coding System (EquiFACS for short) has identified 17 discrete facial movements in horses that may indicate mood or intention or just bafflement. This is at least three more than the facial expressions identified in chimpanzees. Dogs can get a message across with 16 different expressions. And human faces have 27 different ways of speaking silently, with the lips and eyes and the occasional wrinkled nose. “Horses are predominantly visual animals, with eyesight that’s better than domestic cats and dogs, yet their use of facial expression has been largely overlooked. What surprised us was the rich repertoire of complex facial movements in horses, and how many of them are similar to humans,” said Jennifer Watham, a doctoral researcher and one of the lead authors. “Despite the differences in face structure between horses and humans, we were able to identify some similar expressions in relation to movements of lips and eyes. What we’ll now be looking at is how these expressions relate to emotional states.” She and her colleagues report in PLOS One that they dissected a horse’s head (it came from Pennsylvania andthe horse had been put down for clinical reasons) to identify, sketch and photograph all the elements of facial musculature. The researchers then recorded 15 hours of natural behaviour in 86 horses, aged from four weeks to 27 years taking in both male and female and a range of breeds . The search for variety embraced rescued horses, riding schools and farms. And then the team charted all possible twitches of their horse-faced subjects. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Horses and humans can both raise the skin above their eyes, as seen in this video. Wild horses roamed across Europe, Asia and North America during the Ice Ages, between 2.5 million and 12,000 years ago. They were hunted for food, but then were first domesticated around 5,000 years ago. Bythe mid-20th century, the species Equus ferus had become extinct in the wild. The horse changed human society – it delivered mounted cavalry, the notion of chivalry, and the original measure of horsepower for economic development. It became a draught animal, a farm worker, a military steed, a sporting hunter and the foundation of one of the world’s oldest and biggest gambling industries. But the research by the Sussex scientists, with collaborators from the University of Portsmouth and Duquesne University in Pennsylvania, turns history on its head. It is the commencement of a long cool look at how humanity might have changed the horse, and how the look in a colt’s eye, or a frisky glance from a filly, or a Clydesdale’s curling lip – could answer complex questions about the social, cognitive and physical characteristics of biology on the hoof. The Sussex study – a catalogue of eye, lip, nostril, chin and other movements - is just a beginning. It could tell the riders a lot more about how their runners view the human race. “Horses and humans can both raise the skin above their eyes, which seems to happen in negative emotional states,” said Watham. “Another example is the retraction of lip corners, which seems to be part of a submissive gesture in horses. Our paper has only identified the movements horses can make – the challenge now is to document what contexts these occur in, and then we will be able to make more informed comparisons.” Horses are social animals: most of their behaviour must have evolved to help keep family groups together during seasonal migration in search of changing food sources, and to warn of possible predator attack. But the range of possible expression remained a surprise. “It was previously thought that, in terms of other species, the further away an animal was from humans, the more rudimentary their use of facial expressions would be,” said Karen McComb, professor of animal behaviour at Sussex, and the other lead author. “Through the development of EquiFACS, however, it’s apparent that horses, with their complex and fluid social systems, also have an extensive range of facial movements and share many of these with humans and other animals. This contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that social factors have had a significant influence on the evolution of facial expression.” ||||| Different Faces, Same Smiles Horses share some surprisingly similar facial expressions with humans, a new study finds. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, found that, like humans, horses use muscles underlying various facial features, including their nostrils, lips and eyes. These alter their facial expressions in a variety of situations. \\"Horses have rich social lives, and to me it seems likely that horses have evolved a wide range of facial expressions to help them communicate effectively with other members of their species,\\" lead author Jennifer Wathan of the University of Sussex told Discovery News. She added, \\"I think what surprised me most was that we didn't expect horses to have any similarities with humans at all. They're two such distantly related species and, at first glance, have such differently shaped faces.\\" If there is a horse version of laughing, that is not yet known. The researchers are still investigating what emotions are tied to the horse facial expressions. What Your Dog (or Horse) Is Trying to Tell You: Photos ||||| Abstract Although previous studies of horses have investigated their facial expressions in specific contexts, e.g. pain, until now there has been no methodology available that documents all the possible facial movements of the horse and provides a way to record all potential facial configurations. This is essential for an objective description of horse facial expressions across a range of contexts that reflect different emotional states. Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) provide a systematic methodology of identifying and coding facial expressions on the basis of underlying facial musculature and muscle movement. FACS are anatomically based and document all possible facial movements rather than a configuration of movements associated with a particular situation. Consequently, FACS can be applied as a tool for a wide range of research questions. We developed FACS for the domestic horse (Equus caballus) through anatomical investigation of the underlying musculature and subsequent analysis of naturally occurring behaviour captured on high quality video. Discrete facial movements were identified and described in terms of the underlying muscle contractions, in correspondence with previous FACS systems. The reliability of others to be able to learn this system (EquiFACS) and consistently code behavioural sequences was high—and this included people with no previous experience of horses. A wide range of facial movements were identified, including many that are also seen in primates and other domestic animals (dogs and cats). EquiFACS provides a method that can now be used to document the facial movements associated with different social contexts and thus to address questions relevant to understanding social cognition and comparative psychology, as well as informing current veterinary and animal welfare practices.

Introduction Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) provide a method of identifying and recording facial expressions based on the underlying facial (mimetic) musculature and muscle movement [1]. Here we present EquiFACS, a Facial Action Coding System for the domestic horse (Equus caballus). Until now, there has been no methodology available that documented all of the facial movements of the horse, allowing a record of all potential facial configurations. There are a number of studies that focus on the facial expressions of horses in one specific context, for example pain [2, 3]. However, EquiFACS provides a comprehensive list of all the facial movements that horses can produce, which can be used to document facial expressions across a wide range of contexts. What Are Facial Action Coding Systems? FACS are objective coding systems for describing facial behaviour. The facial muscles (sometimes known as the mimetic muscles) are a subgroup of muscles innervated by CN7 (the facial nerve). They are characterised by their extensive connections to the superficial fascia and skin of the face, and consequently are responsible for observable changes in the skin (facial movements or expressions) [4]. FACS are frameworks where designated codes (Action Units or AUs) represent the contraction of a particular facial muscle (or set of muscles) and the resulting facial movements [1]. Action Descriptors (ADs) are also used for more general facial movements where the muscular basis either cannot be identified or is the result of a different muscle set (e.g. deep muscles). This creates a reliable system that people can be trained to use and that describes facial actions in a standardised way, avoiding subjective assessments of expression. This is particularly important as the recording and analysis of facial expressions can be subject to a large degree of observer bias and influenced by the perceived emotional context [5–7]. Consequently, frameworks that quantify behaviour and allow reliable, objective measurements are needed. The original FACS was developed for use in humans [1] and this framework has since been applied to a number of different primates and domestic animals (chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)[8], orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus)[9], rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)[10], hylobatids (gibbons and siamangs)[11], dogs (Canis familiaris)[12] and cats (Felis catus)[13]. This methodology provides compatible systems that allow direct comparisons using identical techniques across species with a different facial morphology (e.g. [14]). EquiFACS is the first attempt to develop this system for an animal with laterally placed eyes and an elongated face. Why Are Horses an Interesting Model? Horses belong to the order Perissodactyla, and within this they are one of nine species in the family Equus. By the end of the Pleistocene era (approx. 2.5 million – 12,000 years ago) wild horses (Equus ferus) roamed across Europe, Asia and North America, and it is estimated that the domestication of horses began around 5000 years ago [15]. However, by the middle of the twentieth century horses had become extinct in the wild, yet were thriving as a domestic species [16]. Domestication can dramatically influence the social, cognitive, and morphological characteristics of a species, and the study of domestic species is of great interest from both welfare and evolutionary perspectives [17–19]. Horses are long-lived social animals. Feral populations have demonstrated that without domestic pressures horses would live in a society comprising of several small groups or ‘bands’ that share space and resources, and to which membership stays relatively stable over time. Bands have large, overlapping ranges so horses regularly come into contact with many other conspecifics, and inter-band dominance indicates that within the larger herd established social relationships exist [20]. Consequently, horses show fission-fusion dynamics; a variation of the same complex social organisation that is seen in humans, bonobos, chimpanzees, and macaques, as well as elephants, spotted hyenas and many cetaceans [21]. Group life in these societies is determined by complex, long-term social relationships that must be maintained, suggesting effective communication would be adaptive [22]. Horses are predominantly visual animals, with reasonable visual acuity that, at 23 cycles per degree, is better than domestic cats and dogs [23–25]. While horses’ use of head and body posture in signaling has been described in observational literature (e.g. [20] and [26]), surprisingly their use of facial expressions has been largely overlooked. This is despite attempts to quantify facial expressions in horses’ close relatives, plains zebra (Equus quagga [27]), and reports that horses do routinely use some apparently complex facial expressions (e.g. snapping and the estrous face, which both involve pulling back the lips and flattening of the ears [28]). A systematic way of recording facial expressions would have a wide range of uses, with the potential to assess and improve welfare for horses, as well as enhancing our understanding of communication and cognition in this highly social species and providing insights into the effects of domestication. Questions about whether particular facial movements are associated with negative emotional states or indicative of positive experiences will be particularly important to address, and FACS provides an ideal framework for such investigations. More generally, FACS provides a framework through which species with different phylogenetic and ecological influences can be compared to investigate the functional significance and evolutionary origins of facial expressions. How Was FACS Modified for Use in Horses? To modify FACS for use in non-human animals, the first step was to document and compare their facial anatomy [9–13, 29]. Horses are only distantly related to primates and the other animals FACS have previously been developed for; additionally horses have a dramatically different facial morphology to these animals, including laterally placed eyes, elongated faces, and raised zygomatic arches. Consequently, it is possible that the facial muscles of horses would show little similarity with the facial muscles of humans or those underpinning other FACS. To facilitate valid comparisons across taxa, it is necessary to report findings in a consistent way, with a standardised nomenclature for the facial muscles [4]. While the anatomy of domestic mammals is generally well documented, it has been difficult to make direct comparisons between domestic animals and primates because of the inconsistent terminology used (see [4, 30] for reviews and a call for a standardized nomenclature for the facial muscles). Additionally, the anatomy of domestic mammals tends to be described from a veterinary perspective, so that the muscles of facial expression are often not documented comprehensively within one text (e.g. [31]). Therefore, we supplemented the previous literature on the facial anatomy of the horse with our own dissection using an innovative ‘face mask’ method, which allows a more complete view of the facial muscles and their attachments than traditional dissection methods [32–35]. In doing this we documented the muscles using the recommended terms, which allowed us to make direct comparisons between horses and the other species. The facial muscles of the horse are reported here using the standardised terminology [4], so that a free, detailed record of the muscles of facial expression is available alongside the EquiFACS manual. We then analysed footage of a wide range of naturally occurring horse behaviours captured on high quality video. Discrete facial movements were identified, their proposed muscular basis was noted, and they were given a code in correspondence with previous FACS systems. All the facial movements identified are listed in the results, accompanied by a description of the appearance changes and video illustrations. Where necessary, the proposed muscular basis of the actions is given and there are also sections on subtle differences between similar actions. Method Anatomical Investigation of the Underlying Anatomy The head of one horse was acquired from the New Bolton Centre at the University of Pennsylvania. The dissection was done using an innovative ‘face mask’ method, where the facial musculature is removed from the deep muscles and the skull with the skin, creating a ‘facial mask’ that holds all of the facial muscles (see S1 Text for full details of the dissection procedure). Using this novel approach preserves the superficially located facial muscles that might be lost in the traditional dissection method of removing the skin from the facial musculature. Furthermore, it provides a more complete picture of muscle attachments, by keeping superficial portions attached to the skin and deeper portions attached to the skull (see [32–35]). The muscles were examined for presence/absence, attachments to the bone, skin, and cartilage, as well as their three-dimensional relationships to one another and to the skull. Muscles were classified with reference to a variety of sources (mainly [36, 37]) and in relation to previous dissections completed for the development of FACS in other species [32–35]. All muscles and their attachments were recorded, sketched and photographed. Classifying Facial Actions We collected and analysed 15 hours of video footage of a wide range of naturally occurring horse behaviours from a sample of 86 horses. Known ages ranged from 4 weeks to 27 years, and the sample included horses of different breeds, coat colours, and sex. Horses were videoed using a Canon XM2 video recorder in a variety of situations, including interacting with conspecifics, humans and other animals (e.g. dogs), feeding and mating. Each discrete facial movement identified was given a code (an Action unit—AU—or an Action Descriptor—AD) in correspondence with previous FACS systems. Where EquiFACS identified movements analogous to those in humans or other animals, the same codes have been used. In some cases, although the same muscle is used in both humans and horses the resulting action on the face is very different; in these cases the Action Unit is prefixed with an ‘H’ e.g. AUH13. In other cases, although the action on the face is similar in horses and humans, the underlying muscular basis differs; in these cases the AU is prefixed by a 1 (e.g. AU122). Where novel movements were noted a new Action Unit or Descriptor was created (see Table 1 and Table 2). Agreement on these classifications was reached between two trained human FACS coders (JW and BMW), a comparative anatomist (AMB), and a specialist in animal behaviour (including horses) (KM).

Summary of actions descriptors in EquiFACS compared to Human FACS. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.t002 The reliability of others to be able to learn EquiFACS and consistently code behaviour was tested with four coders, three of whom had no previous experience of FACS and one of whom had no previous experience of horses. The coders were each given the text, video examples, and practical instructions describing how to use EquiFACS effectively (see S3 Text) and asked to learn EquiFACS independently. The coders had minimum contact with the authors in this time, so that their performance would be considered a fair test of whether EquiFACS produces reliable coding when learned without training from the developers. When each coder was happy that they understood the principles of EquiFACS and felt they could reliably identify the expressions, they were asked to code 22 short video clips (containing the full range of AUs and EADs) with the manual for reference. In accordance with previous FACS, reliability was measured using Wexler’s ratio [1, 8–12, 38]. Wexler’s ratio is a ratio of the number of agreements (i.e. the number of AUs on which coder 1 and coder 2 agreed x 2) divided by the number of possibilities for agreement (i.e. the total number of AUs scored by both coders). This is particularly suitable for situations, such as in FACS, where there are a large number of potential codes and there is likely to be a different number of items coded by each coder. Each person’s coding was compared to JW’s coding, the agreement ratio was calculated for each video clip, and then an average over the video clips was taken for each coder. The overall average was 0.86 (coder 1 = 0.85; coder 2 = 0.86; coder 3 = 0.87; coder 4 = 0.85), demonstrating high reliability across the coders. Ethical Statement This study gained ethical approval from the University of Sussex Ethical Review Committee, and was carried out in accordance with the Association of Animal Behaviour Guidelines for the Treatment of Animals in Behavioural Research. All owners gave consent for their horses to be video recorded. It should be noted that the specimen for the dissection was not euthanised for the purpose of this study, but was acquired from a veterinary centre where the horse had been euthanised for clinical reasons. Results Facial Muscles of the Horse Fig 1 depicts the facial muscles of the horse (S1, S2, and S3 Figs show the facial muscles located in our dissection). Overall, the facial muscles of horses are very complex, and although there are differences, there are a surprising number of similarities with humans and other primates. Table 1 summarises the findings in comparison to the human facial muscles. Detailed descriptions of the muscles are given in S2 Text. PPT PowerPoint slide PowerPoint slide PNG larger image larger image TIFF original image Download: Fig 1. The facial muscles of the horse. NB. Levator labii superioris a.n. represents the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, which is often also called the levator nasolabialis. Synonyms for the levator annuli oris fascialis muscle include the dilator nares muscle and the caninus muscle. The frontoscutularis has a frontal and a temporal arm. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g001 Gross observations showed that the muscles around the ear, lips, and nose of the horse were particularly large and complex, with these muscles having many attachments to the fascia, cartilage, and other muscles (S2 and S3 Figs). In particular, many muscles of the lower face converged in the modiolus to form a large, complex muscular mass (S2 Figs). This was in contrast to previous suggestions that mammals distantly related to primates, such as Perissodactyla, should have very simple facial musculature, particularly around the lips and mid-face [39, 40]. The orbital and mid-face region of the horse had numerous muscles including both a zygomatic major and minor (also termed the malaris), and an extensive obicularis occuli, although the muscles in these areas were thinner than the muscles around the ears and lower face. There was a large amount of adipose compared to non-human primates, e.g. chimpanzee, [33]; rhesus macaques, [34] Otolemur [32] and Hylobatids [35], possibly due to the domestic situation of the horse. The adipose was particularly prevalent around the ear, but also found around the mouth (this has been cut away in the Figs to allow better observation of the muscles). Conclusions The study of complex behaviours, such as facial expressions, would be limited without standardised systems that allow quantification of behaviour and cross-species comparisons. Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) provide a means of addressing this problem, and by developing a FACS for the domestic horse (EquiFACS) we have produced a tool that allows the systematic recording of horse facial expressions in any context, with the potential to make direct comparisons across species. EquiFACS is an anatomically based, objective system that contains all the facial actions horses can possibly produce, making it suitable for many different research questions. Horses have a rich facial repertoire, with 17 defined Action Units (AUs). Whilst this was less than the number of AUs humans display (27), it was slightly more than most other animals that FACS have been developed for (chimpanzees, 13, rhesus macaques, 13, orang-utans, 15, Hylobatids, 16, dogs, 16), with only cats displaying a larger facial repertoire (21, largely due to the extensive whisker and ear movements). The potential to make such cross species comparisons can enhance our understanding of the meaning, function, and evolution of communicative behaviour [14, 44]. In fact, many of the horse AUs were similar to the facial movements seen in other animals, including humans, chimpanzees, cats, and dogs. It was previously thought that humans possessed the most complex repertoire of facial expressions and that, in phylogenetic terms, the further away an animal was from humans, the more rudimentary their use of facial expressions would be. However, through the development of EquiFACS it is apparent that horses also have an extensive range of facial movements, sharing many Action Units with humans and other animals. This contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the evolution of facial expressions was not driven entirely by phylogenetic pressures, but that other, socio-ecological factors had a significant influence [30, 35]. EquiFACS also provides those working in the horse community with a standardised language through which information can be shared, facilitating the investigation of questions relevant to horse management and welfare. It should be noted that whilst some of the video examples given with this manuscript contain recognisable horse behaviour (e.g. flehmen, S25 and S30 Videos), when coding facial expressions it is important not to try and immediately assess the overall behaviour, but instead to focus on describing the individual facial movements. One of the key actions seen in flehmen (AU122, the upper lip curl) has also been recorded in some pain expressions of the horse [45, 46], and yet is also seen in other, unrelated contexts (see S31 Video). A potential application of EquiFACS would be to establish whether there are particular configurations of facial movements displayed alongside the upper lip curl (AU122), which help distinguish the different contexts. While recent work has suggested that horses use apparently complex facial expressions [28, 47], and that certain facial movements are associated with pain in domestic horses [2, 3], until now the full capacity of horse facial expressions to convey a range of information has been largely overlooked. In particular, no studies have yet investigated whether there are facial expressions associated with positive experiences in horses–a critical yet poorly understood aspect of animal welfare [48]. EquiFACS can be applied to address this gap, with the potential to greatly facilitate future studies of horse welfare as well as extending our knowledge of equine communication and cognition.

A: Answer:","output":"The airway and the lungs are part of the Respiratory System. The primary function of the respiratory system is to take in oxygen from the environment and expel carbon dioxide from the body. This process is usually done through breathing. The Respiratory System is composed of various organs and structures, including: 1. Nasal cavities and nose: Filters, warms, and moistens the incoming air. 2. Pharynx (throat): Serves as a passageway for both food and air. 3. Larynx (voice box): Allows vocalization, and prevents food from entering the trachea. 4. Trachea (windpipe): A major tube that carries air to the lungs. 5. Bronchi and Bronchioles: These are smaller branches that carry air from the trachea into the lungs. 6. Lungs: These are two large organs that perform the gas exchange, allowing oxygen to enter the bloodstream and carbon dioxide to be removed from the bloodstream and exhaled. 7. Alveoli: These are small sacs within the lungs where the actual gas exchange happens. In the process of respiration, the human body draws in fresh air into the lungs, absorbs oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. It is a critical system for sustaining life because all cells, tissues, and organs in the body require a constant supply of oxygen to generate the energy needed for body functions."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you're given a context, a sentence, and a character.

In the present day, an elite group of historians, archaeologists, and treasure hunters are tirelessly decoding these messages to find the lost treasures. Main Characters: 1. Greg - A brilliant archaeologist who specializes in deciphering ancient languages. 2. Anita - A renowned historian known for her knowledge of ancient societies and relics. 3. Marcus - A seasoned treasure hunter, skilled in infiltrating dangerous locations. 4. Dr. Emily - A talented engineer who creates innovative gadgets to aid in the treasure hunts. 5. Lucius - The wealthy financier who funds the group's expeditions. Plot: The film opens with Greg and Anita digging into the ruins of an ancient civilization, where they discover a cryptic message, revealing the existence of four mythical artifacts known as the \\"Cryptic Tetrad.\\" The artifacts are believed to possess immeasurable power, capable of granting the ultimate knowledge and control over the world. Word spreads regarding their extraordinary finding, and a race among treasure hunters around the world begins to unfold. With the help of their friends Marcus and Dr. Emily, the unlikely group of treasure hunters starts to collect information about the possible locations of the four artifacts. Meanwhile, their financier, Lucius, becomes increasingly obsessed with the idea of possessing the power of the Cryptic Tetrad, and he starts pushing the team to work under his discretion, as his desire for control begins to cloud his judgment. As the team continues to decipher ancient codes and unravel mysteries surrounding the four artifacts, they successfully locate the first two artifacts. But with each discovery, they are faced with increasingly intricate booby traps, left by the ancient societies to protect their hidden treasures. Along the way, the team encounters rival treasure hunters, who will stop at nothing to get their hands on the Cryptic Tetrad. The conflicts escalate around the discovery of the third artifact, hidden within a formidable fortress protected by a complex maze of traps. In order to gain access, Greg and Anita must solve a series of riddles and face the dangers that lie ahead. Unfortunately, as they start to unravel the answers that would lead to the third artifact, Greg and Anita find themselves in front of a booby trap they cannot overcome. Despite their best efforts to disarm the lethal trap, they tragically lose their lives, leaving Marcus and Dr. Emily devastated. They decide to carry on with the mission, honoring the memory of their fallen friends. In the film's climax, the surviving members, Marcus and Dr. Emily, uncover the fourth and final artifact. As they approach the coveted piece, they face a choice: to claim the power for themselves or to leave it untouched, as the ancient society had intended. As Lucius reaches his breaking point and ruthlessly demands they seize the artifact, Marcus and Dr. Emily ultimately choose to abandon the treasure in honor of their deceased friends. With a newfound appreciation for life, they thwart Lucius' plans for world domination and expose the Cryptic Tetrad's secret to the world. The movie ends with the revelation that the real treasure was the unique knowledge and experiences they gained along their journey, and the bonds they forged with their companions. In conclusion, \\"The Cryptic Tetrad\\" touches upon themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the limits of human ambition in the face of ancient power, making it a thrilling and emotional adventure for audiences around the globe."},{"instruction":"Question: Process: - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust - Question: suppose erosion occurs at faster pace happens, how will it affect more acid is formed. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"In order to answer this question, let's break down the process and analyze each step. 1. Water comes into contact with something made of iron. 2. The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid. 3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve. 4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen. 5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together. 6. They form iron oxide, which is rust. Now, the question is asking how a faster rate of erosion would affect the acid formation (step 2) and its influence on the second effect mentioned (step 4). If erosion occurs at a faster pace, it is logical to assume that more iron could be exposed to water and carbon dioxide, therefore increasing the formation of carbonic acid. This means that more acid would be formed. Now, let's examine how this would affect step 4, which is the water breaking down into hydrogen and oxygen. Since the formation of carbonic acid could increase due to faster erosion, there is a possibility that more water would be involved in this process. This would lead to more water breaking down into hydrogen and oxygen. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of faster erosion would lead to: 1. More acid being formed (in step 2). 2. A higher chance of more water breaking down into hydrogen and oxygen (in step 4) as a result of the increased acid formation. Therefore, the answer is \\"more effect\\" on the second effect mentioned (step 4), due to the increased acid formation caused by faster erosion."},{"instruction":"Concepts: audience, caress, leader Write a sentence that includes all these words.","output":"A leader is a person in charge, like a mom or dad; they gathered their audience, which are people who are listening, like when you tell a story, and then gave them a gentle caress, which is a soft touch or hug to show love and care."},{"instruction":"Background: Dev was born Dharam Dev Anand on 26 September 1923 in the Shakargarh tehsil of the Gurdaspur district in Punjab (British India). His father Pishori Lal Anand was a well-to-do advocate in Gurdaspur District Court. Dev was the third of four sons born to Anand. One of Dev's younger sisters is Sheel Kanta Kapur, who is the mother of film director Shekhar Kapur. Context: In the sixties, Dev Anand acquired a romantic image with films such as Manzil and Tere Ghar Ke Samne with Nutan, Kinaare Kinaare with Meena Kumari, Maya with Mala Sinha, Asli-Naqli with Sadhana Shivdasani, Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai, Mahal with Asha Parekh and Teen Deviyaan opposite three heroines Kalpana, Simi Garewal and Nanda. In the film Teen Deviyaan, Dev Anand played a playboy. His first colour film, Guide with Waheeda Rehman was based on the novel of the same name by R. K. Narayan. Dev Anand himself was the impetus for making the film version of the book. He met and persuaded Narayan to give his assent to the project. Dev Anand tapped his friends in Hollywood to launch an Indo-US co-production that was shot in Hindi and English simultaneously and was released in 1965. Guide, directed by younger brother Vijay Anand, was an acclaimed movie. Dev played Raju, a voluble guide, who supports Rosy (Waheeda) in her bid for freedom. He is not above thoughtlessly exploiting her for personal gains. Combining style with substance, he gave an affecting performance as a man grappling with his emotions in his passage through love, shame and salvation. He reunited with Vijay Anand for the movie Jewel Thief, based on the thriller genre which featured Vyjayanthimala, Tanuja, Anju Mahendru, Faryal and Helen and was very successful. Their next collaboration, Johny Mera Naam (1970), again a thriller, in which Dev was paired opposite Hema Malini was a big hit. It was Johnny Mera Naam which made Hema Malini a big star. In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival. Question: Did the film do well for him? Answer:","output":"Yes, the film \\"Johny Mera Naam\\" did well for Dev Anand. The film was a big hit and was successful.

The bacterial growth vegetated along.","output":"The term \\"vegetate\\" does carry a connection in meaning for both sentences, but there are distinctions in how it is used and the specific meanings it conveys in each context. In the first sentence, \\"The fields vegetate vigorously,\\" the term “vegetate” is used to describe the growth and flourishing of plants or crops in the fields. This usage is more aligned with the original definition of vegetate, which involves plant life growing and developing in a healthy manner. In this context, \\"vegetate\\" communicates the idea that the fields are teeming with life, plants are thriving, and there is a sense of strong, robust growth. In the second sentence, \\"The bacterial growth vegetated along,\\" the term \\"vegetate\\" takes on a different nuance of meaning. Here, the word is utilized to describe the growth and expansion of bacterial colonies or populations. Although \\"vegetate\\" still conveys growth, its connection to plant life is less prominent in this sentence, and the emphasis is more on general growth processes. In this context, \\"vegetate\\" primarily indicates that the bacteria are growing, reproducing, and spreading. So while there is an overlap in the basic concept of growth and development in both sentences, the specific meaning and application of \\"vegetate\\" varies depending on the context. In the first sentence, it is about the thriving and flourishing of plant life, whereas in the second, the focus is on the reproduction and expansion of bacterial growth.

Years later, during her final illness, mother kept different things for my sister and brother. \\"But the desk,\\" she said again \\" is for Elizabeth.\\"[:Zxxk.Com] I never saw her angry, never saw her cry.

I wrote to her in careful words and asked her to let me know in any way she chose that she did forgive me. My hope turned to disappointment, then little interest and, finally, peace-it seemed that nothing happened. I couldn't be sure that the letter had even got to mother. I only knew that I had written it, and I could stop trying to make her into someone she was not. But the present of her desk told me, as she'd never been able to, that she was pleased that writing was my chosen work.

At any given moment, the world's oldest person could be someone new, as individuals pass away and others continue to age. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question without recognizing the transient nature of the title. As of the time of this response, the world's oldest living person is Kane Tanaka, a Japanese woman who was born on January 2, 1903. She has been recognized by the Guinness World Records for this distinction, attaining her status as the world's oldest person upon the passing of her predecessor. However, it is important to emphasize that this title may be reattributed in the future, as other individuals continue to age and inevitably surpass Kane Tanaka in terms of chronological seniority. Regarding the proposed answer of \\"This is a list of tables of the verified oldest people in the world in ordinal rank, such as oldest person or oldest man,\\" it is essential to note that this statement does not directly answer the question. Rather, it alludes to a resource (or series of resources) that could potentially provide the desired information. It is more suitable as an introduction to such a list, but would not independently suffice as an adequate answer.

To find out the number of red apples, we can calculate 50% of 20: 20 * 50% = 20 * 0.5 = 10 red apples Finally, to find the total number of red apples, we just need to combine the red apples from both trees: 8 red apples (tree 1) + 10 red apples (tree 2) = 18 red apples So, Brogan gets a total of 18 red apples from the two trees."},{"instruction":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Don'tinvitethose,whowrotevariousmutantsand,lookingatthem,theimpression,theyhavejustsqueezedoutazitornipthesexualorgan.","output":"Don't invite those who wrote about various mutants, and, looking at them, one can't help but get the impression that they have just squeezed out a zit or nipped the sexual organ."},{"instruction":"What is the solution?

Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’.

This incident highlights the escalating tensions in the region and has prompted concerns among safety and security experts. This article examines the details and possible implications of this tragic event as well as the impact it may have on the fragile relations between China and Laos. The Incident The unfortunate event took place near the Lao-Vietnamese border, a popular destination among Chinese tourists. According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, the attack unfolded when a group of Chinese citizens traveling in a minibus were targeted in an explosion. A preliminary investigation by local authorities in Laos suggests that the bomb was planted along the roadside and was remotely detonated. The victims of the attack have been identified as Chinese nationals, highlighting potential motivations for this crime. The injured individual was transported to a nearby clinic, where they received emergency medical treatment. Their condition is stable but remains under observation. Reaction and Impact on China-Laos Relations The Chinese government has expressed concern over the safety of Chinese nationals living and traveling in Laos. Officials from both the Chinese embassy in Laos and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have called for a thorough investigation into the attack and requested full cooperation from the Lao authorities. This call for action underscores the significance of the incident and its potential ramifications on China’s ties with Laos, a country heavily dependent on China for investment and infrastructure support. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its spokesperson, urged the Laotian government to take effective measures to ensure the security of Chinese citizens and their assets in the country. While there have not been any explicit accusations against the Lao government, it goes without saying that failure to act could strain the China-Laos relationship. The Lao government has condemned the attack and extended its condolences to the Chinese government and the families of the victims. Laos authorities have assured China of their full cooperation with the investigation, in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. Possible Motives The motive behind the suspected bomb attack remains unclear, as no group has claimed responsibility so far. However, some speculations exist that conflict or disagreements arising from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments could have played a role in the incident. Laos is a key partner of China's BRI projects in Southeast Asia, primarily in terms of infrastructure development. Consequently, there are concerns that local unrest or dissatisfaction could have spurred this attack to undermine China's position in Laos. Additionally, ethnic and political tensions continue to exist in the border regions of Laos, which is further exemplified by a history of sporadic violence. This situation could contribute to the involvement of a group or groups with specific local grievances, aiming to send a message either to China or the Lao government. Conclusion The recent suspected bomb attack that claimed the lives of two Chinese citizens and injured another puts further strain on the relations between China and Laos. While the motive behind the attack remains unclear, it has succeeded in conveying an alarming message prompting both governments to act urgently to ensure the security of Chinese nationals in Laos. As the investigation progresses, it is crucial for China and Laos to cooperate closely in order to identify the perpetrators and maintain the delicate balance in their relations. This incident is a reminder that regional security tensions require constant vigilance by all relevant stakeholders."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given this review: \\"Good service\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Long, known as \\"Uncle Earl\\", connected with voters through his folksy demeanor and colorful oratory. He departed from other southern politicians of his time by promoting a progressive agenda, including expanding school lunch programs, teacher pay, public works projects, and minority voting rights. His sometimes erratic behavior - including a liaison with New Orleans stripper Blaze Starr - did not affect his electoral success. The colorful \\"Uncle Earl\\" (so-named because of his relatives, including nephew and U.S. Senator Russell Long) once joked that one day the people of Louisiana would elect \\"good government, and they won't like it!\\" But, beneath his public persona as a simple, plain-spoken rural Louisianan of little education, he had an astute political mind of considerable intelligence. Earl Long was a master campaigner, who attracted large crowds when his caravan crisscrossed the state. He would not allow a local person to introduce him or his ticket mates at a rally. Only out-of-parish people could do the honor. Long reasoned that nearly any local person would have made some political enemies who might reject Earl Long just because that person's \\"enemy\\" was pro-Long. Long was determined to get every vote possible and so tried to remain independent of local rivalries. Both Earl Long and his brother Huey had grown close to Earl Williamson, a local politician in Caddo Parish. Williamson's son, Don W. Williamson, later recalled Earl Long coming into their town of Vivian and picking up his father to join the Long entourage for a trip to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where they enjoyed buttermilk drinking and horse racing as well as illicit attractions in the resort city. Long demanded absolute loyalty among his inner circle, often saying that he did not need them to back him when he was right but when he was wrong.

The primary goal of this law was to address the issue of runaway slaves by requiring their return to their owners in the South. It was one of the most controversial acts of the 1850 compromise and indeed heightened Northern fears of a \\"slave power conspiracy.\\" The Compromise of 1850 was a set of five bills that aimed to resolve the sectional conflict between the Northern and Southern states. This conflict had arisen in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War, as new territories were acquired, and disputes arose over their status as slave or free states. The Fugitive Slave Act was enacted as one of the five component bills of the Compromise to address this matter. The Fugitive Slave Act made it a federal offense for individuals to assist or harbor escaped slaves, and it mandated that state and federal officials aid in the capture and return of these slaves to their owners. In addition, the law provided for the use of federal commissioners to adjudicate claims of fugitive slaves, without the right of these alleged escapees to a trial by jury or the presentation of any evidence on their own behalf. The Northern states, which were generally opposed to slavery, found the Fugitive Slave Act particularly onerous. Abolitionists, including groups such as the Underground Railroad, had long been assisting slaves in their escape and relocation to the free states or Canada, and this law effectively forced them to violate their moral convictions in order to avoid prosecution. This situation only served to further polarize the country, leading to an increase in tension between the North and the South. In this context, it is entirely reasonable to say that the Fugitive Slave Act was one of the most controversial acts of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a \\"slave power conspiracy.\\" The passage of the law, as well as its subsequent enforcement, generated widespread uproar in the North and fueled a growing divide between the two regions, which would eventually contribute to the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"• consulted (e.g., interviews, focus groups, emails) with Initiative partner representatives (N= 54).\\" to French?","output":"Dans cette phrase, l'auteur indique que diverses méthodes de consultation, telles que des entrevues, des groupes de discussion et des courriels, ont été utilisées pour interagir avec les représentants des partenaires de l'Initiative, avec un nombre total de participants égal à 54.

A:","output":"Title: \\"A Disappointing Experience - 1/5 Stars\\" As a long-time avid reader, I was excited to try out the at.tomtasche.reader app. However, despite its promising premise, it turned out to be one monumental blunder rather than functional utility. The following points elucidate why I'm leaving a 1-star rating: 1. User Interface and Navigation: The primary letdown was the app's user interface and navigation. The layout was confusing, with various buttons congested on the screen without proper labeling. I struggled to find basic options like \\"Open File\\" and \\"Search.\\" The color scheme and font choices were anything but appealing, making the reading experience aesthetically displeasing. 2. File Compatibility and Handling: As someone with a diverse e-library, I was sorely disappointed to discover that the app only supports PDF files. In this era, an e-reader should be capable of opening multiple file formats like EPUB, MOBI, and even DOCX. Additionally, the app struggled to read large files and constantly crashed on numerous instances. 3. Performance and Stability: The at.tomtasche.reader app was nowhere near what I'd hoped it would be in terms of performance. Pages took an unbearably long time to load, and scrolling was far from smooth. Frequent crashes during usage heightened my frustration, leading me to question whether it was even optimized for devices or not. 4. Lack of Features: This e-reader lacks essential features that are standard on competitor apps. There's no option to adjust font size or type, nor can users modify the background color for a more comfortable reading experience. Even basic functionalities like bookmarking and searching are either unavailable or too hard to find. 5. Customer Support and Updates: After facing numerous problems with this app, I tried reaching out to customer support expecting prompt assistance. Alas, my queries remained unanswered for an unreasonably long time. It is apparent that customer satisfaction isn't high on their list of priorities. The app has also not received updates to address existing issues, which only solidifies my discontentment. Ultimately, my experience with at.tomtasche.reader was an exasperating one. It's apparent that the development team lacks effort and intention to create an enjoyable, functional e-reader app. With so many competitors in the market, it's hard to justify using this app, let alone recommending it to others.

The Ozarks in Missouri, and the more massive and younger Colorado Rockies. He loved both ranges, but liked the caves systems and blue holes in the Ozarks a bit more. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which mountains have a larger percent of sedimentary rock? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Ozarks have a larger percent of sedimentary rock. The Ozarks, also known as the Ozark Mountains, are primarily located in Missouri, but also extend into Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Contrary to the Colorado Rockies, the Ozarks are an ancient mountain range with a geological history that dates back approximately 500 million years. This mountain range consists mainly of sedimentary rock, including limestone, dolomite, sandstone, and shale. These rocks were formed from the accumulation of sediments in ancient seas that once covered the region. The Ozarks' caves and blue hole systems that Peter enjoyed are the result of water erosion of these sedimentary rocks over millions of years, especially the dissolution of soluble rock, such as limestone. On the other hand, the Colorado Rockies, a segment of the larger Rocky Mountains, are primarily located in Colorado but extend into neighboring states, such as Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, and Utah. This mountain range is relatively younger, with its formation dating back around 80 million years. The Rockies consist mainly of igneous and metamorphic rocks that were uplifted during the Laramide orogeny, a tectonic event when the Earth's crust was compressed and thickened, causing the formation of mountain ranges. While sedimentary rocks can also be found in the Colorado Rockies, they are not as prevalent as they are in the Ozarks.

Little does she know that her close friend, Jimmy Haynes, is her informant, and holds secrets that could shake the very foundation of the city. The story begins with a grisly murder in a dark alley in the heart of the city. The victim has obvious ties to The Umbra, but nobody seems to have any information about their activities. Nicole, determined to expose the truth, begins her investigation. Her search for reliable information proves fruitless until she starts receiving anonymous tips on her personal phone. The informant, Jimmy, is revealed to be a childhood friend, who eventually developed a double life as a master hacker working with The Umbra. Feeling guilty, he decides to share insider information with Nicole, to save his city from devastation. Nicole, growing increasingly skeptical of the unknown identity of her informant, continues her investigation while unknowingly getting closer to unveiling the identity of her own trusted confidante. As their bond strengthens, Nicole and Jimmy face numerous dilemmas as she closes in on not only The Umbra but also the truth of her informant's identity. Confronted with the potential betrayal of a close friend, Nicole must weigh the value of her friendship against the need for justice for the victims of The Umbra's crimes. The climax of the story occurs when it is revealed that The Umbra's leader, a powerful and influential figure in the city, plans to bring chaos to the metropolis in a finale to their hidden reign of terror. With time running out, Jimmy must make a life-altering decision: reveal his secret to Nicole, and risk both their lives to bring down The Umbra, or forever live with the consequences of his actions. Together, Nicole and Jimmy, cornered by The Umbra's henchmen, face off against the syndicate, risking their lives to save their city and put an end to The Umbra's reign of terror once and for all.

Dreams are like stars .. you may never touch them but if you follow them they will lead you to your destiny. ||||| The four-minute video in Korean and English was credited to Destiny Pictures, but owner of firm with same name said he had ‘no involvement’ The National Security Council has said that it made the video Donald Trump showed to Kim Jong-un at their Singapore summit on Tuesday in an unorthodox effort to persuade him of the benefits of denuclearisation. The four-minute video in Korean and English was made in the style of an extended action movie trailer and portrayed Kim and Trump as men of destiny with the future of the world in their hands. The video, which Trump showed to the press after playing it on an iPad for Kim, is credited to “Destiny Pictures Productions”, prompting a flurry of press inquiries to a film production company of that name in California. 'The bromance of the century': Trump's bizarre trailer for his summit with Kim | Peter Bradshaw Read more Mark Castaldo, the company’s founder, said in an email it had “no involvement in the video”. “Woke up to 100’s of e-mails and calls from all over the world. Crazy” Castaldo said in a tweet, adding that he was trying to find out “why they used my company name”. Garrett Marquis, an NSC spokesman said in a statement: “The video was created by the National Security Council to help the president demonstrate the benefits of complete denuclearization, and a vision of a peaceful and prosperous Korean peninsula.” When asked about the decision to present the video as made by a non-existent company, an NSC spokesman said there would be no further comment. “From my understanding, they were just using ‘Destiny Pictures’ as a play on words. It just so happens there’s a studio by that name in California,” said Ned Price, a former NSC spokesman. “Leave it to this White House to fail to conduct basic due diligence. And that, of course, leaves aside the fact they thought it prudent to try to out-North-Korea North Korea in the propaganda department. “The whole enterprise reeks of amateurism and comes off as an attempt to check the box on a harebrained idea that presumably originated in the oval office,” Price added. The video shows the possibilities of North Korea’s future if it renounces nuclear weapons, with a rapid succession of colourful images of advanced technology and happy people. It contrasted that with an alternative reality in which the regime stayed on course with the development of its arsenal. That future was shown in grainy black and white images of US warplanes in the air and missiles launching. The choice between the two scenarios was Kim’s, the film implied. “A story about a special moment in time. When a man is presented with one chance that may never be repeated,” the narrator says. When asked about the film at a press conference on Tuesday, Trump defended it as a masterstroke which he had sprung on Kim and his entourage. “We had it made up,” the president said. “I showed it to them today. Actually during the meeting. Toward the end of the meeting. I think he loved it. “We had it on cassette. An iPad,” Trump said. “They played it. About eight of their representatives were watching it. I thought they were fascinated by it. I thought it was well done. I showed it to you because that is the future.” ||||| White House Just when you thought things couldn’t get any weirder, President Donald Trump today released a video about the future of U.S.-Korean relations that looks like a cross between a Michael Bay movie and a corporate infomercial. “It is cod spiritual gibberish,” wrote a columnist with the British newspaper, The Spectator, “But clearly, in some peculiar way, it works.” As cheesy as the video is, it’s precisely the vision of a high-energy planet that poor nations generally, and North Korea particularly, need right now. The video draws a striking contrast between the current, low-energy North Korea, and a future high-energy one. For decades, anti-nuclear environmentalists have insisted that there aren’t enough resources for all humans to live prosperous lives, while pro-nuclear environmentalists have pointed out that nuclear power allows for universal prosperity and a shrinking of humankind’s environmental footprint. Trump’s video clearly embraces the high-energy vision, even referencing population challenges. “Seven billion people inhabit planet Earth,” says the narrator over scenes of population-dense cities. The video presents a positive vision of all the things nuclear energy can power: an abundant grocery store; speedboats; incubators for babies; skyscrapers along a beach; robots in factories; and people being scanned inside of MRIs. ||||| “And I explained, I said, ‘You know, instead of doing that, you could have the best hotels in the world right there.’ Think of it from a real estate perspective.” Mark McKinnon, a seasoned political ad maker who ran media for President George W. Bush’s campaigns, said the video was “obviously quite shlocky” for a broader audience, but could be effective in influencing its intended target. “At bottom, it’s very good storytelling — something obviously Trump understands,” Mr. McKinnon said. Citing the former governor of Texas ousted by Mr. Bush, he added: “Ann Richards used to say, ‘Dumb it down so my mama can understand it.’ Or you know, so a foreign dictator can. Over all, a pretty creative and clever move.” But veteran diplomats and foreign policy scholars were warier. “I was speechless when I first saw it,” said Alexander R. Vershbow, who served as ambassador to South Korea under Mr. Bush. “Pure Trump with Hollywood production values, showing what Kim Jong-un and North Korea would be like if they make the fateful choice to trade in their nukes for economic prosperity.” Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korean studies professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, was even less impressed, calling it “eerily reminiscent of second-rate South Korean government promotional videos.” In fact, although the White House said it was made by the National Security Council, he said he instinctively suspected the South Koreans might have created it and gave it to Mr. Trump. “Will it have any impact?” he asked. “Most likely, this patronizing act will give Kim a good laugh. It may also irritate and, paradoxically, reassure him at the same time — in the knowledge that his two adversaries are utterly clueless.” Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said he thought it would fall flat. “I was gobsmacked by it,” he said. “It seems unlikely that a man who ruthlessly ordered the murder of his half brother with a nerve agent is likely to be beguiled by a film trailer and decide to abandon the nuclear-armed missiles that are a centerpiece of his propaganda.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"So, WARCZone is like a big box where people put special files called WARCs, which help save parts of the internet.

Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario?","output":"Thomson"},{"instruction":"Title: Mariah is a cash cow.

Their career launched in 1991 when they auditioned for the film The Commitments in which Andrea gained a speaking role as Sharon Rabbitte. John Hughes noticed the quartet when they auditioned for the movie, and agreed to become their manager. The Corrs signed with Atlantic Records in 1995 and travelled to North America to record their debut album Forgiven, Not Forgotten. The album featured six instrumental selections among its Celtic-influenced tracks. When released, it was successful in Ireland, Australia, Japan, and Spain. The album reached platinum status in the United Kingdom and Australia, and quadruple platinum in Ireland, which made it one of the most popular debuts by an Irish group. Following on from the success of their debut album, they released Talk on Corners and In Blue in 1997 and 2000 respectively. Originally Talk on Corners met with lukewarm success, until a remix version was released, when it topped the charts in many countries, and reached platinum status in the United Kingdom and Australia. In Blue moved towards mainstream pop, placing heavy emphasis on electronic synthesisers. It was successful, and was No. 1 in its first sales week in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria and debuted at No. 2 in France and Norway. It climbed to the top position during its second week in Sweden and Spain. During the production of In Blue, their mother, Jean, died while waiting for a lung transplant in the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, Britain. She was laid to rest at St. Patrick's cemetery in Dundalk. Bono, Larry Mullen, Brian Kennedy and Paul Brady were among the attendees. \\"No More Cry\\", written by Andrea and Caroline Corr for the album, was dedicated to their father hoping to help with his grief. In 2003, Andrea recorded \\"Time Enough For Tears\\", a song written by Bono and Gavin Friday for the film In America. This track was featured on The Corrs' 2004 album Borrowed Heaven. Borrowed Heaven was dedicated to their late mother, Jean, and their father, Gerry. The band also dedicated their 2005 tribute album Home to their deceased mother. The band covered many traditional Irish songs taken from their mother's songbook to commemorate their 15 years as a band. In an interview with Chris Evans in June 2015, Andrea confirmed that The Corrs were working on a new album and would play the BBC Radio 2 'Live in Hyde Park' festival.

Arriving early at the party, Angelica immediately attempts to acquire ecstasy and suspects an attendee named Swan (Stallone) is carrying the drug. When asked about it, Swan informs the two girls that he doesn't have any ecstasy on him, but he has it in a nearby cabin, where his friends live. He requests that Emily and Angelica come to the cabin with him and meet his friends; the two comply. Unbeknownst to the girls, Swan's friends are actually his father Chaos (Gage), a notorious and wanted criminal and his father's gang, which consists of Chaos' girlfriend Daisy (Quann) and felon Frankie (Wozniak).

He finds Ned in his home in front of the TV, still holding the ticket in his hand, a smile on his face and dead from shock.

Earlier this week, a 13-year-old kid named Coreco JaQuan Pearson sat down in front of a camera in the kitchen of his home in Grovetown, Ga. CJ had a lot on his mind: the 14-year-old Muslim student invited to the White House after he was wrongly arrested for building a clock thought to be a bomb; the young woman allegedly shot by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco; the four Marines gunned down in Chattanooga over the summer; the Black Lives Matter movement. President Obama, CJ feared, didn’t have his White House in order. It was a lot to distill into a short message — one that would catch fire among CJ’s 35,000 Twitter followers and large YouTube audience. But CJ was determined to make this quick — and needed little more than two minutes to make his point. “Mr. President,” he began, speaking with a Southern twang. “When Kate Steinle was gunned down by an illegal immigrant, you didn’t do anything. You didn’t even call the family. You didn’t invite them to the White House. Is that okay? I don’t think so, Mr. President.” Twenty seconds had gone by — but CJ was just getting warmed up. “When cops are being gunned down, you don’t invite their family to the White House,” he said. “You never did.” This was just the set-up. Then came the punch. “When a Muslim kid builds a clock?” CJ said. “Well, come on by. What is this world that you are living in?” As smoothly as a seasoned commentator three or four times his age, CJ then pivoted. He pointed out that it took Obama longer to lower the White House flags to half-staff than it did to light 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. with rainbow colors after the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage. He blamed Obama for the immigration policies that allowed Steinle’s killer in the country. He blamed Obama for rules that prevented Marines from carrying their own firearms in Chattanooga. He said Obama was trying to appease “domestic terrorists” — that is, Black Lives Matters protesters. “Mr. President, what are your priorities here?” he said. “Because in all honesty, I think you’re being ignorant, I think you’re incompetent, and I don’t think you understand reality.” CJ’s conclusion: “You don’t get invited to the White House for building a clock.” As is probably apparent, CJ is not the average teenager. He is not the average YouTube sensation. And he is not the average conservative. He’s just a really passionate young man who really thinks that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex) should be president. And, of course, CJ is African American — indeed, the national chairman of Teens for Ted, a national group backing a candidate who enjoys only marginal support among black voters. “I strongly believe that Senator Cruz is truly what America needs to make America the shining city on a hill it once was,” CJ wrote in an e-mail to The Washington Post, saying Cruz would challenge the “Washington cartel.” “To allude to the Hunger Games, he’s the face of the rebellion. Being a teenager, I am definitely a big fan of that haha!” CJ’s video missives have had him in the news at least since he was 12. He said he was suspended from Facebook after making another video critical of Obama. (Facebook said children under 13 are not permitted to have accounts, which CJ called “complete malarkey.”) And earlier this year, he reportedly sued a liberal activist he claimed threatened him. “The Internet allows really anyone to have a voice and build a following, and CJ is a great example,” Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler told the Dallas Morning News. “He can make a real difference. He’s kind of the model that we want others to follow.” CJ lives in Grovetown with his grandparents — though he says his parents are “actively involved.” His grandfather, he said, is a retired First Sergeant of the Army who works at the Department of Energy. Coming from a military family is what inspired CJ to go into politics in the first place. This was in 2008, when he was in second grade. “Senator McCain’s life story resonated with me and I was honored to support a man who was willing to give it all up, including his life, while serving his country in the Vietnam War,” he wrote. CJ pointed YouTube rants against, among many other targets, gun control, Hillary Clinton and George Takei, are issued when he’s not doing time in the eighth grade at Columbia Middle School. He wasn’t the only one on the right criticizing the invite Obama extended to clock-maker Ahmed Mohamed. Bristol Palin, for example, got in on the act. So did Pamela Geller — she of the “prophet Muhammad cartoon contest.” “This whole thing smells like a setup,” Geller wrote at Breitbart. “With ISIS in America, and young moderate Muslims fleeing to Syria to join the terror group, the response of MacArthur High School officials was rational and reasonable.” Ahmed Mohamed, the Texas teenager who was arrested when his homemade clock was mistaken for a bomb, thanked his supporters during a news conference on Wednesday. Since his arrest, Mohamed has received a personal invitation from President Obama to attend an astronomy night at the White House. (Reuters) But CJ was perhaps the youngest to criticize Obama’s invitation — and almost certainly the only one who appeared on Fox News before he was a teenager. “I think I’m one of the few voices who has taken such a public stand condemning this decision, but I do believe many people agree with the sentiment I expressed in my video,” Pearson wrote. “Ahmed is being used as a political prop, and to be quite frank, it’s quite disgusting. It’s even more disgusting that he’s enjoying it.” This point raised an uncomfortable comparison. If Ahmed — a young man of color embraced by the White House for its own reasons — is a political prop, isn’t CJ? “Not at all,” CJ wrote. “At the end of the day, I’m not beholden to the Republican Party. They don’t own me and they never will. My political involvement is based on fighting for the conservative principles I believe in and fighting for the future of my generation.” He added: “I’m not in it for the fame. I’m not in it for the fortune. I’m involved in politics because I strongly believe my generation deserves a voice.”","output":"Title: \\"CJ Pearson: The Young Conservative Voice Calling Out Obama's Priorities in a Viral Video\\""},{"instruction":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer this complex question, we must first examine the historical figure Gerard Brantsen and identify which war was ended with the treaty he signed. Gerard Brantsen (1735-1809) was a Dutch diplomat and politician in the 18th-19th century. His most significant contribution was to the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which marked the end of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War was a conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, and commenced on December 20, 1780. The war was primarily driven by commercial rivalries and political tensions that emerged from the American Revolutionary War. At this time, the Dutch Republic, in an attempt to protect their trade interests, sought to provide military assistance and resources to the newly established United States of America. This support of the rebellious colonies angered Great Britain and consequently led to the escalation of hostilities between the two European powers. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, was signed on September 3, 1783. The negotiations brought together the major powers involved in the American Revolutionary War. Delegates from the United States, France, Spain, and the Dutch Republic were present to deliberate the terms for reestablishing diplomatic relations and resolving territorial disputes. Gerard Brantsen, acting as one of the Dutch envoys, played a significant role in the negotiation process.

Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Define the key terms First, we need to understand the key terms in the statement. \\"Angling\\" refers to a method of fishing, typically using a fishing rod with a line and hooks, which can be done for a variety of purposes. Recreational fishing refers to fishing for pleasure or relaxation, rather than for sustenance or commercial purposes. Step 2: Analyze the statement The statement claims that angling specifically describes recreational fishing, either on a boat or on land. We should verify if angling always refers to recreational fishing, or if it can also be associated with other types of fishing. Step 3: Research Upon researching the topic, we find that angling is most commonly associated with recreational fishing.

Pat Garrett, the new marshal, will try to catch the thief, as will bounty hunters after Frenger's reward offer of 3,000. McEwen is bitten by a rattlesnake before he can board a train, where he is helped by a couple of passengers, Monte Marquez, a gambler, and Fay Hollister, a nurse.

(CNN) -- This is the time of the year when everyone can channel their inner Dick Vitale. Just make sure not to startle your co-workers if you start yelling, \\"Awesome, baby!\\" Everyone in the entire country, starting on Selection Sunday when the NCAA Tournament brackets are revealed, becomes a college basketball expert. From President Obama to that annoying woman in accounting who lets her corgie make the picks (and still somehow wins the office pool), we're all about to pretend we know more about Cinderella than the prince himself. So if you're just now beginning to pay attention, here is an A-to-Z primer of what you're going to find in your brackets. If that doesn't seem like a long drought, consider: The","output":"last time a team with a losing record made it to the NCAA Tournament was back in 1999 when Florida A&M stunned the college basketball world. Since then, there have been numerous attempts for lesser-known programs (or Cinderellas, as they're often called) to defy the odds and make it to the Big Dance. This year promises to be no exception, as several potential dark horse contenders are poised to make their mark on the national stage. But amid all the Cinderella stories and bracket-busting upsets, there remains a certain level of predictability within the NCAA Tournament. Powerhouse programs such as Duke, Kentucky, and Kansas are perennial fixtures on the brackets, and their success often sets the pace for the rest of the field. However, part of the tournament's appeal lies in the fact that anything can happen once the first round begins, setting the stage for what has become one of the most exciting sporting events in the United States. One crucial aspect of filling out a winning bracket is to understand the mechanics of the seeding process. Teams are ranked from 1 to 16 within four different regions – East, West, Midwest, and South – depending on their performance during the regular season and conference tournaments. This seeding determines their matchups in the tournament. While the higher-ranked teams generally have better odds of advancing to later rounds, they must navigate through a minefield of potential upsets at the hands of lower-seeded squads that have nothing to lose. Often, it is these matchups that help form the enduring legends of the tournament, as fans and pundits alike revel in the unexpected triumphs of the underdog. Another crucial concept to grasp is that of the tournament's one-and-done nature. Unlike the professional leagues, there are no best-of-seven series in college basketball – each game is a single-elimination affair, meaning that one bad performance can spell the end of a team's season. This high-stakes atmosphere is what fuels the intensity and passion behind the NCAA Tournament, as both players and fans alike are all too aware of the fact that one wrong move or one unlucky bounce could send a championship contender packing. In summary, succeeding in your office pool or finding your inner Dick Vitale requires a blend of basketball knowledge, an understanding of the tournament structure, and a healthy dose of good fortune. It's important to pay attention to patterns and trends throughout the season to make educated guesses on which teams are poised to pull off an upset, but remember that no strategy is foolproof in the ever-unpredictable world of March Madness. As you prepare to fill out this year's bracket, take some time to learn about the participating teams and enjoy the stories they will inevitably bring to the tournament. Whether you choose to root for the underdog or stick to the safe and familiar path of backing the established powerhouses, the NCAA Tournament is a nearly month-long celebration of the very best that college basketball has to offer. And who knows – with a little luck and the right amount of bracket savvy, you may just find yourself atop the office pool standings and proudly proclaiming \\"Awesome, baby!\\" for all to hear."},{"instruction":"Is the following statement true? \\"Many areas in Puerto Rico struggled to rebuild following Hurricane Maria.\\" Let's think first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the statement. The statement focuses on the idea that \\"many areas in Puerto Rico struggled to rebuild following Hurricane Maria.\\" Step 2: Research Hurricane Maria. Hurricane Maria was a Category 5 hurricane that hit Puerto Rico in September 2017. It caused widespread destruction and was one of the worst natural disasters in the island's history. Step 3: Analyze the impact of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico. The hurricane caused massive damage to Puerto Rico's infrastructure, including the power grid, water supply, and telecommunication systems. Thousands of homes were destroyed, and many people lost their lives. Step 4: Assess the rebuilding efforts. After the hurricane, federal aid and local efforts were made to rebuild Puerto Rico. The island's government, along with non-governmental organizations, worked together to restore services, repair homes, and help affected communities. However, the rebuilding process has been slow and difficult for several reasons: - The scale of the damage was extensive, making it challenging to address all the needs quickly. - Limited resources and financial constraints hampered reconstruction efforts. - Some areas were isolated due to debris and damaged roads, making it difficult for aid to reach them. - The existing infrastructure in Puerto Rico was already weakened by years of fiscal crises and underinvestment. Step 5: Evaluate the statement. Based on the information gathered, we can conclude that the statement \\"Many areas in Puerto Rico struggled to rebuild following Hurricane Maria\\" is true. The widespread destruction caused by the hurricane, combined with the mentioned challenges, made the rebuilding process difficult for many areas in Puerto Rico."},{"instruction":"Consider the question.

Answer:","output":"Title: Echoes of The Past Genre: Action, Mystery, Drama Plot Summary: Lau, a struggling musician, tries to get his big break in the bustling city of Hong Kong. As he seeks to improve his sound, he stumbles upon Chan, an enigmatic man with a unique, mysterious audio system. As the two become entangled in a dangerous plot, Lau must unravel the secrets of the audio system and the mysterious organization in the background. ----- Act 1: Rising Beats We're introduced to Lau, a young, talented musician struggling to find his place in the Hong Kong music scene. Desperate for a powerful and crystal-clear sound, Lau hears of an underground audio technology that promises to elevate his performances to a new level. In a dimly lit bar, Lau meets Chan, a secretive man with a penchant for obscure, high-quality audio equipment. Lau is mesmerized by the sound produced by Chan's system—it's unlike anything he has ever heard. Eager to get his hands on the equipment, Lau proposes a deal. Chan agrees, but with a cryptic warning that Lau must not dig too deep into the origins of the technology. Act 2: Amplified Pursuit As Lau starts using the new audio system, he notices some unusual sounds hidden beneath the music—a series of encoded messages woven through the tracks. Driven by curiosity, Lau decides to go against Chan's warning, and investigates the source of the messages. His search leads him to a secretive organization known as the Sonic Order, which uses music and advanced technology for mysterious purposes. In his quest for answers, Lau befriends Lily, a former member of the organization, who reveals that the Sonic Order is involved in illegal activities such as cyber-espionage, mind manipulation, and hidden communication. With the audio system being the key to their operations, Chan, a high-ranking member of the Sonic Order, was entrusted with its sale to fund their expansion. Act 3: Reverberation of Consequences The Sonic Order realizes that Lau is aware of their secrets and sends their agents to recover the audio system and silence Lau and Lily. In a series of intense encounters, Lau and Lily fight against the agents and try to dismantle the organization from the inside. As the conflict reaches its peak, Lau confronts Chan once more, who tells him that the Sonic Order is actually trying to prevent an even bigger threat that could harm millions of people.

Moments later, Henry is helped by an older version of himself who has also traveled back. Unable to control the timing or destinations of his traveling, Henry finds himself drawn to significant people, places, and events in his life but is incapable of changing events beyond the minor differences his presence creates. In 1991, Henry meets Clare Abshire in the library where he works. She is overjoyed to see him although he is actually meeting her for the first time. Clare explains that she met Henry's future self when she was a child, and that he informed her then that they would meet in the future, which is happening at the moment. Since childhood, Henry has been Clare's best friend and visited her. Clare develops a crush with Henry, and she is upset after learning that he is married. When Clare turned 18, which is two years before their meeting at the library, the older Henry kissed Clare, leading her to realize that he is romantically involved with her and thus is her husband in the future. They begin a relationship, which is challenged by Henry's disorder. His sporadic time traveling is further complicated by the fact that he arrives at his destination completely naked. From an early age, he learned how to pick locks and to steal clothing to endure his travels. Among his getaways are many visits to young Clare. From present-day Clare's diary, he gets a list of dates when he visited her, and gives those to young Clare so that she can be waiting for him with clothes. Falling in love, Henry and Clare eventually marry, though he actually time travels away before the ceremony and an older version of himself arrives in time to step in, though his altered appearance confuses guests. Henry's disappearances allow him to win the lottery by having the numbers in advance, but his disorder takes a toll on his relationship with Clare. It also makes having a child with Clare...

I was visiting one of my clients, when, suddenly, out of the bushes, two snarling dogs attacked me. They weren’t necessarily mad, as in crazy, but they were very angry. They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet. Fortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me. I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits. As I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me. When she saw me hitting her dogs with a stick, she called the dogs off of me. I asked her why her dogs attacked me, and why she laughed at me. She said that she had just given her dogs a big steak bone and they were upset when I came near and attacked me. I asked her why she would set me up in this way when she knew I was on the way over. She admitted that she wanted to see what happened, and she said that when she saw what happened she thought that it was funny. I did not keep the appointment with her. My trousers were torn, and my ankles, legs, and hands were bleeding. I told her that I would not be back, and left. Later that night, her husband called to apologize on her behalf.

Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation -93*m and 266*m are like terms, so we add them together: (-93 + 266) * m + 16325 = -480*m 173 * m + 16325 = -480 * m Step 2: Move the terms with m to one side of the equation and constants to the other side Now, we want to move the -480*m term to the left side of the equation. To do this, we can add 480*m to both sides of the equation: 173*m + 480*m + 16325 = -480*m + 480*m 653*m + 16325 = 0 Step 3: Move the constant term to the right side We want to isolate the m term, so we need to move the constant term 16325 to the right side of the equation. We can accomplish this by subtracting 16325 from both sides of the equation: 653*m + 16325 - 16325 = 0 -16325 653*m = -16325 Step 4: Solve for m Now, we have an equation with only one term containing m.

It was so named by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey , following their survey of 1948 -- 49 , because of the continuous avalanches from the hanging glaciers above the corrie . - Coronation Island is the largest of the South Orkney Islands, long and from wide. The island extends in a general east-west direction, is mainly ice-covered and comprises numerous bays, glaciers and peaks, the highest rising to . - The South Orkney Islands are a group of islands in the Southern Ocean, about north-east of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. They have a total area of about . The islands are claimed both by Britain (as part of the British Antarctic Territory since 1962, previously as a Falkland Islands Dependency), and by Argentina as part of Argentine Antarctica. Under the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, sovereignty claims are held in abeyance. - Snowpack forms from layers of snow that accumulate in geographic regions and high altitudes where the climate includes cold weather for extended periods during the year. Snowpacks are an important water resource that feed streams and rivers as they melt. Therefore, snowpacks are both the drinking water source for many communities and a potential source of flooding (in case of sudden melting). Snowpacks also contribute mass to glaciers in their accumulation zone. - In fluid dynamics, a gravity current is a primarily horizontal flow in a gravitational field that is driven by a density difference, hence gravity currents also sometimes being referred to as \\"density currents\\". When a gravity current propagates along a plane of neutral buoyancy within a stratified ambient fluid, it is known as a Gravity Current Intrusion. Typically, the density difference is small enough for the Boussinesq approximation to be valid. Gravity currents can be either finite in volume, such as the release from a dam break, or continuously supplied from a source, such as in doorway or lava flows. - An amphitheatre or amphitheater is an open-air venue used for entertainment, performances, and sports. The term derives from the ancient Greek (\\"amphitheatron\\"), from (\\"amphi\\"), meaning \\"on both sides\\" or \\"around\\" and (\\"thétron\\"), meaning \\"place for viewing\\". - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. - The Antarctic Peninsula is the northernmost part of the mainland of Antarctica, located at the base of the Southern Hemisphere. At the surface, it is the biggest, most prominent peninsula in Antarctica as it extends from a line between Cape Adams (Weddell Sea) and a point on the mainland south of Eklund Islands. Beneath the ice sheet which covers it, the Antarctic Peninsula consists of a string of bedrock islands; these are separated by deep channels whose bottoms lie at depths considerably below current sea level. They are joined together by a grounded ice sheet. Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of South America, lies only about away across the Drake Passage. - In earth science, erosion is the action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that remove soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust, then transport it away to another location. The particulate breakdown of rock or soil into clastic sediment is referred to as \\"physical\\" or \\"mechanical\\" erosion; this contrasts with \\"chemical\\" erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by its dissolving into a solvent (typically water), followed by the flow away of that solution. Eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres, or for thousands of kilometres. - The British Antarctic Territory (BAT) is a sector of Antarctica claimed by the United Kingdom as one of its 14 British Overseas Territories, and is the largest. It comprises the region south of 60°S latitude and between longitudes and , forming a wedge shape that extends to the South Pole, overlapping the Antarctic claims of Argentina (Argentine Antarctica) and Chile (Chilean Antarctic Territory). - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it. - A cauldron (or caldron) is a large metal pot (kettle) for cooking and/or boiling over an open fire, with a large mouth and frequently with an arc-shaped hanger. - The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters. - An avalanche (also called a snowslide or snowslip) is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of gravity current. - Argentine Antarctica is a sector of Antarctica claimed by Argentina as part of its national territory consisting of the Antarctic Peninsula and a triangular section extending to the South Pole, delimited by the 25° West and 74° West meridians and the 60° South parallel. This region overlaps with British and Chilean claims in Antarctica; however, all claims are suspended by the Antarctic Treaty System, of which Argentina is a founding signatory and permanent consulting member, with the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat being based in Buenos Aires. - Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain. Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall. - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - Fluvial is a term used in geography and geology to refer to the processes associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. When the stream or rivers are associated with glaciers, ice sheets, or ice caps, the term glaciofluvial or fluvioglacial is used. - A cirque (French, from the Latin word \\"circus\\") is an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion. Alternative names for this landform are corrie (from Scottish Gaelic \\"coire\\" meaning a pot or cauldron) and cwm (Welsh for \\"valley\\", pronounced \\"coom\\"). A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion. What is the relationship between 'avalanche corrie' and 'landform'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Avalanche Corrie is a specific type of landform. It is an ice-filled cirque, or corrie, located near the south coast of Coronation Island in the South Orkney Islands. This landform got its name due to the continuous avalanches from the hanging glaciers above the corrie. A landform, in general, refers to any natural feature on the Earth's surface, such as mountains, valleys, or plateaus. In this case, the Avalanche Corrie is a landform shaped primarily by glacial erosion and the continuous avalanches it experiences."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Article: In England, traffic keeps on the left.Cars, buses and bikes all move on the left side of the road.But the traffic keeps on the right in China.So when you are in England, you must be very careful in the street.Before you cross a street you must stop and look both ways.Look right and look left and look right again.If the traffic lights are red, the traffic must stop.Then the people on foot can cross the road.If the traffic lights are green, the traffic can go.People on foot mustn't cross.

It frustrated Randy that Joel would oversleep so often but","output":"it was a situation that he'd come to accept after months of dealing with his roommate's tardiness. They had been friends since grade school, and despite the flaws Randy saw in his friend, there was also a loyalty that couldn't be shaken. However, when they decided to become roommates for their college years, Randy had no idea how much of an impact Joel's habit would have on their daily lives. Randy began to analyze the root of the problem. He had noticed, on multiple occasions, that Joel had a penchant for staying up late. Whether it was finishing an assignment at the eleventh hour, binge-watching a series or playing video games until the early hours of the morning, Randy realized that Joel was operating under an unhealthy cycle of sleep deprivation. This, in turn, made it difficult for him to wake up on time, leaving Randy to fill in the blanks when it came to dividing shared responsibilities. Over time, the frustrations began to wear on both of them. Joel knew that his actions were impacting his friend and roommate, but he couldn't seem to break the habit. Time and time again, Randy would attempt to discuss the issue with Joel, offering suggestions on how to improve his sleeps schedule, such as setting multiple alarms, using innovative sleep aid apps or adjusting his bedtime routine. Despite his supportive efforts, nothing seemed to change. Randy began to feel the weight of his friend's bemusement on his own life. Their friendship, once filled with laughter and camaraderie, started taking a toll as their interactions became increasingly centered around the issue of oversleeping. Late-night study sessions would inevitably devolve into arguments, and shared meals became less and less frequent as the tension grew between them. Eventually, Randy realized that he could not bear the growing resentment that was building between them. He didn't want to risk losing a lifelong friendship over Joel's tardiness. As difficult as it was for him to accept, Randy began looking for new ways to get a handle on the situation. One day, Randy happened upon an article about coexistence and tolerance. He took the time to introspect and reassess his understanding of his friend's struggle. It dawned on him that perhaps there was more to Joel's problem than just a refusal to change his habits. He knew how much Joel valued their friendship, and it was unlikely that Joel would willingly jeopardize it. Determined to salvage their bond, Randy broached the subject with Joel in a more empathetic manner. He approached the conversation with an open mind and a willingness to truly understand what factors were playing a role in his friend's struggle. For the first time in months, they sat down and discussed the matter without anger. To Randy's surprise, Joel opened up about his anxieties and how they were affecting his sleep. These were factors Randy had never considered before, and he couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of compassion for his friend. Together, they began to work on a plan to improve Joel's sleep schedule and cope with his anxieties. It was a slow process, with occasional setbacks. But as time went on, they found ways to compromise and help each other. Patience and understanding replaced frustration, and their friendship began to flourish once again. It frustrated Randy that Joel would oversleep so often, but as they worked through the issue together, he discovered the value of empathy and the importance of unwavering support. Not only did they grow stronger as individuals, but their bond as friends became unshakable - a testament to the power of facing life's challenges with mutual care and understanding."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"Was Origin published sooner in Swedish or Italian?\\" Context: \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

One of the best known of these tragedies gains new power through a moving and boldly original treatment. “Juliet and Romeo” is Swedish choreographer Mats Ek’s version of the ill-fated lovers’ tale, told in a way that honors its Renaissance source while tying it directly to today’s world. The Royal Swedish Ballet gave this 2013 work its North American premiere on Wednesday at the Kennedy Center Opera House. Ek’s ballet has little in common with those heavily draped and chandeliered productions of the Shakespeare story that most balletgoers know. Ek’s characters look pretty much like us, in their slacks, skirts and ponytails. There are no pointe shoes. The teenage boys behave like teenage boys, goofing around and punching each other. It is always night here. The set has a stripped-down look, with a smoky, shadowy stage and forbidding walls that bring to mind cities under siege. This could be modern-day Syria or Iraq, or a U.S. town in crisis. The Capulets patrol their turf on Segways, with the rigid bearing that we instantly recognize as policelike. The music is not the familiar Prokofiev, but Tchaikovsky. In a previous conversation, Ek told me he found that Tchaikovsky evoked young love beautifully, though there wasn’t much in the way of true violence and aggression in his music. Ek needed the violence, too, but love was most important. He chose his excerpts well, and they were splendidly performed by the Opera House Orchestra. Ek took his flip-flopped title from an early short story, “Giulietta e Romeo,” which was probably one of Shakespeare’s sources. Having given his heroine top billing, he also gave her moxie and strength. Again and again it is Juliet who takes the most decisive action and who stands up to her parents. In this austere world, Mariko Kida’s Juliet is the lone bright spot. We first see her wearing yellow, hopping about like a puppy and teasing her Nurse. Ana Laguna, the extraordinarily expressive dancer who is Ek’s longtime muse (and wife), gave the role of the Nurse a grounded moral force. Throughout the ballet she is a witness to the key moments, often peering from the shadows. In her 60s, with her long gray hair in a thick braid, she is also a vigorous and deeply musical member of the cast, matching the bounding Mercutio and Benvolio, for instance, step for step. Her presence highlighted one of the many glories of this company and this production: Not everyone looks alike. There are dancers of varying ages, sizes (Jerome Marchand’s Mercutio towers over Jokuto Kodam’s Benvolio) and backgrounds, with some more trained in ballet, others in modern dance. It takes time to adjust our ears when we’re at a Shakespeare play, and in the same way, it may take a short while to feel engaged by Ek’s unique physical expression: the long, stretched-out lunges, the blown-back torsos and moments when everyone rolls on the floor. It is Ek’s genius, however, that his weighted, earthy, unusual moves arouse vivid emotions. When Mercutio, Benvolio and Anthony Lomuljo’s sweet Romeo are messing around, you ache for them. Especially the big, tattooed Mercutio, who roughly pushes the other two away, yet also yearns for their company. An unnameable change is in the air — we see how the boys sense it, in their intentionally awkward, artless responses to the music, in the way they link arms and take comfort in being together. The giddy beauty of young love is Ek’s high achievement here, but so is the ugliness of hatred, which Ek depicts with equal inventiveness and immediacy. It’s easy, therefore, to link this ballet with what’s going on in today’s world. Age-old frictions and factions continue to tear loved ones apart: The same day that “Juliet and Romeo” opened at the Kennedy Center, this newspaper’s front page told the story of an Israeli woman fatally knifed in her kitchen by a teenage Palestinian boy. Both her family and his spoke poignantly of their grief, confusion and loneliness in the aftermath. That Ek’s ballet seems to anticipate, respond to and add more layers to such heartbreaking violence speaks to his masterful command. How acutely he communicates something real in the make-believe world of the stage. In fact, his art draws us in not by making us believe, but by making us feel. By expressing the yearning, resistance, helplessness — and the hopefulness — of love. Hope is Ek’s coda, as it was Shakespeare’s, and as it must be ours, too. The Royal Swedish Ballet performs “Juliet and Romeo,” by Mats Ek, in the Kennedy Center Opera House through Saturday. Tickets: 29-129. 202-467-4600 or kennedy-center.org. What was this article about?","output":"This article is a review of the ballet \\"Juliet and Romeo\\" performed by The Royal Swedish Ballet at the Kennedy Center Opera House. This production is a modern reinterpretation of Shakespeare's tragic love story by Swedish choreographer Mats Ek. His approach not only pays homage to the original story, but also addresses contemporaneous themes, helping the audience connect it to today's world. In this version, characters dress like everyday individuals, there are no pointe shoes and the stage is reminiscent of a city under siege. In particular, a significant departure from traditional portrayals is the presentation of Juliet -- she is bold and the stronger of the star-crossed lovers. The music, rather than using Prokofiev's score common to this ballet, is Tchaikovsky's, chosen by Ek to depict young love. The performances of all characters, especially the one by Ana Laguna, Ek’s muse and wife, playing the role of the Nurse, are highly praised. The article also draws parallels between the essence of this performance and current events, citing an example of a violent incident mentioned in a newspaper. The article concludes that Ek's ability to evoke strong emotions and mirror real-world situations through the fictional realm of the play is a testament of his mastery as a choreographer. The piece finishes with details of the show's run and ticket prices."},{"instruction":"Footage shows the remote In Amenas plant two weeks after the crisis. Manager told how hostages were tied to a gas construction complex. Terrorists wearing suicide vests built a bomb in one of their vehicles. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: In Amenas Gas Plant Recovers after Hostage Crisis Introduction: Two weeks after the traumatic hostage crisis at the In Amenas gas plant, new footage sheds light on the harrowing circumstances faced by the victims. The remote Algerian plant, operated in part by British Petroleum (BP), was put under siege by terrorists who inflicted a wave of violence upon its workers. Crisis Details: In an exclusive interview, the plant's manager revealed the chilling details of the attack. Hostages were reportedly tied to various parts of the gas construction complex, placing them in extremely vulnerable positions. The calculated actions of the terrorists further heightened the risk for all involved, as they wore suicide vests, posing an ever-present threat of a catastrophic explosion. The terrorists' sinister plans extended to building a bomb in one of their vehicles. This latest revelation underscores the extreme danger faced by the hostages as they remained captive during the intense standoff. The attackers' determination to cause widespread destruction was evident in their tactics and was undoubtedly intended to strike fear in both the hostages and the local populace. Recovery Efforts: Since the crisis, the In Amenas gas plant has been diligently working to ensure the safety of its employees and the community. Enhanced security measures have been implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future. The Algerian government and plant operators, including BP, are collaborating to protect the facility and prevent any disruptions to the country's vital energy supplies. Conclusion: The events at the In Amenas gas plant serve as a stark reminder of the threats to critical infrastructure around the world. As the footage reveals, the attackers were willing to go to great lengths to cause destruction and terrorize innocent individuals. In response to these atrocities, government officials and industry leaders must remain vigilant and prioritize the safety of those working in high-risk environments. By working together, they can effectively safeguard both the people and resources that make these facilities crucial to global energy stability."},{"instruction":"A response by the Postal Service would be expected.

As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music.

The founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits Crowded House were midway through a US tour when Paul Hester quit the band on 15 April 1994. He flew home to Melbourne to await the birth of his first child and indicated that he required more time with his family. Wally Ingram, drummer for support act Sheryl Crow, temporarily filled in until a replacement, Peter Jones (ex-Harem Scarem, Vince Jones, Kate Ceberano's Septet) was found. After the tour, the Finn Brothers released their album Finn in November 1995. In June 1996, at a press conference to announce the release of their greatest hits album Recurring Dream, Neil revealed that Crowded House were to disband. The June 1996 concerts in Europe and Canada were to be their final performances. Recurring Dream contained four songs from each of the band's studio albums, along with three new songs. The album debuted at number one in Australia, New Zealand and the UK in July 1996. Early copies included a bonus CD of live material. The album's three new songs, which were released as singles, were \\"Instinct\\", \\"Not the Girl You Think You Are\\" and \\"Everything Is Good for You\\", which featured backing vocals from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. Paul Hester returned to the band to play drums on the three new tracks. Worried that their goodbye had been too low-key and had disregarded their home fans, the band performed the Farewell to the World concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House on 24 November 1996, which raised funds for the Sydney Children's Hospital. The concert featured the line-up of Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mark Hart and Paul Hester. Tim Finn and Peter Jones both made guest appearances. Support bands on the day were Custard, Powderfinger and You Am I. The concert had one of the highest live audiences in Australian history with the crowd being estimated at between 120,000 and 250,000 people.

Internal struggles among the actual Steel Dragon band members culminate with the firing of their lead singer, Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng), and the starting of recruitment sessions to find a new vocalist. Chris experiences his own strife with his Blood Pollution bandmates, particularly guitarist Rob Malcolm (Timothy Olyphant).

The next day, Chris arrives at Blood Pollution's rehearsal space (the basement of an X-rated theater) to find that he's been fired and replaced with his arch-rival, the (now former) lead singer of another Steel Dragon tribute band. Rob also cites Chris' inability to create his own musical style, preferring to remain the singer in a tribute band.

A:","output":"Based on the given information, it remains unclear whether the option \\"cellulose\\" correctly answers the question \\"what sort of molecules are used for absorbing light energy by plants?\\", especially since the statement confirms that complex molecules are involved in the process. To provide a more comprehensive and detailed response, let's first consider the primary function of cellulose in plants. Cellulose is a complex carbohydrate and the main structural component of plant cell walls. While it plays a critical role in maintaining a plant's physical strength and support, cellulose lacks the ability to absorb light energy. Instead, plants primarily use light-absorbing molecules called pigments to fulfill this function. These pigments are responsible for capturing light energy, which is then converted into chemical energy via photosynthesis. Chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color, is the most prominent and essential pigment in this process, although other pigments such as carotenoids (yellow, orange, and red pigments) also contribute to light absorption. Chlorophyll absorbs light in the red and blue parts of the visible light spectrum, and through a series of complex reactions within chloroplasts, converts the absorbed energy into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which are then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and other organic molecules. These products are vital to the plant, as they provide energy and structural building blocks for further growth and development. In conclusion, while cellulose is an essential component of plant structure, it is not primarily involved in light absorption. Rather, the process relies on pigments such as chlorophyll. Therefore, given the available answer options and presupposing that complex molecules absorb light energy in plants, the correct answer would not be \\"cellulose.\\" Instead, the answer should involve pigments like chlorophyll and carotenoids that are directly responsible for the light absorption and photosynthesis processes in plants."},{"instruction":"How does this story end?

The half-time whistle blows, and tensions are high as both teams head to their respective dressing rooms. The managers, knowing the importance of this derby, give impassioned speeches to their players, urging them to remain focused and disciplined on the pitch. As the second half kicks off, both teams return to the field with fierce determination. City, the aggrieved party after the controversial penalty decision, look to make amends and take control of the game. After a series of chances, they finally break through in the 63rd minute. Raheem Sterling jinks his way past a defender and serves an inch-perfect cross for Sergio Aguero, who makes no mistake in putting the ball into the back of the net. The Etihad erupts in celebration, as Manchester City take the lead 1-0. Both teams continue to battle it out, but the intensity of the derby gets the better of them. In the 78th minute, following a dangerous tackle, scuffles break out between several players — a testament to the high stakes and emotions associated with this match. Oliver, having a difficult evening, shows a red card to Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera for a studs-up challenge on David Silva. Now down to ten men, United's desperation grows. They fight valiantly to find an equalizer, and in the 85th minute, they do just that. A cross from the right wing finds the head of Marcus Rashford, who expertly guides the ball past Joe Hart. The score is now level at 1-1. With the fans on the edge of their seats and the clock ticking down, it seems as though the match could be headed for a draw. However, both teams are determined to find a late winner as extra time approaches. A relentless back-and-forth battle ensues, with neither team willing to relent. Finally, deep into added time, a moment of individual brilliance unfolds. Kevin De Bruyne finds himself with the ball outside the United penalty area. He assesses the situation, takes a calculated touch, and unleashes a curling shot that whistles past the outstretched arms of David de Gea and nestles into the far corner of the net. The Etihad erupts in euphoria once more, as Manchester City takes the lead just as the referee signals for full time. The story ends with Manchester City claiming a dramatic 2-1 victory in a thrilling, hard-fought, and heated derby. The fans are left breathless, as both sets of players slump to the ground in exhaustion. As the dust settles, Manchester City desperately savors their victory, while Manchester United is left to ruminate on a game marred by controversy and heartbreak. Off the pitch, the refereeing decisions lead to heated debates between pundits, journalists, and fans alike. Days later, Michael Oliver's performance remains under the microscope, a forceful reminder of just how heavily the outcome of a match can rest in the hands of one individual.

Choose your answer from: (A). Place a several small weights together at the top of the shower curtain to keep it in place (B). Place several small weights in intervals along the end of the shower curtain to keep it in place Answer:","output":"Answer: B. Place several small weights in intervals along the end of the shower curtain to keep it in place. Keeping a shower curtain from flapping out during a shower can be quite a challenge, especially when you want to keep the water contained in the shower area and maintain privacy. To achieve this, the best way is to use several small weights placed at intervals along the end of the shower curtain. Here's a detailed description of this solution and its advantages: 1. Distribution of weight: By placing small weights at intervals along the end of the shower curtain, you're ensuring that the weight distribution is even. This leads to a better hold on the curtain, preventing it from flapping or being disturbed by water or air currents in the bathroom. 2. Flexibility: Using multiple weights allows you to adjust the placement and number of weights to suit your specific shower curtain and bathroom setup. Different shower curtains may have varying lengths and materials that could require more or fewer weights to achieve the desired stability. This flexibility makes it a more versatile and efficient solution. 3. Less strain: Attaching weights only at the top, as mentioned in option A, would add extra strain on the shower curtain and could cause it to tear or stretch over time. By placing the weights at intervals along the end, the force of the weights is distributed more evenly, reducing the strain on any single point. 4. Enhanced stability: Weights at the bottom of the curtain help maintain its position as a barrier, making it more resilient to water splashes and drafts that could otherwise cause the curtain to flail outwards. This enhanced stability ensures that water is contained within the shower area, minimizing the risk of a wet and slippery bathroom floor. 5. Ease of installation: It's relatively easy to implement this solution, as there are commercially available shower curtains with built-in weights or magnets. Alternatively, you can attach clip-on weights to the bottom of a standard shower curtain, or even use household objects, like binder clips with small metal washers, to create DIY weights. In conclusion, placing several small weights along the end of the shower curtain is the best solution to prevent it from flapping out when taking a shower because it evenly distributes the weight, offers flexibility, causes less strain on the curtain, enhances stability, and has easy installation options."},{"instruction":"Question: Who plays role of Lilly Dillon? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Grifters Context: Lilly Dillon (Angelica Huston) is a veteran con artist. She works for a bookmaker, Bobo Justus (Pat Hingle), making large cash bets at race tracks to lower the odds of longshots. On her way to La Jolla for the horse races, she stops in Los Angeles to visit her son Roy (John Cusack), a small-time grifter whom she has not seen in eight years. She finds him in pain and bleeding internally after one of his victims caught him pulling a petty scam and punched him in the stomach. When medical assistance finally comes, Lilly confronts the doctor, threatening to have him killed if her son dies. At the hospital, Lilly meets and takes an instant dislike to Roy's girlfriend, Myra Langtry (Annette Bening), who is a few years older than her son. Lilly urges her son to quit the grift, saying he literally does not have the stomach for it. Because she leaves late for La Jolla, she misses a race where the winner was paying 70â1. For this mistake, Bobo burns her hand with a cigar. Myra, like Roy and Lilly, plays all the angles. When her landlord demands payment of late rent, she uses her sex appeal to lure him into bed and forget the rent. She makes a similar offer to a jeweler (Stephen Tobolowsky) to get what she wants for a gem she is trying to pawn. Upon leaving the hospital, Roy takes Myra to La Jolla for the weekend. On the train, she notices him conning a group of sailors in a rigged dice game. Myra reveals to Roy that she is also a grifter and is looking for a new partner for a long-con operation. Myra describes her long association with another man, Cole (J. T. Walsh), and how they took advantage of wealthy marks in business cons, including a greedy oil investor, Gloucester Hebbing (Charles Napier). A flashback scene in a plush office building culminates in a fake FBI raid with a fake shooting of Myra to discourage Hebbing from going to the police. Roy, who insists on working only short-term cons, resists the proposition, fearing she may try to dupe him herself. Myra, seeing Lilly's power over Roy, accuses him of...

The scene is shifted from Renaissance Verona to ancient Rome; Romeo is Marius, Juliet is Lavinia, the feud is between patricians and plebeians; Juliet/Lavinia wakes from her potion before Romeo/Marius dies. Otway's version was a hit, and was acted for the next seventy years. His innovation in the closing scene was even more enduring, and was used in adaptations throughout the next 200 years: Theophilus Cibber's adaptation of 1744, and David Garrick's of 1748 both used variations on it. These versions also eliminated elements deemed inappropriate at the time. For example, Garrick's version transferred all language describing Rosaline to Juliet, to heighten the idea of faithfulness and downplay the love-at-first-sight theme. In 1750, a \`\`Battle of the Romeos'' began, with Spranger Barry and Susannah Maria Arne (Mrs. Theophilus Cibber) at Covent Garden versus David Garrick and George Anne Bellamy at Drury Lane.

The following points can help explain why this perception is derived from the text: 1. Word choice: The use of words like \\"bloated\\" and \\"stretches\\" in the sentence indicates that the plot of the story or movie is being criticized for being unnecessarily long and possibly unwarranted. These words evoke a sense of excess, which is often considered as a negative trait. 2. The comparison of running time: Mentioning that the running time is stretched about 10 minutes longer than it should be suggests that the plot is excessive and could have been more concise. This indicates dissatisfaction with the way the story has been structured or paced, and therefore adds to the negative perception of the sentiment. 3. Implication of wasted time: By pointing out the additional 10 minutes of running time, the sentence implies that the extra length does not contribute to the overall quality of the story. This can be perceived as a criticism, meaning that the time spent watching or listening to the story may have been wasted or not well-utilized. 4. Lack of praise or positive descriptions: The sentence does not offer any positive or complimentary feedback on the plot. As it is solely focused on the negative aspects, the sentiment is more likely to be perceived negatively. Overall, the sentiment in this sentence can be considered as negative, as it critiques the plot of a story or movie for being excessively long and potentially wasteful. The word choice and implications in the text contribute to this perception and make it evident that the author does not deem the additional running time as valuable or worthwhile."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

It is the fawning history of the dynasty known as the House of Barcelona . In presenting the rulers of the county of Barcelona as the descendants of Charlemagne , the monks sought to justify their independent policy with respect to the King of France , their nominal sovereign . The Gesta is the chronological backbone . The first composition was made between 1162 and 1184 and ended with the reign of Raymond Berengar IV ( 1131 -- 62 ) . In the late thirteenth century it was continued through the reign of James I ( 1213 -- 76 ) . An abridged version in the Catalan language was produced sometime between 1268 and 1283 . The final Latin version was edited in 1303 -- 14 and included the reigns of Peter the Great ( 1276 -- 87 ) , Alfonso the Generous ( 1287 -- 91 ) , and James II. Except for the first composition , all surviving versions are later copies , today preserved in the Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó , in the Biblioteca de Catalunya , and in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France . A copy of one of the latter was taken to France by Pierre de Marca and published in 1688 by Étienne Baluze . - The Kingdom of Aragon (, ) was a medieval and early modern kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula, corresponding to the modern-day autonomous community of Aragon, in Spain. It should not be confused with the larger Crown of Aragon, that also included other territories the Principality of Catalonia (which included the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan Counties), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and other possessions that are now part of France, Italy, and Greece that were also under the rule of the King of Aragon, but were administered separately from the Kingdom of Aragon. - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. - The House of Barcelona was a medieval dynasty that ruled the County of Barcelona continuously from 878 and the Crown of Aragon from 1137 (as kings from 1162). From the male part they descend from the Bellonids, the descendants of Wifred the Hairy. They inherited most of the Catalan counties by the thirteenth century and established a territorial Principality of Catalonia, uniting it with the Kingdom of Aragon through marriage and conquering numerous other lands and kingdoms until the death of the last legitimate male of the main branch, Martin the Humanist, in 1410. Cadet branches of the house continued to rule Urgell (since 992) and Gandia. Cadet branches of the dynasty had also ruled Ausona intermittently from 878 until 1111, Provence from 1112 to 1245, and Sicily from 1282 to 1409. By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastámara, descended from the \\"infanta\\" Eleanor of the house of Barcelona. - A dynasty is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a feudal or monarchical system but sometimes also appearing in elective republics. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a \\"house\\"; which may be styled \\"royal\\", \\"princely\\", \\"comital\\", etc., depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians periodize the histories of many sovereign states, such as Ancient Egypt, the Carolingian Empire and Imperial China, using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term \\"dynasty\\" may be used to delimit the era during which the family reigned and to describe events, trends, and artifacts of that period (\\"a Ming-dynasty vase\\"). The word \\"dynasty\\" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references (\\"a Ming vase\\"). - Provence (Provençal: \\"Provença\\" in classical norm or \\"Prouvènço\\" in Mistralian norm) is a geographical region and historical province of southeastern France, which extends from the left bank of the lower Rhône River to the west to the Italian border to the east, and is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. It largely corresponds with the modern administrative \\"région\\" of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and includes the \\"départements\\" of Var, Bouches-du-Rhône, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and parts of Alpes-Maritimes and Vaucluse. The largest city of the region is Marseille. - The Principality of Catalonia, is a historic territory and a medieval and early modern political entity in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula, mostly in Spain, with an adjoining portion in southern France. Between the 13th and the 18th centuries it was bordered by the Kingdom of Aragon to the west, the Kingdom of Valencia to the south, the Kingdom of France and the feudal lordship of Andorra to the north and by the Mediterranean sea to the east. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - The County of Barcelona was originally a frontier region under the rule of the Carolingian dynasty. By the end of the 10th century, the Counts of Barcelona were \\"de facto\\" independent, hereditary rulers in constant warfare with the Islamic caliphate of Córdoba and its successor states. The counts, through marriage alliances and treaties, acquired the other Catalan counties and extended their influence along Occitania. Barcelona formed the nucleus of the emergent Principality of Catalonia. In 1164, the count of Barcelona, Alfons I, inherited the Kingdom of Aragon (as Alfonso II). Thenceforward, the history of the county of Barcelona is subsumed within that of the Crown of Aragon, but the city of Barcelona remained preeminent within it. - An era is a span of time marked by character, events, changes on earth, etc. When used in science, for example geology, an \\"era\\" denotes a clearly defined period of time of arbitrary but well-defined length, such as for example the Mesozoic Era frozen m 252 Ma66 Ma, delimited by a start event and an end event. When used in social history, eras may for example denote a period of some monarch's reign. In colloquial language, eras denote longer spans of time, before and after which the practices or fashions change to a significant degree. When era is extended to a calendar system, it is known as a calendar era. In Sanskrit or Indian culture eras are known as yugas. - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Occitania (, , , , also sometimes lo País d'Òc, \\"the Oc Country\\") is the historical region in southern Europe where Occitan was historically the main language spoken, and where it is sometimes still used, for the most part as a second language. This cultural area roughly encompasses the southern half of France, as well as Monaco and smaller parts of Italy (Occitan Valleys, Guardia Piemontese) and Spain (Aran Valley). Occitania has been recognized as a linguistic and cultural concept since the Middle Ages, but has never been a legal nor a political entity under this name, although the territory was united in Roman times as the \\"Seven Provinces\\" and in the early Middle Ages (\\"Aquitanica\\" or the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse) before the French conquest started in the early 13th century. Currently about 200,000800,000 people out of 16 million living in the area are either native or proficient speakers of Occitan, although the languages more usually spoken in the area are French, Italian, Catalan and Spanish. Since 2006, the Occitan language has been an official language of Catalonia, which includes the Aran Valley where Occitan gained official status in 1990. - A prince is a male ruler, monarch, or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family. \\"Prince\\" is also a hereditary title in the nobility of some European states. The feminine equivalent is a princess. The English word derives, via the French word \\"prince\\", from the Latin noun \\"princeps\\", from \\"primus\\" (first) + \\"capio\\" (to seize), meaning \\"the chief, most distinguished, ruler, prince\\". - The House of Trastámara was a dynasty of kings in Spain , which first governed in Castile beginning in 1369 before expanding its rule into Aragón, Navarre and Naples. They were an illegitimate cadet line of the House of Ivrea. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - The Catalan counties were the administrative divisions of the eastern Carolingian \\"Marca Hispanica\\" and southernmost part of the March of Gothia created after its Frankish conquest. The various counties roughly defined what came to be known as the Principality of Catalonia. - The Bellonids, sometimes called the Bellonid Dynasty, were the counts descendant of the Goth Belló who ruled in Carcassonne, Urgell, Cerdanya, County of Conflent, Barcelona, and numerous other Catalan and Septimanian counties and marches in the 9th and 10th centuries. His most famous grandson was Wilfred the Hairy, who founded the House of Barcelona, rulers of the County of Barcelona from 878, and since 1164 the Crown of Aragon, until the end of the reign of Martin the Humane in 1410. - The Low Countries is a coastal region in western Europe, consisting especially of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the low-lying delta of the Rhine, Meuse, Scheldt, and Ems rivers where much of the land is at or below sea level. This wide area of Western Europe roughly stretches from French Gravelines and Dunkirk at its southwestern point, to the area of Dutch Delfzijl and German Eastern Frisia at its northeastern point, and to Luxembourg and French Thionville in the southeast. - A chronicle (from Greek , from , \\"chronos\\", \\"time\\") is a historical account of facts and events ranged in chronological order, as in a time line. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important. - The Carolingian dynasty (known variously as the Carlovingians, Carolingus, Carolings or Karlings) was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The name \\"Carolingian\\" (Medieval Latin \\"karolingi\\", an altered form of an unattested Old High German word *\\"karling, kerling\\", meaning \\"descendant of Charles\\", cf. MHG \\"kerlinc\\") derives from the Latinised name of Charles Martel: \\"Carolus\\". The dynasty consolidated its power in the mid 8th century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and \\"dux et princeps Francorum\\" hereditary, and becoming the \\"de facto\\" rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the Merovingian throne. In 751 the Merovingian dynasty, which had ruled the Germanic Franks was overthrown with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and a Carolingian Pepin the Short was crowned King of the Franks. The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak in 800 with the crowning of Charlemagne as the first Emperor of Romans in over three centuries. His death in 814 began an extended period of fragmentation of the Carolingian empire and decline that would eventually lead to the evolution of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire. - The Crown of Aragon was a composite monarchy, also nowadays referred to as a confederation of individual polities or kingdoms ruled by one king, with a personal and dynastic union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona. At the height of its power in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon was a thalassocracy (a state with primarily maritime realms) controlling a large portion of present-day eastern Spain, parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean \\"empire\\" which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442) and parts of Greece (until 1388). The component realms of the Crown were not united politically except at the level of the king, who ruled over each autonomous polity according to its own laws, raising funds under each tax structure, dealing separately with each \\"Corts\\" or \\"Cortes\\". Put in contemporary terms, it has sometimes been considered that the different lands of the Crown of Aragon (mainly the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Valencia) functioned more as a confederation than as a single kingdom. In this sense, the larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot).

Bill used insecticides to get read of aphids, while his buddy farmer Paul didn't. But I can use this background: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.

Joseph Dyer, 54, says Ed Murray, 62, forced him to have sex in a bedroom they shared at the home of Dyer's mother four decades ago. Murray, a Democrat elected in 2013, denies Dyer's claims and says they're based in grievances between various estranged sides of his family. Regardless, Murray announced Tuesday—hours after Dyer went public with his allegations—that he would be stepping down as Seattle's mayor effective Wednesday evening. “While the allegations against me are not true, it is important that my personal issues do not affect the ability of our city government to conduct the public’s business,” Murray says in a statement. The first allegation against Murray came in the form of a lawsuit filed in April, the Washington Post reports. A man claimed he was repeatedly raped by Murray when he was a homeless teen in Seattle in the 1980s. The lawsuit, which was later withdrawn, was followed by three other men accusing Murray of sexually abusing them as teens, according to CNN. Murray ended his re-election campaign in the face of the allegations. He denies any claims of sexual abuse, saying he's being targeted for his progressive politics and support for gay rights. Seattle City Council President Bruce Harrell will take over mayoral duties for at least the next few days. He calls the accusations against Murray \\"unspeakable.\\" Article:","output":"Once upon a time, in a big city called Seattle, there was a mayor, a person who helps to run and take care of the city, named Ed Murray. Mr. Murray, however, got into some trouble when five different people told publicly that he did bad things. These bad things they say he did is called sexual abuse, which is like when someone touches or forces someone to do naughty and uncomfortable things they don't want to do. One of these people was Mr. Murray's own cousin, Joseph Dyer, who is older now, but says that Mr. Murray forced him to do these naughty things when they were both younger, and were staying in the same bedroom at their mom's house. But Ed Murray denies this and says that he never did these bad things. He thinks his family members may just be angry with him and trying to make him look bad. Nevertheless, these are very serious accusations and after Mr. Dyer spoke publicly about what he says happened, Mr. Murray decided that he would resign, or quit being the mayor, because he does not want his personal problems to interfere or cause trouble in running the city. He said so in a statement, which is a sort of official letter or speech that people sometimes make when something big happens. This isn't the first time somebody has accused Mr. Murray of these bad things. Earlier, another man said that Mr. Murray did the same to him when he was a homeless teenager in the 1980s. There were even some more men who said Mr. Murray did bad things to them too when they were teenagers. Because of all these accusations, Mr. Murray ended, or stopped his campaign to be mayor again. Mr. Murray says that he didn't do anything bad and thinks that people are accusing him because they don't like his progressive politics or his support for gay rights, which means he believes that men should be able to love and marry other men, and the same for women. Anyway, now that Mr. Murray isn't the mayor anymore, someone else has to help run the city. The person who is now in charge is the Seattle City Council President, Bruce Harrell. Mr. Harrell will be taking over the mayoral duties, or the jobs and tasks that the Mayor should do, for at least the next few days.

The journey towards this discovery, however, was preceded by numerous critical findings and collaborative efforts from other brilliant minds in the world of physics. Before diving into Chadwick's discovery, it is essential to understand the background and some earlier discoveries in atomic structure. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scientists made a series of significant breakthroughs that unraveled the mysteries of atomic structure. In 1897, the British physicist J.J. Thomson discovered the electron – a negatively charged subatomic particle. His work led to the development of the \\"plum pudding\\" model of the atom, which proposed that the atom consisted of negatively charged electrons dispersed in a positive \\"soup\\" much like plums in a Christmas pudding. This model was later challenged by the work of Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from New Zealand. Rutherford's famous Gold Foil Experiment (performed in 1909 with Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden) revealed that most of an atom's mass was concentrated in a central positive core, which he later termed the nucleus. This led to the conception of the \\"Rutherford model,\\" where electrons orbit the dense, positively charged nucleus, much like planets orbit the sun. Another critical figure in the story of the neutron is the Danish physicist Niels Bohr. Bohr's work built on Rutherford's atomic model, refining it by incorporating the principles of quantization and suggesting that electrons occupied specific energy levels around the nucleus. Despite these advancements in understanding the atom, the model could not explain the atomic mass discrepancies or the behavior of isotopes. The final piece of the puzzle came in 1932 when James Chadwick, a student of Rutherford, performed a series of experiments at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England. Chadwick hypothesized that the nucleus contained another neutral particle (neutron), which would account for the atomic mass disparity and the existence of isotopes. He reached this conclusion after studying the high-energy particle emission from radioactive decay. Chadwick observed that when beryllium was exposed to alpha particles, it emitted a stream of unidentified particles, which he called neutrons. In his experiments, Chadwick employed the radioactive substance polonium to emit alpha particles, which struck a beryllium target. The beryllium emitted the mysterious, high-energy particles, which then interacted with a paraffin wax, as it was thought that hydrogen nuclei would be useful in detecting the neutral particles thanks to their similar masses. As the particles passed through the wax, they caused protons to be ejected. The ejected protons’ energy was observed and measured, indicating that these emitted neutrons had no charge. Chadwick's discovery of the neutron was an essential milestone in atomic and nuclear physics. The identification of an uncharged particle residing in the atomic nucleus paved the way for many subsequent advancements, such as nuclear fission, the development of atomic weapons, and nuclear power generation. This discovery also contributed significantly to the development of modern atomic theory and understanding the behavior of isotopes, which are crucial in various fields, including biology, chemistry, medicine, and materials science."},{"instruction":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?

Haydn Austin Bunton (born 5 April 1937) is a former Australian rules footballer and coach. The son of the legendary Haydn Bunton Sr., Bunton Jr. played for North Adelaide and Norwood in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), as well as Swan Districts and Subiaco in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL). Bunton was regarded as a tough and skilful player in both South Australia and Western Australia, but it was as a coach that he cemented a reputation alongside his father as one of Australian football's greatest identities. Bunton was inducted into the coaches section of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, as well as the Western Australian Institute of Sport Hall of Champions in 2003 and was made an inaugural member of the WA Football Hall of Fame in 2004 and the SA Football Hall of Fame in 2002. Born in Caulfield, Victoria, Bunton Jr. moved with his father first to Western Australia and then to South Australia. Bunton was hospitalised for two years from the age of three due to a fractured pelvis and Perthes disease in his hip. He wore leg braces and used crutches until he was aged ten. Haydn Bunton junior made his debut for North Adelaide at the age of 17, and two years seasons later was named an All-Australian player. In 1955, Bunton senior was killed in a car crash, but the following year, the younger Bunton showed his class as a player by finishing runner-up for the Magarey Medal to Dave Boyd. The following year, Haydn \\"stood out\\" as a player due to a transfer dispute with North Adelaide, who would not clear him, but amazingly served as a non-playing coach of Norwood. From 1958 to 1960, he played for Norwood, in spite of a serious knee injury sustained in a car accident in Tasmania in 1959. Bunton had another strong year in 1961, when he was recruited by Swan Districts in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) as captain-coach. At the time Swan Districts were the Cinderella side of the WAFL, having never won more than seven games in a season since 1945, and were generally regarded with \\"pity or scorn\\". Swan Districts had lost their last sixteen games of 1960, but improved immediately under Bunton's coaching. They won 12 and drew two of twenty-one matches to finish second, but after a loss to raging hot premiership favourite East Perth in the second semi final they were not considered a serious threat. However, after overcoming Subiaco in the preliminary, Bunton developed an ingenious tactic to counter Royals' champion Polly Farmer by using both Keith Slater and Fred Castledine in the ruck contests. Though this ploy was technically illegal, it was accepted by the umpires, and Swan Districts won by 24 points for their first WAFL premiership. In the process of lifting Swan Districts from cellar-dwellers to premiers, Bunton developed a use of handball that was far ahead of its time and also discouraged the use of the erratic drop kick. The following year Bunton won the Sandover Medal for the league's \\"fairest and best\\", completing a rare father-and-son achievement. Swan Districts took their first minor premiership and won both the second semi and grand finals against East Fremantle. Despite finishing fourth after the home-and-away rounds, Swan Districts managed to win three finals and a hat-trick of premierships in 1963; however, 1964 saw the team collapse to sixth of eight clubs with only nine wins. Bunton returned to Norwood as playing coach from 1965 until 1967, bringing his total number of games for Norwood to 97. In his first season the club played off in the finals, but they slowly declined in 1966 and 1967 finishing seventh of ten teams.

Charities which create sustainable good in areas where it is needed are the best and will do the most good. You don't necessarily have to donate money. Some nonprofits accept educational materials, clothing, or other supplies. Call or email to ask what they need. Some really want awareness most of all, so you can help by spreading the word, in addition to any physical donations you can make. Volunteer or be part of fundraising efforts for charities that do good abroad. Run a half marathon or other fundraiser to raise funds for an international charity of your choice. Look for programs that allow you to fly out and volunteer in person. Consider other options, like providing input, advice, or tutoring to small nonprofits and organizations over the web. Fair trade certified products are guaranteed to have been produced under humane conditions for worker, with that worker being paid a fair wage, and produced under sustainable conditions. By buying these products as much as possible, you show companies that you think these practices are worth a few extra pennies and encourage other companies to invest in these practices as well. Fair Trade items will almost always be labeled as such. If you're unsure, try to at least avoid items that are often unethically sourced. Coffee, bananas, cocoa, many tropical fruits, wine (mainly from California), clothing items (mainly from China, Bangladesh, and SE Asia) and jewelry are often unethically sourced. Sometimes, all a third world or disadvantaged community needs is a chance for their own economy to flourish. One way you can help these people help themselves is by providing small business loans. This means that you should get your money back and the small business will get what it needs to contribute to that economy and community. An easy way to get in to this is through Kiva.org, which provides small business loans to people in disadvantaged areas. This is an especially good way to help women and other vulnerable groups to support themselves. Do things that help the environment globally. A great way to do this is to reduce your reliance on fossil fuels and other fuel sources that have a negative impact on the environment. You can do this by using public transit, a bicycle, or an electric vehicle to get around. You can also use solar power to heat your home, instead of things like natural gas (which put a strain on the environment). Eating local food and using local products will also cut down on global fossil fuel usage. Conserve as much energy as you can. Producing energy is very taxing on the planet, often requiring the burning of gases or the production of nuclear energy. Any energy you don't use can then be used for more important things and less power will need to be produced overall. Turn off lights in rooms that you're not in, take colder showers, switch to energy efficient light bulbs, turn off your computer when you're not using it, etc. There are lots of ways to conserve power! Don't eat more than you need to, don't buy a bunch of junk that you don't need, and avoid buying new clothes every year. Buying used clothing can help reduce waste that is created. Eating a healthy, balanced, minimal diet will also reduce waste. If you do have leftover food, compost it. You want to reduce the waste you produce before our planet ends up looking like a still shot from Wall*E! Compost your excess organic waste. Get or build a large bin that can be left outdoors, as well as a small one that can go in your home. Collect all of the food scraps that are leftover from eating and preparing your meals, as well as things like yard waste, and deposit these items in your outdoor bin. Use a pitchfork or rake to turn and mix the compost regularly. You will also need to add soil on occasion. One it has turned into a homogeneous mixture, it's ready to be spread in your green spaces. Recycle more and correctly. Most cities will come and collect your recycling along with your garbage, though they'll be kept in separate bins. Recyclable items vary by city, but generally most plastic jugs, metal cans, and paper are all recyclable. As the dominant life form on this planet, it is our responsibility to protect the creatures that cannot protect themselves. Because of the way we currently live, many animals suffer and are even going extinct! If you want to improve conditions for animals, there are many ways you can help. Encourage and vote for legislation that protects animals. Only buy products that do not contribute to animal abuse. Donate to charities which help animals, such as the Humane Society, The Marine Mammal Center, or the Performing Animal Welfare Society. In many disadvantaged countries, like many regions in India and Africa, women do not have access to sanitary feminine hygiene products. This leads to humiliation and isolation at best, and at worst discomfort and even life-threatening infections. By donating items and money to charities that work to solve this problem, you'll be keeping women healthy and help them to do things like attend school and work so that they get the opportunity to better their own lives. One such charity is Days for Girls. Summary:","output":"To help people across the world, it's essential to support charities that create sustainable good in areas where it is needed the most.

Different dishwashers may have distinct features, but most modern dishwashers have a variety of cycles and options designed to cater to specific cleaning needs. These options may include Auto/Normal cycle, Heavy cycle, Delicate cycle, Eco cycle, or even a specific Sanitize cycle, among others. Choose the cycle that best suits the type of dishes, the level of soil, and your energy preferences. To select a cycle, simply press the button or turn the dial associated with the desired option available on the dishwasher's control panel. After selecting the cycle, press the start button to initiate the dishwashing process. The dishwasher would then begin filling with water, heating the water to the required temperature, and circulating the water and detergent mixture through the spray arms to clean and sanitize the dishes within. During the course of the cycle, the dishwasher will also perform a few additional steps like rinsing the dishes, draining the soiled water, and in some cases, provide a heated drying cycle or a steam clean. Finally, once the complete dishwashing process is over, the dishwasher will signal its completion with a beep, a light indicator, or by displaying relevant information on the control panel. Allow the dishes to cool for a few minutes before opening the dishwasher door. When it's safe to do so, carefully take out the dishes, starting from the bottom rack to avoid any residual water dripping from the upper rack onto the lower, clean dishes. As you unload, check for any remaining food particles and wipe them off before placing dishes in their designated storage spaces. Now that you have successfully completed the entire dishwashing process, you can enjoy your clean, sanitized dishes and utensils. Remember to perform regular dishwasher maintenance to keep the appliance in proper working condition, ensuring efficient, consistent cleaning for years to come."},{"instruction":"Q:This article: Ned Rochlin is a biodynamic farmer living with his girlfriend, Janet. While selling produce at a local market, Ned sells marijuana to a uniformed police officer due to the officer's claim that he had a stressful week, which made Ned feel sympathetic after initially being skeptical. Ned is then arrested on a charge of selling drugs. Ned has three sisters: Miranda the middle sister, is a journalist for Vanity Fair trying to get her first major article published. Though she has trouble finding a man to keep her interest, she and a neighbor, Jeremy have hidden feelings for each other. Natalie, the youngest, is an independent, bisexual hipster living with her girlfriend, Cindy, and five other roommates. Liz, the oldest, is married to Dylan, a documentary filmmaker. Their marriage is failing as Dylan shows no sexual or emotional interest in Liz. They also have strict control over their son River, which leaves him unhappy and unable to express himself. When Ned is released from prison, he returns home to his girl and his dog. He finds that she is living with Billy, and no longer wishes to continue their relationship or allow him to work at the farm. Billy gives Ned a ride into town and tells him that if he can scrape together 500 for the first 2 months rent, Janet might let him stay in the goat barn behind the farm. Ned initially stays at his mother's house but a few days later shows up at Liz's place, asking if he can stay with her.

Given the context: How would you describe Alex? Possible answers: guilty, embarrased, a bike snatcher Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, I would describe Alex as a combination of guilty, embarrassed, and potentially misunderstood. It's important to examine each aspect of Alex's actions and the situation to better understand these descriptions. 1. Guilty: Since Alex lost their own bike, they felt the need to take Cameron's bike to school. This act can be seen as guilty because they knowingly took someone else's property without permission. Whether it was intentional or not, the fact that Alex chose to use Cameron's bike demonstrates a certain level of guilt on their part. If they knew it was wrong, yet still chose to take the bike, this feeling of guilt would likely be more pronounced. 2. Embarrassed: Losing one's own belongings can often lead to a feeling of embarrassment. In this case, Alex lost their bike, which may have motivated them to take Cameron's bike to avoid further ridicule or embarrassment at school. The embarrassment may have stemmed from a fear of being judged by their peers for not having a bike or being irresponsible in losing their own. 3. A Bike Snatcher (Misunderstood): While it could be argued that Alex acted as a bike snatcher, this term may not accurately portray their intentions behind taking Cameron's bike. They may have taken the bike out of necessity due to factors out of their control, such as time constraints, the distance to school, or other extenuating circumstances. If circumstances forced Alex to take the bike as a last resort, it could be more accurate to say that they were misunderstood, rather than being a true bike snatcher who steals out of malicious intent. This possibility should not be discounted, as it is essential to consider all available context to accurately describe a person's actions. In conclusion, the context suggests that Alex was guilty and embarrassed for losing their own bike and resorting to take Cameron's bike to school. At the same time, it's important to consider that Alex's actions could potentially be misunderstood, and the term bike snatcher may not genuinely reflect their intentions. To provide a more holistic and accurate description of Alex, it is essential to consider the various aspects of their actions and any underlying motivations or reasons that may have led to their decision to take Cameron's bike."},{"instruction":"Cheers Most Cheers episodes were, as a voiceover stated at the start of each, \`\`filmed before a live studio audience'' on Paramount Stage 25 in Hollywood, generally on Tuesday nights.

Hmmm, my chain of thoughts:","output":"A common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) would likely not thrive in a greenhouse, and there is a possibility that it might starve. Here are some factors to consider: 1. Natural Habitat: Warthogs are native to the grasslands, savannas, and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. They are adapted to these environments and would likely be stressed and uncomfortable in a greenhouse. 2. Diet: Warthogs primarily feed on grass, roots, tubers, and the occasional fruit or invertebrates such as insects. They use their tusks and snout to dig up the ground to find food. A greenhouse typically contains a variety of plants, but these may not be suitable or sufficient for a warthog's diet. A lack of appropriate and sufficient food could eventually lead to starvation. 3. Space: Warthogs require space to roam, explore, and search for food. They are also social animals that live in groups called sounders. A greenhouse may not provide enough space for a warthog to carry out its natural behaviors, leading to stress and potentially impacting its health negatively. 4. Temperature: Greenhouses are designed to maintain a warm, controlled environment for plant growth. This environment may not be conducive to the comfort and well-being of a warthog, which is adapted to Africa's varied climates. In summary, a common warthog would likely not be well-suited to life in a greenhouse, and there is a possibility that it could starve due to an insufficient diet.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Exorcist III Context: The film begins with the point of view of someone wandering through the streets of Georgetown, a voice informing us \\"I have dreams... of a rose... and of falling down a long flight of stairs\\". The point of view shows a warning of evil about to arrive later that night at a church. Demonic growls are heard, leaves and other street trash suddenly come flying into the church as a crucifix comes to life. It then cuts to Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (George C. Scott) at a crime scene, where a 12-year-old boy named Thomas Kintry has been murdered.Kinderman takes his friend, a priest named Father Dyer (Ed Flanders), out to see their mutually favorite film It's a Wonderful Life. Kinderman later relates the gruesome details of the murder of the young boy he was investigating that morning, including his crucifixion. Another murder soon takes place; a priest found decapitated in a church. Dyer is shortly hospitalized and found murdered the next day, with the words \\"IT'S A WONDERFULL LIFE\\" written on a wall in Dyer's blood.At each murder scene, the fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match up, indicating a different person was responsible for each. Kinderman tells hospital staff the reason for his unease: fifteen years ago the vicious serial killer, \\"The Gemini\\" (Brad Dourif), was executed; with every victim he cut off the right index finger and carved the Zodiac sign of Gemini into the palm of their left hand. Kinderman noticed the hands of the three new victims and verified that the Gemini's sign has been there. The Gemini Killer also always used an extra \\"L\\" in his notes sent to the media, such as \\"usefull\\" or \\"carefull\\". Furthermore, to filter out false confessions, the original Gemini Killer's true mutilations were kept a secret by the Richmond police's homicide department; the newspapers were made to wrongfully report that the left middle finger was severed and that the Gemini sign was carved on the back of the victim.Kinderman visits the head of the psychiatric ward, Dr. Temple (Scott Wilson), who relates... A:","output":"The Gemini Killer, also known as James Venamun, was able to inhabit the body of a fellow inmate in the psychiatric ward named Patient X, who was revealed to be Damian Karras (Jason Miller), the priest from the original Exorcist film. Karras, having survived being possessed by the demon Pazuzu, had amnesia and was being cared for by Dr. Temple. After The Gemini Killer's execution, his soul was sent to Karras' comatose body by the demonic forces trying to exact their revenge. As James Venamun, The Gemini Killer sought spiritual guidance from his master, Satan himself, while occupying the body of Damian Karras. Upon transferring his soul into the body, the Gemini Killer proceeded to commit a series of horrific murders, mimicking his previous modus operandi and targeting the victims with ties to the Georgetown exorcism and the individuals who participated in it. It should be noted that the Gemini Killer did not inhabit the body of a child in the movie, but rather the body of the adult priest, Damian Karras. There was, however, a child victim mentioned in the film - Thomas Kintry, who was killed by the Gemini Killer. What makes The Exorcist III stand out is the investigative aspect of the story, which focuses on the character of Lieutenant Kinderman unraveling the mystery of the Gemini Killer's resurrection and possessing Damian Karras' body. As Kinderman delves deeper into the case, he comes to confront the Gemini Killer, who confirms that he is responsible for the recent murders and that he has been acting on demonic orders. Eventually, as Kinderman tries to confront the Gemini Killer and save Karras, an exorcism is performed by another priest, Father Paul Morning (Nicol Williamson). During the exorcism, Karras regains his strength and sacrifices himself to save not only Morning but also to vanquish the demon and the Gemini Killer's plans for destruction."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that played Billy Parker? In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: \\"Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.\\" The track \\"Most of the Time\\", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while \\"What Was It You Wanted?\\" has been interpreted both as a...

How many cents did the candy bar cost? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Determine the total amount John initially paid with. - 4 quarters are worth 4 * 25 cents = 100 cents - 3 dimes are worth 3 * 10 cents = 30 cents - 1 nickel is worth 5 cents So, John initially paid 100 cents + 30 cents + 5 cents = 135 cents. Step 2: Since John received 4 cents back in change, subtract the change from the total amount paid to find the cost of the candy bar. - The cost of the candy bar is 135 cents - 4 cents = 131 cents. Therefore, the candy bar cost 131 cents."},{"instruction":"Answer the question below: When we add more cars to the road the pollution levels decrease or increase?

In this photo, students wait in line to buy tickets for the temple. Can we infer the following? At the Temple of Literature, people usually pray for a dose of academic luck.","output":"Yes, we can infer that at the Temple of Literature, people usually pray for a dose of academic luck. The Temple of Literature, also known as Van Mieu Quoc Tu Giam, is a prominent historical and cultural site in Hanoi, Vietnam. Established in 1070 by Emperor Ly Thanh Tong, it was initially dedicated to Confucius, whose teachings emphasized the importance of education and moral values. Later, in 1076, the Quoc Tu Giam, which was Vietnam's first imperial academy and university, was founded at the same site to educate the nation's elite. Given its long-standing association with education and learning, the Temple of Literature has become a popular place for students and their families to visit and pray for academic success, especially before important examinations. Confucianism, the philosophical and ethical system derived from Confucius, holds education in high regard, emphasizing the cultivation of knowledge, moral character, and personal development. With this in mind, it is not surprising that many Vietnamese people view the temple as a symbol of learning and a source of spiritual support for academic pursuits. The temple complex is divided into five courtyards, and throughout the site, visitors can come across several altars and statues dedicated to Confucius and other influential scholars. Among these, the Thien Quang Well and the Stelae of Doctors are particularly popular spots, where students can make offerings, light incense, and say prayers to ask for blessings and good fortune in their education. In addition to its spiritual significance, the Temple of Literature also serves as a prime example of traditional Vietnamese architecture, featuring exquisite pagodas, gates, and pavilions adorned with intricate decorations and motifs. This historic site thus attracts tourists, historians, and architects alike, in addition to the scores of students and their families. During the summer months leading up to significant exams, the Temple of Literature is known to become especially crowded, as a larger number of students and parents visit to pray for that extra dose of luck and success. This influx of visitors is further corroborated by the reference to students waiting in line to buy tickets for the temple. In conclusion, based on the renowned historical and cultural context of Van Mieu Quoc Tu Giam as a center for education and its associations with Confucian teachings, it is reasonable to infer that the primary reason people visit the Temple of Literature, particularly before major academic evaluations, is to pray for academic luck and blessings."},{"instruction":"Prince Louis Ferdinand Oskar Christian of Prussia (German: \\"Louis Ferdinand Oskar Christian Prinz von Preußen\\"; 25 August 1944 – 11 July 1977), also called Louis Ferdinand II or Louis Ferdinand Jr., nicknamed \\"Lulu\\", was a member of the House of Hohenzollern and the fifth of seven children of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia and his wife, Grand Duchess Kira of Russia.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.

Obese bulldog weighed 28.3 kg and lost a quarter of her body weight on gruelling diet and exercise plan. PDSA Pet Fit Club returns for its ninth year to help slim down the podgiest pets in six months.","output":"Title: Lazy Daisy's Incredible Transformation: Overcoming Obesity and Inspiring Healthy Living for Pets In the quaint town of Middlesborough, lives a lovable bulldog named Daisy, who had captured hearts with her journey from a lethargic, \\"lazy\\" dog to a shining example of healthy pet living. This inspiring transformation wouldn't have been possible without an owner's unwavering love and support or the PDSA Pet Fit Club's guidance to help slim down even the podgiest of pets. Lazy Daisy, as she was adoringly called, was once a 28.3 kg, obese bulldog who would squander her days lying around, refusing to engage in any physical activity. Even at just six years old, she had become alarmingly unfit. Her weight was obviously taking a toll on her heart and joints, paving the way for potential health issues in the future. Always ready to put in the least possible effort, Daisy only willingly exercised when bribed with her favorite treat—ham! Her zeal for movement depended solely on the prospect of a delicious slice waiting for her at the finish line. Fed up with Daisy's lack of motivation and growing unease regarding her health, her owner decided to do something. They turned to the PDSA Pet Fit Club, a program that aims to tackle pet obesity and promote fitness among animals, creating healthier and happier homes. By enrolling Daisy in their ninth annual program, her owner took a crucial step toward a life-changing transformation. For the next six months, Daisy and her owner embarked on a grueling diet and exercise regimen, customized to suit the bulldog's stubborn disposition. The journey wasn't an easy one, as Daisy's old habits proved hard to kick, and bribery with ham took a backseat to rewarding Daisy with love, praise, and cuddles for her progress. Under the advice of the PDSA Pet Fit Club, Daisy's owner introduced her to healthier, tailored meals that helped her maintain the energy needed for her new lifestyle. Even the smallest of adjustments started making a visible difference. Over time, the ham-loving bulldog began developing a taste for nutritious meals, which only served to fuel her big transformation. In tandem with her diet, Daisy commenced a well-rounded exercise routine to shed the excess weight and receive the inherent benefits of an active lifestyle. Walks around the neighborhood turned into long, adventurous strolls across nature trails and parks, maintaining a level of interest that drove Daisy to keep moving. Slowly yet steadily, Daisy embraced exercise as part of her life—a dramatic departure from the lethargic dog she once was. As the six-month program came to an end, the results were nothing short of extraordinary. Daisy had dropped a whopping quarter of her body weight, shedding 7.1 kg—unveiling a slimmer, fitter, and more energetic counterpart of 'Lazy Daisy.' The transformation was stark and inspiring, setting a heartwarming yet powerful example in the fight against pet obesity. Lazy Daisy's incredible journey is a reminder that the issue of pet obesity is one that should not be taken lightly. Chubby and cuddly pets might seem endearing at first, but their well-being is of utmost importance. Programs like the PDSA Pet Fit Club are vital in promoting healthier lifestyles for our beloved pets and educating owners on the risks of pet obesity. After all, a healthy and happy pet ensures a healthier and happier home for everyone involved."},{"instruction":"How is \\"There are two main aspects to take into consideration.\\" said in Romanian?","output":"In Romanian, \\"There are two main aspects to take into consideration\\" can be translated as \\"Sunt două aspecte principale de luat în considerare.\\" Let me explain it better so you can easily understand: - \\"Sunt\\" means \\"there are\\" and shows that we're talking about something that exists or is happening. - \\"două\\" means \\"two\\" and tells us the number of important aspects we're thinking about. - \\"aspecte principale\\" means \\"main aspects\\" and refers to the most important ideas or details about something. - \\"de luat în considerare\\" means \\"to take into consideration\\" and is a way of saying that these aspects should be thought about or examined carefully before making a decision."},{"instruction":"A dohnala tě k tomu pýcha a nenávist.

This option seems the most fitting so far. - punctured: A punctured ball would not be used in a game, so this option is not relevant. - round: While the ball and rim being round is a general characteristic, it doesn't specifically relate to the difficulty of predicting a rebound.

Passage: After the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\" He said he was told his songwriting was \\"not up to par\\", the sound was \\"unlistenable\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\\" However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. According to Cobain, \\"Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that. This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\\"The band members began to have doubts about the record's sound. During this time, Cobain admitted, \\"The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong. The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\\" The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. The producer declined; as he recalled, \\"[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' And I don't think he felt he had that yet ... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope.\\" The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine.

Kayla made sure to mold the wooden table well for Christine's purchase because","output":"she knew how important this table was to her friend. Christine had been searching for the perfect table for months, ever since she’d moved into her new house. She had an image in her mind of a beautiful, handcrafted wooden table, one that would last for generations and be a centerpiece for family gatherings, get-togethers, and heartfelt conversations with friends. Kayla, a skilled woodworker herself, had always been an advocate of quality craftsmanship and had a deep-rooted passion for creating things with her own two hands. She had spent years honing her skills in order to establish a flourishing business. When Christine reached out to her with her request, Kayla knew it was more than just a simple purchase from a friend; she was providing Christine something meaningful that would connect their friendship and families for years to come. It was her way of showing her love and support, while also demonstrating her incredible artistry. Kayla decided to use high-quality, reclaimed wood for the table, as its inherent warmth and character would only add to its charm. She knew that Christine had a beautiful open kitchen with an industrial-chic design, so a blend of rustic and contemporary styles would be the perfect match. The wood was sourced from an old barn that had been taken down in a nearby town; it immediately caught Kayla’s eye for its natural beauty and history. In order to create a one-of-a-kind piece that would stand the test of time, Kayla began by planning out her design meticulously. She envisioned a long, sturdy table, with an elegantly arched base and thick, solid legs that gave it both stability and an air of majesty. The intricate details and embellishments would be understated yet exquisite, hinting at the great care and thought that went into its creation. As she began to work on the table, Kayla quickly realized that her friend’s timeline for the purchase was fast approaching. Christine was hosting a large family dinner in just a few weeks to celebrate her parents' anniversary. To ensure that the table would be ready in time, Kayla immersed herself in the process, working long hours without rest. She painstakingly sanded, carved, and polished the wood, transforming the reclaimed timber into a stunning piece of furniture. As the table started to take shape, Kayla made sure that each corner and edge was perfectly smoothed out. The table had to have a refined, seamless beauty that would catch the light and create an inviting atmosphere in Christine’s home. Every detail was important, from the precise alignment of the wooden planks, to the masterful joinery techniques Kayla employed. This craftsmanship was both a testament to her friend’s refined taste as well as a showcase of her own skill. In the final days leading up to the deadline, Kayla’s dedication never faltered. Although her hands were calloused and her muscles sore, she quietly reveled in the satisfaction of her labor. The table’s incredible transformation was nearing completion, and she was proud of what she had accomplished. With great care, she applied a rich, natural finish to the wood, sealing and protecting it for years to come. On the morning she was meant to deliver the table, Kayla took a step back and admired her handiwork. She had imbued the table with all her love, care, and skill – and it showed. Knowing that she had created not just an ordinary table, but a cherished heirloom, Kayla smiled and thought of the countless memories that would be shared around it. When the day finally arrived for Christine to receive her new wooden table, Kayla knew she had surpassed her friend’s expectations. As they marveled at the table, it became apparent just how special this piece was – the careful craftsmanship, the warm and sturdy wood, and the love that bound the friends together. Kayla felt proud and grateful for the opportunity to create something so significant for her dear friend, and as laughter and conversation filled Christine’s home that night, the table’s presence was the perfect reminder of their connection and the love that united them."},{"instruction":"Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Flat roof.

Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt.

Q: Passage: Although nominally under Seleucid control, Pergamon under Philetaerus enjoyed considerable autonomy. However, upon his succession, Eumenes, perhaps with the encouragement of Ptolemy II, who was at war with the Seleucids, revolted, defeating the Seleucid king Antiochus I near the Lydian capital of Sardis in 261 BC. He was thus able to free Pergamon, and greatly increase the territories under his control. In his new possessions, he established garrison posts in the north at the foot of Mount Ida called Philetaireia after his adoptive father, and in the east, northeast of Thyatira near the sources of the river Lycus, called Attaleia after his grandfather, and he extended his control south of the river Caïcus to the Gulf of Cyme as well. Demonstrating his independence, he began to strike coins with the portrait of Philetaerus, while his predecessor had still depicted Seleucus I Nicator. Link Information: Mount Ida is lightly populated upland massif of about 700 km² located to the north of Edremit. A number of small villages in the region are connected by paths. Drainage is mainly to the south, into the , also known as Edremit Bay, where the coast is rugged and is known as \\"the Olive Riviera.\\". However, the Karamenderes River (the ancient Scamander) flows from the other side of Mount Ida to the west. Its valley under Kaz Dağları has been called \\"the Vale of Troy\\" by English speakers. Currently a modest 2.4 km² of Mount Ida are protected by Kaz Dağı National Park, created in 1993. The summit is windswept and bare with a relatively low tree line due to exposure, but the slopes of this mountain, at the edge of mild Mediterranean and colder central Anatolian climate zones, hold a wealth of endemic flora, marooned here after the Ice Age.

One day when he was a teenager, Eisenheim (played as young man by Aaron Johnson) meets a traveling magician (David Forest) along a road. The magician performs several tricks for him and then, according to various accounts, both the magician and the tree he was sitting under vanish. Eisenheim becomes obsessed with magic tricks after this.He also falls in love with Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen (Biel, played as a young lady by Eleanor Tomlinson ), a noblewoman well above his social class; her parents have hired Eisenheim's father as a cabinetmaker. Young Eisenheim makes Young Sophie a unique marquetry puzzle locket, which if twisted correctly reveals a small, hidden photograph of Eisenheim. Although the two are forbidden to see each other, they meet in a secret hideout chamber in the woods, where Eisenheim tells of his plans to go to China to learn more magic and Sophie promises to go with him. On the day that they are going to leave, however, the police come looking for Sophie. The two hide in the secret room and Sophie begs Eisenheim to make them both disappear. He is unable to fulfill this request and the two are separated.Eisenheim leaves his village to travel the world; he perfects his magic and returns 15 years later as a master illusionist. He meets Sophie at one of his performances, when she is volunteered by the ruthless Crown Prince Leopold as a reluctant participant in a trick.

The coup occurred on January 25, 1971, while Obote was attending a Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Amin, who was serving as commander of the Ugandan Army under President Obote, orchestrated the coup in his absence, seizing control of the government and installing himself as the new head of state. Apollo Milton Obote was Uganda's first post-colonial Prime Minister from 1962 to 1966, and then he served as the President from 1966 until his overthrow in 1971. He played a significant role in Uganda's early post-independence political landscape, leading the country through initial years of nation-building and laying the terms of internal governance. As a founder and leader of the Uganda People's Congress (UPC), Obote's first term focused on finding revenue sources, alleviating poverty, and fostering national unity. However, his consolidation of power, particularly through the 1966 crisis which led to the suspension of the Ugandan Constitution and his shift from prime minister to president, created tensions and vulnerabilities within the government and military. Idi Amin, who was a trusted military confidant of Obote, had risen through the ranks of the armed forces, thanks to his loyalty and effectiveness in implementing military actions against Obote's political rivals. While Obote believed that Amin's loyalty would keep the military in check, Amin's aspirations and ambitions began to cause divisions, eventually leading to the coup in 1971. Amin's ascendancy to power and his brutal regime, which lasted from 1971 to 1979, marked a dark period in Uganda's history. His rule was characterized by widespread human rights abuses, extensive bloodshed, political and ethnic persecution, extrajudicial killings, and the expulsion of minorities, particularly Asians, from the country. Experts estimate that between 100,000 and 500,000 people lost their lives under Amin's regime, making it one of the most horrific and tyrannical periods in Africa's modern history. In 1979, Amin was eventually overthrown by a coalition of Ugandan exiles and the Tanzanian army. Obote, who was living in exile in Tanzania, returned to Uganda in 1980 and was re-elected as the president. However, his second term faced numerous challenges, and he struggled to regain the trust and support of the populace. Obote was ultimately deposed again in 1985 following a military coup led by General Tito Okello. Obote fled to Zambia, where he spent the rest of his life in exile until his death in 2005. Overall, the 1971 coup that brought Idi Amin to power was a destabilizing event in Uganda's history and significantly impacted the political, social, and economic trajectory of the country for decades to come. The reign of these two leaders, Obote and Amin, is a testament to the complexity of post-colonial African politics and the lasting legacies of their time in office."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

How you answer that question predicts what style of music you like, report University of Cambridge psychologists in the journal PLoS ONE. In fact, people's cognitive styles \\"can be a better predictor of what music they like than their personality\\"—such as how neurotic or conscientious they are—the study's lead author, a trained jazz saxophonist, tells Popular Science. To study this, the researchers had more than 4,000 volunteers complete the Empathy Quotient and NEO Personality Inventory-Revised and listen to and rate 50 music excerpts from a library of 26 sub-genres that aimed to mitigate cultural or personal ties to certain songs. They then calculated each person’s scores across five \\"MUSIC\\" dimensions—mellow, unpretentious, sophisticated, intense, and contemporary—and found that cognitive style influences the very genres of music people like (empathizers drift toward \\"mellow\\" and \\"unpretentious\\" music like soft rock and blue grass, while systemizers prefer \\"intense\\" music like punk rock and heavy metal). Even within genres they found differences. Those who scored high as empathizers drift toward music that has low energy or great emotional depth, while the systemizers tend toward music that is high energy or positive. Top songs among empathizers? Jeff Buckley's \\"Hallelujah\\" and Norah Jones' \\"Come Away With Me.\\" The systemizers far prefer Vivaldi's \\"Concerto in C\\" and Metallica's \\"Enter the Sandman.\\" (Check out how '80s metalheads turned out.) Article:","output":"Hey there kiddo! Today, I'm going to talk about something really interesting: how the way people think can help us figure out what kind of music they like. Do you ever notice how some kids at school like to listen to calm songs and others like really loud and fast songs? Well, some smart people at a place called the University of Cambridge wanted to find out why. First, we need to know that there are people called \\"empathizers\\" and others called \\"systemizers\\". Empathizers are people who care a lot about other people's feelings. They understand when others are happy or sad. On the other hand, systemizers are people who like to follow certain rules and find patterns in the world around them. This doesn't mean they don't care about people, though! They just see things a bit differently. The scientists wanted to find out if how people think—like being an empathizer or a systemizer—can tell us about what kind of music they like. They asked more than 4,000 grown-ups to take some tests and listen to different songs. They then looked at how those people scored in five types of music, which they called \\"MUSIC\\": mellow, unpretentious, sophisticated, intense, and contemporary. And guess what they found out? There really is a connection between the way people think and the kind of music they like! People who care about other people's feelings, the empathizers, usually like mellow and unpretentious music, like soft rock and bluegrass. Systemizers, who like patterns and rules, prefer intense music, like punk rock and heavy metal. So, next time you notice your friends' favorite songs, you might be able to find out if they're an empathizer or a systemizer! Just remember, everyone is unique and can like different types of music too."},{"instruction":"Iron mining in the United States produced 42.5 million metric tons of iron ore in 2015, worth US 3.8 billion.

With the help of his assistants the uptight Munk (Wallace Shawn) and the decidedly goofy Mambo (Andy Dick), the Wizard is checking to make sure that all the fairy tales under his care are \\"on track\\" to have their traditional happy endings. As we meet him however, the Wizard is leaving for Scotland for a long-overdue vacation. He leaves the kingdom in the hands of Munk and Mambo.

Her best friend at the palace is Rick (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), the palace dishwasher. Rick takes it upon himself to deliver the invitations to the royal ball to Ella. Ella sees Rick only as a friend, but Rick secretly loves Ella, although he is too cool and proud to admit it. Rick can't really understand what Ella likes about the Prince. Rick's Three Amigos, the comic chefs (all voiced by Phil Proctor, Rob Paulsen and Tom Kenny) in the palace kitchen, believe that Rick has a bad case of \\"Prince envy\\".

The bilateral security agreement (BSA) came into force after a long period of negotiations and aimed to provide the much-needed security and stabilization to the country grappling with insurgency and terrorism. The agreement established a framework for continued United States' military presence in Afghanistan, which has been essential in supporting and training Afghan security forces while conducting counterterrorism operations. This was a crucial development for the Afghan government and the people of Afghanistan, seeking a steady partnership with the United States in their efforts to build a secure and prosperous nation. Since then, both nations have actively collaborated in strengthening the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), targeted operations against the Taliban and terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and efforts in advancing the peace process. Despite the agreement, the initial plan to withdraw virtually all U.S. troops by the end of 2016 loomed over Afghanistan, creating concerns about the country's security situation and its capacity to maintain hard-won gains against insurgent forces. Therefore, the potential extension of the U.S. troop presence beyond 2016, as indicated by Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, could provide much-needed reassurance to Afghanistan's leadership and its people. In the long run, any decision to extend the U.S.' military commitment in Afghanistan will greatly depend on several factors, such as the ANDSF's ability to effectively counter threats, the country's progress in combating corruption, and its efforts to foster a culture of good governance and democracy. It is essential for Afghanistan and the United States to maintain a strong partnership based on trust, cooperation, and mutual respect, so as to ensure a secure and stable future for the war-torn nation."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Dear Annie, I have never written a letter to a newspaper before, I have just never felt the need to do such a thing.

Andhra Pradesh, from which Telangana would be carved, saw protests for and against the new state this year. The final decision to create a new state lies with the Indian parliament. But the state assembly must pass a resolution approving the creation of Telangana. In February, the government decided to set up a committee headed by an ex-chief justice of the Supreme Court of India, BN Srikrishna, to examine the demands for the new state. Mr Srikrishna handed over his report to federal Home Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday. Mr Chidambaram said he would hold consultations with eight recognised political parties of Andhra Pradesh on 6 January after which the \\"report will be made public\\". \\"That is the only way in a democracy and those who respect democracy must also respect the process of democracy,\\" Mr Chidambaram said. Fearing fresh violence in the state after the publication of the report, the government has appealed to the people of Andhra Pradesh to stay calm.

The sentence provided is in Romanian and conveys that the state-owned electricity company of Croatia, HEP (Hrvatska Elektroprivreda), experienced substantial financial losses. The losses amounted to approximately 80 million euros, which could potentially have a significant negative impact on the company's operations, finances, or future growth potential. This information highlights the vulnerability of state-owned utility companies, particularly in the electricity sector, to financial setbacks caused by various factors. These factors can include unfavorable market conditions, inefficient operations, natural disasters, or political decisions having a direct impact on the business. To mitigate such financial risks and losses, it is crucial for utility companies to implement effective risk management strategies that encompass considerations such as market fluctuations, regulatory compliance, infrastructure investments, and environmental conditions.

The Customer Settlements group makes every effort to render accurate invoices on a timely basis. Although issued a day after their scheduled posting, the invoices are still being issued within the 5-business days. {I'd forgotten about Labor Day when I set up the schedule.} Transmission Customers will observe adjustments for an error on in May 2000 Settlement Adjustment invoices that were issued in July. The total adjustment amounted to 2,081,568.11 and was allocated across 2,261,753.08 MWh. Customers may validate their respective adjustments by computing their ratio shares of the 2,081,568.11 using 2,261,753 MWh as the denominator in their respective ratios of their May 2000 load. The reason the denominator of the ratio share appears small is because the pay out of this adjustment is to the Transmission Owners. In order not to assess the TO's a proportionate share of the 2,081,568.11, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment, their withdrawals have been excluded from the ratio share.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" or simply \\"the King\\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string...

A cross-dressing male housekeeper, known as Ms Puppy, has pleaded guilty to beating to death a gay couple from Denver. Daryl Rasmussen, 58, pleaded guilty Friday to counts of second-degree murder. Rasmussen was sentenced to 30 years in prison, and 13 other charges against him – including first-degree murder - were dismissed. Scroll down for video. Guilty: Daryl Rasmussen, 58, known as Ms Puppy, was sentenced to 30 years in prison as part of a plea deal in the double murder of a gay couple. According to prosecutors, Rasmussen bludgeoned to death Ronald Ford, 63, and his long-time boyfriend, 56-year-old Ramiro 'Rome' Sanchez, in their Denver home in late January 2011. The cross-dresser also stole the slain couple's 1997 Dodge Caravan and used their credit cards and identifies. The victims’ bodies were discovered a week apart in mid-February. Both are survived by a number of grown children. Rasmussen, aka Ms Puppy, had been homeless when the Denver couple hired him in 2010 to be a housekeeper and caregiver to Sanchez, who was disabled. Sanchez and Ford were killed in their home in the 120 block of Stuart Street in Denver with blows to the head, according to court documents. Ingrate: Rasmussen (left), who had been homeless, was hired by the couple in 2010 as a housekeeper and a caregiver to Ramiro Sanchez, 56 (right), who was disabled.

Ford's body was found inside the house February 11. Sanchez was discovered a week later hidden in the basement under a pile of bags. Before Sanchez was found dead, it had been suggested that he and Rasmussen may have run away together. Speaking to The Denver Channel in February 2011, Heidi Coleman, one of Ford's four children, said that it was a relief to know that her father's partner of 18 years did not play a part in his murder. Denver Post reported that Daryl Rasmussen fled after the murders but was arrested six months later in Palm Springs, California, after a patron in a local bar overheard him introduce himself as Ms Puppy. In court Friday, Daryl Rasmussen spoke very little, only saying he was sorry for what happened, CBS Denver reported.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Tosca is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias. Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public. Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman called it a \\"shabby little shocker\\"—the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances.","output":"The first name of the person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects, and ideas in Tosca is Giacomo. Giacomo Puccini, an Italian composer, is best known for his operatic works, such as La bohème, Madama Butterfly, and Tosca, in which he masterfully blended lyrical arias, recitative, choruses, and other musical elements into a seamless whole. Inspired by Richard Wagner's use of leitmotifs, Puccini incorporated this technique to represent various characters, objects, and ideas in his opera Tosca, enhancing the plot's coherence and emotional impact. Despite some critics' dismissal of the opera as a simple melodrama, Tosca's powerful score and Puccini's inventive orchestration have earned the work recognition and admiration, making it one of the most frequently performed operas worldwide."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"A: The first step of the process is known as Inhalation or Breathing In. Here is a detailed explanation of the entire process: 1. Inhalation (Breathing In): This is the first step in the process of respiration. Inhalation occurs when we take in fresh air containing oxygen from the environment into our body. It starts with the diaphragm muscle (located below the lungs) and the intercostal muscles (located between the ribs) contracting, which results in the expansion of the chest cavity and a decrease in pressure. This pressure difference causes air to move into the lungs through the nose or mouth, passing through the pharynx and larynx. 2. Air travels down the trachea: Once the air enters the respiratory system, it travels down the trachea (windpipe) which is a tube that connects the upper respiratory system to the lower respiratory system. The trachea is lined with mucus and tiny hair-like structures called cilia that help filter out dust, bacteria, and other unwanted particles. 3. Air goes down the bronchi and bronchioles: The trachea splits into two main branches known as the left and right bronchi, which further divide into smaller tubes called bronchioles. These bronchioles continue to branch and become smaller until they finally end in tiny air sacs called alveoli. 4. Gas exchange in the alveoli: Inside the alveoli, oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through the thin walls of the alveoli and capillaries and enters the red blood cells in the bloodstream. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide (a waste product of cellular respiration) diffuses from the bloodstream into the alveoli. 5. Oxygen transport by the circulatory system: The oxygenated blood is then transported by the red blood cells throughout the body via the circulatory system. It reaches cells and tissues where the oxygen is used for cellular respiration – a process that generates energy for the cells to function. 6. Exhalation (Breathing Out): After the oxygen is used by the cells, the carbon dioxide produced as a waste product needs to be removed from the body. The carbon dioxide-rich blood returns to the lungs, where it releases the carbon dioxide into the alveoli. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, which in turn causes the chest cavity to shrink and increase the pressure inside the lungs. This pressure difference forces the air containing the carbon dioxide to be expelled from the body through the mouth or nose during exhalation. In summary, the first step of the process is inhalation, where fresh air containing oxygen is taken in from the environment. This is followed by the air traveling through the respiratory system, gas exchange occurring in the alveoli, and oxygen being transported to the cells. Finally, the process ends with exhalation, where carbon dioxide is expelled from the body."},{"instruction":"Can you imagine a world without the Internet?It's surprising to think about it Now,China has more than 162 million Internet users,according to the China Internet Network Information Center. This is the second highest number of user in the world after the United States. Today,66% of Chinese \\"netizens \\"are teenagers. \\"They spend about thirteen hours every week online,\\"said Qian Hulin,an Internet expert . Doctor Song in Beijing Xuanwu Hospital said about 14% of Chinese netizens who are teens often lasted over ten hours to play online games. The main reasons why teenagers surf the Web are to search for information,to communicate with others and to have fun. On the Internet,teenagers can find out almost everything. And surfing the Web can help students with their homework and widen their knowledge. Li Dong,a teacher at No. 41 Middle School in Shijiazhuang,likes her students to use the Internet. \\"When we talk in class,students who surf the Net usually know more background information than the others,\\"she said. In addition,people can use the Internet to write letters or stories and send emails. Many teens keep in touch with their friends online. It is cheaper than phoning somebody far away and also much quicker. ,,. (1,5) Which way is the cheapest and quickest to learn something about friends far away? A) Giving them a call. B) Going to see them. C) Writing a letter to them. D) Sending emails to them. Answer:","output":"D) Sending emails to them. In a world without the Internet, the way we communicate, find information, and entertain ourselves would be vastly different. Before the advent of the Internet, people relied on traditional means of communication such as face-to-face conversations, phone calls, and handwritten letters to stay in touch with friends and family. The exchange of information was much slower and less convenient compared to today's digital age. Considering the statistics provided on China's Internet users, it is clear that a significant portion of the population relies on the World Wide Web for various activities. Today’s generation of Chinese teenagers, who are actively using the Internet, spends an average of thirteen hours a week online. This clearly shows the role the Internet plays in their lives, allowing them to search for information, communicate with others, and have fun. Dr. Song's observation of teenagers spending more than ten hours playing online games highlights the Internet's function as an entertainment platform. Moreover, the benefits of the Internet also extend to educational arenas. Teacher Li Dong's statement about how students who surf the Net have more background knowledge indicates that the Internet can be an invaluable learning tool. In addition to its educational benefits, the Internet also enables cheap and quick communication with friends far away. Among the various ways to stay in touch with friends, such as making a phone call, visiting in person, or writing a letter, sending emails stands out as the most cost-effective and efficient method. This virtual form of communication not only saves time and money on phone bills and postage stamps but also provides instantaneous connections allowing users to send and receive messages almost instantly. In conclusion, if we were to imagine a world without the Internet, our communication would be slower, and the process of obtaining information would be much less efficient. The traditional ways of staying in touch with friends and learning about them, like phone calls or writing letters, are more time-consuming and expensive than sending emails. Therefore, in a world with the Internet, sending emails is the cheapest and quickest way to learn about friends far away."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve -139*u + 142*u = -15 for u. And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation -139*u + 142*u = -15 for the variable u, follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine the like terms on the left side of the equation. The left side of the equation has two terms with the variable u: -139*u and 142*u. -139*u + 142*u = (142 - 139)*u = 3*u Now the equation is: 3*u = -15 Step 2: Solve for u by isolating the variable. To isolate u, we need to get rid of the coefficient (3) that is multiplying the variable. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3. (3*u) / 3 = (-15) / 3 The left side simplifies to u since (3*u) / 3 = u: u = -15 / 3 Step 3: Simplify the right side of the equation. Now, we just need to simplify the right side of the equation: u = -5 And the answer is: u = -5 So the solution to the equation -139*u + 142*u = -15 is u = -5."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: who is the number one person followed on instagram?","output":"As of my current knowledge update in September 2021, the number one person with the most followers on Instagram is Portuguese professional footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. However, it is essential to note that the number of followers and social media statistics change regularly, thus this information may no longer be accurate when viewed at a later date. Cristiano Ronaldo, born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers in the history of the sport. He has gained immense fame and popularity due to his exceptional skills and dedication on the field, resulting in millions of fans following him across social media platforms. On Instagram, Cristiano Ronaldo shares pictures and videos of his personal life, soccer career, workout routines, charity initiatives, brand endorsements, and family moments. Ronaldo began his professional football career with Sporting CP in Portugal before moving to Manchester United in 2003. During his time with Manchester United, he won several titles, including three Premier League titles, one FA Cup, two Football League Cups, and a UEFA Champions League title. In 2009, he was transferred to Real Madrid for a then-world record fee. Ronaldo's stay at Real Madrid was incredibly successful, and he helped the team secure numerous domestic and international trophies, breaking several individual and team records along the way. These achievements include two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey trophies, four UEFA Champions League titles, and three UEFA Super Cups, among others. Cristiano Ronaldo then moved to Juventus in 2018, where he continued his winning ways by claiming two Serie A titles and two Supercoppa Italiana trophies. In 2021, Ronaldo made a surprising return to Manchester United, further adding to his legendary status. For his individual accolades, Ronaldo has been awarded the FIFA World Player of the Year/Ballon d'Or five times, which highlights his outstanding talent and contribution to football. With his numerous achievements, extraordinary playing ability, and global appeal, it's no wonder Cristiano Ronaldo enjoys a massive following on Instagram. Despite being the number one person followed at the moment, it is essential to keep in mind that these rankings can change over time as different personalities gain or lose followers.

Problem: In an office, 30 percent of the workers have at least 5 years of service, and a total of 16 workers have at least 10 years of service. If 90 percent of the workers have fewer than 10 years of service, how many of the workers have at least 5 but fewer than 10 years of service? Let's break down the given information: 1. 30% of workers have at least 5 years of service. 2. 16 workers have at least 10 years of service. 3. 90% of workers have fewer than 10 years of service. Now let's use this information to find the number of workers with at least 5 but fewer than 10 years of service. Let the total number of workers be x. According to the given information, 90% of workers have fewer than 10 years of service. So the remaining 10% of workers have 10 or more years of service. Since 16 workers have at least 10 years of service, we can write it as: 16 = 0.1 * x (10% of workers have 10 or more years of service) x = 16 / 0.1 x = 160 (total number of workers) Now we know that 30% of workers have at least 5 years of service, which is: 0.3 * 160 = 48 workers We need to find the number of workers with at least 5 but fewer than 10 years of service. This will be the workers with at least 5 years of service minus the workers with at least 10 years of service. Number of workers with at least 5 but fewer than 10 years of service = 48 (workers with 5 or more years of service) - 16 (workers with 10 or more years of service) = 32 workers So, 32 workers have at least 5 but fewer than 10 years of service, which is not among the given options.

Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events.

David Frum: Survey indicates that they are less trusting, patriotic, more alienated. Some say social trust declines as a community becomes more ethnically diverse. Frum: As U.S. becomes more ethnically diverse, will diversity be a source of strength? Article:","output":"Title: Millennials: The Powerhouse of Diversity and Democratic Preferences Introduction A recent Pew report has highlighted the political inclination of millennials, making it clear that this dynamic generation is most likely to vote Democratic. The findings sparked discussions on the state of trust, patriotism, and alienation, as well as the impact of ethnic diversity on social trust within communities. Prolific political commentator David Frum weighed in on the matter, and further examined the role of diversity in strengthening the United States, now and in the future. Millennials and Democratic Voting The Pew report is indicative of the changing tides in the United States political landscape, as millennials - born between 1981 and 1996 - are increasingly leaning towards the Democratic Party. This generation, known for their progressive views, are shaping the future of politics, with their overwhelming preference for policies that focus on social justice, climate change, and economic equality. Millennials' support for the Democratic platform could have significant and lasting effects on long term political trends. Less Trusting, Less Patriotic, and More Alienated According to David Frum, the survey results revealed that millennials are less trusting, less patriotic, and more alienated than their older counterparts. This is attributed to a variety of factors, ranging from global economic insecurities to the globalization of technology. These findings raise concerns about how the millennial cohort will impact the overall fabric of society, including the levels of trust and cohesion between communities. Ethnic Diversity and Social Trust A common argument against multiculturalism is that social trust tends to decrease as communities become more ethnically diverse. Critics argue that people are more likely to trust and interact with others who share similarities - including language, culture, and ethnicity - leading to less cohesive and integrated communities. However, this idea neglects to consider the benefits that diversity brings to the table, in terms of innovation, creativity and economic prosperity. Frum highlights the critical question: \\"As the United States becomes more ethnically diverse, will diversity be a source of strength?\\" To many millennials, the answer is a resounding \\"yes.\\" They see diversity as an essential component of a prosperous and multicultural society, one in which all individuals can contribute their unique skills and perspectives. The Power of Diversity Evidence has consistently demonstrated that diverse societies enjoy numerous benefits, such as increased creativity, enhanced problem-solving abilities, and an enriched cultural landscape. Diversity encourages individuals to challenge their preconceived notions, fostering a more inclusive and tolerant mindset. It also cultivates an environment of learning, growth, and mutual respect. In line with this evidence, millennials see the value in nurturing diversity and recognize its potential to strengthen the United States as a whole. Moreover, the Democratic Party has increasingly incorporated the importance of diversity into their policies and messaging, further solidifying the connection between millennials and the party. Conclusion The Pew report sheds light on the political preferences of millennials and ignites conversations surrounding diversity, social trust, and the future of the United States. Although there is a widely-held belief that diverse societies experience lower levels of trust, millennials have proven time and again their belief in the power of diversity, and are driving the Democratic Party's embrace of multicultural policies. As the United States continues to diversify generationally and ethnically, this generation's values may prove crucial in promoting a more inclusive, accepting and prosperous society."},{"instruction":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: Who does Rahul propose to? his girlfriend, Nafisa Answer:","output":"Step 1: Establish the main characters and setting To begin, it is essential to establish the main characters in the story: Rahul and Nafisa. Additionally, we will introduce other characters like their friends, family, and perhaps a rival. The story will take place in a metropolitan city in India. Step 2: Introduce the characters' backgrounds and create an emotional connection The plot begins with an introduction of Rahul and Nafisa's relationship. They have been dating for two years and deeply love each other. Rahul is a hardworking software engineer who values his career, while Nafisa is an aspiring writer with a creative mind. Both families are aware of their relationship and are supportive. Step 3: Introduce a complication or challenge Rahul receives an opportunity to work for a renowned software company in another country – an opportunity he has always dreamt of. However, this would mean being away from Nafisa for a significant amount of time. This brings tension to their relationship, as Nafisa worries about the future of their relationship as a long-distance couple. Step 4: Further develop the characters through subplots Here, we can introduce subplots involving Rahul and Nafisa's friends and family members. For instance, Rahul's best friend might be going through a messy divorce, making Rahul realize he doesn't want to lose Nafisa. On the other hand, Nafisa's mother, who initially supported their relationship, now expresses her doubts about Rahul's commitment, given his decision to move abroad. Step 5: Build suspense around Rahul's decision As the days go by, Rahul becomes increasingly conflicted about his impending move. Nafisa tries to be supportive, but her heartbreak is visible. Rahul, in turn, has second thoughts about accepting the position abroad. Step 6: The climax and resolution Ultimately, Rahul decides that Nafisa's love is worth more than his dream job. He turns down the offer and focuses on building a future with Nafisa in their hometown. Deeply touched by Rahul's sacrifice, Nafisa's mother withdraws her concerns about their relationship. Step 7: The proposal To conclude the plot, Rahul plans a romantic evening with Nafisa at the site of their first date. During a private fireworks display, Rahul gets down on one knee and proposes to Nafisa. Overwhelmed with emotion and love, Nafisa accepts his proposal, and they share a passionate kiss as the fireworks light up the sky. In summary, the movie plot revolves around Rahul's challenging decision between pursuing his dream job abroad and committing to a future with his girlfriend, Nafisa. The plot highlights the power of love, the sacrifices we make for the people we care about, and how the people surrounding us can help shape our decisions."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

The reasoning behind this answer is as follows: Dodo birds were flightless birds that went extinct in the late 17th century due to human activities like hunting and habitat destruction, along with introduction of invasive species by humans. Since they are extinct, it is impossible to dance with a dodo bird.

The cough of Carrie is very bad, so Lindsey recommends Nyquil.","output":"The persistent, hacking cough of Carrie is distressing and has been keeping her up for countless nights, resulting in her feeling exhausted and run-down. Her symptoms have only become worse over the past few days, with the nagging cough now accompanied by a stuffy nose and persistent headaches. Observing the discomfort that Carrie is enduring, her concerned friend Lindsey empathizes with the situation and offers a solution that she hopes will relieve her friend's misery. Taking Carrie's situation to heart, Lindsey recommends the over-the-counter medication Nyquil as a potential remedy for her affliction. As a nighttime cold and flu relief medicine, Nyquil is known to alleviate the common symptoms plaguing Carrie, such as her cough, congestion, runny nose, as well as any aches and pains that she may be experiencing. Lindsey explains to Carrie that Nyquil contains various active ingredients - like acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, and doxylamine succinate - which work together to provide multi-symptom relief. With this in mind, Lindsey advises Carrie to take Nyquil before heading to bed, as it will not only help dampen her cough, but may also relieve her nasal congestion and ease her overall discomfort. She also highlights the importance of adhering to the recommended dosage and following the directions on the bottle to ensure a safe and effective usage of the medication. Additionally, Lindsey cautions Carrie that, due to the sedating nature of the antihistamine component present in Nyquil, she should make sure that there are no other activities planned once she takes the medicine, as it can make her feel drowsy and fall asleep relatively quickly. However, Lindsey also stresses the importance of seeing a doctor if Carrie's symptoms continue to persist or worsen despite taking the medication, as this might signal an underlying health problem that requires professional care. In conclusion, Lindsey recommends Nyquil to Carrie with the hopes that it will succeed in alleviating her disruptive cough, as well as the other cold and flu symptoms plaguing her. As a caring friend, Lindsey wants nothing more than to see Carrie regain her health, energy, and well-being, which she believes is achievable with the help of Nyquil, alongside proper rest and following the right treatment."},{"instruction":"This task is about translating a given Yoruba language sentence to English.

This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne.

Not likely -- not any time soon, at least. And while the mind-controlled set we saw last year was certainly cool, it didn't offer much in the way of accuracy. This Eye-Control TV, on the other hand, certainly takes a step in the right direction. To use the set, you sit in front of a black rectangular sensor positioned at chest height. There's some calibration involved when moving from person to person, chasing a circle around the screen with your eyes. Once calibrated, you're good to go. You use your eyes for basic TV controls -- changing channels, adjusting the volume, things like that. Switching involves looking at an element of the screen and giving a big blink to select -- the display seems adjusted in such a way that normal blinks won't trigger it, so you're less likely to accidentally set something off. You look down to adjust the volume. A control panel will show up, and from there, you can move the slider left or right by looking at the volume up and volume down icons -- you can also select mute from here. To change channels, look at the top left-hand corner of the screen and blink. That'll bring up a UI featuring large pictures of videos. Look at one and blink at it to select it. The system can also be used to view and toggle between still images. The use of pictures certainly seems the most intuitive method for navigating around videos -- there's a definite learning curve here, and it's hard enough to select pictures -- we couldn't really imagine toggling through small text. As with the transparent television, this doesn't feel quite ready for market -- it's a compelling concept, none the less.

The Eye Control TV, by Chinese manufacturer Haier, comes with an admittedly bulky device that you place in front of your TV, and with a determined blink of your eyes you can change channels, change the volume, or power your television off. The eye-sensing technology relies on a Kinect-style sensor sat on your table, and Haier says your standard blinks will not interrupt your scheduled viewing. Scroll down for video No more lost remotes: The prototype sensor sits in front of the television, responding to blinks from the couch potato Blinks can bring up a menu bar, with a slide of your head allowing you to adjust the volume The sensor sits in front of you and needs calibration the first time you run it, which involves chasing a circle around the screen with your eyes. After that, long blinks activate the sensor, bringing up an on-screen display. Looking downwards brings up the volume controls, which you can then adjust by looking at the plus and minus signs. Meanwhile, other menus allow you to switch channels and glide between still images. Engadget tested the equipment at the IFA technology conference in Berlin this week and called it a 'compelling concept', although not quite ready for market, partly for the slight learning curve and the coffee-table-dominating sensor. The sensor is not likely to improve the appearance of your coffee table, but it might make a good talking point ... unless there's something worth watching instead New ways of controlling the TV are beginning to overtake the old infra-red remotes that currently dominate the coffee table.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences can be considered as paraphrases of each other, but with subtle differences in emphasis and arrangement. They both convey the same core idea that there is a family of languages present in a specific region of New Guinea. However, there are some variations in the structure and focus of each sentence. Let's break them down to better understand their similarities and differences: 1. The Madang languages are a family of languages in New Guinea - stock on the Rai - coast. In this sentence, the main emphasis is on the Madang languages, which are described as a family of languages. The location of these languages is specified as New Guinea, further narrowed down to the Rai Coast. Here, the term \\"stock\\" is used, potentially implying a linguistic grouping based on shared ancestry or some sort of relationship between these languages. 2. The languages of the Rai coast are a family of languages in Madang - continent of New Guinea. This sentence focuses more on the languages spoken in the Rai Coast region, presenting them as a family of languages found in Madang – a region within the continent of New Guinea. Unlike the first sentence, this version emphasizes the location (Rai Coast) over the specific linguistic classification (Madang languages). Additionally, this sentence explicitly mentions \\"continent of New Guinea,\\" specifying the broader geographical context. In summary, both sentences convey the idea that there is a family of languages associated with Madang in New Guinea, predominantly found in the Rai Coast region. The primary difference lies in the focus and arrangement of information, with the first sentence centering on the Madang languages and the second one emphasizing the languages of the Rai Coast. Overall, they can be considered paraphrases due to their conveying of similar core messages while using a slightly different structure and linguistic focus."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN; Kyjitai: Shinjitai: \\"\\" or \\"Nippon Kaigun\\", \\"Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire\\") was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1868 until 1945, when it was dissolved following Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II. It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff and the Ministry of the Navy, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) was formed after the dissolution of the IJN. - Frank Jack Fletcher (April 29, 1885 April 25, 1973) was an admiral in the United States Navy during World War II. Fletcher was the operational commander at the pivotal Battles of Coral Sea and of Midway. As a lieutenant, Fletcher was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in battle at Veracruz. He was the nephew of Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, who was also awarded the Medal of Honor for actions at Veracruz. - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Raymond Ames Spruance (July 3, 1886 December 13, 1969) was a United States Navy admiral in World War II. - The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea, the United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz, Frank Jack Fletcher, and Raymond A. Spruance decisively defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto, Chuichi Nagumo, and Nobutake Kondo near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. Military historian John Keegan called it \\"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare.\\" - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - Midway Atoll (also called Midway Island and Midway Islands; Hawaiian: \\"Pihemanu Kauihelani\\") is a atoll in the North Pacific Ocean at . As its name suggests, Midway is roughly equidistant between North America and Asia. Midway Atoll is an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the United States. Midway continues to be the only island in the Hawaiian archipelago that is not part of the state of Hawaii. Unlike the other Hawaiian islands, Midway observes Samoa Time (i.e., eleven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time), which is one hour behind the time in the state of Hawaii. For statistical purposes, Midway is grouped as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands. The Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, encompassing of land and water (mostly water) in the surrounding area, is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The refuge and most of its surrounding area are part of the larger Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument. - Pearl Harbor is a lagoon harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, west of Honolulu. Much of the harbor and surrounding lands is a United States Navy deep-water naval base. It is also the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. The U.S. government first obtained exclusive use of the inlet and the right to maintain a repair and coaling station for ships here in 1887. The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941 was the immediate cause of the United States' entry into World War II. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for providing power projection, using the mobility of the United States Navy, by Congressional mandate, to deliver rapidly, combined-arms task forces on land, at sea, and in the air. The U.S. Marine Corps is one of the four armed service branches in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest-ranking military officer in the U.S. armed forces, is a Marine Corps general. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - Yamamoto held several important posts in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and undertook many of its changes and reorganizations, especially its development of naval aviation. He was the commander-in-chief during the decisive early years of the Pacific War and so was responsible for major battles such as Pearl Harbor and Midway. He died when American codebreakers identified his flight plans and his plane was shot down. His death was a major blow to Japanese military morale during World War II. - The attack on Pearl Harbor, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, and Operation Z during planning, was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Sir John Desmond Patrick Keegan (15 May 1934 2 August 2012) was a British military historian, lecturer, writer and journalist. He was the author of many published works on the nature of combat between the 14th and 21st centuries concerning land, air, maritime, and intelligence warfare, as well as the psychology of battle. - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known. - The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought during 48 May 1942, was a major naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and naval and air forces from the United States and Australia. The battle was the first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other, as well as the first in which neither side's ships sighted or fired directly upon the other. - Lofton R. Henderson ( May 24 , 1903 -- June 4 , 1942 ) was a marine aviator in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. He was the Commanding Officer of Marine Scout Bombing Squadron 241 ( VMSB - 241 ) at the Battle of Midway and is recognized as the first Marine Aviator to die during that battle while leading his squadron to attack the Japanese carrier forces .

What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The first step of the process in recycling is the collection of items that are able to be reused. This is typically done by recycling trucks that pick up recyclable materials from designated collection points, such as residential homes, businesses, and public recycling bins. The purpose of this initial step is to gather all the materials that can be potentially repurposed and to divert them from ending up in landfills or other non-recyclable waste streams. During this collection phase, people are encouraged to separate their recyclable items from their regular waste, which helps to make the process of sorting and recycling more efficient later on. In many communities, recycling services are provided by local municipalities or specialized waste management companies who have dedicated trucks for the transportation and collection of these materials. There are various types of recyclable materials that can be collected, including paper, plastic, glass, metal, and more. In order to facilitate the recycling process, it is important to properly clean and sort these items before placing them in designated recycling bins. This is because contamination or improper sorting can lead to a lower quality of the recycled end product, or make certain materials non-recyclable altogether. Once the recycling trucks have collected the items that are able to be reused, these materials are then transported to a recycling plant. This marks the beginning of the next steps in the recycling process, including sorting, breaking down, melting, and repurposing the raw materials in these collected items to create new products. In conclusion, the first step in the recycling process is the collection of recyclable materials by recycling trucks. This crucial stage serves to gather materials that can be repurposed, ensuring that they don't end up in landfills or other non-recyclable waste streams, and ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly system of waste management."},{"instruction":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Joe Clyde Daniels (Courtesy: Tennesee Bureau of Investigation) ||||| NASHVILLE – A joint investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the Dickson County Sheriff’s Office has resulted in the arrest of the father of Joe Clyde Daniels, the five-year-old who has been the subject of an Endangered Child Alert this week. Joe Clyde Daniels was reported missing by his parents the morning of Wednesday, April 4th. At the request of the Dickson County Sheriff’s Office, the TBI issued an Endangered Child Alert, and law enforcement agencies, search and rescue organizations, and citizen volunteers began an exhaustive search in the area of his residence. On April 6th, at the request of 23rd District Attorney General Ray Crouch, TBI Agents opened an investigation into criminal conduct. During the course of the investigation, and after a three-day search, it was determined that the child’s father, Joseph Daniels, intentionally killed his son sometime during the night of April 3-4, in their residence and then hid his son’s body. On the morning of April 7th, TBI Agents arrested Joseph Ray Daniels (DOB 10-16-89) and charged him with one count of criminal homicide. Daniels was booked into the Dickson County Jail on a 1,000,000 bond.

There were no interactions between the family and DCS in the last three years, spokesman Rob Johnson said. Daniels does not appear to have a history of arrests, according to public records. He was booked into the Dickson County jail Saturday where he is being held on a 1 million bond. Joe Clyde had wandered off his family's property outside Nashville in the past. Those previous incidents prompted calls to authorities, and led investigators to initially believe the same situation occurred again, though foul play was never ruled out. Joe Clyde was first reported missing on Wednesday at 7 a.m., said TBI, which added the boy was wearing pajamas when he went missing. Daniels called 911 to report his son missing and told a dispatcher the boy must have unlocked the door and wandered off. A substantial search effort was immediately launched, with law enforcement using equipment to search nearby ponds, fields and wooded areas. At least 250 volunteers joined search parties and covered a carefully mapped grid in the area around the property in recent days. Investigators said they received “credible” information the child was spotted early Wednesday morning about 100 yards from his house. The boy was walking near Garners Creek Road when a passerby saw him, investigators said. On Friday, Bledsoe reported a sign of hope when a footprint was found near a creek about three miles south of where Joe Clyde was reported missing. Volunteers gathered at Friendship Baptist Church on Highway 70 Friday, April 6, 2018 to search for missing 5-year-old Joe Clyde Daniels. About 253 volunteers signed in to participate, 158 were assigned to teams. (Photo: Kelly Fisher / For the Dickson Herald) As the search continued to unfold, the community rallied and volunteers prayed the blonde-haird, blue-eyed boy would be found. Bledsoe said on Saturday he was not surprised, but \\"impressed\\" by the community support. A vigil for Joe Clyde is planned for 5:30 p.m. on Sunday at Friendship Baptist Church. The church served as a staging area for volunteers during the search. The community flooded the church with food and supplies. Because the investigation is ongoing, many details surrounding the boy's death remain unknown. At a news conference on Saturday, investigators did not reveal the break that shifted the case into a criminal investigation.

In 1965, a young Mossad agent Rachel Singer on her first field assignment arrives in East Berlin to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz and Stefan Gold. Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel—infamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War II—and bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as a married couple from Argentina and Rachel becomes a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. At a doctor appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in an ambulance. They attempt to leave by train, but Vogel awakens and sounds the horn of the van where he is being held, alerting guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to save the compromised Rachel. The agents have no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction.

Conscripts and contract soldiers should be given a thorough physical examination looking for tattoos in intimate places, the Defense Ministry's central administration recommends.

Other laws that the","output":"Russian government has implemented to maintain discipline within its military ranks include strict regulations on alcohol consumption, drug use, and gambling. These measures are designed to ensure that soldiers remain focused on their duties and maintain a high level of physical and mental fitness. While such regulations may be intended to improve the overall discipline and performance of the military, critics argue that examining tattoos as a means of identifying homosexuality is an invasive and discriminatory practice. Human rights organizations have expressed concerns that these measures could further marginalize Russia's LGBT community and lead to false accusations or unfair treatment of soldiers on the basis of their appearance. In response to these concerns, some experts suggest that the Russian military place greater emphasis on inclusive policies and training to promote understanding and tolerance among soldiers. This could involve educating military personnel about the differing cultural, religious, and sexual identity backgrounds of their comrades, as well as implementing clear anti-discrimination policies. In conclusion, while it is crucial for any military force to maintain discipline and high performance standards, the specific criteria used to identify potential issues should not infringe on individual privacy or propagate discrimination.

As someone who’s quit in a flamboyant way – and then compounded the drama by writing about quitting in both memoir and in fiction – I’ve spent a lot of time thinking: what might drive someone to that moment? Is it ever the right thing to do? The logical answer to the latter question seems pretty obvious: probably not. Not only did Greene hang all her co-workers out to dry, forcing them to scramble to cover for her as she got her moment of satisfaction, but she’s also marked herself as a loose cannon. She’s now someone who, in the most fundamental way, can’t be trusted as a teammate. It’s fun to quit, certainly, but would you ever want to be the next person to hire a quitter? On the other hand, sometimes quitting is the only appropriate response: when an employer’s in the wrong, say, or when you have a valid point to make and you need to make it in a very public way. Other times, it’s the right thing to do for more complicated reasons. Quitting can show coworkers or colleagues who don’t quite have the gumption to get out of obviously bad situations that it can be done; it can inspire others to have the courage to change their lot, maybe in less brazen, more incremental ways. Maybe that’s why we’re so fascinated by people who say “fuck it”: they speak to the tiny part of all of us that wishes we could say be so honest and so irresponsible in any number of situations, any number of times a day. But refusing to give in to those impulses is what keeps society functioning, and what makes us – as individuals – adults. In 2007, I quit my job at Gawker – which was then a New York-specific media gossip site – by essentially saying “fuck it”. I said it far less succinctly than Greene did, though, in a long, digressive blog post in which I echoed concerns raised by a piece that had recently run in the magazine n+1: that Gawker, once a useful gadfly that irritated the powerful, had become a bully more powerful than the institutions it mocked. I then compounded the faux pas of quitting that way by running my mouth off to anyone who asked: media reporters whose work I’d been in the business of shredding were only too willing to mock my hasty, immature decision. (It’s taken my former boss, the site co-founder Nick Denton, many years to forgive me – though, actually, I’m still not quite sure he has. But then, I’ve also never quite apologized, and I’m not exactly apologizing now.) Looking back, it’s easy for me to view my fuck-it moment as a rookie mistake – the kind of thing only a 26-year-old who doesn’t understand that actions have consequences would do. I wanted to make a big ideological point, and I had but one weapon in my arsenal: a pulpit that I could use to denounce the very thing that had given me a voice. Unfortunately, I lost that weapon as soon as I used it, like a bee that dies in the act of stinging. I don’t know that I would have quit if I’d understood then how much it would deform the next few years of my life. I succeeded on my own terms as a freelancer and an author, but I also failed to secure any of the steady, full-time, paycheck-y gigs that every writer (save maybe Edward St Aubyn) needs. The reason? Well, if I had to guess, it was that no one was quite prepared to trust me. It took years before I worked another full-time job. I hope that Charlo Greene is enjoying her new, more self-determined career path, and that she isn’t listening to the people who are questioning her decision, after her on-air performance inevitably went as viral as it did on Monday. We don’t know exactly what Greene’s workplace was like, or the other choices that were available to her. We can guess at her motivations, but it’s probably good to recognize that we’re inevitably projecting our own workplace neuroses onto someone we really don’t know much about at all. Hopefully, she’s listening to the people who find her inspiring and liberating, and not to the people who put her down for being “unprofessional”. The satisfaction of quitting is real, but it’s fleeting. More lasting satisfaction comes from slowly, painstakingly creating a career path that lets you be true to yourself, whether you’re a pot-loving activist or a writer with various axes to grind. But I also hope that she’ll find her way, as I’ve tried to do, towards a different kind of future – one where she gets the kind of work that doesn’t make her want to say “fuck it” every day. Because we all want to say it; we just shouldn’t have to. ||||| Early in the evening of the day I became Facebook friends with James Frey, Choire and I found ourselves standing on Chrystie Street, unloading boxes of n+1's Winter 2008 issue (\\"Mainstream\\") from a very large Budget rental truck. We did this in a fit of perversity. n+1 editor Keith Gessen had driven the truck from the Ingram warehouse in Pennsylvania earlier in the day, accompanied by an n+1 intern that he'd been \\"mentoring.\\" There were six pallets. As usual, the issue's contributors had been invited to the box-unloading party, and so we staggered, box-laden, past the likes of little Ben Kunkel, wearing his noticeably-heeled boots even for this athletic activity. Probably more people came later for the beer-drinking part of the evening. But we missed that part because, when the truck was fully unloaded, we hopped into it with Keith to return it to the Budget lot in Brooklyn. On the way there, Keith turned up a narrow street and smashed a taillight and a bit of the back end of a minivan that would turn out to belong to an Orthodox Jewish lawyer. Keith handled himself remarkably well in this crisis, though he did later blame the accident on me: \\"You make me nervous,\\" he said, his voice getting high-pitched and muppety for a second. At the time of the accident we'd been talking about Keith's book \\"All The Sad Young Literary Men,\\" which Viking will publish in April. Jonathan Franzen had said that reading Keith's book made him wish to be a young man again. And last night, Choire quoted a friend of his who's reading a galley of the book as saying that the book was a cautionary tale. [The friend had written: \\"I just started reading Keith Gessen's novel — irritating of course, it's the n+1 world, where women are mere accessories, but not bad! But SUCH a cautionary tale.... To me it's screaming *Get out of NY before it's too late*!!! Or, shrink your life in NY... stop going to all those lame competitive parties. Look, I always liked Sloane Crosley too, but when the fact that she is *nice* is the subject of an Observer article, that is a culture in deep, deep decline.\\"] Keith didn't understand how the book could be a cautionary tale. Not having read the book, it's impossible to say with any certainty whether it would make me want to be a young man or whether it would make me want to leave New York. While Keith was writing a note for the minivan's owner, I had time to flip through n+1 issue 8. In it, Wesley Yang writes about Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho, and of other \\"essentially unlovable\\" people, including himself: Jasper once told me that I was \\"essentially unloveable.\\" I've always held that observation close to my heart, turning to it often. It's true of some people—that there's no reason anyone should love or care about them, because they aren't appealing on the outside, and that once you dig into the real person beneath the shell (if, for some obscure if not actively perverse reason, you bother), you find the real inner ugliness. Identifying with a serial killer is uncomfortable, maybe as uncomfortable as identifying with the pretty girls who rejected his advances. The essay puts its reader in both roles. Wesley's refusal to shy away from the kind of \\"rude question\\" that \\"affects to inquire into what everyone gets to know at the cost of forever leaving it unspoken\\" makes 'The Face of Seung-Hui Cho' an exercise in revolutionary honesty. In the Budget truck, I also had time to read most of Carla Blumenkranz's review, 'In Search of Gawker.' Carla went back into the Gawker archives to trace the site's evolution from Elizabeth Spiers' first post in 2002 to the decadent Gawker of today. \\"Reading through the early Gawker archives means watching Spiers receive and record her New York education,\\" Carla writes, also observing that \\"her persona was part of her appeal,\\" while the site's next editor Choire Sicha's appeal was that he was \\"almost impersonally sharp and cruel and correct.\\" \\"Sicha's persona did not change much during his time at Gawker, but he did reveal himself to be invested, in a strange way, in the integrity of Gawker as an institution,\\" Carla goes on to say. It's hard not to be invested in the integrity of an institution that you are, to some extent, the public face of. Yes, also it's just a job, it's just a business. Right now, it's a business that is fairly hell-bent on increasing pageviews in light of the allegedly coming internet advertising downturn—whether that means that content is a tertiary concern after pageview-boosting commenter-friending features and sponsored contests. And still when you work here, Gawker is, to some extent, you. Carla also wrote: No one ever said Nick Denton was an altruist. But it's important to note that Gawker Media was designed to compete with the corporations that Gawker abused from the sidelines, because this is what created the dissonance of the site's later years....It was the writers, from Elizabeth Spiers to Emily Gould, who sold Denton's cynical project to his cynical audience, on the strength of their authentic interest in the material.... The old (and also accurately self-parodied) idea of Gawker as a necessary corrective to the reams of fawning, vapid, toothless celebrity profiles and trend pieces published every day has faded also as many of the media outlets Gawker used to mock have adopted its jaded style, if not its substance. \\"The status of Gawker rose as the overall status of its subjects declined, and it was this that made Gawker appear at times a reprehensible bully,\\" she wrote. And finally: In early 2007, Choire Sicha—the outsider, the non-careerist, the one who had known restraint, whose parody of journalism had retained some memory of journalism's ethics—returned from the Observer to save Gawker. But it was too late. That is, at least, overblown. Didn't he do it for the money, actually? Yes. Yes he did. Keith finished his note to the minivan-owner and, with Choire behind the truck waving his arms in an impersonation of usefulness, backed the truck out of the too-narrow street. Later Keith asked me what I thought about Carla's essay and I said that I didn't really think she was wrong about anything, except that Jessica Coen had not \\"grown up in Los Angeles.\\" By then we were standing high on the F train elevated platform at Smith and 9th Streets. The Statue of Liberty looked like a little dashboard adornment beyond the B.Q.E. I took a phone call and when I got back, Choire had told Keith he was quitting Gawker. \\"Yup, we're quitting!\\" I said. \\"Because of this?\\" Keith asked. \\"Sort of. Well, not because it was written. But because it's not untrue.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This news article talks about a lady named Charlo Greene, who used to be a news person on TV.

Every language has different grammar rules and structures for sentence building, hence for better translation, splitting the sentences into several parts will be beneficial. Here is the breakdown: - \\"This covers everything\\" - \\"from computer input and output\\" - \\"to the electronic delivery of information and services.\\" Step 2: Use my built-in translation module to translate each part to French. - \\"This covers everything\\" -> \\"Cela couvre tout\\" - \\"from computer input and output\\" -> \\"de l'entrée et de la sortie de l'ordinateur\\" - \\"to the electronic delivery of information and services.\\" -> \\"à la livraison électronique d'informations et de services.\\" Step 3: Put all the parts back together into one sentence maintaining the integrity and smoothness of the language. In French it is important to ensure the sentence flow maintains, especially when joining words like \\"de\\" and \\"à\\". So, the final translation is: \\"Cela couvre tout, de l'entrée et de la sortie de l'ordinateur à la livraison électronique d'informations et de services.\\" This approach, apart from translating word-to-word, also takes into account linguistic nuances and grammar rules which vary from language to language. This ensures that the translated text is not only faithful to the original in terms of meaning but also linguistically authentic."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a statement written in Panjabi.

I will consider some popular languages such as Spanish, French, and German. I choose Spanish as it is the second most spoken language in the world. Next, I will think of a simple sentence. The sentence will be about the weather because it is a common topic of conversation. Now, I will translate the sentence \\"The weather is nice today\\" into Spanish. In Spanish, \\"the weather\\" is \\"el tiempo,\\" \\"is\\" is \\"está,\\" \\"nice\\" is \\"agradable,\\" and \\"today\\" is \\"hoy.\\" Finally, I will put these words in the correct order to form the sentence: \\"El tiempo está agradable hoy.\\" Justification of my steps: 1. I picked the language Spanish as it is widely spoken and easily understood by many people. 2. I chose a simple and common subject (the weather) to ensure that the sentence is easily understood. 3. I translated each word individually and then arranged them in the correct order according to Spanish grammar rules. This ensures that the sentence is not only in a different language but is also grammatically correct and easily understood by those who speak the language."},{"instruction":"Award bookings may be made up to 355 days prior to departure, during this period, as a minimum, British Airways makes some seats available for Award bookings on all routes operated by British Airways on some flights in each direction for each week of operation throughout the year.
