He is in a healthy relationship with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), but also has a mild crush on his co-worker, Susan Ortega (Catherine Bell), who barely seems to notice him. Bruce, however, suffers from constant bad luck, and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from Bruce's segment while accepting the promotion on-air. Furious, Bruce aggressively and profanely criticizes the station during his first live report, and is promptly fired. Following a series of other misfortunes, Bruce takes out his frustration on God (Morgan Freeman), blaming Him and claiming that He is \\"the one who should be fired.\\" Bruce later receives a message on his pager directing him to an empty warehouse, where he meets God. God offers to give Bruce His powers, to prove that He is doing His job correctly. God gives Bruce two rules that he must follow: firstly, Bruce cannot tell anyone else that he has God's powers; and secondly, Bruce cannot use the powers to interfere with free will. Bruce ignores God and is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain such as potty-training his dog, exposing a woman by blowing up her dress, transforming his beat-up car into a Saleen S7, and sexually impressing Grace. Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him his job back. Bruce then uses his powers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on-air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor.

Ryan A:","output":"Title: Unraveling Life Genre: Drama Plot: Natalie Reynolds, a renowned philosophy professor with a major in existentialism, has lived a rich and fulfilling life, exploring the depths of human potential and addressing various societal injustices. She has started to recognize a shift in her perspectives as she reaches her late 40s, prompting her to dive deeper into understanding what it means to live a meaningful life. Ryan Thompson, a brilliant but enigmatic young man in his early 20s, becomes a new student in Natalie's philosophy class. Ryan stands out from the rest of the students with his unorthodox ideas and insightful contributions during class discussions. Intrigued, Natalie sees an opportunity to revisit the foundations of her own philosophical beliefs by exploring Ryan's unique perspectives on life. As Natalie engages Ryan in one-on-one conversations about his philosophies, she learns that he has a rare and terminal illness which has made him contemplate mortality and the meaning of existence at a much younger age than most. Natalie finds herself bewildered by Ryan's unusual mix of nihilism, optimism, and unconventional moral principles. The relationship between Natalie and Ryan grows stronger as each exchange leads to more challenging questions and perspectives. As they navigate through the teachings of Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre, their conversations encourage them both to confront hidden emotional struggles and personal dilemmas. While Natalie's curiosities about Ryan's beliefs guide her own personal journey, she helps Ryan process his illness and confront his fears related to his imminent death. Ryan, inspired and reassured by Natalie's care and wisdom, starts making a conscious effort to seize the day and live life to the fullest. As the movie progresses, the narrative intertwines their personal growth with the philosophical ideas they discuss, such as nihilism, existentialism, and value of subjective experiences. By the end of the film, Natalie discovers a renewed sense of purpose, embracing the uncertainty of life. Ryan, on the other hand, learns to accept the impermanence of existence while cherishing the remaining moments of his life as invaluable gifts. Unraveling Life captures the emotional and deeply human journey of both characters as they explore contrasting perspectives on life. Through the unfolding debates, reflections, and relationships, the movie becomes a poignant reminder of the power of human connection and the importance of reflecting on the profound questions that define our existence."},{"instruction":"Jessica Ann Johnson (nee Simpson; born July 10, 1980) is an American singer, actress and fashion designer.

It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - Philippine cuisine (Filipino: \\"Lutuing Pilipino\\" or \\"Pagkaing Pilipino\\") consists of the food, preparation methods, and eating customs found in the Philippines. The style of cooking and the food associated with it have evolved over many centuries from their Austronesian origins to a mixed cuisine of Malay-Indonesian, Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, and American, in line with the major waves of influence that had enriched the cultures of the archipelago, as well as others adapted to indigenous ingredients and the local palate. - Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savoury taste most often associated with tamarind ( Filipino : sampalok ) . It is one of the more popular viands in Philippine cuisine , and is related to the Malaysian dish singgang . While present nationwide , sinigang is seen to be culturally Tagalog in origin , thus the versions found in the Visayas and Mindanao may differ in taste ( mainly ginger is an additional ingredient ) . Fish sauce is a common condiment for the stew . - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - The Fabaceae, Leguminosae or Papilionaceae, commonly known as the legume, pea, or bean family, are a large and economically important family of flowering plants. It includes trees, shrubs, and perennial or annual herbaceous plants, which are easily recognized by their fruit (legume) and their compound, stipulated leaves. The family is widely distributed, and is the third-largest land plant family in terms of number of species, behind only the Orchidaceae and Asteraceae, with about 751 genera and some 19,000 known species . The five largest of the genera are \\"Astragalus\\" (over 3,000 species), \\"Acacia\\" (over 1000 species), \\"Indigofera\\" (around 700 species), \\"Crotalaria\\" (around 700 species) and \\"Mimosa\\" (around 500 species), which constitute about a quarter of all legume species. The ca. 19,000 known legume species amount to about 7% of flowering plant species. Fabaceae is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa. - Gin is a spirit which derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries (\\"Juniperus communis\\"). From its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, gin has evolved from a herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin was developed on the basis of the older jenever, and became popular in Great Britain (particularly in London) when William of Orange, leader of the Dutch Republic, occupied the English, Scottish, and Irish thrones with his wife Mary. Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, represented by products of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles that all revolve around juniper as a common ingredient. - In biology, a monotypic taxon is a taxonomic group (taxon) that contains only one immediately subordinate taxon. Although the phrase appears to indicate that a taxon has a single type specimen (with no syntypes, lectotypes, or other types) and no heterotypic/junior synonyms, that is not the usage. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Tamarind (\\"Tamarindus indica\\") is a leguminous tree in the family Fabaceae indigenous to tropical Africa. The genus Tamarindus is a monotypic taxon, having only a single species. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Although tropical Africa is most familiar in the West as depicted by its rain forests, this region of Africa is far more diverse. While the tropics are thought of as regions with warm to hot moist climates caused by latitude and the tropical rain belt, the geology of areas, particularly mountain chains, and geographical relation to continental and regional scale winds impact the overall parts of areas , also, making the tropics run from arid to humid in West Africa.

Options: - explosion - unpredictable - disaster - warmth - everywhere Let's think step by step:","output":"To determine why starting a fire is a terrible idea, let's analyze each option: 1. Explosion: Flames can lead to an explosion if they come into contact with flammable materials or gases. This could cause significant damage and endanger lives. However, not all fires lead to explosions. 2. Unpredictable: Flames can move in unpredictable patterns depending on the environment, fuel sources, and air flow. Uncontrolled fires can spread quickly and cause extensive damage. 3. Disaster: Starting a fire without proper precautions or control measures in place could lead to disaster, as it may cause harm to people, animals, property, and the environment. 4. Warmth: Fire can indeed provide warmth, which may be beneficial in certain situations like camping or cold weather survival. However, this option doesn't explain why starting a fire would be a terrible idea. 5. Everywhere: Flames can spread rapidly to nearby fuel sources and potentially engulf an entire area, which can be dangerous and challenging to control.

On Friday night we went out for a group dinner at Enoteca. I have never been to this establishment but having been to Carnevino and having a WONDERFUL dinner I had expectations. Enoteca is a bit more casual and low key than Carne and offers pastas, pizzas and a small variety of entrees. Our group started with a selection of cheeses, Prosciutto di Parma and fried squash blossoms. Not being a cheese fan I passed on the cheese and sampled the prosciutto and blossoms. YUM! The Prosciutto was delicate, just a bit salty and a nice light beginning to the meal. The squash blossoms were filled with some sort of cheese mixture, lightly battered and deep fried. And though fried they were still very light and airy. DELISH! I've never had squash blossoms but this app made me a fan! For dinner I had the the Marinated Chicken Paillard. WOW! What a serving! The dish \\"base\\" was a large slice of deep fried eggplant topped with ricotta cheese, three chicken breast pieces, spicy arugula and a light almost tangy green sauce. So Good and a very generous serving of food! I was able to finish the eggplant, arugula and two pieces of chicken, but left one last piece....just too full. I also have to mention the Braised Pork Shoulder which two members of our party ordered. I was told was delicious and literally fell apart it was so tender. They didn't even need a knife to slice the meat, it just pulled part with a fork! Good stuff. For dessert we did a sampling of two gelatos and one sorbet. We had the chocolate gelato with hazelnuts, a black cherry gelato and a strawberry sorbet. All were the perfect ending to the meal. Cool, light, clean, refreshing and delicious!

Plot: Introduction: Tiger, an exceptionally skilled martial artist, has been searching for answers about his long-lost half-brother Dragon; all he knows is his mother had left his father to marry Dragon's father, a man of Chinese descent. Despite his respectful upbringing in his father's prestigious martial arts academy in the U.S., Tiger struggles to contain his growing curiosity and resentment towards his absent mother and the brother he has never met. Dragon, on the other hand, grew up an orphan in China under the guidance of a legendary Kung Fu master, after losing both his parents in a plane crash when he was just a baby. Living a humble life in the mountains, he has developed mastery over an ancient martial art technique with rumored ties to mysticism and ancient legends. Set-up: An unexpected letter arrives for Tiger from a lawyer, informing him of a secret inheritance split between him and his half-brother, Dragon. This is the opportunity Tiger has been waiting for, to finally confront his estranged family. As he leaves for China, his father urges him to be open-minded and not let his anger cloud his judgment. Conflict: Once in China, Tiger seeks out the orphanage where Dragon was raised, only to find him in the midst of a local Kung Fu tournament. Impulsively, Tiger enters the competition and eventually faces off against Dragon in the finals. Realizing each other's identity, the two display impressive and contrasting martial arts styles, with the explosive final match ending in a tie. Rising Action: Despite Tiger's initial hostility, Dragon welcomes him into his life, and the two gradually form a bond. Tiger begins to learn about their family's mysterious past—their mother was the heir to an ancient mystical bloodline, which made her a target for a centuries-old deadly cult seeking to harness this power for their own dark purposes. This is the same cult that staged the accident that killed Dragon's parents, forcing their mother to go into hiding and leave Dragon orphaned. Climax: When the evil cult discovers the existence of both brothers, they believe they can use their combined blood and latent powers to further their goals. They now pose a grave threat to Tiger, Dragon, and their friends. The brothers put aside their differences, uniting their contrasting martial arts styles along with their inherited mythical powers to confront the cult's deadly assassins. Resolution: As the dust settles from their fights, Tiger and Dragon emerge victorious, having dismantled the dark organization that has been hunting their family for generations. Their bond is now stronger than ever, and they both agree to visit their mother's secret grave, finally putting the past to rest. In the end, Tiger invites Dragon to continue training with him in the States, combining the best of both their worlds and creating a new martial arts legacy."},{"instruction":"It wasn't for a lack of effort they didn't finish the job, they just didn't have what supplies?

After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable.

The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits.

The sentence merely describes a scene where the basilica is filled with a mystical light, but it does not identify any individuals or groups involved in its rebuilding. To find a valid answer to the question \\"Who rebuilt the basilica of Saint Denis?\\", you would need to look for another source of information that directly provides details about the people involved in the reconstruction. The Basilica of Saint Denis is a Gothic-style church located in Paris, France, and known for housing the tombs of French kings and queens. The reconstruction of the Basilica of Saint Denis is typically attributed to Abbot Suger, a French statesman and historian who served as the abbot of Saint Denis from 1122 to 1151. Suger was a close advisor to Louis VI and Louis VII, the kings of France at the time, and he played a critical role in shaping the political and cultural landscape of France. Suger began the rebuilding of the Basilica, transforming it into a full-scale Gothic cathedral. This project significantly expanded the church and introduced several innovative architectural features, including pointed arches and ribbed vaulting. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"Who rebuilt the basilica of Saint Denis?\\" is Abbot Suger, and the sentence, \\"Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light.\\" does not offer any relevant information to answer the question."},{"instruction":"Question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"You should do auto update\\" Answer:","output":"It is difficult to determine a specific star rating based on the provided review alone.

Understand the phrase: The phrase \\"missing a beat\\" can have different meanings depending on the context. In a literal sense, it refers to a rhythm pattern being interrupted. In a metaphorical sense, it can mean something never ceases to be engaging, exciting, or impressive. 2. Determine the context: In this case, the context involves a movie review.

Analyze the opinion: The phrase \\"missing a beat\\" does not indicate a positive or negative opinion directly. It depends on how the phrase is framed. For example, \\"the movie never misses a beat\\" would be positive, whereas \\"the movie keeps missing a beat\\" would be negative.

This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian palais of Maria de' Medici, the Luxembourg. In the principal façade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\\"kneeling\\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement. On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \\"grotto of Moses\\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the piano nobile windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the Fontana del Carciofo (\\"Fountain of the Artichoke\\"), designed by Giambologna's former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end. Giulio Parigi won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi. During the 18th century, two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect Giuseppe Ruggeri to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana, which creates a piazza centered on the façade, the prototype of the cour d'honneur that was copied in France.

According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \\"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\\". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative. While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy. The so-called \\"Alexander Sarcophagus\\", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331. However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.

See options at the end The man was rapping in the club louder than he was rapping in the bar because the speakers at the Available options: -bar were bigger.; -club were bigger.;","output":"The man was rapping in the club louder than he was rapping in the bar because the speakers at the club were bigger. This option suggests that the club's audio system played a significant role in amplifying the sound and enabling the man to rap louder. When people go to clubs, they generally expect a high-energy environment, with loud music and a large crowd. The club's atmosphere is meant to be vibrant, engaging, and entertaining. As such, it is important for clubs to have high-quality sound systems that can deliver loud, clear, and powerful sound to accommodate the preferences of the crowd. In this particular case, the man's rapping was considerably louder in the club, likely due to the larger and more powerful speakers. These larger speakers can produce a higher sound pressure level, which directly translates to louder audio output. They can also handle more power from the amplifier, allowing the system to play more loudly without distortion. On the other hand, bars usually have a more laid-back atmosphere, with a focus on socializing and conversation rather than dancing and loud music. The sound system in a bar is generally designed to support this atmosphere, with speakers that are sufficient to provide background music without overpowering the patrons' ability to engage in conversation. As a result, the speakers in a bar are often smaller and less powerful than those found in clubs. In conclusion, the man's rapping volume was influenced by the difference in speaker size between the club and the bar. Due to the club's larger speakers, which can handle more power and deliver louder sound, the man's rapping was louder there than it was at the bar, where smaller speakers are more appropriate for the setting. This illustrates the importance of having the right audio equipment to enhance the experience for performers and audiences alike in different types of venues."},{"instruction":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Donald's friends are worried for Donald.

To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court.

Establishing a European Gerontology Center could provide numerous benefits for the aging population within the region and beyond. As the population across Europe continues to age, with life expectancy increasing, there is a growing need for focused research, support, and resources designed to address the unique challenges faced by older individuals. The following are several reasons for establishing a European Gerontology Center: 1. Focused research on aging: By creating a hub for gerontological studies, researchers and experts can collaborate to further understand the aging process and its implications on overall health and society. Such a center would be able to coordinate large-scale studies, pooling resources from various countries, and creating a comprehensive database of knowledge. 2. Improved healthcare services: A Gerontology Center could serve as a model for best practices in geriatric medicine, offering specialized healthcare services to the elderly population. This could lead to improved overall health, increased quality of life, and potentially longer lifespans for the aged population. 3. Education and training: The center would be an ideal location for training healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, social workers, and other support staff members. Providing specialized training in gerontology would ensure that healthcare professionals are equipped to address the unique needs of the elderly population. 4. Innovation and technology: By focusing on gerontological research and development, the center could foster the creation of new technologies, products, and services specifically designed to enhance the lives of older individuals. This development would benefit not only the elderly population within Europe but also worldwide as these technologies and products are brought to market. 5. Economic growth: Establishing a European Gerontology Center would create jobs within the center itself and further support growth in the sector. With the increasing demand for services and products aimed at older individuals, the gerontology industry is likely to continue its expansion. 6. Social and cultural exchange: The center could become an international hub for the sharing of knowledge, cultural exchange, and the formation of partnerships among experts. This would facilitate the dissemination of information and best practices within the field of gerontology, ultimately benefiting the elderly population across Europe. 7. Policy development: As a leading authority on gerontological issues, the center would be well-positioned to inform and shape policy development at both the national and European levels. This would ensure that governmental strategies and regulations are based on the most current and accurate research in gerontology, leading to the most effective outcomes for older individuals. In conclusion, establishing a European Gerontology Center could significantly enhance research, improve healthcare services, create economic growth, and foster international collaboration in the field of aging. The resulting policies, technologies, and services would ultimately benefit the elderly population and contribute to the overall well-being of individuals across Europe and beyond."},{"instruction":"The actual substance of English law was formally \\"received\\" into the United States in several ways.

Liebeck, who suffered third-degree burns and was hospitalized, sued McDonald's and won big -- a jury awarded her 2.9 million. Twenty-one years later, a Fresno lawyer said McDonald's is still serving piping hot coffee. Nicholas \\"Butch\\" Wagner has sued McDonald's in Fresno County Superior Court \\"in excess of 2 million\\" on behalf of 74-year-old Clovis homemaker Joan Fino. Wagner said Fino suffered second-degree burns to her groin area after coffee spilled on her lap at the drive-up window of McDonald's in Clovis at Alluvial and Temperance avenues in August 2012. \\"It still hurts,\\" Fino said this week. \\"I have trouble sleeping because the burning sensation doesn't go away.\\" A lawyer for McDonald's could not be reached . But Wagner said the lawyer, Samuel Grader of Sacramento, \\"has reached out to us\\" in hopes of reaching a confidential settlement by Thursday. If a settlement isn't reached, Wagner said he and Fino plan to present their case to a Fresno jury next year. When Liebeck won her McDonald's suit she became an instant celebrity, but for the wrong reason: late-night talk-show hosts, comedians, sitcom writers and political pundits accused her of filing a frivolous lawsuit. Some politicians sought reforms in the legal system, hoping to cap multimillion-dollar verdicts. The trial judge even reduced Liebeck's jury award to about 650,000 before both sides settled for a confidential amount. In 2011, HBO produced a documentary called \\"Hot Coffee\\" that profiled Liebeck and her case and showed how corporate America was behind the move to cap jury awards. Wagner said the legal reforms went nowhere once the public learned that Liebeck had a legitimate lawsuit. \\"People joked about the McDonald's case without looking at the facts,\\" he said. This week, The New York Times published a Retro Report piece on the Liebeck case, saying that during court proceedings, McDonald's said it served its coffee between 180 and 190 degrees. \\"The company has refused to disclose today's standard temperature,\\" the article said, but a handbook for McDonald's franchisees call for temperatures 10 degrees lower. Like Liebeck, Fino is suing McDonald's for negligence, contending the corporation acted with malice because its employees knowingly served her coffee that was \\"unreasonably hot in excess of 175 degrees Fahrenheit,\\" the lawsuit said. She is seeking damages for medical expenses, physical pain, mental anguish, emotional distress and pain and suffering. Wagner said McDonald's serves its coffee extra hot to save money. By keeping the coffee at \\"scalding hot temperatures,\\" the coffee keeps its taste longer and McDonald's \\"doesn't have to re-brew coffee as often,\\" he said. In its defense, McDonald's puts a warning -- in both English and Spanish -- on its coffee cup that says: \\"Caution Handle with Care I'm Hot.\\" Wagner said Fino has a better case than Liebeck because coffee spilled on Fino while a McDonald's employee handed her the beverage at the drive-through window. Liebeck was a passenger in her grandson's car when coffee spilled on her on Feb. 27, 1992. After ordering coffee, her grandson parked the car so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. Liebeck placed the cup between her knees and pulled the lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled coffee on her lap and suffered third-degree burns to her thighs, groin and buttocks. She was hospitalized for eight days and underwent skin grafts. In 2004 Liebeck died at age 91. The McDonald's at Alluvial and Temperance in Clovis opened in April 2012 -- a few months before Fino ordered coffee there. Fino said she was alone in her sports utility vehicle when she ordered two cups of coffee -- one for her and one for her husband -- on Aug. 14, 2012. She recalled that when she was handed the first cup, coffee spilled out from under the lid and burned her fingers. She quickly put the cup in a cup holder. When the second cup was handed to her, the coffee spilled onto her lap, Fino said. \\"I was screaming and crying but the lady at the window didn't even offer to help me,\\" she said. The pain was so excruciating, she said, she unbuckled her seat belt, got out of her car, and raced to restroom. \\"I left the car running in the drive-through,\\" she said. She recalled crying in the bathroom, but \\"no one would talk to me or help me.\\" She said a female employee finally approached, but she just wanted her name and phone number. By then, someone had moved her car to the parking lot, Fino said. She then drove home, still crying, she said. Her husband Robert took her to what was then Clovis Community Hospital (now it is called Clovis Community Medical Center). A doctor told her to go to the burn center at Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno, she said. Fino said she's still upset at McDonald's because its only attempt to reach out to her was when an insurance agent asked her if she had blisters. More than a year later, she said, the coffee burns still bother her. \\"I use lotions and ice packs, but I can still feel it,\\" she said. She said she has not returned to the McDonald's at Alluvial and Temperance, but goes to other McDonald's restaurants because her grandkids like the food. Fino said she still likes hot coffee. \\"They need to put the lids on right so people don't get hurt,\\" she said.

McDonald’s hasn’t lost its power to provoke. The Retro Report video about the lawsuit featured here this week has been watched more than a million times on several websites and attracted hundreds of comments, many vehement. The documentary, which I produced over months of reporting, showed that many misconceptions had arisen since a 79-year-old woman, Stella Liebeck, ordered coffee at a McDonald’s drive-through, spilled the coffee, suffered severe burns, sued the company and was given a jury award of 2.9 million, later reduced to about 500,000. Nevertheless, a good many commenters remained committed to their erroneous understanding of the case, some castigating Ms. Liebeck as foolish for driving with liquid she must have known would be hot. This frustrated a host of other commenters, including M Craig from Kirkland, Wash., who reminded people: “She was in the passenger seat of a PARKED car when she was scalded. She was not one isolated case of scalding, there were hundreds — which, amazingly, did not move McDonald’s to change their policy on the temperature at which to keep the coffee.” Laura of Brentwood wrote: “She got 500,000 — not the millions reported.” Patalcant from Southern California said, “From what has been reported, the woman was not acting recklessly, given any kind of reasonable assumption she might have made about the actual risk of what she chose to do. Even if coffee is expected to be hot, who would expect that spilled coffee would result in third-degree burns on a significant portion of her body?” |||||Summary:","output":"The article discusses two cases involving McDonald's serving hot coffee, resulting in injuries for customers Stella Liebeck in 1992 and Joan Fino in 2012. In the 1992 case, 79-year-old Stella Liebeck suffered third-degree burns when she spilled McDonald's hot coffee on herself, leading to a 2.9 million jury award. Twenty years later, in a similar case, 74-year-old Joan Fino also suffered second-degree burns from McDonald's hot coffee spillage in her groin area. Fino is suing McDonald's for \\"in excess of 2 million\\" on negligence grounds, claiming that McDonald's employees knowingly served her unreasonably hot coffee, resulting in injuries and ongoing pain. The first case led to a public outcry against frivolous lawsuits and attempts to cap multimillion-dollar verdicts in the legal system. However, after further examination of the case, it was determined that there was legitimacy to Liebeck's lawsuit, as McDonald's served its coffee at 180-190 degrees Fahrenheit. While the company has not disclosed its current standard temperature for serving coffee, a handbook for McDonald's franchisees suggests a temperature of 170-180 degrees Fahrenheit. The article also notes that McDonald's serves its coffee at extra hot temperatures allegedly to save money, as the scalding temperatures preserve the taste for longer, reducing the need to re-brew coffee as often. In response to the incidents, McDonald's has included warnings in English and Spanish on their coffee cups cautioning customers to \\"handle with care\\" due to the hot temperatures. As both cases illustrate, there is still room for improvement in terms of customer safety and the proper handling of hot beverages to prevent further incidents and legal actions."},{"instruction":"It was just three degrees above zero.\\"That's cold\\", thought Jane as she got ready to deliver her morning papers .

The MAT is a standardized test commonly used for graduate school admissions in the United States. It measures a candidate's ability to understand complex relationships and similarities through the use of analogies. The MAT consists of 120 analogy-based questions, which are divided into four categories: 1. Semantic: These questions test vocabulary knowledge and general reasoning abilities. 2. Analytic: These questions require understanding relationships among terms and how these relationships apply to novel situations. 3. Classification: These questions test a candidate's ability to group items based on shared properties. 4. Syntactic: These questions examine understanding of word order and patterns in sentences. From these 120 questions, only 100 items contribute to the examinee's final score. The other 20 items are experimental and are used to evaluate their suitability for future test editions. Test-takers have 60 minutes to complete the MAT. MAT scores are reported as both a raw score and a scaled score, which range from 200 to 600. The raw score is simply the number of questions answered correctly, while the scaled score is adjusted to account for differences in difficulty between different test editions. The test developer, Pearson, also provides a percentile rank for the scaled scores, which show the percentage of test-takers scoring below a given score. Now, to determine what a \\"good\\" score is, consider the following factors: 1. Graduate program requirements: Some graduate programs have minimum MAT score requirements, while others provide score ranges for their typical successful applicants. To identify what may be considered a good score for the program you are interested in, research the program's website or contact their admissions office. 2. Comparisons to other test-takers: Percentile ranks provide a useful comparison to understand how your score compares to others. A higher percentile rank indicates better performance as compared to other test-takers. Generally, a percentile rank of 50 or above would indicate that you scored higher than half of the test-takers, while a rank above 70 or 80 would place you in the top 30% or 20%, respectively. 3. Personal goals: Consider your own academic background and the competitiveness of the programs you are applying to when setting a personal target MAT score. To provide a general idea, examinees who score around 400 or above are typically considered to have performed well on the MAT. However, highly competitive graduate programs may expect scores closer to 500 or even higher to stand out in the applicant pool. In conclusion, a good score on the Miller Analogies Test depends on several factors, including the requirements of the graduate program you are interested in, how your score compares to other test-takers, and your personal goals. To increase your chances of admission, strive for a score significantly above the minimum required or the average score range for your desired program."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Wolf howl for the following movie plot: Former NYPD Captain Dewey Wilson (Albert Finney) is brought back to the force and assigned to solve a bizarre string of violent murders after high-profile magnate Christopher Van der Veer (Max M. Brown), his wife (Anne Marie Pohtamo), and his bodyguard are slain in Battery Park. Executive Security, Van der Veer's client, prefers to blame the murders on terrorists; but knowing that the victim's bodyguard was a 300-pound Haitian with voodoo ties makes Wilson skeptical. At the crime scene, Wilson meets with Warren (Dick O'Neill), his superior. With pressure to solve the case coming down from both the Police Commissioner and the Mayor, Warren partners Wilson with criminal psychologist Rebecca Neff (Diane Venora). Meanwhile, a homeless man goes exploring an abandoned church in Charlotte Street, South Bronx, which was going to be demolished by Van der Veer along with the rest of the ruined buildings in the area, to be able to build apartment complexes. He is suddenly attacked and torn to pieces by an unseen monstrous being. Wilson and Neff arrive to investigate his murder. While investigating the abandoned church, sounds of crying lure Neff up the bell tower. Wilson follows her but does not hear the crying; however, once Neff is separated from him, he hears a wolf howl. He goes up after Neff and drags her forcibly to safety.

Here's a detailed explanation: 1. The representation of objects in a mirror is based on the reflection principle. When you look at an object in a mirror, you see a virtual image of the object. This virtual image is created due to the reflection of light rays that bounce off the object and strike the mirror. 2. A virtual image, in this case, is all that our eyes perceive, and the brain processes it as the object in front of us. When you look into a mirror, the light rays from your head travel to the mirror and then reflect back to your eyes, conveying the virtual image of your head. 3. As you move closer to the mirror, the distance between your head and the mirror decreases. According to the mentioned fact, the decreased distance between you and the mirror will cause the image of your head to appear larger. 4. This increase in size is due to the angle subtended by the object at the eye, also known as the visual angle. As the distance between the object (in this case, the virtual image of your head) and your eyes decreases, the visual angle increases, causing the image to appear larger in your field of view. Essentially, the object or image is occupying a larger portion of your field of view, making it seem bigger. 5. The brain processes this increase in visual angle as an increase in the size of the object (your head). Therefore, you perceive the virtual image of your head in the mirror as larger when you move closer to the mirror. To summarize, as a person moves towards a mirror while looking at their head, the visual angle at which their eyes perceive the virtual image will increase, causing the image of their head to appear larger. This is consistent with the fact that as the distance from an object decreases, that object will appear larger."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: The transport of sediments by longshore currents is called longshore drift .

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When it comes to human productivity and focus, there's a common belief that performing multiple tasks at once can lead to inefficiency and decreased overall performance. This is due to the fact that our brains can struggle to process multiple inputs, and often spend more time switching between tasks than actually completing them. However, there are certain tasks that can be executed simultaneously without negatively impacting efficiency. When tasks are simple or one of them requires minimal cognitive effort, it becomes possible for an individual to successfully multitask. For example, listening to music while jogging is a combination of activities that don't require excessive mental exertion, and in such cases, multitasking can be quite manageable. Another scenario where multitasking can be effective is when the combination of tasks being performed involves different sensory channels. For instance, washing dishes while listening to a podcast - one is a visual and tactile task while the other is an auditory task. Since these tasks use different brain pathways, they can be conducted simultaneously without interfering with each other. It's important to note, though, that the efficiency of multitasking depends on the individual and their personal cognitive abilities. Some people might find it quite effortless to multitask and do so efficiently, while others might find it more challenging. In conclusion, while multitasking can, in certain instances, be detrimental to overall task performance, there are situations in which it can be effectively carried out. The capacity to multitask efficiently depends on the complexity of the tasks involved, their sensory demands, and the individual's cognitive abilities. In specific circumstances where the tasks are simple or utilize different sensory channels, the answer to whether humans can multitask efficiently is: yes."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: Juror 8 helps Juror 3 with his coat in a show of what? Compassion A:","output":"Title: Unspoken Bonds Genre: Drama, Courtroom, Emotional Plot: The movie, \\"Unspoken Bonds\\" revolves around an intense, emotionally-charged trial. The case is a high stakes one, in which a young man named Michael is accused of brutally murdering his own mother. Public opinion has already crucified him; the evidence seems insurmountable-- until Juror 8 enters the picture. Throughout the course of the film, we follow the lives of the twelve jurors as they get to know one another. They are all very different people, but two jurors stand out. Juror 8, named Sarah, is a kind-hearted, middle-aged woman who works as a social worker in the city. Juror 3, named James, is a retired war veteran and a recently-widowed patriarch of a once-happy family. James holds characteristically old-fashioned values, while Sarah is a progressive and compassionate soul. As the jurors review the facts and testimonies surrounding the case, it becomes clear that there seems to be a unanimous guilty verdict. However, Sarah, who believes at the very heart of her being that justice cannot be defined in black and white terms, decides to push against the tide by presenting an alternate perspective that could exonerate Michael. Sarah's insistence on digging deeper pits her against the majority of the jury, especially James, who stubbornly asserts that the accused is beyond redemption. Amidst their confrontations, we learn that James's staunch position is heavily influenced by his broken relationship with his own son. His son took up a life of crime and abandoned the family, leaving James a disillusioned and bitter man who's closed his heart off to compassion. However, Sarah stands firm against James’ anger, and begins to sow the seed of doubt in the other jurors' minds. As they work tirelessly day in and day out to find the truth, they engage in heated debates and even delve into the psychological aspects of Michael's life, finding mutual understanding and unraveling hidden facets of the case. A turning point occurs when fresh evidence proves Michael's innocence, details that were previously overlooked in the trial. This newfound perspective sways the jurors, but it's the emotional transformation James experiences which solidifies their unanimous in favor of innocence. Throughout their time together, Sarah and James's journey inside and outside the courtroom thoroughly explores various themes such as empathy, forgiveness, prejudice, the intricacies of human connections, and even second chances at life. As the trial concludes, these two antagonistic jurors begin to form an unexpected bond, bridged by the compassion they have both learned through this case. In the climactic scene, as the jury leaves the courtroom, a snowstorm rages outside. James, having reconciled with his past and his heart softened due to Sarah's influence, struggles to put on his coat - a symbol of the emotional baggage he has previously carried. Sarah, without hesitation or judgment, helps him with the coat, which symbolizes her compassion for him. James's grateful and tearful gaze speaks volumes, and the two part ways knowing that they have both grown and learned from their encounter. \\"Unspoken Bonds\\" sends a powerful message: that compassion and understanding can triumph over even the most profound resentments, and that even seemingly irredeemable individuals can change for the better."},{"instruction":"Passage: The spleen is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates.

These relentless invaders have been decimating crops and posing a significant threat to food security around the world. However, there's hope on the horizon, as innovative pest research is uncovering novel strategies to fight these unwelcome guests. The primary step in this groundbreaking research has been understanding the biology and behavior of these destructive organisms. By studying their life cycles, mating habits, and feeding patterns, scientists have been able to develop targeted approaches to minimize their impact on agricultural production. The gathering and analysis of extensive data has also played a crucial role in predicting pest populations and determining the most effective control measures. This well-rounded approach to pest research is giving way to promising new strategies for a sustainable future in agriculture. One of the most promising developments is the use of integrated pest management (IPM). This environmentally-friendly approach focuses on combining biological, cultural, and chemical methods to control pests more effectively. In IPM, natural predators, parasites, and pathogens are implemented as a vital part of the pest control strategy, reducing reliance on harmful chemical pesticides and thereby promoting long-term ecological balance. Another exciting discovery in pest management is the use of pheromones to disrupt the mating process of pests. By releasing synthetic pheromones, researchers can interfere with insect reproduction, reducing pest populations and limiting the damage they inflict on crops. This innovative technique holds great promise for sustainable pest management, as it's both environmentally-friendly and highly targeted, with minimal impact on other organisms. Genetic engineering and modification of pests is another area showing immense potential. Researchers are steering away from the conventional chemical-focused approaches, acknowledging that these could cause harm to non-target organisms and increase the likelihood of pest resistance. By exploring gene editing techniques to alter key pest traits, scientists can introduce sterility or other impairments into pest populations, curbing their growth without causing harm to other species. These advances in pest research bode well for the future of agriculture. With an ever-increasing global population and a growing need for sustainable farming methods, the innovative strategies derived from this research are vital for ensuring our ability to maintain adequate food production. By continuing to invest in pest research and embracing these cutting-edge techniques, the agricultural industry will be better prepared to tackle the challenges of pest invasions, securing a more sustainable and fruitful future for all."},{"instruction":"Was very impressed - went during busy Resturant Week at the Metro location - both service and food were Great - and yes the cheesecake is a Must!!!!

Repo Business (Repurchase Agreement): A repo, short for repurchase agreement, is a financial transaction where one party sells a security (usually government bonds, corporate bonds, or other marketable securities) to another party and agrees to buy it back at a specified amount and date. Repos are commonly used by banks and other financial institutions for short-term borrowing and to manage their liquidity needs. This instrument is not included in the interest rate margin calculation as specified by \\"excl.\\" 5. Percentage Points: This term refers to the unit of measurement for the difference between two percentages. For example, if one interest rate is 5% and another is 7%, the difference between them is 2 percentage points. It is important to distinguish between percentage points and percent changes, as percentage points simply express the difference, while percent changes involve a relative comparison between the starting and ending rates. So, the provided text refers to the interest rate margin, calculated by excluding repurchase agreements (repo business), and the result is expressed in percentage points. This metric can be especially useful for understanding and analyzing the profitability of a financial institution's lending and borrowing activities that do not involve repo transactions."},{"instruction":"Q:Context: Austin met the client's for lunch and was pleased with the deal that they made.

Question: suppose more rocket fuel will be needed happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER satelites in space. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"A satellite launch is a complex process that involves several factors, including the type and size of the satellite, the rocket and fuel required for launch, and the desired orbit. In the scenario provided, it is suggested that more rocket fuel will be needed at some point, and we are to assess how this might impact smaller satellites already in space, as well as the possible perturbations that may arise. First, let us consider how adding more rocket fuel could affect smaller satellites in space. Rocket fuel is a major contributing factor to the mass and propulsion capabilities of a launch vehicle, and increasing the fuel mass can have several consequences. These consequences include increased thrust and more available energy to propel the rocket and its payload (in this case, the satellite) through the atmosphere and into space. This might be needed if the desired orbit is higher, or if the payload mass (the satellite) is heavier than initially planned. However, it is essential to understand that increasing the amount of rocket fuel is not the only factor that could impact orbital dynamics or other objects like smaller satellites in space. The actual influence on smaller satellites depends on various factors, such as the satellite's orbital paths, relative velocities, and the added fuel's effect on the trajectory. In general, if a satellite is launched with more fuel, it is likely to reach a higher orbit or change its orbit parameters (e.g., inclination, eccentricity, etc.), causing it to cover a larger area and potentially have an extended mission duration. This might lead to an increased risk of potential collisions with other objects in orbit like debris and smaller satellites. As for the supposed perturbation, it primarily refers to the changes induced in the orbits of satellites due to external forces, such as gravitational forces from other celestial bodies or spacecraft propulsion. If more fuel is needed to launch the satellite, there may be more frequent burn events to correct or adjust the satellite's orbit, resulting in perturbations. These perturbations are likely to cause varying effects, depending on their magnitude and direction relative to the orbits of smaller satellites. Considering the various factors, it is difficult to predict the precise effects of needing more rocket fuel on smaller satellites or the subsequent perturbations. However, it can be stated that there could be 'more effect' on smaller satellites if certain conditions are met, such as a higher probability of potential collisions or disturbances in orbit due to the additional fuel. The perturbations could likewise have 'more effect' on the second effect mentioned if more frequent maneuvering or propulsion events occur, altering the orbital paths of satellites or space debris. In summary, the overall impact of requiring more rocket fuel on smaller satellites and related perturbations is likely to be 'more effect' under specific scenarios. However, due to the complex nature of orbital mechanics and external factors, it is crucial to evaluate the entire system thoroughly and analyze the individual factors involved in each case for more accurate predictions."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Street performers were plentiful through the city.\\" to Turkish?","output":"\\"Şehir boyunca sokak sanatçıları çoktu.\\""},{"instruction":"Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what describes behaviors that improve fitness?\\" is \\"mass\\", given that behaviors that improve fitness increase through Darwinism?

Context: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: How often do people who are conditioned to prefer a calorie-dense diet probably eat high salt foods? Options: - More than once a week. - Most times that macaroni and cheese is served. - not enough information - Usually at lunch time.

Article: Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around but we can't detect them or sense them without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cells in important organs. Even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and when they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years. This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. A child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents. Question: Which of the following can be best inferred from the passage? Answer:","output":"The best inference from the passage is that nuclear radiation, even at low levels, is dangerous to humans and other living organisms. It can cause serious harm such as death or cancer, potentially years after exposure.

This article will guide you through a step-by-step process to determine, plot, and draw graphs for a given function. Step 1: Determine the function First, you must determine the function you want to graph. Functions can be a simple linear equation such as y = x + 3, or more complex equations like quadratic, exponential, or logarithmic functions. Ensure you have a clear understanding of the function and its properties before moving on to the next step. Step 2: Draw two lines in a + shape on a piece of paper Draw two lines in a \\"+\\" shape on a piece of paper. These lines will represent the x-axis (horizontal line) and y-axis (vertical line) of the coordinate plane, with the point where the two lines intersect being the origin (0, 0). Make sure the lines are long enough to accommodate the range of x and y values you'll be plotting. Step 3: Number your graph Label the horizontal line with the appropriate x values, and the vertical line with the appropriate y values. Be consistent with the scale you use, ensuring equal intervals between the numbers on both axes. This will help you plot the points accurately and maintain the correct proportions in your graph. Include negative values if needed, extending to the left and downwards from the origin. Step 4: Calculate a y value for 2-3 x values Choose 2-3 x values within the range of your graph, and calculate the corresponding y values using the function you determined in step 1. For example, if the function is y = x + 3, and the x value is 2, the calculated y value would be 5 (since 2 + 3 = 5). Step 5: Draw the graph point for each pair Now, plot the points on the coordinate plane using the calculated x and y pairs. Ensure each point is placed accurately in relation to the labeled axes. If your function is continuous (such as a linear, quadratic, or exponential function), you can draw a smooth curve or line connecting the points. Step 6: Remove the imaginary lines Once you've plotted the points and connected them with the appropriate curve or line, you can remove any additional or unnecessary lines that were used as guidelines during the plotting process. This will ensure that the final graph is clean, accurate, and easy to read. Conclusion Understanding how to accurately plot and draw graphs is an essential skill in many different fields. By following this step-by-step guide, you can confidently and accurately create graphs for any given function, and become a more proficient problem solver within your field of study."},{"instruction":"How do you do this: freeze soup","output":"Freezing soup is an excellent way to preserve leftovers or meal prep for future consumption. The process helps maintain the soup’s flavor, texture, and nutritional value. Here’s a detailed guide on how to freeze soup properly: 1. Allow the soup to cool: Before freezing, give the soup some time to cool down to room temperature. This helps prevent the growth of bacteria and ensures that the soup doesn't raise the temperature of your freezer, which could affect other foods. To speed up the cooling process, you can place the pot in an ice bath or stir the soup occasionally to release heat. 2. Choose the right containers: Once the soup has cooled, select appropriate containers or freezer-safe bags for storage. Opt for BPA-free plastic containers with airtight lids, glass containers with freezer-safe labels, or heavy-duty resealable plastic bags specifically designed for freezing. Make sure the containers are clean and free from any residual odors. 3. Leave space for expansion: Soup tends to expand when freezing, so it's crucial to leave some headspace in the container to prevent it from cracking or distortion. For containers, leave about an inch of space from the top, whereas for freezer bags, try to avoid filling them to the brim. 4. Separate into portion sizes: Freezing the soup in smaller, individual portion sizes will not only save space in your freezer but also make it easier to reheat the exact amount you need for a meal. This step is particularly helpful for avoiding waste and multiple freeze-thaw cycles that can degrade the soup's quality. 5. Label and date: To keep track of your soup's freshness and make it easy to identify in the freezer, use a permanent marker to label each container or freezer bag with the contents and the date it was made. Soups can generally be kept frozen for up to 2-3 months, though some soups, such as those with delicate vegetables or seafood, are best consumed within a month. 6. Remove air and seal: When using freezer bags, it's important to remove as much air as possible before sealing them securely. The lack of oxygen will help prevent freezer burn and preserve the soup's flavor better. Double-check the lids on containers to ensure a tight, leak-proof seal. 7. Store flat and stack: For freezer bags, lay them flat on a baking sheet or tray to freeze them in a uniform shape, making them easier to stack once they're frozen. This will help you optimize the storage space in your freezer and keep it organized. 8. Freeze: Place the containers or bags in the freezer, ensuring they are not covered or surrounded by other items that could affect their freezing process. Allow the soup to freeze completely, which may take several hours or overnight, depending on the size of the portions. 9. Reorganize the freezer: Once the soup has fully frozen, you can stack the containers or bags strategically in your freezer to save space while keeping your freezer organized. When you’re ready to enjoy your frozen soup, allow it to thaw in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight, or reheat it directly from the freezer using a microwave, stovetop, or oven. It’s always recommended to reheat the soup thoroughly to ensure it’s safe to eat and has reached 165°F (74°C) before consuming. Keep in mind that certain delicate ingredients like pasta, rice, and some vegetables might not hold up well during the freezing and thawing process. If possible, you can freeze these components separately or add them to the soup only after the base has been reheated."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: In Greek mythology Mount Olympus was the home of the gods and the site of the throne of Zeus, the chief deity.

These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous sky of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the world. They return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed that now seems to resemble a coffin. Although he tries to reassure her to the contrary they both know that the end is coming. He leaves her and goes for a long solitary walk. When he returns he weeps for his mother who's died.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is endangered when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death-threatening postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill lurks around Kahane's home and is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi), whom he watches while talking to her on the phone, that Kahane is at a showing of 'The Bicycle Thief'. Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards. Kahane continues goading Mill about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot the two men fight. Mill loses his balance and falls, and feeling threatened, kills Kahane, then makes the death look like a robbery gone wrong.The next day, Mill receives another postcard. Mill attends Kahanes funeral and gets along with June; she knows none of the other mourners. Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive. Detectives Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) suspect Mill is guilty of murder. They question him and DeLongpre keeps an eye on him.

I'm going to explain this in a way that's easy to understand. Question 1: It's really hard to say which is the best assault rifle in the world because different people have different opinions, and it also depends on what they are using it for. Some might say the AK-47 because it's very tough and lasts a long time. Others might say the M16 or the M4 because they are used by many armies all over the world. Question 2: A 'Bullpup' assault rifle is a special type of gun where the bullets and some other parts are behind the trigger. This makes the gun shorter and easier to handle. Again, it's hard to say which one is the absolute best, but some people might say it's the Steyr AUG or the IWI Tavor because they are very popular and work well.

Choose your answer from: * mechanical to electrical; * mechanical to thermal; * chemical to electrical; * chemical to thermal;","output":"Whenever coal is burned, the energy conversion process that occurs is chemical to thermal energy. Let us dive into the details of this process: Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with other elements such as hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. It is classified as a fossil fuel and is formed from the remains of ancient plant life that lived and died millions of years ago. Over time, these remains were subjected to immense geological pressure, which resulted in the formation of coal. Coal, when stored, contains potential (chemical) energy due to the energy-rich bonds between these elements. When coal is burned, it reacts with oxygen in the atmosphere, leading to a process called combustion. Combustion is an exothermic reaction, which means it releases energy in the form of heat. During this reaction, the carbon in the coal combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, and hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water vapor. This chemical change releases energy in the form of heat or thermal energy. This heat can then be used to generate steam, which can power turbines and generate electricity or can be used for heating purposes. To summarize, the energy conversion process that occurs when coal is burned is a conversion of chemical energy (present in the bonds of the carbon, hydrogen, and other elements) to thermal energy (the heat released from the exothermic combustion reaction). This process is critical in industries and power plants that rely on coal as a primary source of energy for generating electricity and providing heat. Further advancements in technology, such as clean coal technologies, are being pursued to minimize the harmful environmental effects (such as emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides) associated with coal combustion. However, a transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources is essential to mitigate the impacts of climate change and pollution."},{"instruction":"sometimes it gets a bit stressful being a blogger.

And in the frenetic scramble around the iPhone, few newcomers are as energetic as Jonathan Zweig, founder of Los Angeles-based Jirbo, a mobile games start-up that boasts a toothy gerbil for a mascot. Zweig, a fast-talking, 30-year-old developer, and Jirbo have already churned out 14 games for the iPhone and iPod touch and have a pack more on the way. Although the numbers fluctuate from day to day, as many as five of Jirbo's games have ranked in the top 25 applications since the opening last week of App Store, Apple's (nasdaq: AAPL - news - people ) new online storefront for iPhone applications. One game, \\"Jirbo Break,\\" made it up to No. 2 among the most popular free applications for the iPhone. (The top application is currently \\"Tap Tap Revenge\\" by Gogo Apps.) It's an impressive showing from an eight-month-old firm. After all, the App Store is stocked with 800 programs, including offerings from such tech powerhouses as AOL, Facebook, Google (nasdaq: GOOG - news - people ) and Apple itself, and many of the apps are free. Apple hasn't told developers how many downloads it has racked up, but Zweig says his site has logged more than 250,000 \\"high scores\\" from its games in the past week. Jirbo's formula is simple: create applications that build on familiar games and themes, add a dash of whimsy and top with rich graphics. \\"Jirbo Break\\" is reminiscent of Atari's classic \\"Pong\\" and the hit BlackBerry game \\"BrickBreaker.\\" \\"Jirbo Match\\" is an updated version of the time-tested card game \\"Memory.\\" \\"Jirbo Arcade\\" contains a game called \\"Jirbo Says\\" that prompts players to repeat patterns, much like \\"Simon Says.\\" \\"Never underestimate the value of nostalgia,\\" Zweig says. Jirbo spices up its applications with blazingly colorful, three-dimensional graphics and a cast of cartoon animals--the most popular one is a chubby gerbil--that pop up in each game. To spur downloads, Zweig decided to give away six for free and price most of the rest under 1 apiece. The most expensive Jirbo app is 5. Ads may show up on the free games to help pay the bills. \\"We want to be on as many devices as possible and trump [applications] with high price points,\\" he says. Though Jirbo was an early leader in iPhone Web games, with four of the top 10 most popular games on many days, its applications will encounter a lot more competition as more developers make applications for App Store. Still, Zweig has visions of a gerbil-filled empire of iPhone applications. He plans to debut a set of workout-related applications, dubbed \\"Jirbo Gym,\\" this winter. The company is also developing several programs designed to test users' mental and physical fitness levels, Jirbo Health, for 2009. Foreign-language editions are another initiative, given the iPhone's scheduled launch in 70 countries by year's end. Jirbo already offers Japanese versions of two of its games. Combined with the casual games currently available in the App Store, Jirbo's portfolio will eventually comprise as many as 30 applications. Zweig also hopes Jirbo will become a utility for other iPhone developers. That's part of the rationale behind Jirbo Avatar, another free application available through the App Store. Avatar is Jirbo's attempt to create an online network of iPhone game players. Zweig describes it as a \\"mobile social gaming community the glue between all our games.\\" Jirbo is Zweig's first start-up, and he's tackled it with all the zeal of a fresh entrepreneur. In the run-up to the App Store launch, he printed several thousand T-shirts with Jirbo logos and the slogan \\"Free iPhone games\\" and arranged to have them distributed in cities around the country. He's experimented with a few tricks too, including putting a number in front of the names of some of his games to elevate them in the App Store directory. (He's since abandoned that tactic.) Zweig is still getting accustomed to being a CEO. After majoring in computer science and engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, he worked as a software engineer at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine. Jirbo kicked off last November with the release of several games that ran on the iPhone and iPod touch's Web browser. With the help of angel investors, the company now has 14 employees, who work out of a Wilshire Boulevard office three miles from the beach. Three investors sit on Jirbo's board with Zweig and advise him on business strategy. In the meantime, he's working at breakneck speed to get everything launched. \\"We don't want someone like Nintendo saying, 'We should do something on the iPhone,' \\" he says. \\"Then we'll have been trumped.\\"","output":"A long time ago, there was a person named Jonathan Zweig who wanted to make really fun games for a special phone called the iPhone. He started a small company called Jirbo and made games with colorful pictures and cute animals in them. People liked the games, and some of them became very popular. Jonathan's company grew, and he had more ideas for games and other fun things to use on the iPhone. He worked very fast because he wanted to make sure his company stayed popular and successful.

Answer choices: - animals - sun - humans - watershed - stars - habitat - earth - moon A:","output":"Planting trees has a positive impact on several aspects mentioned in the list. These positive impacts can be divided into three main categories: the environment, the climate, and living organisms. 1. Environment and climate: - Earth: Trees improve soil quality by adding nutrients, increasing water retention, and preventing soil erosion. They also help to maintain a balanced ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various species. - Watershed: Trees slow down water runoff, causing water to infiltrate the soil more effectively. This reduces the risk of flooding and erosion in watershed areas and helps recharge groundwater resources. - Sun: Trees absorb and reflect sunlight, which can help balance temperatures and mitigate the urban heat island effect in cities. They also contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gases, as they absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, helping to counteract global warming. 2. Living organisms: - Habitat: Trees provide habitats for various species of animals and plants. These species depend on trees for food, shelter, and breeding grounds. Trees also create microhabitats that support aquatic life in rivers and streams. - Animals: Trees provide food, shelter, and nesting sites for animals, especially birds, insects, and mammals. A diverse range of tree species ensures the survival of different types of fauna. - Humans: Trees offer various benefits to humans, such as improving air quality, providing shade, and enhancing the aesthetic value of an area.

Pencils or pens are easily accessible items that most people have readily available. 2. Both are able to create visible, fine lines for precise cutting. 3. Pencil marks can be easily erased, while pen marks are permanent, but with cardboard being a disposable material, this may not be a significant concern. Solution 2: Using a scoring tool 1. Scoring tools create an indentation in the cardboard without cutting through it completely, making it easier to follow the line with a cutting tool. 2. Scoring allows for neat, precise folds, which can be a desirable feature for some projects. 3. Scoring tools are less common household items, so they may be more difficult to acquire for some users. Comparing the two solutions: Solution 1 (using a pencil or pen) seems to be a better choice for the goal of marking cardboard for cutting it up because: 1. Pencils and pens are more widely accessible and many people already have them in their possession. 2. The marks made by these tools are easy to see and give a clear indication of where to cut. 3. While scoring is a more specialized technique, using a pencil or pen will get the job done with minimal effort and provide satisfactory results for most projects."},{"instruction":"What type of details about donnie duncan can be gathered from the following bio?

The five-year-old's father Brett admitted that his unwell son 'will be scared' but his mother Naghmeh will be there to hold his hand and both have 'every confidence' Czech doctors will cure him. Ashya was flown by private jet from Spain to Prague, where he is expected to start pioneering treatment for his brain tumour next week after being monitored by experts today. Scroll down for video. Good news: Ashya King leaves the Prague clinic this afternoon clutching a teddy bear after a day of tests that mean his cancer treatment can start next week. Brett King, father of the five-year-old Ashya King, spoke today and believes that the care his son will receive abroad will save him. Doctors warned Mr King that his son will suffer headache-like-pain as he inspected the proton beam machine that will treat him. He said: 'I'm so happy we can finally bring Ashya here. It is incredible, I have every confidence in it. 'It is daunting and Ashya will be scared but his mother will be holding his hand.' With his devoted parents by his side, Ashya King finally arrived at hospital in the Czech Republic yesterday – as his father declared: ‘It’s all worthwhile – he will get better.’ Just days ago, his parents were in a Spanish prison cell after being arrested for removing the youngster from an NHS hospital in Southampton without doctors’ permission and taking him abroad. But following a public outcry, the couple were released and reunited with their son, before being allowed to transfer him to Prague for the proton beam therapy treatment they desperately want for him. In a statement, the Proton Therapy Centre said: 'If all goes well and the physicists will be able to prepare Ashya's irradiation plan in four days already instead of standard 10 days, he will start the first irradiation on Monday. 'His plan takes 30 irradiation visits and is combined with chemotherapy. 'The chemotherapy will be applied by specialised oncologists at Motol University Hospital, where Ashya is hospitalised with his mother.' Fresh start: Ashya King arrived at Prague's Proton Therapy Centre this morning for tests before treatment his parents have 'every confidence' will cure his brain cancer. Family: The unwell five-year-old was again with his parents Brett and Naghmeh as he was wheeled into the clinic. Love: Brett King gives his son a kiss ahead of crucial tests to determine what care he can receive. As Ashya was stretchered from the ambulance yesterday, his father Brett, 51, said: ‘It’s amazing, I’m excited. Power to the people. ‘When you see my son you see why the whole thing we’ve been through has been worthwhile to get him better. He will get better.’ Ashya’s mother Naghmeh, 45, added: ‘I’m so happy to be here.’ Their emotional arrival came as it emerged Ashya’s treatment is expected to cost up to £70,000 – and could be paid for by the NHS. Miloslav Ludvik of the Motol University Hospital – where Ashya will stay while he is treated at the Proton Therapy Centre – said it was a ‘good question’ who would foot the bill. He said: ‘We are not concerned about the financial issues at the moment, what matters is treating the child. Parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45, were reunited with their son after 72 hours in jail and later dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge to allow Ashya to undergo proton therapy in Eastern Europe. Visit: Yesterday Brett King visited the facility where his son will have proton beam therapy. 'But there are three options for payment eventually. Either the parents will pay, or the NHS will pay under new EU regulations or the parents will pay and then take the bill to the NHS for reimbursement.’ The NHS funds proton beam therapy abroad ‘whenever it is considered clinically appropriate’. However, NHS England does not fund proton therapy for medulloblastoma – the cancer that Ashya has – because of concern that patients not fit enough to travel would be delayed from receiving radiotherapy and subsequently have a reduced chance of a cure. Last year 99 children were fully funded by the NHS to go abroad for proton beam therapy. One method of funding is the S2, an arrangement between the NHS and the state healthcare provider in the EU country patients are visiting, which requires prior approval. A spokesman for University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘It is good news that Ashya’s treatment can be resumed without delay and we are delighted for him that the situation has now been resolved.’ Ashya is expected to be taken to the Proton Therapy Centre today for assessment, and if all goes well a six-week treatment programme will start next there on Monday. British paediatricians who treated Ashya have insisted that proton therapy is not suitable for his type of tumour. They want him to receive conventional radiotherapy. After being taken from Britain to Spain and then being isolated from his parents and family, Ashya King arrived in Prague for cancer treatment yesterday. The couple stroke young Ashya's head as they arrive in Prague yesterday. The five-year-old's mother said she was 'so happy' to be in the Czech Republic. The family travelled on a private jet from Malaga to Prague after being released from prison where they spent 72 hours. An ambulance carrying the child arrives at the centre where Ashya's treatment is expected to cost £70,000. The five-year-old's mother Naghmeh accompanied him on both ambulance journeys in Spain and the Czech Republic. Ashya's parents removed him from Southampton hospital on August 28 without doctors' consent. The £30million Proton Therapy Centre where Ashya King is to be treated boasts state of the art cancer-fighting technology. Built in 2012, the gleaming white lobby of the five-storey building on the outskirts of Prague appears more like a modern hotel – complete with an 18ft tropical fish tank and red sofas. The centre says its treatment is more accurate than conventional radiotherapy because proton beams stop once they reach their target. For brain tumours, this reduces the radiation doses to other parts of the body by 60 per cent and halves the risk of secondary tumours, staff claim. A course of treatment takes from five to 30 visits. Sessions never last more than 30 minutes. Jiri Kubes, Chief Medical Officer of proton therapy (right) shows Brett King around the centre where his son will receive treatment for medulloblastoma. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Ashya King, a five-year-old boy with brain cancer, is set to start treatment at Prague's Proton Therapy Centre next week, after successful tests were conducted.

The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, who had worked with Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by \\"the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on ... legends and fables to the grandchildren\\".They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including The Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's Hammersmith Palais), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany. On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in Bochum, West Germany, for the German TV show Rockpalast. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time. Fables of the Reconstruction performed poorly in Europe and its critical reception was mixed, with some critics regarding it as dreary and poorly recorded. As with the previous records, the singles from Fables of the Reconstruction were mostly ignored by mainstream radio. Meanwhile, I.R.S. was becoming frustrated with the band's reluctance to achieve mainstream success.For its fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp's producer Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986), featured Stipe's vocals closer to the forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Peter Buck related, \\"Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice.\\" The album improved markedly upon the sales of Fables of the Reconstruction and reached number...

Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 13:32 EST, 8 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 20:41 EST, 8 November 2013. Brooke Mueller's brother Scott has been awarded temporary guardianship of Charlie Sheen's twin sons Bob and Max. The news came after Denise Richards felt compelled to give up her guardianship of the four-year-old boys due to their 'violent behaviour' towards her daughters and pet dogs. According to TMZ, the Department of Children And Family Services signed off in court on Scott becoming a guardian and he will take charge of the children on Friday night. They are also now investigating allegations that someone hurt Bob in regards to a deep cut on his back. Keeping it in the family: Brooke Mueller's brother Scott has been awarded temporary guardianship of Charlie Sheen's twins. But in another twist to the increasingly complex family saga, Scott and the children will reportedly be 'moving in' with Brooke. Sources connected with the case told TMZ that the judge who granted the guardianship felt it was important for Bob and Max to stay in the same school. And with Scott residing in a 'far away' beachside community, 'the judge ruled he could move in with Brooke,' which would effectively give her custody. However, as the website reports, the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services has not yet given Brooke full custody rights, feeling the children should be 'reintroduced gradually,' following her drug problems. Blame game: Brooke is allegedly pointing the finger at Denise Richards for a cut on Bob's back. Brooke had apparently been set to regain full custody of the boys by Christmas. But now, Scott is allegedly set to be moving in to the house once purchased for Brooke by Sheen in his own gated community. TMZ is also reporting that DCFS have opened an investigation into allegations over Bob's injury, which allegedly happened on Denise Richards' watch and Brooke is blaming the Drop Dead Gorgeous star for the cut, that was deep enough to scab over. Social workers went to Bob's school and determined it had been there for more than a week, which means it could have happened while Bob was under Brooke's care, reported TMZ. DCFS then interviewed Denise, who said the cut had been there for more than a week. Taking charge: Brooke's brother Scott Mueller has been awarded temporary guardianship of twins Bob and Max. Scott has also requested '55,000 in child support' from Sheen claim Radar. 'Scott. has formally notified Charlie Sheen’s lawyer he wants 55,000 in child. support because he has been appointed Bob and Max‘s temporary guardian,' a source close to the situation told the website. 'He. expects to be paid, immediately, even though Charlie already pays for. all of the boys expenses including their pre-school, doctors visits,. etc. During the time that Denise Richards was their guardian, she didn’t. ask Charlie for one dime in child support, she actually turned it. down.' The website reports that Brooke's. child support payments were recently cut in half due to her not being. 'their primary caregiver.' However, she will again be awarded the full 55,000 when she takes on full custody. Still angry: Charlie Sheen leaving court on Wednesday after he was ordered to stay 200 yards away from Brooke. According to TMZ, this is what Charlie has been telling friends about his troubled ex and her family:. 'This pig circus overflowing with buffoons, sycophants and heretics cannot be trusted to safely raise a colony of ferrets.' 'Brooke will fail and her brother [who lives by the beach] will be selling his ass under a pier and the evil nanny will die from ugly.' 'When, not if, this psychotic and desperately irresponsible sham goes sideways, DCFS will burn to the ground, topped off with the smoldering robe of the judge.' Denise,. 42, has been watching the boys as a favour to her ex-husband Charlie, 48. - who she divorced in 2006 - after Brooke, 36, went into rehab for the. 21st time earlier this year. But this week the former Bond girl wrote to the Los Angeles County. Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to inform them that. she can no longer look after the boys because of their violent. outbursts, according to TMZ. In a letter, the actress detailed how the twins. tried to strangle her own daughters Sam, nine; Lola, eight; and Eloise, two. She also. complained the twins relieved themselves in their maid's bathtub and. also tortured her dogs. On Wednesday, a judge put a restraining order on Charlie, asking him to not. go within 200 yards of his ex-wife Brooke, from whom he split in 2011. He. replied with a 'thank you'. Getaway: Denise Richards was seen arriving and leaving Charlie's home in her Mercedes on Thursday. Heading home: Denise was on her own as she left her ex-husband's Beverly Hills home. What's going on here?: This image is said to show Brooke Mueller arriving at Charlie's home after the meeting. According to RadarOnline,. Brooke would regain full custody of the boys by Christmas, after. impressing the Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family. Services with her commitment to getting sober and turning her life. around. A source told the. website: 'Brooke will be awarded custody of the boys by Christmas, as. long as she doesn’t relapse. She has been sober for several months. She. hasn’t had one dirty test. Harmony: Brooke and Charlie in 2009 on the red carpet at the Emmys. 'She. has done everything that has been asked of her by DCFS, so at this. point, there is absolutely no reason for Brooke not to get her boys. back.' On Monday, Brooke attempted to have. her lawyers remove Denise as guardian of the boys but that wasn't accepted. There have been conflicting reports. regarding the state of relations between the two women, with Brooke. accused of 'lashing out' at Richards during an emergency meeting over. the. custody of her twins on Thursday, it was claimed. Concerned. about Max and Bob, the. Los Angeles Department of Children & Family Services were reported to have brought her and the actor's second wife together to discuss the twins' future. But. Brooke is said to have. found the pressure of the meeting too much, becoming 'extremely. combative' and having a 'temper tantrum' directed at Richards during the. meeting, according to RadarOnline. A. source revealed to the site: 'Brooke was extremely combative and lashed. out at Denise. It came out of nowhere and was extremely inappropriate. It was probably the first time DCFS saw cracks in Brooke’s previously. cool demeanour. 'Brooke was having a temper tantrum because she felt Denise was making her look like a bad mother.' Another source had told Radar: 'The. meeting has been called in hopes of convincing Denise to keep the boys. for at least another three weeks until Brooke is scheduled to get them. back.' However, TMZ reported a different version of events - claiming that Brooke and Denise were 'cordial' with each other and are close to calling a truce. Whatever. happened inside the meeting, Brooke looked in good spirits and was seen. smiling as she left the face-to-face in a chauffeured. black Cadillac Escalade on Thursday. Keeping a schedule: Denise taking her daughters Sam, aged nine, and Lola, aged eight, to school on Wednesday. Denise. was apparently seen arriving and leaving Sheen's home in a car on. Thursday while Brooke was also spotted driving up to the house, it has. been claimed. This comes after Charlie posted a photo of a cake decorated with a grenade, which he said was made for the troubled socialite. The news of Scott Mueller being awarded custody comes just days after photographs emerged of Bob with severe bruising to his head. The shocking images show injuries on Bob's face, which it has been alleged in a document submitted to an LA court were sustained while the boy was in the care of his mother Brooke or his grandmother Moira Fiore. In one zoomed-in image,. reportedly taken by Denise, Bob returned from a weekend with Mueller and. Fiore on July 26, with a noticeable raw skin sore near the red. mark. When things were calmer: Charlie's ex wives in Malibu in 2012 with their children. The images have now been presented to the LA Department of Children and Family Services by Sheen's legal team. Sore: Bob's pictures, have allegedly been presented to LA Department of Children and Family Services by Sheen's legal team. Sources told. TMZ Charlie believed it was a burn, although Brooke insisted he had it. before he arrived at her home. An enraged Charlie said: 'These crimes against my children will be exposed. These. war criminals will be hanged at dusk to a cheering and jeering crowd,. gathered together in love in support of all children who are mercilessly. discarded like garbage by CPS. Which by the way stands for 'CAN'T. PROTECT S****.' He even quoted. his actor father Martin Sheen's famous film Apocalypse Now to describe the current. situation, whilst violating his gag order. Charlie allegedly told TMZ: 'I am beyond their timid lying morality, therefore I am beyond caring. 'What. my family and I are forced to deal with in the last four years, lives. outside the pale of any acceptable conduct or decency. 'I am battling an. amorphous enemy that needs to be swiftly disempowered.' Charlie also branded Brooke a ‘chubby weirdo’ following her failed. attempt to secure a restraining order against him in court on Monday. He. wrote on Twitter: ‘Oh, by the way, nice try this morning Brooke. You. are a chubby weirdo who will lose at every turn trying to get between me. and my boys (sic).’ According to TMZ, the petition claims Charlie said: ‘There will be a reckoning. There will be a whirlwind. That they will all reap while desperate begging for my forgiveness. You've all been warned. ‘I will exercise every resource at my. disposal. I will, I will, I will, I will empty my entire war chest and. if I can't get it done, I know a guy who can.’ She's changed: Brooke in February before her 21st visit to rehab (left) and sober in September (right) Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In November 2013, Brooke Mueller's brother, Scott, was awarded temporary guardianship of Charlie Sheen's twin sons, Bob and Max, after Denise Richards decided to give up her guardianship due to the boys' violent behavior.

The twins, then four years old, were to move in with Brooke and Scott as it was important for them to stay in the same school. Initially, Brooke was denied full custody rights, but eventually awarded full custody on the condition that she remains sober.

The presence or absence of minimal pairs, as mentioned above, is a frequently used criterion for deciding whether two sounds should be assigned to the same phoneme. However, other considerations often need to be taken into account as well. Q: What kind of speaker data does studying a language phonologically involve examining?","output":"Studying a language phonologically involves examining speaker data that consists of phonetic transcriptions of the speech of native speakers. Phonetics deal with the actual sounds produced by speakers, while phonology is the study of the abstract system that governs the way those sounds function within a given language. Native speaker data is crucial in a phonological study, as they have the most natural and accurate command of the language's sound system. The careful examination of speaker data allows linguists and phonologists to deduce the underlying phonemes (the smallest units of sound that can distinguish meaning in a language). These phonemes form the sound inventory of the language and help establish the rules that govern how these sounds can be combined, altered, or restricted in different contexts. To identify the distinct phonemes in a language, phonologists analyze various aspects of the data, such as the presence or absence of minimal pairs. Minimal pairs are two words that have different meanings but differ only by a single sound. For example, in English, the words 'cat' and 'bat' form a minimal pair, as they differ only in the initial sound (/k/ and /b/, respectively). The existence of minimal pairs can serve as evidence that two sounds should be treated as separate phonemes within a language. However, minimal pairs alone are not sufficient for determining the complete set of phonemes in a language. Other factors and linguistic tools are often employed in the process: 1. Complementary distribution: When two sounds never occur in the same phonetic context and can be predictably substituted for one another based on their environment, they might be considered as allophones (variants) of the same underlying phoneme. 2. Phonotactics: Phonotactics involves analyzing the permissible combinations of phonemes in a given language. Different languages have different rules regarding which sounds can occur together, and studying these patterns helps phonologists define the phonemic inventory of a language. 3. Phonological processes: These are systematic changes that phonemes undergo when they appear in specific contexts. Understanding these processes helps to further classify phonemes and allophones and determine the abstract sound patterns in a language. 4. Syllable structure: Investigating the organization of sounds within syllables can reveal essential information about the language's phonology. This includes observing the constraints on the sequencing of consonants and vowels, determining stress patterns, and identifying any pitch or tonal information. In summary, studying a language phonologically involves examining speaker data, such as phonetic transcriptions of native speakers' speech. The analysis encompasses a wide range of linguistic tools and methodologies, including minimal pairs, complementary distribution, phonotactics, phonological processes, and syllable structure, in order to determine and characterize the underlying phonemes and the sound inventory of the language."},{"instruction":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: The composition of wine changes greatly after filtering.

Mantle was one of the best players and sluggers, and is regarded by many as the greatest switch hitter in baseball history. Mantle was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. Mantle was invited to the Yankees instructional camp before the 1951 season. After an impressive spring training, Yankees manager Casey Stengel decided to promote Mantle to the majors as a right fielder instead of sending him to the minors. Mickey Mantle's salary for the 1951 season was 7,500. Mantle was assigned uniform #6, signifying the expectation that he would become the next Yankees star, following Babe Ruth (#3), Lou Gehrig (#4) and Joe DiMaggio (#5). Stengel, speaking to SPORT, stated \\"He's got more natural power from both sides than anybody I ever saw.\\" Bill Dickey called Mantle \\"the greatest prospect [he's] seen in [his] time.\\" After a brief slump, Mantle was sent down to the Yankees' top farm team, the Kansas City Blues.

Thomas Gainsborough painted some of Britain’s most recognisable landscapes as well as some of the 18th century's most famous aristocrats. So, the discovery of what could be the great artist’s paints has got art historians excited. The intriguing little pots were found at the artist's home and experts believe they were used by the master. The bladders of paint (pictured) were found at Gainsborough's former house in Sudbury in the mid-1960s during a clear-out, it is only now that experts are attempting to confirm their provenance. Before the invention of tubes made of lead or tin, painters carried bladders to store the paint that they would have made in their studio. The bladders were made from pig bladder - hence the name - and tied at the top with strong twine to keep air out. This kept the paint fresh and workable. It is unusual for such a large collection of delicate bladders of paint to survive. The ‘bladders’ of paint spent hundreds of years gathering dust in the attic at the famous 18th century Suffolk-born painter’s former house. While they were found at the property in Sudbury in the mid-1960s during a clear-out, it is only now that experts are attempting to confirm their provenance. The paints were discovered just after the house was opened to the public as a museum and art gallery some 50 years ago. The 'bladders' of paint spent hundreds of years gathering dust in the attic at the famous 18th century Suffolk-born painter's former house (pictured) Thomas Gainsborough (self portrait left) painted some of Britain’s most recognisable landscapes and famous portraits of 18th century aristocrats, such as Anne, Countess of Chesterfield (right) Executive director Mark Bills intends to feature the historic paint bladders in an exhibition, but only after they have been examined by specialists. ‘We’ve commissioned the Hamilton Kerr Institute at Cambridge University - they have lots of experience in this area,’ Mr Bills said. ‘The paints will undergo a scientific test to date them and to see if it’s plausible that they’re Gainsborough’s.’ He said that the museum is undertaking the work now that it has the funding, but it already knows that the bladders are mid-18th Century and French. Some 19 pouches were discovered in the attic and Mr Bills said it is rare to find so many together. ‘It is possible that they were a present to someone in the family but to buy paints at that time wasn’t cheap - they would have been a good present,’ he said. ‘There are secrets yet to be revealed.’ The Suffolk-born painter's former house in Sudbury (pictured) now hosts exhibitions of his work and is a museum for fans of Gainsborough. Thomas Gainsborough was born in Sudbury, Suffolk in 1727 and became one of the country’s most celebrated landscape and portrait artists before dying in 1788 aged 61. He left home in 1740 to study art in London with William Hogarth. After marrying In 1746 Margaret Burr and fathering two daughters, he moved to Bath in 1759 where fashionable society patronised him, and he began exhibiting in London. In 1769, he became a founding member of the Royal Academy, but his relationship with the organisation was thorny and he sometimes withdrew his work from exhibition. Gainsborough moved to London in 1774, and painted portraits of the king and queen. He painted relatively simple landscapes and is credited (along with Richard Wilson) as the originator of the 18th century British landscape school. He painted quickly and his later pictures are characterised by a light palette and easy strokes. He preferred landscapes to portraits. His liking for landscapes is shown in the way he merged figures of the portraits with the scenes behind them. Gainsborough worked more from observations of nature and of human nature than from application of formal academic rules. The poetic sensibility of his paintings caused Constable to say, ‘On looking at them, we find tears in our eyes and know not what brings them.’ The paints (pictured) will undergo a scientific test to date them and to see if it's plausible that they¿re Gainsborough's. Once the tests have been completed and the paints returned to Sudbury they will become part of an exhibition next year and a conference about Gainsborough and contemporary artists. Even if it turns out that the bladders did not belong to the ‘son of Suffolk’ they will still be a valuable addition to the museum’s collection. 'To have 19 surviving is a very rare thing - They are really important,’ Mr Bills said. Once the scientific tests have been completed to establish the paints' former owner, they will become part of an exhibition next year and a conference about Gainsborough and contemporary artists. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In the mid-1960s, 19 paint bladders were discovered in the attic of Thomas Gainsborough's former house in Sudbury, believed to have been used by the famous 18th-century British artist.

In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Icahn said he has unloaded all of his Apple shares, citing concern about the tech giant's challenges in China. The 80-year-old investor said the stock is cheap and he still believes Apple is a \\"great company\\" and CEO Tim Cook is doing a \\"tremendous job.\\" Yet his fears about China have prompted him to exit the stock. \\"China obviously could be a shadow for it,\\" he told CNBC, describing concerns about the government telling Apple what it can and can't do. Icahn started chipping away at his Apple stake months ago, selling 700 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter of 2015. That still left him with some 46 million shares, equivalent to less than 1% of the company. The investment has been a successful one for Icahn. He estimates that he's pocketed about 2 billion in profits and could return for more. \\"I hope to get back into [the stock] someday,\\" he said. Since Icahn announced in a 2013 tweet he had taken a \\"large\\" position in the company after speaking with Tim Cook, he has been one of Apple's biggest fans. Last year, he said the company was worth more than 1 trillion, at a time when its market capitalization was 700 billion. He's routinely called the stock undervalued and misunderstood by the market and expressed hope that Apple would make an entrance into television and cars. The stock was down nearly 2% following Icahn's comments, after falling 6% yesterday on ugly quarterly earnings. Apple has struggled to sell more iPhones and on Tuesday reported its first quarterly sales drop in 13 years. Sales fell all over the world, but dropped an especially steep 26% in China. Must Read: Little Black Book Of Billionaire Secrets ||||| Financial analysts say it's too early to worry about the falling sales in Apple's largest market after U.S. Apple executives said Tuesday that they remained committed to China and that its economy is steadier than many believe. The company also manufacturers in China. ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said Thursday he had sold his entire stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O), citing the risk of China’s influence on the stock. Billionaire activist-investor Carl Icahn gives an interview on FOX Business Network's Neil Cavuto show in New York February 11, 2014. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Icahn, in an interview with cable television network CNBC, also said he was “still very cautious” on the U.S. stock market and there would be a “day of reckoning” unless there was some sort of fiscal stimulus. Icahn had been a huge cheerleader of Apple, acquiring a stake in the company almost three years ago, repeatedly calling the investment a “no brainer.” In an open letter to Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook in May 2015, Icahn had argued that shares of the iPhone maker were worth 240, about 90 percent more than they had been trading. At 240 a share, Apple’s market cap would be 1.4 trillion, Icahn asserted. But Icahn, who owned 45.8 million Apple shares at the end of last year, said China’s economic slowdown and worries about how China could become more prohibitive in doing business triggered his decision to exit his position entirely. “We no longer have a position in Apple. Tim Cook did a great job. I called him this morning to tell him that and he was a little sorry, obviously. But I told him it’s a great company,” Icahn said. “In Apple today as opposed to six months or a year ago, in this one, there’s no need for activism because I think they have a great management. But you worry a little bit, maybe more than a little, about China’s attitude.” The Chinese government could “come in and make it very difficult for Apple to sell there ... You can do pretty much what you want there,” Icahn said. Earlier this month, China shut down Apple’s iTunes movies and iBooks stores within the country, following Beijing’s introduction of regulations in March imposing strict curbs on online publishing, particularly for foreign firms. Asked when he might get back in, Icahn replied: “I don’t think it’s the price point. I think it’s my opinion about what is happening with China. I think the stock is very cheap on a multiple basis. China could be a shadow for it, and we have to look at that.” Icahn, who suggested that he made roughly 2 billion off the Apple trade, said he was in Apple for about three years and “if you bought the stock then, you got a 48 percent to 50 percent total return. We obviously made a great deal of money, but it was no surprise that we got out of some in February.” Apple shares came under further selling pressure during Icahn’s television interview, as did the Dow Jones industrials with Apple closing down over 3 percent at 94.83. The Dow ended down by 210 points. Apple on Tuesday posted its first decline in iPhone sales as well as its first revenue drop in 13 years. The company’s sales fell by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues. Apple shares have now declined more than 10 percent this week. ||||| Chinese customers of Apple's iTunes Movies and iBooks services are seeking refunds on their purchases amid reports that the features have been suspended at the behest of government authorities. Apple has not issued any statement to customers in China about the status of the services, but many users report that they have been unable to connect to the movie service and iBooks since April 15. A Beijing-based Apple spokeswoman said: \\"We hope to make books and movies available again to our customers in China as soon as possible,\\" but she would not elaborate on why the services were unavailable. The Chinese government has not issued any statement on the matter. However, the New York Times, citing two anonymous sources, said the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television had ordered the services offline, though it was unclear why. Apple's App Store revenue has surged in China in the last year, overtaking Japan as the world's No. 2 market for the service, according to App Annie. Apple technical assistance and account service representatives, reached by phone in China, said they had received no official notice from the company that the services had been blocked or shut down. They offered to arrange refunds on purchased content. \\"The iTunes Store's movie service is turned off,\\" one customer wrote on the Twitter-like service Sina Weibo. \\"I spent 88 kuai [about 13.50] buying a 'Star Wars' collection and have not had time to download it. I want know if I can get a refund or not.\\" China has become a massive market for Apple since the Cupertino, Calif. company launched the iPhone on the mainland in 2009. In its fiscal year ending in September 2015, the company said total net sales increased 84% year-over-year in Greater China to 58.7 billion. (Greater China includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan). Apple is one of only a handful of U.S. tech companies that have flourished in China. Facebook and Twitter have been blocked by Internet censors for years. Google pulled its servers out of China in 2010 because of censorship. And Amazon has struggled to gain traction in the country against local rivals such as Alibaba. The government in Beijing has moved to rein in foreign technology companies — at times demanding to add backdoors to hardware and urging data be stored on local servers. Apple said it has never provided a backdoor to Chinese authorities, but it agreed to store user data locally. Now that millions of Chinese own Apple hardware, the company has set its sights on selling them content and services. On Sept. 30, Apple launched its music service, as well as iTunes Movies and iBooks in China. The company in February introduced Apple Pay in China as well. The iTunes movie service enabled fans to rent or purchase movies from Chinese studios as well as Hollywood blockbusters. A variety of free and paid books also were made available on iBooks. Rentals of high-definition movies on iTunes started at about 77 cents, and purchases at 2.77. Paid iBooks started at about 8 cents. \\"For the first time, customers in China will have access to Apple's entertainment ecosystem with music, movies and books right at their fingertips,\\" the company said in a statement announcing the September launch. Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, added at the time: \\"Customers in China love the App Store and have made it our largest market in the world for app downloads. One of the top requests has been more great content, and we're thrilled to bring music, movies and books to China, curated by a local team of experts.\\" To encourage Chinese customers to start using iTunes Movies, Apple offered free rentals of the hit Chinese film \\"The Taking of Tiger Mountain\\" for a limited time. On the books front, Apple touted its selection of Chinese books and foreign novels, noting that it was bringing Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" series to China for the first time in a digital format. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook took to Weibo on the day of the launch, telling Chinese customers: \\"Excited to launch Apple Music, iTunes Movies and iBooks in time for you to enjoy over the October holidays!\\" China celebrates its National Day on Oct. 1. So far, Cook's Weibo account has been silent about the services' suspension. julie.makinen@latimes.com Yingzhi Yang in The Times' Beijing bureau and David Pierson in Los Angeles contributed to this report. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Billionaire activist investor, Carl Icahn, has revealed that he has sold his entire stake in Apple, due to concerns about the company's future in China and the impact of the economic slowdown there.

Scott Frank and Kenneth Branagh regularly work together.","output":"While the first sentence provides information about the 1991 film Dead Again, including the fact that it was written by Scott Frank and directed by Kenneth Branagh, it does not give sufficient context or evidence to support the statement in the second sentence that \\"Scott Frank and Kenneth Branagh regularly work together.\\" To make such a claim, one would need to provide additional examples of projects in which they have both collaborated or discuss their working relationship in further detail. Dead Again is indeed a collaboration between Scott Frank and Kenneth Branagh, but a single instance of them working together does not necessarily mean that they regularly collaborate on various projects. The phrase \\"regularly work together\\" implies a recurring pattern of collaboration between the two artists in multiple films or other creative endeavors. In order to determine the validity of the second sentence, one would need to examine the body of work of both Scott Frank and Kenneth Branagh individually and identify any reoccurring instances of joint collaboration. For instance, one could research their respective filmographies and determine whether they have collaborated on multiple occasions, and if so, whether those collaborations were significant, frequent, and consistent over time. If further research reveals that Scott Frank and Kenneth Branagh have indeed regularly worked together over an extended period of time, then the statement in the second sentence would accurately follow the information provided in the first sentence. However, without that additional information, the second sentence's claim cannot be verified as definitively true or relevant based on the limited context provided.

His parents were both of Ulster Scottish descent, the father having emigrated from Milford, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1783. One of eleven siblings, Buchanan was the oldest child in the family to survive infancy. In March 1860, the House created the Covode Committee to investigate the administration for evidence of offenses, some impeachable, such as bribery and extortion of representatives in exchange for their votes. The committee, with three Republicans and two Democrats, was accused by Buchanan's supporters of being nakedly partisan; they also charged its chairman, Republican Rep. John Covode, with acting on a personal grudge (since the president had vetoed a bill that was fashioned as a land grant for new agricultural colleges, but was designed to benefit Covode's railroad company). However, the Democratic committee members, as well as Democratic witnesses, were equally enthusiastic in their pursuit of Buchanan, and as pointed in their condemnations, as the Republicans. The committee was unable to establish grounds for impeaching Buchanan; however, the majority report issued on June 17 exposed corruption and abuse of power among members of his cabinet, as well as allegations (if not impeachable evidence) from the Republican members of the Committee, that Buchanan had attempted to bribe members of Congress in connection with the Lecompton constitution.

He was also Nagasaki bugyō under the Tokugawa bakufu. The Terazawa clan took part in the Battle of Sekigahara on the side of Tokugawa Ieyasu and received an additional 40,000 koku of land, bringing the total revenues of the domain up to 123,000 koku. The Terazawa took part in the Shogunate's expedition to suppress the Shimabara Uprising. The family held on to Karatsu until 1647, when Hirotaka's son Katataka committed suicide; due to a lack of heir, the family came to an end and the domain was confiscated by the central government. Several families were rotated through Karatsu for the next century: two generations of the Ōkubo clan; three generations of the Ogyū-Matsudaira clan, four generations of the Doi clan, and four of the Mizuno clan, including the famous reformer Mizuno Tadakuni. The domain then passed into the hands of Ogasawara Nagamasa, whose family remained until Karatsu domain was abolished in 1871. During the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration of 1868-69, Ogasawara Nagamichi, the de facto ruler of Karatsu, led a group of his retainers on the side of the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei; after the fall of this alliance he went to Ezo and fought under the forces of the Ezo Republic. At the same time, Karatsu's domain-based administration was forced to pledge military support to the Satchō Alliance of Emperor Meiji.

After the release of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City.

A nice film by Lasse Hallström . This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film. \\"My Life as a Dog\\" known in Sweden as \\"Mitt Liv Som Hund\\" is inarguably Hallström's best known foreign language film. Though he has done other films they are American or British made. \\"Chocolat,\\" \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape,\\" and \\"Something to Talk About.\\" He is also very well known for directing the music videos for the world famous Swedish pop group, ABBA. The film is about a 12 year old boy in 1950's Sweden. He is very rambunctious and when his mother falls ill, his antics prevent her from recovering, so he is sent to live with his uncle. He meets new people there and makes friends with the towspeople. He often compares his misfortunes with those worse off than he is. The film has some excelent scenes of the more rural areas Sweden and some fine photography also. It remains a very popular film to this day and has recieved or been nominated for many awards. It won a golden globe for best foreign film and was nominated for best director by the AMPAS. Though it is described by many people as a family film, it got a PG-13 rating in the US. Mainly for nudity and sexual diaglogue. There is a half second of full frontal female nudity, though non-sexual, it still may be a cause for parental concern. The other scene involves material that I feel uncomfortable mentioning but parents are urged to watch the film themselves before letting their children see it. The special features on the Criterion DVD include Lasse Hallström's first film, \\"Ska vi gå hem till dej eller till mej eller var och en till sitt?\\" which translates to, \\"Shall We Go to My Place or Your Place or Each Go Home Alone?\\" This film has some explicit sex scenes and definately not appropriate for children.

So, Paul's number of photos would be: Paul's_photos = Tim's_photos + 10 Paul's_photos = 52 + 10 Paul's_photos = 62 3. To find Tom's number of photos, we will subtract Tim's and Paul's total photos from the total number of photos. Tom's_photos = Total_photos - (Tim's_photos + Paul's_photos) Tom's_photos = 152 - (52 + 62) Tom's_photos = 152 - 114 Tom's_photos = 38 Thus, Tom has 38 photos."},{"instruction":"Question: Choose between \\"farm field\\" and \\"back yard\\".

The 27-year-old exotic dancer claimed they wanted only to “incapacitate” the first-time user, but the injection of “China White” proved fatal, federal prosecutors said. Cierra Rounds confessed her role in the wicked scheme during a plea on Tuesday in a Dallas federal court. Rounds said she and three others met 19-year-old Rian Lashley on March 25, 2014 at an IHOP restaurant to sell her 100 worth of heroin. The underworld sharks soon smelled a bigger score when they learned Lashley was carrying about 3,000 in cash along with a phone and iPad, prosecutors said. The plot unfolded in text messages as Rounds, Lashley and another woman, Kathryn Dirks, rode back to Round’s home in Lashley’s car. A drug dealer, identified as “J.C.” in court papers, and a 28-year-old named Glen Brunton trailed along in a separate car, prosecutors said. “I figured ud want me on this money,” Rounds texted J.C. The dancer and Dirks took Lashley inside, and J.C. sent a text message to keep her there. Rounds soon sent an update. “ima bout to shoot her up for the first time,” she wrote. The injection was too much for Lashley. She began to struggle, and Rounds and Dirks dumped her in a bathtub of ice water in hopes of counteracting the heroin, prosecutors said. They later put her on a couch. Lashley passed out and never woke up. An autopsy the next day confirmed she’d died of a fatal overdose. Rounds, Dirks and Brunton were indicted on drug charges and accused of contributing to Lashley’s death. Brunton is set for trial in April. Dirks is still on the run. Rounds pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a felony drug conspiracy charge. She faces a maximum of 20 years in federal prison and a 1 million fine when she’s sentenced in September. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"A 27-year-old Dallas stripper, Cierra Rounds, admitted to a fatal robbery plot that involved overdosing a naive 19-year-old, Rian Lashley, with heroin in 2014.

Despite attempting to only incapacitate her, the injection of \\"China White\\" heroin proved lethal for Lashley. Rounds and two others were indicted for drug charges linked to the death.

After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: \\"I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much.\\" He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Erard's on 1 March 1843. Late in 1844, Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him \\"hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain\\", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"One of the conditions that contributed to Chopin's decline starting in 1842 was his increasingly fragile health caused by a combination of various illnesses. While the exact nature of Chopin's health problems remains a subject of debate among scholars, several factors played a significant role in his deteriorating condition. After his solo recital in Paris on February 21, 1842, Chopin complained about severe pain in his mouth and tonsils, forcing him to stay in bed. This episode indicates that Chopin was likely experiencing an infection or inflammation in his throat, which could have negatively affected his overall health and well-being. The fact that Chopin had to decline a written invitation to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Erard's on 1 March 1843 further highlights his weakened state. In addition to these issues, Chopin's physical condition started to visibly worsen by 1844. When Charles Hallé visited him, he described Chopin as \\"hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain.\\" This description suggests that Chopin might have been suffering from a musculoskeletal disorder or another illness that affected his mobility and caused him discomfort. Despite these challenges, Chopin's spirits seemed to improve when he played the piano for Hallé, illustrating the vital role music played in his life even as his health declined. Modern research has also proposed that Chopin might have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy, a neurological disorder that affects the brain's temporal lobes and can cause seizures, among other symptoms. Temporal lobe epilepsy may have contributed to Chopin's overall decline in health and could have exacerbated other health issues he was experiencing at the time. Ultimately, the conditions that contributed to Chopin's decline starting in 1842 were a culmination of several health problems, including throat infections, mobility issues, and possibly temporal lobe epilepsy. These conditions, aggravated by his weakened state, led to a steady deterioration in Chopin's health, which had profound implications for his personal life and professional career as a composer and pianist."},{"instruction":"Computer Associates to Cut 800 Jobs NEW YORK (Reuters) - Software maker Computer Associates &lt;A HREF=\\"http://www.investor.reuters.com/FullQuote.aspx?ticker=CA.N target=/stocks/quickinfo/fullquote\\"&gt;CA.N&lt;/A&gt;on Wednesday said it would cut 800 jobs, or 5 percent of its work force, in one of its biggest cost cutting efforts amid weaker demand and falling prices for software and services.

For a long time, Bali was cut off from much of the world. The people of Bali were happy and had a peaceful life. They were not allowed to fight. At one time there had been terrible wars on Bali. Then the people decided it was wrong to fight or have wars. They made rules to keep apart those people who wanted to fight. Bali was divided into seven small kingdoms.

Are the following two questions the same? What is a common fantasy thing other than magic to make a fantasy world? What are things that are only possible in a fantasy world? Pick your answer from: A). no B). yes The answer is:","output":"A). no The two questions are not the same, as they explore different aspects of the fantasy genre. The first question, \\"What is a common fantasy thing other than magic to make a fantasy world?\\" pertains to identifying elements that are prevalent in fantasy worlds apart from magic. This implies a focus on particular aspects or features that help to define and establish a setting as a fantasy world. Some examples of such common fantasy elements could be: 1. Mythical creatures: Fantastical beings such as dragons, unicorns, and giants often populate fantasy worlds, and can play various roles within stories. They may be friendly or malevolent, wise or dangerous, and can lead to many exciting and unexpected encounters for protagonists to face. 2. Diverse races: Fantasy worlds might have numerous humanoid species living within them, such as elves, dwarves, orcs, and others. These characters often have their own distinct cultures, societies, and territories, which can add to the overall richness of the world as well as provide interesting avenues of story exploration. 3. Complex imaginary geography: Fantasy worlds can be built on elaborate settings with a fictional geography and diverse landscapes, including impressive mountain ranges, sprawling forests, ancient ruins, and various settlements. This rich environment is a central part of creating a believable and engaging world. The second question, \\"What are things that are only possible in a fantasy world?\\" asks for elements that are unique to the fantasy realm as a genre and cannot exist in reality. This can include not just specific features, but also broader concepts or plot points that separate fantasy from the real world. The following are several examples: 1. Magic as a system: While the first question seeks to identify elements apart from magic, this question recognizes magic as a key aspect of a fantasy world. As magic is a fictional concept, it would be impossible to find such systems existing in reality. Be it wizardry, alchemy, or enchantments, the presence of magic greatly impacts the realm of possibilities within a fantasy story. 2. Time travel and parallel universes: Fantasy stories can incorporate fantastical aspects of time travel and alternative dimensions that are not commonly found in the real world. These elements open the door for interesting and unpredictable storylines, as well as unique world-building opportunities. 3. The influence of gods and otherworldly beings: Powerful divine, supernatural, or cosmic beings that interact with and influence the world in fantasy settings are yet another distinctive feature of the genre. While elements of these divine figures are certainly present in religious history and mythology, their direct interaction with characters and events often distinguishes the fantasy world from reality. In summary, the two questions are not the same, as they inquire about different aspects of the fantasy genre. The first question focuses on specific common elements that help define a fantasy world, whereas the second question emphasizes aspects of the fantasy realm that are impossible or highly unlikely to exist in our reality."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials, MJ, is an American retired professional basketball player, businessman, and principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets.

Problem:Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa) is an American writer of violent horror novels whose books are tremendously popular in Europe. In Italy to promote his latest work, entitled Tenebrae, he is accompanied by his literary agent Bullmer (John Saxon) and his adoring assistant Anne (Daria Nicolodi). He is unaware that he is also being followed by his embittered ex-wife Jane (Veronica Lario). Immediately prior to Neals arrival in Rome, a beautiful young shoplifter (Ania Pieroni) is brutally razor-slashed to death by an unseen killer. The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree. Neal immediately contacts the police, who put Detective Giermani (Giuliano Gemma) in charge of the investigation, along with the detectives female partner Inspector Altieri (Carola Stagnaro).More killings occur. Tilde (Mirella D'Angelo), a beautiful lesbian journalist, is murdered at her home along with her lover. Later, Maria (Lara Wendel), the young daughter of Neal's landlord, is bloodily hacked to death with an axe after stumbling into the killer's lair.Neal notices that TV interviewer Christiano Berti (John Steiner) appears to have an unusually intense interest in the novelist's work. At night, Neal and his second assistant Gianni (Christiano Borromeo) watch Bertis house for suspicious activity. Neal decides to separate from Gianni in order to get a better view. Alone, Gianni watches in horror as an axe-carrying assailant brutally hacks Berti to death. But he is unable to see the murderer's face. Gianni finds Neal unconscious on the lawn, having been knocked out from behind.Giermani's investigation reveals that Berti was unhealthily obsessed with Neal's novels, and now that he is dead it is believed that the killings will cease. However, Bullmer, who is having an affair with Jane, is stabbed to death while waiting for his lover in a public square. Gianni is haunted by the thought that he had seen, but did not recognize, something important at Bertis house during the night of the interviewer's murder. He returns to the house and suddenly remembers what was so important he had heard Berti confessing to his attacker, \\"I killed them all, I killed them all!\\" Before Gianni can share this important detail with anyone, he is attacked from the back seat of his car and strangled to death by an unseen assailant.Jane sits at her kitchen table when a figure with an axe leaps through her window, hacking off one of her arms. She spews gallons of blood over the kitchen walls before falling to the floor, the killer continuing to hack at her until she is dead. Neal is her murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal had suddenly been overwhelmed by a forgotten memory involving Neal's murder of a girl who had sexually humiliated him when he was a youth in Rhode Island. The memory now constantly torments him and has inflamed his previously repressed lust for blood. Neal has become completely insane. Berti was the killer of all the women by razor, but it was Neal who also killed Berti, Bullmer and Gianni.When Inspector Altieri arrives at the house a few minutes after Jane's death, Neal kills her too. Later, Giermani and Anne arrive at the house in the pouring rain, and when Neal sees that he cannot escape, he commits bloody suicide in front of them by slashing his neck with a straight razor. Anne runs outside to her car for a moment. Giermani relaxes and is suddenly murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits inside for Anne to return, but when she opens the door, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills the demented writer.

This interactive explores events that have taken place over the last 45 years and the states’ legal actions on marijuana use. Timeline: Marijuana in America Americans' views on the legalization of marijuana have ebbed and flowed over the past four decades. Click through the points in the interactive timeline below to see significant marijuana legal and cultural events over time. Marijuana Laws in 50 States Marijuana use is now legal in some form or decriminalized in 24 states and the District of Columbia. Pew Research Center has found growing public support for legalization over the past decade. Federal law prohibits the possession, selling or harvesting of marijuana. Decriminalization laws reduce the penalties associated with the use or possession of small amounts of marijuana. SOURCE: National Conference of State Legislatures and National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ||||| John Wagner Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) said Monday that he will sign a bill decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana. On a 34-to-8 vote, the Senate gave final approval to the legislation Monday afternoon. The bill would impose only civil fines, rather than criminal sanctions, on those caught with less than 10 grams of the drug. At least 24 other states now have either decriminalized the use of marijuana, approved it for medicinal purposes or legalized it outright, according to a study by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. “As a young prosecutor, I once thought that decriminalizing the possession of marijuana might undermine the public will necessary to combat drug violence and improve public safety,” O’Malley said in a statement. “I now think that [it] is an acknowledgment of the low priority that our courts, our prosecutors, our police and the vast majority of citizens already attach to this transgression of public order and public health.” Maryland would join several states and jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia, that have moved in recent years to legalize or decriminalize the drug. The House voted Saturday 78 to 55 to approve the measure. The decriminalization bill followed a tortuous route to passage, having narrowly survived efforts by House Judiciary Committee Joseph F. Vallario Jr. (D-Prince George’s) and others to kill it in committee, by appointing a task force to study the issue. But a group of lawmakers, including the Black Legislative Caucus, argued that the time had come to end this chapter in the war on drugs. Supporters cast the issue as a matter of civil rights, noting data showing that African Americans go to jail at a higher rate for marijuana possession, despite usage levels that are no different from those of whites. “It’s rare you see that kind of turnaround that fast,” said Sen. Robert A. Zirkin (D-Baltimore County), the bill’s sponsor. Zirkin said Vallario deserved some credit for ultimately signing off on the measure and doing so in a politically savvy way. Vallario opposed decriminalization on principle, Zirkin said, but the chairman also felt growing public support for such a measure, particularly in his district. With decriminalization, violators would receive citations similar to traffic tickets for possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana: the person could either pay the fine in full or request a trial date in District Court. Failure to appear would be a misdemeanor under the criminal code. Records of convictions would not be subject to public inspection, the bill says. As initially passed by the Senate last month, the legislation would have imposed a straight 100 fine on violators — regardless of the number of convictions — and authorized a court to require third-time offenders to enter a drug treatment program. The final bill that emerged from the House and Senate would have escalating fines for multiple offenses: a second violation would carry a 250 fine, and a third offense would have a 500 fine. A court would be required to order a drug assessment for a third-time offender. In addition, a violator who is younger than 21 years old would have to appear before a court; the initial version in the Senate applied that sanction to people under 18 years old. Last year, the legislature took a step toward decriminalization by easing penalties for possession of less than 10 grams to 500 fine and up to 90 days in jail. O’Malley, who rose to political prominence as a tough-on-crime mayor of Baltimore, began this session by pronouncing that he was “not much in favor” of legalizing marijuana for recreational use, as Colorado and Washington state have recently done. He called the drug “a gateway to even more harmful behavior.” But O’Malley, who is considering a 2016 White House bid, has been more open to more moderate marijuana reforms. “The General Assembly has decided after much consideration — and with clear majorities in both Chambers -- to send to my desk a bill that would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana, and I plan to sign it,” he said in Monday’s statement. ||||| Assembly moves to decriminalize marijuana House votes to make pot possession a civil offense The House voted 78-55 to approve a measure substantially similar to the decriminalization bill overwhelmingly passed by the Senate last month. Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller said his chamber would agree to the House's relatively minor changes and send the bill to Gov. Martin O'Malley. The General Assembly moved Saturday to dramatically change Maryland's drug laws as the House of Delegates joined the Senate in voting to make possession of small amounts of marijuana a civil offense punishable only by a fine. Meanwhile, key lawmakers also have reached a tentative compromise on how to revamp the state's medical marijuana law to make sure patients can get the drug. That measure is also expected to receive final approval before the Assembly adjourns at midnight Monday. House Speaker Michael E. Busch, who came into the session a skeptic about treating marijuana possession as a civil offense, cast his vote for decriminalization. \\"The fact of the matter is a lot of people utilize this, and it has not been effective putting them in jail and throwing away the key,\\" he said. The House vote came on a busy Saturday as both chambers scrambled to resolve the remaining sticky issues facing the legislature before Monday night. The tally split largely along party lines, with three Republicans joining 75 Democrats in supporting the measure. Twenty Democrats and 35 Republicans voted no. O'Malley, like Busch, has long had reservations about more lenient marijuana laws, but the governor has said he will keep an open mind in reviewing the bill. If O'Malley signs the measure, Maryland would become the 18th state to stop treating simple possession as a criminal offense, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. Two of them, Colorado and Washington, have legalized the regulated sale of the drug for recreational use. The Maryland decriminalization legislation defines a small amount as 10 grams, a smaller amount than in most states. The House acted on marijuana after the Judiciary Committee voted 13-8 earlier in the day to reverse its previous decision to approve only setting up a task force to study changes to marijuana laws. The committee's reconsideration was the result of negotiations between Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph F. Vallario Jr., a proponent of the task force approach, and a group of his fellow Democrats who want to stop treating marijuana possession as a crime. They include members of the Legislative Black Caucus who point to racial disparities in the way marijuana laws have been enforced. The resulting bargain gave decriminalization proponents most of what they wanted. Where marijuana possession is currently treated as a misdemeanor that carries a maximum 90-day jail term, the legislation would change it to a civil offense for adults, punishable by escalating fines. Minors caught with the drug would continue to be handled by the juvenile justice system. The House kept the Senate's 100 fine for a first offense but increased the penalties for subsequent violations to 250 for a second and 500 for a third. For a first or second offense, a violator older than 21 would be able to prepay the fine by mail, but a three-time loser would have to go to court. If convicted, the judge would have to order the defendant into an education or treatment program. ||||| Maryland is set to become the 17th state to decriminalize marijuana. Democratic Governor Martin O'Malley released a statement on Monday, saying he intended to sign legislation that would mean those found in possession of small amounts of the drug would not face jail time. Governor O'Malley said that the decriminalization bill had majority support in the state, and that under current state laws, few defendants in marijuana cases go to prison as a matter of \\"judicial economy and prosecutorial discretion.\\" Violent crime is at its lowest in Maryland in 30 years, and the governor said the new law would allow law enforcement officials to keep their focus on more serious crimes. \\"I now think that decriminalizing possession of marijuana is an acknowledgement of the low priority that our courts, our prosecutors, our police, and the vast majority of citizens already attach to this transgression of public order and public health,\\" he said in the statement. \\"Such an acknowledgment in law might even lead to a greater focus on far more serious threats to public safety and the lives of our citizens.\\" Governor O'Malley said he would sign the bill when it reached him Marijuana is decriminalized in many US states, but the drug can only be bought and sold legally in Washington and Colorado. Under Maryland's proposed laws, people found in possession of small amounts of marijuana can still be fined, and those discovered to have large amounts, designed for sale or trafficking, can be arrested. Further legislation is likely: recent studies suggest that 75 percent of Americans believe marijuana will eventually be legalized across the country, and that 58 percent of the population support that change. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A news article states that public support for legalizing marijuana use in the United States is at an all-time high of 54%.

What's a sentence that uses these characters?","output":"The term \\"ExternalManagercanbecontrolledlocallyfromminiatureRFremotecontrolwithvariablecode.Remoteshave6combinationsofbuttonsindividuallyconfiguredforeachcombinationandeachbutton\\" requires some separation for easier understanding. Here is the sentence based on these characters: \\"An external manager can be controlled locally from a miniature RF (Radio Frequency) remote control with a variable code. The remotes have 6 combinations of buttons, each individually configured for each combination and each button.\\" Now, let's break it down a bit to give you a more detailed understanding: 1. External Manager: This could refer to a specific device, system or person who can be controlled remotely. Given the context, it's likely pointing towards a device or system that can be manipulated from a distance. 2. Locally controlled: This term suggests that the external manager can be manipulated from a close range, probably within the same locality, building, or network. 3. Miniature RF remote control: RF stands for Radio Frequency. An RF remote control is a type of remote control which uses radio waves to transmit commands. The term 'miniature' suggests that the physical size of the remote control is small, making it convenient to handle. 4. Variable code: This suggests that the commands or signals sent by the RF remote control can vary. This might be a security feature to prevent unauthorized access, or it could simply mean that the remote is capable of transmitting a wide range of commands for different functions. 5. Remotes have 6 combinations of buttons: This points out that the remote control has buttons that can be pressed in 6 different combinations to perform different operations or to control different systems. 6. Individually configured for each combination and each button: This implies that each button on the remote, and each combination of buttons, can be individually set up and programmed. This provides a high degree of customization, allowing the user to have different controls or functions according to their needs. It could also imply that each button/combination corresponds to a different command via the variable code system."},{"instruction":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Silverios voice was called the honey from Alcarria. - Cádiz (; see other pronunciations below) is a city and port in southwestern Spain. It is the capital of the province of Cádiz, one of eight which make up the autonomous community of Andalusia. - Enrique Jiménez Fernández ( 1 December 1848 -- 30 May 1906 ) , known as Enrique el Mellizo was a famous flamenco singer , the most influential one in the development of the Cádiz flamenco styles . Together with Silverio Franconetti and Antonio Chacón , he is considered to be one of the most important figures in the development of flamenco . He was the author of one of the most important malagueña styles , and is reported to have created or developed some styles of Soleares , Alegrías , and Tangos . An oral tradition also states that he was the creator of the Tientos . - Flamenco, in its strictest sense, is a professionalized art-form based on the various folkloric music traditions of Southern Spain. In a wider sense, it refers to these musical traditions and more modern musical styles which have, themselves been deeply influenced and become blurred with the development of flamenco over the past two centuries. It includes \\"cante\\" (singing), \\"toque\\" (guitar playing), \\"baile\\" (dance), \\"jaleo\\" (vocalizations), \\"palmas\\" (handclapping) and \\"pitos\\" (finger snapping). - The cantiñas is a group of flamenco \\"palos\\" (musical forms), originated in the area of Cádiz in Andalusia (although some styles of cantiña have developed in the province of Seville). They share the same \\"compás\\" or rhythmic pattern with the \\"soleá\\" and are usually sung in a lively rhythm (between 120 and 160 beats per minute). They are normally sung in a major mode and have a festive mood. - Alegrías is a flamenco palo or musical form, which has a rhythm consisting of 12 beats. It is similar to Soleares. Its beat emphasis is as follows: 1 2 [3] 4 5 [6] 7 [8] 9 [10] 11 [12]. Alegrías originated in Cádiz. Alegrías belongs to the group of \\"palos\\" called Cantiñas and it is usually played in a lively rhythm (120-170 beats per minute).

Spring Festival, also known as the Chinese New Year, is a Chinese cultural and traditional event marking the beginning of the new year according to the Chinese lunar calendar. It is celebrated by millions of people around the world, mainly in China, but also by Chinese communities in other countries. 2. However, the United States has its own event to mark the beginning of the civil calendar year, which is simply called \\"New Year\\", celebrated on January 1st according to the Gregorian calendar. This celebration is widespread and commonly observed by American people. Meanwhile, only a smaller portion of the American population, those who are of Chinese origin or have a strong connection to Chinese culture, may participate in the Spring Festival celebrations. 3. Therefore, claiming that \\"All the American people will celebrate the Spring Festival\\" is not logical, as it includes everyone in the United States, regardless of their background or cultural attachments, which is not accurate.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Ratatouille Context: Remy is an idealistic and ambitious young rat, gifted with highly developed senses of taste and smell. Inspired by his idol, the recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau, Remy dreams of becoming a cook himself. When an old French woman discovers Remy's clan in her house, they are forced to flee, and Remy becomes separated from his family in the panic. He ends up in the sewers of Paris and eventually finds himself at a skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant. As Remy watches, a young man named Alfredo Linguini is hired as a garbage boy by Skinner, the restaurant's devious current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy, but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. Colette Tatou, the staff's only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence, and decides to keep him instead. Remy discovers that he can control Linguini's movements by pulling his hair. On Linguini's first day as a chef, he and Remy find a way to communicate: Remy guides Linguini like a marionette by pulling on his hair while hidden under Linguini's toque, while Skinner assigns Colette to train his new cook. Suspicious, Skinner learns that the boy is Gusteau's illegitimate son and the rightful heir to the restaurant, which jeopardizes Skinner's control of the restaurant and the lucrative packaged food enterprise he formed using the restaurant's reputation after Gusteau's death. Remy discovers the evidence of Linguini's inheritance and, after eluding Skinner, gives it to Linguini, who deposes Skinner as owner. The restaurant continues to thrive, and Linguini and Colette develop a budding... Answer:","output":"Gusteau's motto is \\"Anyone can cook.\\" This motto is a core principle in the movie Ratatouille, as it reflects the belief that anyone, regardless of their background or circumstances, has the potential to become a great cook. This philosophy is exceptionally significant as it inspires Remy, the rat protagonist, to follow his dream of becoming a chef, despite the challenges faced due to his status as a rat. The motto serves as a symbol of hope and empowerment throughout the film, as Remy and Linguini, a garbage boy turned chef, work together to overcome the skepticism and obstacles they encounter in the world of fine dining. Ultimately, the duo defies expectations and combines their unique talents to create exceptional dishes, proving that anyone can indeed cook, even a rat."},{"instruction":"Sentence from a movie review: excruciating demonstration Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the preceding review, it can be inferred that the movie was seen negatively. The term \\"excruciating demonstration\\" suggests a painful, hardly bearable display or representation, which implies that the reviewer did not find the movie enjoyable or of quality standard. Excruciating is derived from the Latin word \\"excruciatus\\", which translates to \\"out of the cross\\", with \\"ex\\" meaning out of and \\"crux\\" meaning cross or torment. It has its roots in intense suffering or being in a state of cruel distress. In contemporary use, it often describes something that's intensely painful, either physically or emotionally. So, when the word \\"excruciating\\" is used to describe a movie, it means that the movie was so difficult or unpleasant to watch that the feeling could be compared to acute physical pain. As for the term \\"demonstration\\", in the context of film criticism, it often correlates with the acting performance, the way the plot was demonstrated/delivered, the director's vision and how it was executed, or even the screenplay and script. Therefore, an \\"excruciating demonstration\\" implies a showing or making clear of something related to the movie that is very painful, distressing, or unbearable to endure. In many cases, film reviews use such metaphorical language to encapsulate their sentiments about different aspects of the movie, like the plot, characters, performance, cinematography, theme, pace, originality, etc. Within this framework, \\"excruciating demonstration\\" indicates negative feedback highlighting that the reviewer found certain elements of the movie, or possibly the entire film, disappointingly unbearable. However, it's crucial to note that reviews are subjective and represent personal interpretations and opinions of the viewer or critic. A movie deemed as an \\"excruciating demonstration\\" by one person might be seen as an intense, challenging, and ambitious endeavor by another. Therefore, while such a negative review might indicate broad problematic areas within the movie, it does not definitively tag the movie as bad, as this often depends on individual preferences and perspectives."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you will be presented with a question in Dutch language, and you have to write the named entities from the question if present.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this translation is phrased and the importance of gender in the Czech language. 1. \\"Chceš\\" means \\"Do you want\\" in English. It is the second person singular form of the verb \\"chtít,\\" which means \\"to want.\\" In the Czech language, verbs are conjugated according to the person, number, and tense they are being used. 2. \\"se\\" is a reflexive pronoun. In this context, it indicates that the action is being done by the subject to themselves. In English, it can be understood as \\"to get (oneself) married.\\" Reflexive pronouns are quite common and necessary in the Czech language, and they have different forms based on the grammatical case they are in. 3. \\"vdát\\" is the verb that means \\"to marry\\" in the context of a woman getting married. It is the infinitive form of the verb \\"vdávat se\\" which specifically refers to a female subject getting married. When asking a female if she wants to get married, you would use \\"vdát\\" in combination with the reflexive pronoun \\"se.\\" 4. \\"oženit\\" is the verb that means \\"to marry\\" in the context of a man getting married. It is the infinitive form of the verb \\"oženit se\\" which specifically refers to a male subject getting married. When asking a male if he wants to get married, you would use \\"oženit\\" in combination with the reflexive pronoun \\"se.\\" So, when asking a female if she wants to get married, the phrase is \\"Chceš se vdát?\\". Whereas when posing the same question to a male, the phrase is \\"Chceš se oženit?\\". Gender plays an important role in the Czech language, and you'll notice that many nouns, verbs, and adjectives change based on the gender of the subject they are referring to."},{"instruction":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Marlene Pinnock is suing thew LAPD and several California highway patrol officers after one allegedly beat her. Pinnock, 51, was released from the hospital last week after several weeks of treatment for head injuries and now slurs her speech. Gruesome footage from July 1 shows the still unidentified officer savagely beating the homeless woman along a Los Angeles highway.","output":"Title: Marlene Pinnock's Lawsuit Against LAPD and California Highway Patrol Officers Highlights Police Brutality Issue Introduction Marlene Pinnock, a 51-year-old homeless woman, has filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and several California highway patrol officers. The lawsuit comes after Pinnock suffered a brutal beating by an officer on July 1, leaving her with severe head injuries and slurred speech. Gruesome footage of the event has further fueled calls for action against police brutality. Setting the Scene Marlene Pinnock was subjected to a horrifying ordeal in the early days of July. On a Los Angeles highway, she was violently beaten by an unidentified officer whose actions have now led to a legal battle. The incident, captured on cell phone video, has incited shock and demands for reform in the policing of vulnerable communities. Pinnock's Injuries and Recovery The 51-year-old was hospitalized for several weeks after the assault, undergoing extensive treatment for head injuries. It is reported that Pinnock can no longer speak without slurring her words, a distressing consequence of the violence inflicted upon her by the officer in question. Her legal team has stated that she is still struggling physically and emotionally from the inhumane treatment she received. The Lawsuit Marlene Pinnock is seeking justice in the courts, filing a lawsuit against both the LAPD and several California highway patrol officers implicated in the incident. The suit is likely to draw attention to the inadequacies and systemic violence present in policing, particularly concerning marginalized and vulnerable individuals. It is a case that will have an impact on the ongoing conversations surrounding police accountability, reform, and the protection of civil rights. Reactions and Responses The release of the footage showing Pinnock's brutal beating has sparked widespread outrage and calls for action. Citizens, community activists, and political figures alike have condemned the actions of the police officer involved in the attack. Several protests and demonstrations have taken place, highlighting the need for real and lasting change in policing strategies and practices. Police Brutality and the Need for Reform Marlene Pinnock's case serves as yet another example of the systemic problems within law enforcement agencies across the United States. The police brutality displayed in the video is indicative of the violence and excessive force that is disproportionately directed at homeless, minority, and underprivileged communities. In the wake of this incident, calls for widespread police reform and accountability have been renewed. Activists and community leaders are demanding changes in the areas of police training, de-escalation tactics, and the use of force guidelines. Additionally, there is a need to address the deep-seated prejudices and biases present within law enforcement agencies. Conclusion Marlene Pinnock's lawsuit represents more than just her fight for justice; it stands as a critical reminder of the ongoing issue of police brutality in the United States. This case illustrates the necessity of substantial reforms within law enforcement at every level. It is an opportunity to acknowledge systemic issues within institutions built to protect and serve their communities and to work towards creating a safe space for everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, or background."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process: - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body.

This prank ends when the students's coach comes in to find out what is happening. The students are forced to perform a vigorous workout in the gymnasium. Still, two students give Marty a marijuana joint laced with poison, which he smokes in the science lab where he is working on a chemistry project.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When thinking about the environmental impact of plastic bags versus cloth bags, one must consider several factors. Plastic bags are often used only once, and then discarded or thrown away, contributing to the increasing amount of pollution in our landfills and oceans. This pollution can lead to the endangerment or death of marine life due to ingestion or entanglement, and the production of harmful greenhouse gases as these plastic materials break down. On the other hand, reusable cloth bags require more resources to produce, such as water and energy, but they can be used for a longer period, reducing the overall amount of resources required for bag production in the long run. In addition to raw material inputs and production, one must also consider the lifespan and durability of reusable cloth bags. A well-made cloth bag could potentially replace hundreds, if not thousands, of single-use plastic bags over its lifetime. Another important aspect to consider is the potential for recycling and repurposing materials. While both plastic bags and cloth bags can be recycled, the process for recycling plastics is more energy-intensive, and not all plastic bags are properly recycled, with many ending up in landfill or littering our environment. Cloth bags, being biodegradable and made from natural materials, have a much smaller impact on the environment once they are no longer usable. Taking into account the reduced resource usage and waste over time, as well as the potential environmental benefits in recycling or decomposing, it is reasonable to conclude that using reusable cloth bags is a more environmentally friendly option than single-use plastic bags for grocery shopping.

Possible A: first aid kit, chemist, butcher, shower, drug store Why is \\"chemist\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"A double-edged razor is a sharp tool that can be used for cutting or slicing things with precision. The reason \\"chemist\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense is because chemists often work with various materials and substances in laboratories. They may need to cut or shape objects like small samples, tissue sections, thin films, or other delicate materials for analysis or experiments. Using a double-edged razor allows them to make precise, clean cuts that can avoid damaging the samples. While the other options (first aid kit, butcher, shower, and drug store) might involve cutting or use cutting tools in certain contexts, they are not as closely related to the specific application of a double-edged razor for precision cutting. For instance, a first aid kit may contain a safety razor for cutting cloth or tape but not necessarily for precision cutting. A butcher may use sharp knives or saws for cutting meat and bone, but typically not double-edged razors. Showers and drug stores are not specifically associated with cutting things precisely, although a drug store may sell double-edged razors for shaving purposes. Therefore, \\"chemist\\" is the answer that aligns most closely with human common sense in this context."},{"instruction":"What is a question about this article?

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When we think about sentence constructions, we can see that they often contain various components that contribute to the overall meaning. These components can be dependent or independent clauses. Dependent clauses rely on the main clause to make sense while independent clauses can stand alone as complete sentences. Now, considering a sentence with two independent clauses, it's important to convey the main idea in the first clause, known as Sentence A, and then present a contrasting or conflicting idea in the second clause, known as Sentence B. By structuring it this way, we provide context with Sentence A, and then Sentence B brings in an additional layer of complexity to the meaning, deepening our understanding of the subject. Therefore, we can conclude that it is Sentence B that usually carries the contrasting or conflicting idea in a sentence construction with two independent clauses."},{"instruction":"Process: - Ocean waves hit land - Ocean water pulls sand off of beaches - Ocean water breaks rocks off of cliffs - Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean - Sand and rocks go to other land or the bottom of the ocean. suppose less ocean waves hit land happens, how will it affect LESS erosion by the ocean.

Oxytocin is continually released throughout childbirth through a positive feedback mechanism. As noted earlier, oxytocin prompts uterine contractions that push the fetal head toward the cervix. In response, cervical stretching stimulates additional oxytocin to be synthesized by the hypothalamus and released from the pituitary. This increases the intensity and effectiveness of uterine contractions and prompts additional dilation of the cervix. The feedback loop continues until birth. Although the mother’s high blood levels of oxytocin begin to decrease immediately following birth, oxytocin continues to play a role in maternal and newborn health. First, oxytocin is necessary for the milk ejection reflex (commonly referred to as “let-down”) in breastfeeding women. As the newborn begins suckling, sensory receptors in the nipples transmit signals to the hypothalamus. In response, oxytocin is secreted and released into the bloodstream. Within seconds, cells in the mother’s milk ducts contract, ejecting milk into the infant’s mouth. Secondly, in both males and females, oxytocin is thought to contribute to parent–newborn bonding, known as attachment. Oxytocin is also thought to be involved in feelings of love and closeness, as well as in the sexual response.

Development of Substitute Materials was otherwise known as? A:","output":"The Development of Substitute Materials was otherwise known as the Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project was a top-secret research and development program initiated during World War II, led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. The primary objective of the project was to develop and produce the first atomic bombs, with the ultimate goal of ending the war by forcing the surrender of the Axis powers, particularly Japan and Germany. The name \\"Development of Substitute Materials\\" was used to maintain secrecy and to avoid drawing attention to the true nature of the project. The term referred to the process of discovering and producing alternative materials required for the construction of an atomic bomb. This included the development of nuclear fission technology, which utilized the release of energy resulting from the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, primarily Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239. The Manhattan Project involved numerous research sites and employed some of the brightest scientists and engineers from around the world. Key players in the project included J. Robert Oppenheimer, who served as the lead scientist, General Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the entire project, and several prominent physicists and chemists such as Enrico Fermi, Niels Bohr, and Ernest O. Lawrence, among others. After several years of extensive research, experimentation, and development, the Manhattan Project produced the first atomic bomb, which was successfully tested on July 16, 1945, at the Trinity test site near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The bombs' devastating power was soon utilized in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945, effectively ending World War II. The success of the Manhattan Project and the Development of Substitute Materials had far-reaching consequences, paving the way for nuclear power generation, advanced scientific research in atomic energy, and the arms race during the Cold War era. The project remains a testament to the remarkable advancements in science and technology during the 20th century and highlights the ethical and moral implications associated with using nuclear weapons."},{"instruction":"- The trees die off - The dead material provides nutrients for more trees - The rising trees provide shelter - And more organisms begin to thrive - The ecosystem known as a forest is made.

Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up.

In the year of Trump: Not so much. Story Continued Below With the convention less than a month away, POLITICO contacted more than 50 prominent governors, senators and House members to gauge their interest in speaking. Only a few said they were open to it, and everyone else said they weren’t planning on it, didn’t want to or weren’t going to Cleveland at all — or simply didn’t respond. “I am not attending,” said South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, who is overseeing the high-profile congressional Republican investigation into Hillary Clinton’s handling of the attacks on Benghazi. Gowdy, who said he was taking his family to the beach instead, hasn’t gone to conventions in the past and didn’t plan to now. “I’m not,” said South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford, a former two-term governor. “But hope you have a good Thursday!” “Don’t know,” said Sean Duffy, a reality-TV-star-turned-Wisconsin congressman. “I haven’t thought about it.” Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo: \\"I won't be there.” The widespread lack of interest, Republicans say, boils down to one thing: the growing consensus that it’s best to steer clear of Trump. “Everyone has to make their own choice, but at this point, 70 percent of the American public doesn’t like Donald Trump. That’s as toxic as we’ve seen in American politics,” said Stuart Stevens, a longtime Republican strategist who helped to craft the party’s 2012 convention. “Normally, people want to speak at national conventions. It launched Barack Obama’s political career.” Trump’s team is tight-lipped about to whom it’ll extend speaking invitations, as is the Republican National Committee. But many of the party’s most prominent pols say they’re flat-out not interested — and that Trump should look elsewhere. Their rejections range from terse to abrupt, and — in a year otherwise lacking in GOP unity — they seem to be using the same talking points. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte “is not attending the convention,” said a spokeswoman. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner “is not attending the convention,” his office said. A spokesman for South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham: “He announced back in May he's not attending.” For South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley: “The governor has not been asked to speak at the convention and has no plans to.” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn: “There are no plans for him to speak.” House members often have to scrap to get national attention — and eagerly take whatever they can get. But taking the podium in Cleveland? No thanks. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, a rising star who helped to write the GOP platform at the 2012 convention, “will be in her district working for her constituents and not attending the convention,” said a spokesman. Oklahoma Rep. Steve Russell, a former Army lieutenant colonel who helped capture Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, “has no plans to be a speaker at the convention,” said his office. North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, who’s frequently talked about as a potential future statewide candidate, “won’t be at the convention.” Mia Love, the charismatic Utah rep seen by many as the GOP’s future, is skipping Cleveland for a trip to Israel. \\"I don't see any upsides to it,\\" Love told a reporter on Friday. \\"I don't see how this benefits the state.\\" Among the pols staying mum on their convention plans? Those playing host. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman will attend the convention and host several events in Cleveland over the course of the week. But a spokesman, Kevin Smith, said “no announcements” had yet been made on whether he would speak. A spokesman for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Trump primary rival who has pointedly refused to endorse the presumptive nominee, declined to comment on whether he wants to deliver a speech. In past conventions, up-and-coming young senators — think Obama, Barack — have used the limelight to raise their profiles. Not so with Republicans this year: Nebraska's Ben Sasse, who’s said he won’t vote for the real estate mogul, isn’t expected to be at Cleveland. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, an outspoken Trump critic who will be serving on the convention’s powerful Rules Committee, hasn’t been asked to speak, said his spokesman, Conn Carroll. Would he if asked? Said Carroll: “If I got a hypothetical question I probably wouldn’t answer it.” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who recently changed his mind and announced a reelection bid, has said it’s unlikely he’ll be asked to speak — but if he does, it won’t be on Trump’s behalf. Even the GOP leaders in charge of maintaining the party’s congressional majorities — Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker and Oregon Rep. Greg Walden — wouldn’t say whether they’d take the podium. Trump’s convention troubles represent a big turnabout from 2012, when Mitt Romney’s team had an endless list of choices. Whoever Romney wanted to speak, one ex-adviser to the former GOP nominee recalled, he got. They would end up packing the three-day schedule with boldfaced names, including Haley, Portman and Kasich. (One person who didn’t end up making it to the stage: Trump. The New York businessman had initially been slated to speak on the opening day of the convention, with Romney’s nervous aides agreeing to allow him brief remarks, according to “Double Down,” the post-2012 campaign chronicle. The appearance was scrapped, however, because inclement weather forced the cancellation of that day’s activities.) View RNC spokesman: Trump 'speaking figuratively' about convention riots 'Well first of all I assume he’s speaking figuratively,' Sean Spicer, the RNC's chief strategist and spokesman, told CNN. In 2008, John McCain similarly drew a number of GOP stars to his convention in St. Paul. “There was a great deal of interest,” recalled Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who oversaw the programming for that convention. A Trump spokesperson declined to comment on this year’s convention plans. But the billionaire, who has fashioned himself as a Beltway outsider, has hinted that he wants nonpoliticians to have major roles. During a rally this month, Trump floated the idea of having a “Winner’s Evening,” which would spotlight sports stars. It’s also expected that Trump’s children, including daughter Ivanka and sons Eric and Donald Jr., will get prime-time spots. The three have emerged as Trump’s most vocal surrogates. And, while many are reluctant to appear onstage in Cleveland, some aren’t. Those pols who’ve thrown their support to Trump, like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, seem like natural candidates to be convention speakers. Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, a former leader of the Navy SEAL team that would later kill Osama bin Laden, hopes to get a slot, said a spokeswoman. Zinke has endorsed Trump and recently appeared at one of his rallies. For all the unease about Trump, some argue, a speaking slot at the party’s national convention remains a precious commodity. “The exposure has enormous upsides for someone who performs well,” said Fred Malek, a prominent GOP fundraiser who helped to organize the 1988 convention, “and this is the Republican convention, not the Trump convention.” ||||| Donald Trump is marshaling a huge whip operation that includes up to a dozen paid staff members and more than 100 volunteers working to keep delegates in line. | AP Photo Anti-Trump 'advance team' to land in Cleveland this week Anti-Donald Trump forces will be sending an “advance team” to Cleveland this week to begin preparing their effort to strip the Republican presidential nomination from Donald Trump. In a Sunday night conference call with allies around the country, the leaders of the effort described a slow-building organization that would begin setting up a command center outside the arena where the Republican National Convention will be held next month. Story Continued Below “We’ve built a list of every delegate in the country,” said Steve Lonegan, former New Jersey director for Ted Cruz’s failed presidential campaign, who’s now leading the anti-Trump Courageous Conservatives PAC. Lonegan said his group would identify three regional field directors and is in talks with “key people” to name an executive director for the effort. The central focus of these anti-Trump activists is a push to “unbind” the delegates who will choose the GOP nominee at the convention. Many are subject to party rules and state laws that require them to vote based on the results of primaries and caucuses. Unbinding delegates would free them to vote their conscience at the convention at a time when Trump is mired in miserable poll numbers and facing a backlash from conservatives who don’t trust him. Even as delegates on the call predicted victory in their uphill struggle, there were clear divisions. Lonegan emphasized that if Trump emerged from the convention as the GOP nominee, he’d work to help him ensure that Hillary Clinton isn’t elected president. He said he’d “denouce” Republicans who suggested otherwise. But other participants described Trump’s ascendance in near-apocalyptic terms and made no pledge of support. “Donald Trump is just about the worst candidate you can think of for the country first, and for the party second,” said Gordon Humphrey, a former New Hampshire senator and an ally of Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Steve Deace, a conservative Iowa radio host who joined the call, compared the moment to the Founding Fathers’ rejection of King George III. “Everybody on this call ... is now in a position similar to theirs,” he said. “You may face the wrath of party bosses. That’s nothing like facing the wrath of a king.” Leaders of the effort, largely spearheaded by Colorado delegates Kendal Unruh and Regina Thomson, also seemed caught between projecting optimism and acknowledging that anti-Trump delegates are terrified to reveal themselves. “We don’t have enough time to be stealth anymore,” said Unruh, whose group Free the Delegates is advocating for unbinding delegates. There are signs abound that anti-Trump delegates will be wildly outnumbered and outgunned at the convention. A POLITICO survey of the 112 delegates who will write the rules of the convention — and have the first word on efforts to unbind — revealed that more than half of the committee support Trump’s nomination. Several other delegates on the committee added their names to the list over the weekend. “I absolutely will not support any effort and do not think anyone else from Hawaii will either,” said Nathan Paikai, one of two convention Rules Committee members from Hawaii, in an email. \\"This is clearly a desperate, selfish attempt at self-promotion by a very tiny minority of the national Republican delegates.\\" In addition, Trump is marshaling a huge whip operation that includes up to a dozen paid staff members and more than 100 volunteers working to keep delegates in line. Unruh, who is also on the Rules Committee, described suggestions that the committee is stacked against her as “misinformation.” There were also indications that delegates are struggling to understand the basics of the procedural maneuvers at their disposal in the effort to stop Trump. One such strategy would occur during the presidential nomination vote, when each state casts ballots alphabetically and declares how many delegates will back Trump or his rivals. Delegates are free to object to the count delivered by the leaders of their state delegations and force a roll call, during which anti-Trump delegates could attempt to register their objections. But many delegates are still unclear about how such an effort would play out in real time or what to do if their objections go unheeded. the call, a delegate who identified himself as being from Maine, said he wasn’t sure how to proceed. “How would we do that in the heat of the moment on the floor?” he wondered. Unruh the convention operates under the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, and she said she’s been consulting with parliamentarians who understand the rules of the House. “It would be just tragic if we advanced the ball this far down the field and were just sidelined,” she said. There were also renewed signs, however, that the Trump campaign is paying attention to the anti-Trump efforts. One man who identified himself as a delegate on the call described being contacted by an official inside the Trump campaign and asked whether he’d heard from Free the Delegates. “I explained to him that I was actually seeking them out myself,” he said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A lack of interest in speaking at the Republican National Convention, which is less than a month away, is largely due to the general consensus that it is best to steer clear of Donald Trump. The majority of responses from over 50 prominent governors, senators, and House members when asked if they would attend ranged from not planning to attend to not wanting to attend. This is a considerable change from the 2012 convention, when Mitt Romney had an extensive list of those desiring to speak. The exposure from speaking at the convention is said to have enormous benefits for those who perform well; however, many are reluctant to appear this year."},{"instruction":"This question has options.

The author expresses strong enthusiasm and delight about the food, particularly the noodles with the Beef/Oyster sauce, through hyperbolic phrases such as \\"Magic OMFG Noodle\\" and \\"soooooooo gooooooood!\\" The satisfaction is reinforced by the statement that despite being full upon finishing their meal, they were merrily content without room for anything else, implying they very much enjoyed what they ate. They commended the food quality, which they say \\"did not disappoint,\\" and even recount that their friend, despite admitting to over-ordering, still found the food \\"very good.\\" These observations suggest an overall positive dining experience, reassured by the anticipation of their friend’s intention to adjust their order size next time, implying a return visit. There was only one notably negative comment about the egg rolls being \\"very 'meh'\\", so they did not meet the reviewer's expectations. However, they gave perspective by stating that the outstanding noodles more than made up for the lackluster egg rolls, thus the positive assessment of the noodles neutralizes the negative evaluation of the egg rolls. Lastly, they express a minor disappointment that the establishment does not serve beer or wine, but this information is offered more as a side note. The reviewer doesn’t dwell on this aspect nor let it significantly influence their overall impression. In sum, although there are minor criticisms mentioned, they are outweighed by the overall enthusiasm and satisfaction expressed regarding the quality of the noodles, the main dish emphasized in the review.

They signed to Tragic Hero Records in 2009. The band's current lineup is front man Schuylar Croom, guitarists Adam Tanbouz and Denis Desloge, bassist Matt Williams, and drummer Sam Huff. - The Famine was an American heavy metal band that formed in 2007 in Arlington, Texas. The band was signed to Solid State Records. - Post-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that derives from hardcore punk, maintaining hardcore's aggression and intensity, but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression initially inspired by post-punk and noise rock. Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. - Act of Depression is the debut album by Underoath. Released July 4, 1999, through Takehold Records, the album was out of print for some time as there were only 2,000 copies originally released. Solid State reissued this album alongside \\"Cries of the Past\\" on August 20, 2013. - Underoath (stylized as Underøath or UnderOath) is an American Christian post-hardcore band from Tampa, Florida. Founded by Dallas Taylor and Luke Morton on November 30, 1997, in Ocala, Florida, subsequently its additional members were from Tampa, Florida. - Stretch Arm Strong (Also known as Stretch Armstrong) is a hardcore punk band from Irmo, South Carolina, and the flagship band for We Put Out Records. They have been active since 1992. Several of the band members are outspoken Christians, but they prefer not to be classified as a Christian band in some cases. They do prefer to be known as Christian with influences, but not as a band that \\"preaches\\". Vocalist Chris McLane appears on Zao's \\"The Lesser Lights of Heaven\\" DVD. - Training for Utopia, also stylized as TFU, was a metalcore band which existed from 19962000. - The Almost was an American Christian rock band from Clearwater, Florida, best known for being fronted by Underoath drummer and vocalist Aaron Gillespie. Formed in 2005, the band's current lineup consists of Gillespie on vocals, lead guitarist Dusty Redmon, rhythm guitarist Jay Vilardi, bassist Jon Thompson, and drummer Joe Musten. The band has released three albums and two EPs on Tooth & Nail Records, with 2009's \\"Monster Monster\\" peaking at No. 67 on the \\"Billboard\\" 200 and the most recent \\"Fear Inside Our Bones\\" released June 2013. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Paramore is an American rock band from Franklin, Tennessee, formed in 2004. The band currently consists of lead vocalist Hayley Williams and guitarist Taylor York. The group released its debut album \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" in 2005, with the album reaching number eight on the UK Rock Chart and number thirty on \\"Billboard\\"s Heatseekers Chart. While it only had a minimal commercial performance initially, the album and its lead single \\"Pressure\\" were eventually certified Gold by the RIAA after the success of the band's later material. - The Agony Scene is an American metal band from Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States. On October 8, 2008, frontman Mike Williams confirmed that the band had broken up in the spring of that year. Although The Agony Scene was known for blending several corrosive elements from genres including thrash metal, black metal and hardcore punk, the band was also generally considered to be a part of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Aaron Roderick Gillespie (born July 18, 1983) is an American musician, best known for being the original drummer and clean vocalist for the metalcore band Underoath, and was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist for the alternative rock band The Almost.

He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes. As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party. Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue. Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years. The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days. Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law. Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964..., what would be the answer ?","output":"Based on the information given in the article, the full name of the person who served in the United States Senate from his appointment in 1964 until becoming Vice President in 1977 is Hubert Humphrey."},{"instruction":"Question: What conflict caused Britain to blockade trade?

The interior is filled with warm, wooden furniture and the walls are decorated with paintings from local artists. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and freshly baked pastries fills the air. Characters: Adam: An AI engineer in his early 30s who loves to discuss the latest trends in technology. He is a tall man with glasses and short-cropped dark hair. Eva: A high school history teacher in her late 20s who has an interest in learning more about technology, particularly AI. She has long, wavy brown hair and is wearing a comfortable blouse and jeans. (Scene commences with Eva sitting at a small table near the window, reading a book about Artificial Intelligence. Adam notices the book and approaches Eva.) Adam: (smiling) I couldn't help but notice the book you're reading. Are you interested in AI? Eva: (looking up from the book) Oh, yes! I'm trying to learn more about it. I'm a history teacher, and I think I need to be more informed about the technologies that will shape our world going forward. Adam: (enthusiastically) That's great to hear! I am an AI engineer, so I'd be more than happy to chat about it if you have any questions. Eva: (grateful) Thank you! I appreciate that. How would you explain AI to a layperson like me? Adam: Sure! At its core, AI is a branch of computer science that focuses on building intelligent machines that can think, learn, and make decisions like humans. Eva: Oh, I see. I've heard about AI being used in various industries, like finance, healthcare, and even entertainment. Can you tell me how AI is being applied there? Adam: Absolutely! AI has a vast range of applications, and it's growing every day. In finance, AI is used to predict stock market trends, help with fraud detection and even improve customer service with the help of AI-powered chatbots. In healthcare, AI can assist in diagnostics, treatment planning, and even be used to create personalized health plans based on an individual's genetic information. And in entertainment, AI is used to recommend movies, music, and games based on user preferences, as well as create new works of art using generative algorithms. Eva: That's fascinating! But I've also heard people express concerns about AI, like job loss and ethical dilemmas. What are your thoughts on these issues? Adam: Those are valid concerns. AI has the potential to replace some jobs, but it's essential to remember that AI can also create new job opportunities. The key is preparing the workforce for the changes that AI will bring and adapting our educational and professional training systems accordingly. As for the ethical dilemmas, a lot of work is being done to ensure that AI systems are developed to be fair, transparent, and accountable. This requires collaboration between engineers, ethicists, and policymakers to create guidelines that help minimize the potential risks. Eva: That's reassuring. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with me. I am quite excited to see how AI will continue to develop and change our world. Adam: You're welcome! It's always a pleasure to discuss AI with someone who is genuinely interested in learning about it. If you ever have more questions or want to continue our conversation, feel free to reach out to me. Eva: Thank you, Adam. I will definitely keep that in mind. I hope you have a great day! Adam: You too, Eva. Enjoy your book! (They exchange smiles and Adam walks away. Eva continues reading her book, now with a deeper understanding and appreciation of Artificial Intelligence.)"},{"instruction":"Summarize this article in one sentence. If you're a college student yourself, you'll spend a good part of your day in classes too, so it only makes sense to look around and see if there are any interesting girls among your classmates. You're probably have the best luck in a class in your favorite subject because there's a chance that you'll share some common interests. If you're uncomfortable approaching girls, meeting in class can help take some of the nerves out of the experience because you'll have a conversation starter ready to go -- ask for help with an assignment or commiserate about the professor. Take advantage of group projects that might come up in classes. It's a good way to get to know a girl without the pressure of having to approach her. Working while you're a student isn't just a great way to ensure that you have some extra cash; it can be a great opportunity to meet new people. You may find a girl who you like among your co-workers or your customers if you're working somewhere like the bookstore or snack bar. Just as with meeting someone in class, getting to know someone on the job can take some of the pressure off because you'll already have something in common. If you're not a student yourself, it may be difficult to get a job on campus. Instead, try to find a position at a business near campus that's frequented by students, such as a coffee house or sandwich shop. You don't necessarily have to look for a paying job. Volunteer positions and internships can also offer opportunities to meet girls. Relationships usually work best when you share interests with your partner, so it's a good idea to look for a girl who you have something in common with. Whether you get involved with the school newspaper, environmental club, or an intramural sport, you'll meet plenty of new people who are interested in the same thing you are -- and you can really get to know someone well when you're working toward a common goal. If you can't find a club on campus that suits your interests, consider starting your own organization. It only makes sense that you'll meet plenty of college girls at spots where students congregate, so spend time at the dining hall, student union, and even the library. If there aren't popular hangouts on campus or you're not a student, try off-campus locales that students frequent, such as coffee shops, bars, clubs, and restaurants. Meeting a girl when she's in a social mood may improve your chances of getting a date, so a party is usually a great opportunity to get to know someone. Frat parties, house parties, and even school dances can provide a fun setting to meet a girl. If you're not the partying type, it's best not to force yourself to go a party. You'll likely feel uncomfortable, and only wind up meeting someone who has different interests from yours.

If the given premise states \\"They're too different,\\" we can infer that the distinct qualities or properties of the subjects being referred to are quite disparate. The premise suggests that the differences between the two are significant and, as a result, they might not have much in common. Given this understanding of the premise, let us examine the hypothesis \\"They are not similar enough for this task.\\" This hypothesis argues that due to the lack of adequate similarity between the subjects, they are not suited or fit for a particular task. Essentially, the hypothesis is making a statement about the potential consequences or relevance of the differences for a specific context (in this case, the task). In light of the premise and hypothesis, we can find that there is a connection between the two assertions. The premise's emphasis on the stark differences between the subjects directly points to the likelihood that they may not exhibit the necessary similarities needed for the task in question. As a result, the premise does entail the hypothesis.

Ensuring that a vehicle's tires are properly inflated is crucial for maintaining the safety and optimal performance of the car. In this instance, Skylar's action may have stemmed from a genuine concern for Ash's well-being and the desire to make their journey home as safe as possible. There could be multiple reasons behind Skylar's decision to help Ash, which include: 1. Friendship or a close relationship: Skylar might be a close friend or family member of Ash who is empathetic to their struggles and understands the importance of a safe and functional vehicle. This sense of responsibility might also drive Skylar to take action and support Ash in making sure their driving experience is secure. 2. Knowledge about tire safety: Skylar could have a thorough understanding of tire maintenance and its impact on the safe operation of a car. This knowledge would undoubtedly lead them to recognize the importance of addressing Ash's flat tires to mitigate the risk of accidents or breakdowns. 3. Altruism or helpful nature: Another possible explanation for Skylar's actions is an innate desire to help others in need, regardless of their relationship with the person. Skylar may simply want to make a positive impact on someone's life, in this case, by ensuring Ash's safe travel. 4.

Related: Federal police admit seeking access to reporter's metadata without warrant In a 22-page opinion issued by the sixth circuit court of appeals, the judges said the FBI’s collection of records from wireless carriers for phone numbers connected to two Detroit men was constitutional. Timothy Carpenter and Timothy Sanders, who were convicted for their role in a string of cellphone store robberies, argued the practice was a constitutional violation under the fourth amendment. A brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union noted that the location tracking in this case reveals the “extraordinary private details” police can obtain via location tracking, including where the defendants may worship and who they may be sleeping with. The appellate panel disagreed in the ruling, saying the pair had “no expectation of privacy” for location information. The judges added the records are unprotected, as they “say nothing about the content of any calls”. In early 2011, law enforcement officials arrested four men suspected in a string of armed robberies around metro Detroit. One of the men confessed to multiple robberies and proceeded to cooperate with the FBI, handing over his phone number, as well as 16 others linked to other possible suspects. Investigators then sought orders to obtain records for “cell site information” for the phone numbers on incoming and outgoing calls over several months, the opinion said. The judges granted the orders. The ACLU found investigators obtained records that included nearly 13,000 separate location points for Carpenter, and more than 23,000 for Sanders, which they calculated was an average of one every six minutes. As a result, Carpenter and Sanders were charged with aiding and abetting multiple robberies. The pair’s motion to suppress the cell location data, contending that a warrant with probable cause was required to obtain the records, was denied by the lower court. The opinion said that Carpenter was described in court as the organizer of several robberies, where Sanders “had served as lookout”. The court reasoned that the defendants do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in “third-party” data such as that from a cellphone carrier. The judges also distinguished between the content of communications such as emails and location information. ”[T]he cell-site data – like mailing addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses – are information that facilitate personal communications, rather than part of the content of those communications themselves,” the ruling stated. ACLU attorney Nate Wessler disagreed. “When we did our own analysis of this location records … we were able to tell things like when the defendant spent the night at home and spent the night at a different neighborhood,” Wessler said. “These records when they’re aggregated can be very sensitive and it’s very important that our understanding of the fourth amendment keeps pace with the advancing technology.” Judge Jane Stranch joined the majority opinion but took issue with the “sheer quantity of sensitive information procured without a warrant,” which “raises fourth amendment concerns”. Stranch also said there was a need to develop a new test to determine when a warrant is needed to obtain similar records. “The runaway pace of technological development makes this task more difficult,” she said. “But the job is ours nonetheless and the circumstances before us lead me to believe that we have more work to do to determine the best method.” The ruling is consistent with separate regional appeals courts, but conflicts with an August ruling by the fourth circuit court of appeals, which found that: “Even as technology evolves, protections against government intrusion should remain consistent with those privacy expectations society deems reasonable.” Wessler said he believes the conflicting opinions suggest “more courts certainly will be taking up this question at the appellate panel”. “And perhaps the supreme court will have to weigh in eventually to set a consistent standard across the country,” he said. The US attorney’s office in Detroit, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment. Carpenter’s attorney, Harold Gurewitz, said his client may ask the sixth circuit to rehear the case or petition the supreme court for consideration. “It concerns an issue that I think is important,” he said, “one that’s been raised in other courts across the country, both state and federal, so it is important and we’re going to look at it real quickly.” Gurewitz said the supreme court needs to step in to resolve the issue at some point. “Technology has moved forward at a speed that has continued to increase,” he said. “And I think it’s time to give the [supreme] court an opportunity to talk about how the law ought to address these … issues.” Sanders was already serving a 30-year sentence for murder, and received an additional 14 years for his role in two robberies. Carpenter was sentenced to over 116 years in prison, which the court also found to be legal. “Carpenter has a long criminal history,” the opinion said. “In this case, as the district court observed, Carpenter organized and led several ‘very violent’ robberies that put his victims ‘in extreme danger’.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1.

It raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters. But what's told is so cynical and ugly and muddled, we're left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as history. The tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that I found more irritating than fun. We're not empathetic with anyone.

Sean Bean Answer:","output":"Title: A Royal Gamble Plot: In a quaint and picturesque town on the English countryside, an enigmatic character, English Spence (played by Sean Bean), is known for his mastery of the chessboard. Over the years, his fame has slowly transcended the sleepy town, attracting chess enthusiasts from around the world seeking to learn from or challenge the legendary player. The story starts with a series of mysterious incidents occurring within the town. People from a distant land are said to be searching for a priceless artifact that once belonged to an ancient king - an ornamented chessboard with pieces made of gold and highly valuable gemstones. Legend has it that this mystical board bestows supernatural powers upon its owner, ensuring victory in any battlefield or realm. After serving its king loyally for years, the artifact was separated into two parts: the gold pieces and the actual board. The pieces have been missing for centuries, but the board is believed to have resurfaced in the town. On hearing the news of the royal artifact, English Spence is immediately intrigued. His expertise as a chess player pushes him to embark on the challenging journey to uncover the board and restore its ancient legacy. Meanwhile, Jane Hamilton (played by Emily Blunt), a smart and resourceful detective, is assigned to the town to investigate and halt any threats related to the mysterious happenings. As Spence delves deeper into the legend, he begins to uncover links between the chessboard and the royal lineage in England. His research unravels treacherous secrets that put his life in danger. He teams up with Detective Hamilton, who uses her wit and instincts to assist Spence in his quest. The duo encounters dangerous individuals and challenges that test the limits of their intellect, courage, and loyalty. As their journey unfolds, Spence and Hamilton must confront a sinister organization determined to possess the artifact's power for nefarious purposes.

Which student read more about the production of glucagon? Tim and Fred were two students. Tim studied about negative feedback and the pancreas, while Fred studied about the stomach and the jejunum. Hint: Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose.

Genealogists have begun to find plantation records, court records, land deeds and other sources to trace African-American families and individuals before 1870. As slaves were generally forbidden to learn to read and write, black families passed along oral histories, which have had great persistence. Similarly, Native Americans did not generally learn to read and write English, although some did in the nineteenth century. Until 1930, census enumerators used the terms free people of color and mulatto to classify people of apparent mixed race.

The review begins by highlighting the key benefit of the product: its ability to greatly enhance the user's field of vision, which can be invaluable in various situations. By comparing the mirror's utility to \\"having eyes in the back of your head,\\" the reviewer effectively conveys the idea that this product can provide users with an almost 360-degree view, allowing for increased awareness of their surroundings. Additionally, the reviewer provides useful information for potential buyers who may have space constraints in their intended mounting location. By mentioning the specific issue encountered when trying to mount the mirror on the walk-thru windshield leading to the bow, the reviewer effectively sets realistic expectations for consumers who have similar setups, ensuring that they are not disappointed upon purchase. However, this review does include a caveat regarding potential obstruction of the view when mounted on the windshield in front of the driver's side. While this concern may slightly dampen the otherwise positive assessment, it does not overshadow the numerous advantages that the mirror offers. It is important to consider that the reviewer is being pragmatic rather than derisive, to ensure potential buyers are aware of all aspects of the product they are considering. This serves to benefit the reader in making an informed decision, and not to malign the product. Having analyzed the review, it can be concluded that it predominantly paints the \\"Eyes in the back of your head\\" mirror in a flattering light, showcasing its great functionality and value. The few minor reservations mentioned by the reviewer should not detract from the overall positive nature of the assessment, but rather provide useful insights for potential buyers who may face similar challenges regarding installation and view obstruction due to their specific circumstances."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: Who was the main singer of 'Hold Your Dream'?

This cable-stayed bridge was completed in 2001 as a collaboration between the Egyptian and Japanese governments, making it a symbol of friendship between the two countries. The Japanese government provided financial and technical assistance through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the construction process involved both Japanese and Egyptian engineers and laborers. Situated over the Suez Canal, the bridge connects the continents of Africa and Asia, offering a more accessible route to various countries and fostering trade and communication. Specifically, the bridge spans between the city of Suez on the African side and Sinai Peninsula on the Asian side, providing an essential route for the transportation of goods and people around the region. The Suez Canal Bridge measures approximately 3.9 kilometers (2.4 miles) in length, with the main span of the bridge reaching about 400 meters (1,312 feet). Its towers stand at a remarkable height of 154 meters (505 feet) each, enabling the bridge to have an air draft clearance of 70 meters (230 feet) for the safe passage of large vessels and container ships beneath it. To build the bridge, engineers employed advanced state-of-the-art technologies to ensure its stability and resilience against natural disasters like earthquakes. As both sides of the canal have sandy soils, extensive foundational work was needed for the bridge's construction, including the installation of deep piles reinforced with steel and concrete. Its cable-stayed design allows for the efficient distribution of weight and tension, making it not only visually appealing but also structurally reliable. Not only does the Suez Canal Bridge serve as a crucial transportation link for the movement of goods, people, and vehicles across the two continents, but it has also become a strategic passageway for regional security and military operations. In addition, the bridge has played a critical role in fostering economic growth, promoting tourism, and encouraging cultural exchange in the area."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

At the center of this turmoil was Bosnia and Herzegovina, a multi-ethnic state consisting of Bosniaks (primarily Muslims), Croats, Serbs, and others. To better understand the demographic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1991, it is essential to examine the relative proportions of these various ethnicities, focusing specifically on the percentage difference between Bosniaks and the combined population of \\"other ethnicities\\" and Yugoslavs. This analysis will shed light on the circumstances and disputes that shaped the Bosnian War and its aftermath. Step 1: Collect 1991 Census Data To perform an accurate comparison of the populations in question, we must first locate the 1991 census data for Bosnia and Herzegovina. After referencing the data, we find the following population breakdown: - Bosniaks: 1,902,956 (43.47%) - Serbs: 1,366,104 (31.21%) - Croats: 760,852 (17.38%) - Yugoslavs: 242,682 (5.54%) - Other Ethnicities: 75,620 (1.72%) Step 2: Calculate the Combined Percentage of \\"Other Ethnicities\\" and Yugoslavs Next, we add the percentage of \\"other ethnicities\\" and Yugoslavs to find their combined percentage within the population. Combined percentage of \\"Other Ethnicities\\" and Yugoslavs = 5.54% (Yugoslavs) + 1.72% (Other Ethnicities) = 7.26% Step 3: Determine the Percentage Difference Between Bosniaks and the Combined Population of \\"Other Ethnicities\\" and Yugoslavs Now we calculate the percentage difference between the Bosniak population and the combined population of \\"other ethnicities\\" and Yugoslavs. Percentage difference = 43.47% (Bosniaks) - 7.26% (Combined \\"Other Ethnicities\\" and Yugoslavs) = 36.21% Conclusion Based on the 1991 census data, the Bosniak population in Bosnia and Herzegovina was significantly larger than the combined population of \\"other ethnicities\\" and Yugoslavs, with a percentage difference of 36.21%. This demographic landscape played a critical role in the political and social conflicts that emerged during this period, as different ethnic groups vied for representation, power, and autonomy. Understanding these numerical disparities provides important context for tracing the historical roots of ethnic tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the broader former Yugoslav region."},{"instruction":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: One day a mime is visiting the zoo and tries to earn some money as a street performer.

AAPL -2.54% Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company will oppose a federal judge’s order to help the Justice Department unlock a phone used by a suspect in the San Bernardino, Calif., attack. In a strongly worded letter to customers posted on Apple’s website early Wednesday, Mr. Cook called the order an “unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers” with “implications far beyond the legal case at hand.” The order, reflected in legal filings unsealed Tuesday, marks a watershed moment in the long-running argument between Washington and Silicon Valley over privacy and security. From the Archives Apple CEO Tim Cook explains Apple's encryption and privacy policies, in a discussion with WSJ's Editor-in-Chief Gerard Baker at the Wall Street Journal's technology conference in Laguna Beach, Calif., in October. Former CIA and NSA Director, General Michael Hayden frames the debate around whether technology companies should be allowed to use unbreakable encryption. He speaks with WSJ's John Bussey at the 2016 CIO Conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif. In the order, U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym agreed with a Justice Department request that Apple help unlock an iPhone 5C once used by Syed Rizwan Farook. The order calls on Apple to disable certain security measures on the phone, including a feature that permanently erases the data from the phone after 10 unsuccessful tries at the password. Such measures have kept agents from reviewing the contents of the phone, according to the filing. When the phone is locked, the data is encrypted. Apple said it has cooperated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation during the investigation, complying with valid search warrants and subpoenas. Apple said the government now effectively wants it to create a new version of its iPhone software that bypasses important security measures. The order, Mr. Cook wrote, asks the company “for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create.” “The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements which protect our customers—including tens of millions of American citizens—from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals,” said Mr. Cook. “We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack.” In the statement, Apple also questioned the U.S. government’s use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to “justify an expansion of its authority” through the request. “The implications of the government’s demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs Act to make it easier to unlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyone’s device to capture their data,” wrote Mr. Cook. Apple said it isn’t opposing the order lightly nor does it question the FBI’s intentions, but it feels that the government has overreached. In her order, Judge Pym gave Apple five days to appeal. Write to Daisuke Wakabayashi at Daisuke.Wakabayashi@wsj.com ||||| WASHINGTON — Last month, some of President Obama’s top intelligence advisers met in Silicon Valley with Apple’s chief, Timothy D. Cook, and other technology leaders in what seemed to be a public rapprochement in their long-running dispute over the encryption safeguards built into their devices. But behind the scenes, relations were tense, as lawyers for the Obama administration and Apple held closely guarded discussions for over two months about one particularly urgent case: The F.B.I. wanted Apple to help “unlock” an iPhone used by one of the two attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in December, but Apple was resisting. When the talks collapsed, a federal magistrate judge, at the Justice Department’s request, ordered Apple to bypass security functions on the phone. The order set off a furious public battle on Wednesday between the Obama administration and one of the world’s most valuable companies in a dispute with far-reaching legal implications. “This Apple case really goes right to the heart of the encryption issue,” said Ira Rubinstein, a senior fellow at the New York University Information Law Institute, “and in some ways, this was a fight that was inevitable.” |||||","output":"Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the company will oppose a federal judge's order to help the US Justice Department unlock a phone used by a suspect in the San Bernardino attacks.

By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.

Qaed al-Thahab, the top AQAP leader in the country's Baitha province and described as a \\"high-profile target,\\" was among those killed, the sources said. They said eight missiles were launched by two unmanned drone planes targeting vehicles. The strikes are believed to have been undertaken by the United States, which has been conducting drone strikes in the fight against terrorism. There was no immediate comment about the attack from the United States. Offensives by the nation's army and drone attacks by the United States have reduced the terror organization's effectiveness in recent years. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. The Long War Journal, a website that tracks, reports and analyzes the U.S. fight against terrorists, said the drone strike was the first in Yemen since August 10, when the United States targeted AQAP operatives traveling in Lahj province. Drone strikes against militants in Yemen intensified a few weeks ago as the U.S. Embassy there and in other Middle Eastern and African countries closed amid terrorism fears. After the Lahj strike, a Yemeni Defense Ministry official said that 34 people had been killed in 12 drone strikes since July 28.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process involves converting the mechanical energy generated by the spinning turbines into electrical energy, which can then be transmitted and distributed to consumers for various uses. Once the steam from the boiling water exerts enough pressure on the turbine blades, causing them to spin, the kinetic energy generated by the turbine's rotation needs to be harnessed and converted into a more usable form: electrical energy. This is achieved through the use of an electrical generator. An electrical generator is comprised of a stationary stator and a rotating rotor. When the steam-driven turbines spin, they are connected to the rotor in the generator. As the rotor rotates, it is surrounded by the stationary stator, which contains tightly wound copper coils. The rotor itself consists of a series of electromagnets. As the rotor with its electromagnets spins within the stator, it creates a fluctuating magnetic field that cuts through the copper coils in the stator. This action induces an electric current in the stator coils, in accordance with Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction. The induced electric current, or alternating current (AC), is collected by the generator's terminals and sent to a transformer. The transformer plays a crucial role in stepping up the voltage of the generated electricity to a higher level, making it more suitable for long-distance transmission through power lines. After the electricity passes through the transformer, it enters the electrical grid, where it is distributed and transmitted to various consumers, such as residential, commercial, and industrial users. In summary, the final step in the process of generating electricity from coal involves converting the mechanical energy produced by the spinning turbines into electrical energy using a generator, followed by the transformation and transmission of the generated electricity through the power grid to end-users. This entire process, starting from mining the coal and ending with the distribution of electricity, is known as the coal power generation cycle."},{"instruction":"Zzzz...no work tomorrow..yayyy!!

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","output":"If Sugar Ray Robinson were to steal in Iran, it is possible that he would face legal consequences based on the laws and regulations within the country. Taking into consideration that he was a professional boxer and known for his boxing skills, the question about whether he could still box after the incident would depend on a few factors. Let's analyze them step by step: 1. Legal consequences: Depending on the severity of the theft and the laws in Iran, Sugar Ray Robinson could potentially receive penalties such as fines, imprisonment, or in extreme cases such as repeated stealing, even amputation of fingers which would severely limit his abilities to compete in boxing. 2. Reputation and public opinion: If Sugar Ray Robinson was found guilty of stealing, his reputation could be severely damaged. Fans and followers might question his morals, which might have a negative impact on his boxing career. Additionally, promoters and endorsers could potentially distance themselves from a person with a criminal record, thus limiting opportunities for him to participate in matches and exhibitions. 3. Boxing authorities: Professional boxing has governing bodies that oversee the sport and enforce regulations to maintain the integrity of the matches and the athletes' behavior. Sugar Ray Robinson's ability to box could be affected if these authorities were to impose suspensions or ban him from competition due to his criminal actions. 4. Personal mindset: A criminal accusation and possible conviction might generate psychological and emotional stress, which could make it difficult for Sugar Ray Robinson to focus on training, preparation, and competing at a high level. In conclusion, if Sugar Ray Robinson were to steal in Iran, his ability to box would be dependent on the legal consequences he would face, his public reputation, potential sanctions imposed by boxing authorities, and his personal mindset after such an incident. In worst case scenarios like imprisonment or amputation as punishment, his boxing career would likely be over. In other cases with less severe consequences, he might still be able to box, but only if he could overcome the challenges presented by damaged reputation, potential sanctions, and personal mindset."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: Another situation can occur when one party wishes to create an obligation under international law, but the other party does not.

One of the cars pulled from the lake, a blue Chevrolet Camaro, matched the description of a car in connection with the teens' disappearance, The Daily Elk Citian reported. The missing teens were Thomas Michael Rios, 18, Leah Gail Johnson, 18, and Jimmy Allen Williams, 16. - Dayva Spitzer, publisher of The Sayre Record newspaper The paper reported that the three were supposed to be heading to a football game in a nearby town, but were never seen again. Some thought the three had stumbled across a drug deal at a rural airstrip and been killed. Others said they might have run away to California. “The second vehicle is tentatively identified as the car with the missing juveniles from the Sayre area,” Custer County Sheriff Bruce Peoples told the paper. He told The Associated Press on Wednesday that investigators are still trying to determine whose remains were in the other car pulled from Foss Lake. In both cases, those missing were believed to have been in an early-model Chevrolet like the one recovered Tuesday. The state medical examiner's office said Wednesday it believes the remains of a total of six people were recovered. The Highway Patrol says three skulls have been recovered. It may, however, take years to identify the remains. “There have been theories from everybody,” said Dayva Spitzer, publisher of The Sayre Record newspaper and a longtime resident. “Everyone suspected foul play. ... But every lead just went nowhere.” Authorities discovered the cars by accident. Betsy Randolph, spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, told the Associated Press dive teams were at Foss Lake conducting training with sonar when they came upon the vehicles last week. \\"So they went back and did a scheduled dive today and were going to recover the cars. When they pulled the cars out of the water, the first one that came out they found bones in the car,\\" she said. The cars were submerged in about 12 feet of water and were only about 50 feet from the end of a boat ramp near a marina. But Peoples said it was no surprise that the murky waters held a secret. “This lake isn’t crystal clear. It’s a typical western Oklahoma lake with a lot of silt in it. The visibility is only 6 to 12 inches on a good day,” Peoples said. “We’ll consider it a mystery until we prove otherwise.\\" The sheriff said it was entirely possible that people simply drove into the lake and drowned. “We know that to happen, even if you know your way around. It can happen that quick,” he added. Peoples said he was confident the Camaro held the remains of the three teens, who were identified as Leah Johnson, Michael Rios and Jimmy Williams. The origins of the bones in the second vehicle were less clear. Tim Porter of Enid said he believed the remains could be those of his grandfather, John Albert Porter, who disappeared along with two other people in 1969. “Forty-something years of wondering who or why,” Porter said. “If it is my grandfather in there, it’s a gift.” The sheriff said Wednesday he was not sure whether the cars held the remains of five or six bodies. The state medical examiner’s office believed the remains of six people were recovered. The bones were being sent to the medical examiner’s office for identification and to determine the cause of death. Divers had found three skulls as of Tuesday evening. They planned to continue looking for more remains, said Oklahoma Highway Patrol spokeswoman Betsy Randolph. Authorities hoped the discoveries would offer some relief to relatives who may have gone decades wondering about the fate of a missing loved one. “We’re hoping these individuals, that this is going to bring some sort of closure to some families out there who have been waiting to hear about missing people,” Randolph said. “If that’s the case, then we’re thrilled.” The Associated Press contributed to this report Title:","output":"\\"Decades-Old Mystery Unraveling: Cars Pulled from Oklahoma Lake May Hold Remains of Missing Teens and Cold Case Victims\\""},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

IMPORTANCE Identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. However, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain. OBJECTIVE To explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of DNA extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS In a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) O104:H4 in Germany. Samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (August-September 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (November 2012-February 2013). In phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. In phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. In phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak strain. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The recovery of genome sequence data for the purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other pathogens from fecal samples. RESULTS During phase 1, a draft genome of the STEC outbreak strain was obtained. During phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. Sequences from the Shiga-toxin genes were detected in 27 of 40 STEC-positive samples (67%). In phase 3, sequences from Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter concisus, and Salmonella enterica were recovered. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. Challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.

Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of 2 each per day.During April 1981, R.E.M. recorded its first single, \\"Radio Free Europe\\", at producer Mitch Easter's Drive-In...

This case is not related to World affairs, Sports, or Science/Tech, as it specifically focuses on the business aspect and the potential legal investigation surrounding the company. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. is a global professional services firm that provides advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy, and people. The company operates through two segments: Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. The Risk and Insurance Services segment include Marsh, which provides insurance broking, risk management, and other risk-related services, and Guy Carpenter, which offers risk and reinsurance intermediary services. The Consulting segment includes Mercer, which provides health, wealth, and career consulting services, and Oliver Wyman Group, which delivers management and economic consulting services. The anonymous letter sent to Eliot Spitzer seemingly pointed to potential wrongdoings or unethical practices within Marsh & McLennan, prompting the attorney general to consider an investigation. Since the company plays a significant role in the US insurance market, any legal action or investigations against Marsh & McLennan could have consequences not only for the company itself but also for the broader insurance industry, its clients, and stakeholders. This is why the topic of the potential investigation falls under the category of Business. Investigations surrounding large companies such as Marsh & McLennan are essential to maintain transparency, fairness, and ethical practices in the world of business. Authorities, like the attorney general, have the responsibility of ensuring that corporations abide by the law and operate in the best interests of their clients, shareholders, and employees. By investigating any potential wrongdoings, these authorities help maintain a healthy business ecosystem that ultimately benefits everyone involved. In summary, the topic revolving around the anonymous letter sent to Eliot Spitzer, suggesting he investigates Marsh & McLennan, a prominent insurance broker in the US, falls under the category of Business due to the nature of the potential investigation into the company's practices within the insurance industry."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect. Which friend studied less about carbon dioxide? Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Vick studied more about the troposphere, whereas Frank focused on the Greenhouse Effect. The Greenhouse Effect directly involves greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. These gases play a crucial role in trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere and impacting global temperatures. Since Frank's study focuses more on the Greenhouse Effect, it can be inferred that Frank learned more about carbon dioxide. Therefore, out of the two friends, Vick, who studied more about the troposphere, likely studied less about carbon dioxide in comparison to Frank."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event? A man was talking to one woman and a man and then another man began talking, they continue their conversation for a while. someone","output":"Based on the information provided, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact logical next event without more context. However, I can certainly provide a few plausible scenarios that could occur after the given situation. 1. Introduction of a new topic: Since there are multiple people in the conversation, it is likely that at some point, someone may introduce a new topic of discussion. This could lead to an engaging exchange of ideas, opinions, and experiences among the individuals. As the conversation goes on, it may foster bonding among the participants and help build connections. 2. Parting ways: After conversating for a while, it is possible that one or more individuals will eventually need to leave, either due to other commitments or simply feeling that the conversation has run its course. When this happens, they may exchange contact information, express appreciation for the conversation, and say their goodbyes. 3. Conflict or disagreement: As people continue talking, differences in opinions and perspectives may arise, potentially leading to a debate or heated argument. In this case, it would be logical for a more neutral party to attempt to mediate the situation and help the conflicted parties find common ground or simply agree to disagree. 4. Activity or event: Depending on the environment where this conversation is taking place, an opportunity for a shared activity or event may present itself. For example, if they are at a party or social gathering, the group may decide to join a game, watch a performance, or partake in some other form of entertainment together. 5. Inclusion of other people: A new person or people may approach and join the conversation, introducing themselves and adding to the dynamic of the group's interaction. This could make the conversation even more interesting and engaging as new perspectives and experiences are shared. 6. Moments of silence: It is quite typical for conversations to have occasional pauses or moments of silence. This can be a natural part of conversation flow, allowing individuals to reflect on what has been said or gather their thoughts before responding. Sometimes, the silence may prompt someone to restart the conversation or to bring up a new topic. 7. Mutual decision to continue the conversation elsewhere: The group may find the current location to be too loud, crowded, or uncomfortable, leading them to decide to move to a different area or venue where the conversation can continue more comfortably. In conclusion, predicting the most logical next event in any social situation can be challenging as it mainly depends on the context, the participants' personalities, and circumstances. Nevertheless, the scenarios presented above represent potential directions the conversation could take given the limited information provided."},{"instruction":"two leading practitioners of american citizen engagement have published a recommendable textbook on the art of engagement.

What kind of thing would answer this question?","output":"\\"America's recessed-filter cigarette\\" refers to a type of cigarette developed and marketed in the United States, specifically designed with a recessed filter. The objective of this innovative design was to provide a more enjoyable and supposedly cleaner smoking experience for consumers by reducing the amount of tar and other harmful substances inhaled during smoking. To answer this question in a comprehensive manner, let's explore the history, the design, and the marketing strategies associated with this particular type of cigarette. History: The concept of recessed-filter cigarette was first introduced by Philip Morris International in 1952. Philip Morris is one of the world's leading tobacco companies, responsible for several popular cigarette brands such as Marlboro, Parliament, and L&M. They developed a new brand called \\"Parliament\\" that featured a unique recessed filter technology for the first time. Design: The recessed filter, also known as \\"Filter Tip Recessed,\\" is designed to surpass the conventional cigarette filters, which are typically made from cellulose acetate and are attached to the end of the cigarette. In the case of recessed-filter cigarettes, the filter is set back from the end of the cigarette, creating a small empty space or recess between the filter and the mouthpiece. This design has several supposed benefits: 1. Reduced tar and nicotine intake: The recessed filter is meant to minimize the amount of tar, nicotine, and other harmful substances that reach the smoker's lungs by forcing the smoke to travel a longer path through the filter before being inhaled. 2. Cooler and smoother smoke: By the time the smoke reaches the smoker's mouth, it has had more time to cool down, providing what was perceived as a smoother and more enjoyable smoking experience. 3. No filter fibers: With conventional filters, there was always a risk of inhaling filter fibers. The recessed filter design prevents direct contact between the smoker's mouth and the filter fibers, thereby eliminating this risk. Marketing Strategy: Philip Morris marketed the Parliament brand with a heavy emphasis on the innovative recessed filter feature. They promoted the cigarette as a more sophisticated, premium option for discerning smokers who were concerned about their health and wanted a cleaner smoking experience. The advertising campaigns often featured the slogan, \\"Only the flavor touches your lips,\\" highlighting the separation of the filter from the mouthpiece. The brand positioned itself as a luxury offering, priced higher than regular cigarettes, further supporting its premium image. In conclusion, \\"America's recessed-filter cigarette\\" refers to a distinctive type of cigarette that was designed and marketed by Philip Morris International under the Parliament brand. These cigarettes were promoted as a more refined, luxurious, and health-conscious option due to their innovative recessed filter design, which aimed to reduce tar and nicotine intake, provide cooler and smoother smoke, and prevent the inhalation of filter fibers."},{"instruction":"Q: Is the following a factual statement? \\"Iron Man stars Captain America.\\" Options: - yes - no Chain-of-thought:","output":"No, the statement \\"Iron Man stars Captain America\\" is not factual.

An estimated 1.3m people in the UK use e-cigarettes which were designed to help smokers quit. Ministers also plan to make it illegal for adults to buy traditional cigarettes for anyone under 18. By Richard WarryBBC News Electronic cigarettes mimic the effects of real cigarettes, producing a vapour that is potentially less harmful than cigarette smoke and free of some of its damaging substances, such as tar. The vapour does often, however, contain nicotine, the addictive substance that provides the \\"hit\\" in cigarette smoke. The jury is still out about just how safe e-cigarettes are, and nobody knows what their long-term impact is on health. There are plans to licence e-cigarettes as an aid to quitting smoking from 2016, but at present they are not available on the NHS, unlike other smoking cessation aids such as nicotine patches. Because they are not regulated, the contents of e-cigarettes can vary. Some have been found to contain toxic chemicals which are also found in tobacco, and have been linked to cancer. There is also only sketchy evidence that e-cigarettes help people to give up smoking. While smoking rates have fallen to their lowest ever level, experts fear the electronic substitutes could be encouraging teenagers to take up the habit. The battery-powered devices, which can be bought online and in some pubs, chemists and newsagents, deliver a hit of addictive nicotine and emit water vapour to mimic the feeling and look of smoking. The vapour is considered potentially less harmful than cigarette smoke and is free of some its damaging substances such as tar. \\"We do not yet know the harm that e-cigarettes can cause to adults, let alone to children, but we do know they are not risk free,\\" Prof Dame Sally Davies, England's chief medical officer, said. \\"E-cigarettes can produce toxic chemicals and the amount of nicotine and other chemical constituents and contaminants, including vaporised flavourings, varies between products - meaning they could be extremely damaging to young people's health.\\" Katherine Devlin, president of the Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade Association, welcomed the changes in the law, saying they had been asking for it \\"for years\\". \\"It's high time that it was mandated in law so that it can be robustly enforced,\\" she added, pointing out that product labelling made it clear e-cigarettes were not for under-18s. Anti-smoking charity Ash also welcomed the changes, but chief executive Deborah Arnott called for a retail licensing system that would mean cigarettes could be legally sold only in shops, not in car boot sales or markets. The UK currently has few restrictions on the use of e-cigarettes, despite moves in some countries to ban them. Restrictions have recently been mooted in Scotland and Wales, where health policy is a devolved issue. A Welsh government spokesman said on Sunday it \\"fully\\" supported a ban on e-cigarettes for under-18s and was considering how such legislation could be introduced in Wales. In Northern Ireland, the NI Chest Heart and Stroke charity is pressing the health minister to introduce a similar ban. The law change for England will be introduced in Parliament this week as an amendment to the Children and Families Bill. Labour said the policy on banning cigarettes for children was a \\"watered-down version of a policy that Labour called for last year\\" and that buying cigarettes for children should carry the same penalty as buying alcohol for underage drinkers. But it said restricting the sale of e-cigarettes to under-18s was a \\"sensible step\\". From 2016, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is expected to license e-cigarettes as a medicine in the UK. This will bring them in line with nicotine patches and gum, and allow the agency to apply rules around, for example, the purity of the nicotine in e-cigarettes. MEPs have rejected calls for a blanket ban on the sale of e-cigarettes across the EU. However, under a compromise deal, strict limits will be placed on the amount of nicotine they contain, and individual EU member states will be able to introduce a national ban if they see fit. If three or more member states chose that path, it could trigger an EU-wide ban. Smoking remains one of the biggest causes of death and illness in the UK, with around 100,000 people dying each year from illnesses linked to the habit. Experts want to crack down on the number of young people smoking by bringing the law in line with restrictions on the sale of alcohol. The new rules on adults buying cigarettes for under-18s could be in force by the autumn and may mean anyone caught buying cigarettes for a child could be given a Â£50 fixed penalty notice or a fine of up to Â£2,500. \\"We must do all we can to help children lead a healthy life,\\" public health minister Jane Ellison said. Some 41% of 15-year-olds who smoke say they usually buy their cigarettes from someone else, rather than from a shop, according to Department of Health figures.","output":"E-cigarettes are devices that help people quit smoking by giving them a similar feeling without the harmful substances found in real cigarettes. Some people are worried that e-cigarettes might be bad for our health, especially for young people. The UK government is trying to control the use of e-cigarettes and make it illegal for adults to buy regular cigarettes for anyone under 18 years old. While e-cigarettes might be less harmful than regular cigarettes, it is still not clear how safe they are in the long run."},{"instruction":"What is the last name of the person who attended concerts conducted by, among others, Arthur Nikisch? Answer the above question based on the context below: Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \\"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\\". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots saw \\"wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments\\".The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"Based on the article provided, five new things happening in Manchester at the time include: 1. New industrial processes: Manchester was experiencing rapid industrial growth, particularly in the textile industry. This led to the development of new manufacturing techniques, increased productivity, and an overall boom in the city's economy. 2. New ways of thinking: The Manchester School, a group of influential economists and politicians, advocated for free trade and laissez-faire economics. Their ideas represented a shift toward liberalization and globalization in the economic sphere. 3. New classes or groups in society: As a result of the Industrial Revolution, new classes emerged, such as the working class, which made up a significant portion of Manchester's population. This shift in social structure led to new forms of labor organization, including the formation of trade unions and the rise of the Labour Party. 4. New religious sects: Manchester's diverse and cosmopolitan environment attracted various religious groups, contributing to the city's rich cultural landscape. 5. New forms of labor organization: Trade unions and other forms of labor organization gained momentum in Manchester, culminating in the first Trades Union Congress held in the city in 1868. Additionally, Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement, which both campaigned for the rights of workers and women, respectively. As such, during the mentioned time period, Manchester was undergoing significant social, economic, and cultural changes, embodying a spirit of innovation that captured the imagination of people from all over Britain and Europe."},{"instruction":"Q: Given reviews from Amazon, classify those review based on their content into two classes: Negative or Positive.

Questions: What would easily hide a snake? Options: - living room of a house - kew gardens - terrarium - thick forest - tropical forest Answer:","output":"The most suitable option in line with common sense for hiding a snake would be a terrarium. Although all of these options can potentially hide a snake, selecting the most appropriate one from the list depends on several factors, including the type of snake, the level of camouflage, and where it is normally found. Let us discuss each option in detail: - Living room of a house: While it is possible for a snake to hide in a living room, it is not a natural habitat for snakes. They are likely to be easily spotted and removed from the house, as people typically do not expect to encounter snakes in an indoor environment. - Kew Gardens: Kew Gardens is an extensive botanical garden in London that showcases a vast collection of plants from around the world. Although one might find snakes in such settings, it is not a place specifically designed to hide snakes, and they might not be as well-concealed here compared to other options in the list. - Terrarium: A terrarium would be the most appropriate option for hiding a snake. A terrarium is a small, enclosed environment designed specifically to replicate the natural habitat of small animals like snakes. In a terrarium, snakes can effectively camouflage themselves, thrive, and remain relatively hidden from human eyes. It can also serve as a controlled environment for keeping them as pets or studying their behaviors. - Thick forest: A thick forest can also provide effective concealment for snakes. However, it is a vast and complex environment that may not necessarily guarantee complete concealment, given the number of other animals and potential human interaction in such settings. - Tropical forest: Similar to a thick forest, a tropical forest can serve as a natural habitat for snakes, especially those native to tropical regions like pythons, boas, and various venomous species. However, this option may not be suitable for terrestrial or temperate snake species, and factors like habitat destruction and human presence might diminish their ability to remain hidden. In conclusion, among the options provided, a terrarium is the best choice in line with common sense to easily hide a snake. It is a controlled environment specifically designed for housing and concealing small animals like snakes, allowing them to blend in, stay hidden, and thrive."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given a text from tweets.

You are probably familiar with this concept as it relates to carbonated beverages. Before opening the container, the inside is pressurized, so a large amount of CO 2 is dissolved in the liquid. After opening, the pressure decreases (to the ambient pressure), so the solubility of CO 2 drops, causing it to bubble out of solution. Because they are not compressible like gases, solid and liquid solutes do not have noticeable changes in solubility at different external pressures. Paragraph: Robin is an exterminator who is making new mixtures of chemicals to use for when he gets called to kill rats in his neighborhood.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If the plates on the Earth's crust were to move more quickly past each other, their effect on LESS or WEAKER earthquakes could be potentially more pronounced. The continuous movement of tectonic plates is the primary driving force behind earthquakes. The speed at which these plates move can indeed have an impact on the frequency, strength, and distribution of earthquakes. Let us examine the potential consequences of the plates moving more quickly in terms of less-frequent or weaker earthquakes: 1. Increased stress along fault lines: As plates move past each other more quickly, the force they exert on one another could lead to increased stress along the fault lines. This increased stress can cause more frequent and stronger earthquakes, thereby reducing the number of less-frequent or weaker earthquakes. 2. Faster release of energy: With increased plate movement, the stored energy in the Earth's crust may be released more rapidly. This energy, which travels through the Earth as seismic waves, could lead to an increase in the frequency of earthquakes, resulting in fewer instances of less-frequent or weaker seismic activity. 3. Redistribution of stress: When plates move more quickly, the stress on fault lines could be redistributed, thereby influencing the likelihood of future earthquakes. While this redistribution could potentially reduce the frequency of less-frequent or weaker earthquakes in specific regions, it may also make other areas more susceptible to experiencing significant seismic activity. 4. Influence on volcanic activity: Increased movement of tectonic plates may also influence volcanic activity, as magma from the Earth's mantle may find it easier to rise to the surface through weakened or fractured crust. This increase in volcanic activity could, in turn, contribute to more earthquakes, which may affect the frequency of less-frequent or weaker earthquakes. Considering these factors, it is plausible to conclude that if tectonic plates were to move more quickly past each other, the number of less-frequent or weaker earthquakes might be reduced as the overall level of seismic activity increases. However, it is important to note that this analysis is highly simplified and does not account for the multitude of additional factors that influence earthquake frequency and intensity, such as the type of plate boundary, the complex interplay between geological structures, and varying local geological conditions. In reality, predicting the precise effects of increased plate movement on the occurrence of less-frequent or weaker earthquakes is a complex task that requires sophisticated modeling and an in-depth understanding of Earth's geophysical processes."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: Those who wish Mr Bloom to stay please raise your hands.","output":"Step 1: Identify the words and phrases in the English sentence that need to be translated. \\"Those who,\\" \\"wish,\\" \\"Mr Bloom,\\" \\"to stay,\\" \\"please,\\" \\"raise your hands.\\" Step 2: Translate each word and phrase to Romanian. \\"Those who\\" - \\"Cei care\\" \\"wish\\" - \\"doresc\\" \\"Mr Bloom\\" - \\"Dl Bloom\\" (Dl is the abbreviation for \\"Domnul,\\" the Romanian equivalent of \\"Mister\\") \\"to stay\\" - \\"să rămână\\" \\"please\\" - \\"vă rog\\" \\"raise your hands\\" - \\"ridicați mâinile\\" Step 3: Arrange the translated words and phrases in a grammatically correct Romanian sentence. \\"Cei care doresc să rămână Dl Bloom, vă rog ridicați mâinile.\\" Translated sentence in Romanian: \\"Cei care doresc să rămână Dl Bloom, vă rog ridicați mâinile.\\""},{"instruction":"Trebuie să evaluăm în ce măsură ar putea criteriile de la Basel să antreneze o criză gravă a creditelor pentru întreprinderile mici și mijlocii. Which language is this?","output":"The language you're asking about is Romanian. The sentence translates to \\"We need to assess the extent to which the Basel criteria could trigger a severe credit crisis for small and medium-sized enterprises.\\" As for the question regarding Basel criteria possibly triggering a severe credit crisis for small and medium businesses (SMEs), it's important to delineate that the Basel Accords were designed as an attempt to standardize banking regulations across the globe, particularly with regards to capital risk, market risk and operational risk. Their goal is to ensure the financial health of individual banks, as well as the overall banking system. The impact of these requirements on SMEs could theoretically be significant. However, the actual impact of the Basel Accords on SMEs is debated among experts and tends to look at several dimensions: 1. The Availability of Credit: One of the key concerns regarding the Basel criteria is that it may reduce the availability of credit to SMEs. Stringent capital requirements might make banks more risk-averse and, hence, more reluctant to lend to SMEs, which are traditionally seen as riskier than larger corporations. 2. The Cost of Credit: The Basel regulations may drive up the cost of credit for SMEs. Banks might choose to pass on the higher costs of maintaining larger capital buffers to their customers in the form of increased interest rates and fees. This could make credit more expensive for SMEs. 3. Financial Stability: On the other hand, the Basel criteria aim to increase the stability of the financial system, which could indirectly benefit SMEs. In a more stable financial system, credit is more likely to be available, and the cost of credit would be less likely to spike during periods of economic stress. In general, while the Basel criteria may pose some challenges to SMEs, they are an important component of a stable, transparent, and resilient financial system. Policymakers must strive to strike a balance between the stability of the banking system, the availability, and cost of credit for SMEs, and the broader goal of economic growth. There are some mechanisms planned to soften the impact on SMEs such as the support from public investment banks, guarantees from mutual guarantee societies and also the promotion of alternative sources of funding."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"The black dog runs through the water.\\" that \\"The red dog is sleeping.\\"?

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Context: Air temperature changes as altitude increases. In some layers of the atmosphere, the temperature decreases. In other layers, it increases. You can see this in Figure 15.12. Refer to this figure as you read about the layers below. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. In it, temperature decreases with altitude. The troposphere gets some of its heat directly from the Sun. Most, however, comes from Earths surface. The surface is heated by the Sun and some of that heat radiates back into the air. This makes the temperature higher near the surface than at higher altitudes. Look at the troposphere in Figure 15.12. This is the shortest layer of the atmosphere. It rises to only about 12 kilometers (7 miles) above the surface. Even so, this layer holds 75 percent of all the gas molecules in the atmosphere. Thats because the air is densest in this layer. Air in the troposphere is warmer closer to Earths surface. Warm air is less dense than cool air, so it rises higher in the troposphere. This starts a convection cell. Convection mixes the air in the troposphere. Rising air is also a main cause of weather. All of Earths weather takes place in the troposphere. Sometimes air doesnt mix in the troposphere. This happens when air is cooler close to the ground than it is above. The cool air is dense, so it stays near the ground. This is called a temperature inversion. An inversion can trap air pollution near the surface. Temperature inversions are more common in the winter. Can you explain why? At the top of the troposphere is a thin layer of air called the tropopause. You can see it in Figure 15.12. This layer acts as a barrier. It prevents cool air in the troposphere from mixing with warm air in the stratosphere. The stratosphere is the layer above the troposphere. The layer rises to about 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the surface. Air temperature in the stratosphere layer increases with altitude. Why? The stratosphere gets most of its heat from the Sun. Therefore, its warmer closer to the Sun. The air at the bottom of the stratosphere is cold. The cold air is dense, so it doesnt rise. As a result, there is little mixing of air in this layer. The stratosphere contains a layer of ozone gas. Ozone consists of three oxygen atoms (O3 ). The ozone layer absorbs high-energy UV radiation. As you can see in Figure 15.14, UV radiation splits the ozone molecule. The split creates an oxygen molecule (O2 ) and an oxygen atom (O). This split releases heat that warms the stratosphere. By absorbing UV radiation, ozone also protects Earths surface. UV radiation would harm living things without the ozone layer. At the top of the stratosphere is a thin layer called the stratopause. It acts as a boundary between the stratosphere and the mesosphere. The mesosphere is the layer above the stratosphere. It rises to about 85 kilometers (53 miles) above the surface. Temperature decreases with altitude in this layer. There are very few gas molecules in the mesosphere. This means that there is little matter to absorb the Suns rays and heat the air. Most of the heat that enters the mesosphere comes from the stratosphere below. Thats why the mesosphere is warmest at the bottom. Did you ever see a meteor shower, like the one in Figure 15.15? Meteors burn as they fall through the mesosphere. The space rocks experience friction with the gas molecules. The friction makes the meteors get very hot. Many meteors burn up completely in the mesosphere. At the top of the mesosphere is the mesopause. Temperatures here are colder than anywhere else in the atmosphere. They are as low as -100 C (-212 F)! Nowhere on Earths surface is that cold. The thermosphere is the layer above the mesosphere. It rises to 600 kilometers (372 miles) above the surface. The International Space Station orbits Earth in this layer as in Figure 15.16. Temperature increases with altitude in the thermosphere.

The film opens to a child reading a comic book about the Daily Planet, the largest newspaper in the city of Metropolis. As the child reads the shot fades to the Daily Planet and up into the sky. The following title sequence moves through space and eventually reveals the planet Krypton, the home world of a highly-evolved race resembling humans and bearing a unique molecular density and structure, a result of the planet's gravitational strength and the radiation of its adjacent red sun. The planet is ruled by a Council of Elders, each representing a particular \\"clan\\" and bearing a crest of that particular House. The planet's greatest scientist, Jor, bears an S-shaped crest, the House of El. Jor-El is supervising the trial of three criminals caught attempting to overthrow the planet's government - General Zod, the planet's former defense chief; his henchman Non, a hulking killer unable to speak; and Ursa, a woman determined to exterminate men other than the man she loves, Zod. As the elders render a guilty verdict, Zod notes that the verdict must be unanimous, so Jor-El ultimately holds the key to their fate. Despite his disillusionment with the Council of Elders, Jor-El renders a conviction. The vast dome of the planet's capital city opens to the night, and a small extra-dimensional prison - the Phantom Zone - tumbles out of the sky and pulls the three criminals out of the trial room and into an eternity in dimensional limbo through space. While a frightened Ursa begs for forgiveness, Zod defiantly swears that he will have his vengeance on the House of El, even if it takes him a thousand years.However, Jor-El's more pressing concern lies in the orbital shift of Krypton; this shift is putting the planet into the fatal gravitational pull of its central star, a fact blithely ignored by the Council Of Elders.

Keep things like the end-of-chapter questions in mind as you complete your reading. On this read-through, don't take notes or do anything else; just read. You have two objectives in doing so. The first is to get a sense of the purpose of the chapter. Ask yourself: what is the author trying to convey in the chapter overall? Second, how does the author build the information or argument in the chapter? When you have a mental picture of these two questions, you can then begin taking notes that will benefit you in your study for exams and research papers. Don’t rush this step! It can be tempting to just get done with your reading as soon as possible, but you are unlikely to retain information if you hurry through. Notes do not mean taking every word down verbatim. The art of note-taking involves discerning what is important and engaging with the material rather than just copying text out. The first thing to write down is the main point or argument that the author is conveying in the chapter. Do this in no more than three sentences. Then ask yourself how the author begins to make this point. This is where the major headings and subheadings help. Under each heading are paragraphs that make up the section of the chapter. Document the topic sentences that help build the argument in the section and chapter. Don’t be afraid to write in your book. Annotating a textbook by writing notes, comments, and questions in the margins near relevant material can be invaluable when studying. Hand write your textbook notes. Handwriting your notes forces your brain to actually engage with the material as opposed to glossing over the material or mindlessly typing the same text into the computer. Go back through the chapter and list major theoretical concepts and properties key to understanding any technical elements of the chapter. Also list key terminology with corresponding definitions. Often, this information will be printed in bold, italics, or set apart in a box or with some other eye-catching method. Begin by summarizing the chapter and its main points in your own words. This will tell you where your knowledge gaps are. Ask yourself questions about what you’ve read and the notes you took: What question does this information answer? and How does this information relate to other things? are good places to start. Summary:","output":"The process of effectively reading and understanding a textbook chapter involves several steps. First, generate a preview of the chapter to grasp its structure and main points, keeping end-of-chapter questions in mind while reading. Focus on discerning the chapter's purpose and how the author builds their argument. Then, take notes by identifying the main point, using headings and subheadings to structure your understanding, and noting key topic sentences. Engage with the material by annotating your textbook with notes, comments, and questions. Handwrite your notes to strengthen engagement with the material and improve retention. List important concepts, properties, and terminology along with their definitions.

Options: - happiness for - new laws - protest - change in leadership - cultural revolution The answer is \\"cultural revolution\\" because Answer:","output":"A coup-de-etat is generally a sudden and often violent seizure of political power by a small group, usually the military, with the aim of overthrowing the existing government. The primary goal is to bring about a change in the leadership and the political system, often driven by a desire for better governance, social change, or the correction of perceived injustices. In the context of the question, the answer is \\"change in leadership\\" as this aligns most closely with the definition and outcomes associated with a coup-de-etat. Changing the leadership is the primary goal in a coup, and through this change, the initiators hope to bring about new laws, policies, and social changes that could lead to increased happiness, more stable governance, and even cultural revolutions. Protests can sometimes be a precursor or a reaction to a coup, but they are not the primary goal or essence of a coup-de-etat. In summary, while cultural revolutions or new laws may be desired outcomes or consequences of a successful coup, the actual act and intention of the coup is centered around a change in leadership."},{"instruction":"Coming off their road win against the Giants, the Chargers went home for an interconference Duel with the Philadelphia Eagles.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

Choices: - act quickly - learn to walk - stretches - buy shoes - go quickly The rationale to choose \\"learn to walk\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The correct answer is \\"learn to walk.\\" The rationale behind choosing \\"learn to walk\\" as the answer is based on the natural progression of human motor skills and physical development. Before an individual can run, they must first learn to walk. This is due to several reasons: 1. Walking helps in muscle development and coordination: Before running, an individual needs to have developed sufficient muscle strength and coordination to support their body weight and maintain balance. Walking is a crucial step in building these essential physical skills, as it requires the use of core muscles, leg muscles and coordination between the two legs. 2. Building stability and balance: Walking helps in developing stability and balance in the body. As an individual walks, their body learns to shift weight from one leg to the other while maintaining an upright position. This skill is critical for running as it also involves weight-shifting and maintaining balance at a faster pace. 3. Developing a rhythmic gait pattern: Walking introduces the concept of a rhythmic gait pattern that synchronizes the movements of the legs and arms. As the individual masters walking, their body becomes more familiar with this pattern, making it easier to transition to running. 4. Gradual progression: Running requires greater physical exertion than walking, which means that it's necessary to have a solid foundation of walking skills before attempting to run. Starting with walking allows the body to adapt to the demands of physical activity and gradually progress to more intense exercises like running. While the other choices - act quickly, stretches, buy shoes, and go quickly - may have some relevance to running, they do not form the fundamental basis for being able to run safely and effectively. Learning to walk is the most crucial prerequisite, as it lays the foundation for all other related skills and activities."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: - A hurricane usually starts as an organized thunderstorm activity that stretches at least 100 miles across and maintains its identity for more than 24 hours - Under the right conditions it can develop further and start to spin around a low-pressure center - If it develops it&#x27;s classified as a &#x27;tropical cyclone&#x27; or &#x27;tropical depression&#x27; - If the system strengthens and wind speeds rise past 39 mph, the system is dubbed a &#x27;tropical storm&#x27; What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The last step of the process of a tropical storm developing into a hurricane is the increase of the storm's wind speeds and its overall organization. When the storm system's sustained wind speeds reach 74 miles per hour (119 kilometers per hour) or greater, the tropical storm is then upgraded and classified as a hurricane. This intensification occurs due to several factors primarily, the structure of the storm itself, the energy provided by warm ocean waters, and favorable atmospheric conditions. When a storm upgrades to a hurricane, its structure becomes more organized and well-defined. It typically adopts a circular shape with a distinct low-pressure center known as the \\"eye\\" of the hurricane. Surrounding the eye is the eyewall, a region of intense thunderstorms and destructive wind speeds. The eyewall is the most dangerous part of a hurricane, often causing the most damage. Spiraling outwards from the eye, bands of rain and thunderstorms, called rainbands, make up the rest of the hurricane's structure. The intensification process from a tropical storm to a hurricane is primarily driven by the energy gained from the warm ocean waters. As the storm system moves over areas with warm sea surface temperatures, the evaporation of the warm ocean water causes energy (latent heat) to be released into the atmosphere, which fuels the storm, increases its wind speeds and thunderstorm activity. This process is known as the heat engine mechanism. Apart from the energy provided by warm ocean waters, atmospheric conditions play a crucial role in the development and intensification of a hurricane. Factors such as low vertical wind shear (change in wind direction and speed with height) and high humidity levels in the upper troposphere contribute to the growth and strengthening of a tropical storm into a hurricane. Low vertical wind shear allows the storm to remain vertically aligned and maintain its structure, while high humidity levels provide necessary moisture and energy from the atmosphere to sustain the storm's intensity. In summary, the last step of the process in the development of a hurricane is the increase and maintenance of sustained wind speeds of 74 miles per hour or greater, as well as an organized storm structure. The transition from tropical storm to hurricane depends on various factors, including warm ocean waters, favorable atmospheric conditions, and the overall organization of the storm system. Once these criteria are met, the tropical storm is classified as a hurricane and continues to move and evolve, potentially causing significant damage to coastal and inland regions in its path."},{"instruction":"Для посетителей вход на Ярмарку автопарков 2009 бесплатный, достаточно заполнить формуляр он-лайн на странице организатора.

This is because the presence of chicken snakes does not directly alter the process itself, but rather influences the survival rates of birds during the egg and hatchling stages, causing a decrease in the overall bird population."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

How much money will that require per person? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Calculate the number of bars needed in total Each friend wants to eat 2 bars, and there are 6 friends. So, we multiply the number of friends by the number of bars each wants: 6 friends * 2 bars/friend = 12 bars needed Step 2: Determine how many boxes of ice cream bars are needed Each box contains 3 bars, and we need 12 bars. So, we divide the number of bars needed by the number of bars per box: 12 bars / 3 bars/box = 4 boxes needed Step 3: Calculate the total cost Each box costs 7.50, and we need 4 boxes. So, we multiply the cost per box by the number of boxes: 4 boxes * 7.50/box = 30 total cost Step 4: Calculate the cost per person The total cost is 30, and there are 6 friends.

With him dressed in baby attire, he easily evades the arriving police. Unfortunately for Finster, he loses his money down Bugs' rabbit hole (the pram rolls down a hill and hits a rock) and he gets himself unofficially adopted in order to gain it back. Multiple attempts to grab it (in one instance Finster whacks Bugs with the bag of money) are interpreted as a baby's typical grabbiness. Finster even points a revolver (\\"toy pistol\\", Bugs calls it) at Bugs and shoots him but this still does not fully register with Bugs. Just as Bugs is putting the 'baby' to bed, Finster hits Bugs with a baseball bat and the words Bok, Pow, Bang and Boing appear; he assumes the baby is having a nightmare. A supposedly remorseful Finster grabs Bugs and hugs him saying: \\"dada!\\" \\"Have you seen this man? He is Ant Hill Harry, alias Baby-Face Finster.

In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early as 49ers RB Maurice Hicks got a 9-yard TD run. The Falcons responded with RB Warrick Dunn getting a 9-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Atlanta increased its lead with RB Ovie Mughelli getting a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, San Francisco crept close as kicker Joe Nedney got a 49-yard and a 32-yard field goal. Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Falcons answered with kicker Morten Andersen getting a 33-yard field goal. The 49ers responded with Nedney kicking a 22-yard field goal, yet Atlanta got the win with Andersen nailing a 27-yard field goal.

Answer:","output":"A hammer. To answer the question \\"What can be used to make debris?\\", it is essential to understand the concept of debris first. Debris refers to the fragmented remains of something that has been broken, destroyed, or worn away. In the context of rocks, debris can be formed through natural processes such as erosion or human activities that involve the breakup and movement of solid materials. Among the answer choices provided, a hammer serves as the best option for making debris, especially when used to break apart rocks or hard ledges of rock. Erosion, rivers, heat, wind, and water pump are all natural or mechanical processes which can, over time, lead to the formation of debris. However, they may not provide the immediate, targeted, and controlled result that a hammer can offer when it comes to breaking rocks and generating debris. While these processes may all contribute to the ultimate formation of debris, they may not do so in a focused, efficient manner. A c-clamp and a screwdriver, on the other hand, are tools specifically designed for purposes other than breaking rocks. A c-clamp is meant for applying pressure and holding objects securely in place, while a screwdriver is used mainly for driving screws. Although these tools can potentially be used to break substances and generate debris in certain circumstances, they are not specifically designed for this purpose and would therefore be less efficient and less effective than a hammer. In conclusion, among the given answer choices, a hammer is the best option for making debris, particularly when the task involves breaking rocks or other hard materials. The combination of its weight, design, and intended purpose makes it the most suitable tool for this task. It allows users to exert a significant amount of force on the material they wish to break, which increases the chances of generating debris efficiently and effectively."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a question-answer pair.

Movie title: Anguish Movie plot: The film begins with a written disclaimer: During the film you are about to see, you will be subject to subliminal messages and mild hypnosis. This will cause you no physical harm or lasting effect, but if for any reason you lose control or feel that your mind is leaving your body -- leave the auditorium immediately. The disclaimer is accompanied by a narrator, who advises viewers to take caution regarding their surroundings once the film has begun, and not to engage in conversation with any unknown individuals for the duration of the running time. In the Los Angeles theater The Rex, moviegoers watch the film within a film, The Mommy. The Mommy tells the story of John Pressman (Michael Lerner), an extremely myopic, uncontrolled diabetic who works as an ophthalmologist's assistant and is progressively growing blind. For unstated reasons, his overbearing mother Alice (Zelda Rubinstein) hypnotizes him and induces him to murder people so that he can remove their eyes and bring them back to her. One evening, Johnâagainst his mother's wishesâbarricades himself inside of a movie theater playing The Lost World, where he sets about killing the patrons one by one with a scalpel. Once John's rampage becomes apparent, the surviving moviegoers attempt to flee the now sealed-off theater. The police bring Alice to the theater in an attempt to end the siege; in the course of trying to talk John down, Alice is accidentally shot to death by the police. As The Mommy wears on, patrons of The Rex begin to experience anxiety attacks and disorientation in response to the events onscreen. In particular, one man grows progressively agitated, constantly checking his watch; and a teenage girl, Patty, begins to break down in tears, though she cannot entirely articulate her fear. At a key point in the film, the man exits the theater and approaches the concession stand, where he's recognized by an employee as a frequent patron of The Mommy.

Here is a hypothesis: The animal was standing near him. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the information provided in the premise, it is possible to develop a well-reasoned, detailed response as to whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. Premise: \\"He looked past the brill's enormous rump to the dark-skinned beauty at the door.\\" The premise provides us with the following information: 1. The subject, presumably a person, is looking in the direction of a dark-skinned beauty standing at the door. 2. A \\"brill\\" with an enormous rump is present in the scene and is partially obstructing the subject's view of the dark-skinned beauty. 3. The subject is looking past the brill in order to see the dark-skinned beauty. Hypothesis: \\"The animal was standing near him.\\" To assess whether the premise supports the hypothesis, we must consider the information available in the premise and determine if it confirms that the brill—an animal with an enormous rump—was indeed standing near the subject. From the premise, we can infer that the brill is significantly large, as it has an \\"enormous rump.\\" This implicates that the animal likely has a sizable presence in the space. Furthermore, since the subject has to look past the brill to see the dark-skinned beauty, it is reasonable to deduce that the brill is physically located between the subject and the door where the dark-skinned beauty stands. However, the premise does not provide explicit information about the distance between the subject and the brill or whether the animal is close (or near) to the subject. The fact that the subject has to look past the brill merely indicates that the animal is in the line of sight, but it does not indicate the animal's proximity to the subject. Given these considerations, we cannot definitively conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well. While the premise does provide information that places the brill between the subject and the dark-skinned beauty, it does not provide enough detail to verify the hypothesis stating the animal was standing near the subject. The hypothesis remains plausible, but we would require more information about the spatial relationship between the subject and the brill to confirm its accuracy."},{"instruction":"(CNN) -- Scotland's Paul Lawrie carded a final round seven-under-par 65 on Sunday to win the Qatar Masters by four strokes, his second victory in the tournament.

Start writing your autobiography by conducting research on your own life. Creating a timeline of your life is a good way to make sure you include all the most important dates and events, and it gives you a structure to build upon. You can consider this the \\"brainstorming\\" phase, so don't hesitate to write down everything you can remember, even if you don't think the memory will make it into the final version of the book. Your autobiography doesn't have to begin with your birth. You may want to include some family history as well. Write down information about your ancestry, your grandparents' lives, your parents' lives, and so on. Having information about your family history will help readers get a sense of how you became the person you are. What happened when you were a teenager? What led you to make the decisions you made? Did you go to college? Write about those transitory years, too. Write about your career, your relationships, your children, and any big life-altering events that occurred. Every good story has interesting characters, friends and foes who help move the plot along. Who are the characters in your life? It's a given that your parents will play a role, along with your spouse and other close family members. Think beyond your immediate family to others who have affected your life and should play a role in your autobiography. Teachers, coaches, mentors, and bosses are extremely influential in people's lives. Decide whether someone who has been a role model (or the opposite) for you will figure into your story. Ex-boyfriends and girlfriends might co-star in some interesting stories. What enemies have you had in life? Your story will be boring if you don't include some conflicts. Offbeat characters such as animals, celebrities you've never met, and even cities are often points of interest in an autobiography. The story of your entire life would start to get pretty long-winded, so you'll have to make some decisions about what anecdotes you're going to include. Begin drafting your manuscript by writing out the main stories that will be woven together to create a picture of your life. There are a few main topics that most autobiographies cover since readers find them fascinating. The childhood story. Whether your childhood was happy or traumatic, you should include a few anecdotes that give a picture of who you were and what you experienced at the time. You can tell the story of your childhood by breaking it down into smaller anecdotes that illustrate your personality - your parents' reaction when you brought home a stray dog, the time you climbed out of the window at school and ran away for 3 days, your friendly relationship with a homeless person living in the woods . . . get creative. The coming of age story. This heady and often sensual period in a human's life is always of interest to readers. Remember that it's not about writing something unique; everyone comes of age. It's about writing something that resonates with readers. The falling in love story. You could also write the opposite of this, the never-finding-love story. The identity crisis story. This usually occurs in the 30s or 40s and is sometimes referred to as a mid-life crisis. The story of facing down some force of evil. Whether it's your battle with addiction, a controlling lover, or a madman who tried to kill your family, you've got to write about conflict you've experienced. People read autobiographies to gain insight on what it's like to be someone else. Being authentically you is a sure way to keep people engaged. If your writing is formal and stiff, or if it reads like a college essay instead of an expose on your life, people will have trouble getting through the book. Write as though you're opening your heart to a trusted friend, in prose that's clear, strong and not too cluttered with vocabulary words you rarely use. Write so that your personality is revealed. Are you funny? Intense? Spiritual? Dramatic? Don't hold back; your personality should come through in the way you tell your story. You don't have to be explicit, but it's important to reveal truths about yourself and your life in an autobiography. Don't let the book become a list of your accomplishments, with all the negative material carefully kept under the rug. Present yourself as a whole person, sharing talents and flaws alike, and your readers will be able to identify with you and hopefully root for you as they make their way through your story. Don't always cast yourself in a positive light. You can have foibles and still be the protagonist. Reveal mistakes you've made and times when you've failed yourself and other people. Reveal your inner thoughts. Share your opinions and ideas, including those that may spark controversy. Be true to yourself through your autobiography. How was your story shaped by the moment in history in which it took place? What wars influenced your politics? What cultural events inspired you? Be sure to include a few important dates so readers can understand the sequencing of the events you are describing. Discussing what happened in the world at large during your lifetime is a good way to make your story more relevant and interesting to those reading it.","output":"This article suggests that when writing an autobiography, it's important to research your life, create a timeline, include family history, share interesting stories, and be authentic and truthful about your experiences and personality, while also considering the historical context of your life."},{"instruction":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: A bowl of broccoli covered in cheese and cheetos.","output":"Step 1: Identify the main subjects and objects in the sentence.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (UAVs), or “drones” as the press is wont to call them, can be used for surveillance, relaying communications and some can be weaponized and called in for strikes. If Iran has indeed managed to capture an intact Sentinel, would they be able to resist flaunting it on domestic television? Unlikely as this could be a fantastic propaganda coup on their end. While it is possible Iran may have its hands on the UAV, it is worth noting that twice in the very recent past Iran has declared it has captured a U.S. owned UAV only to fail to provide any evidence to support its claims. In January of this year, Iran's Revolutionary Guards claimed to have shot down two UAV. During this hoo hah, Iran also claimed that these UAVs violated its sovereign space. But then Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Air Force, did not succeed in presenting any evidence that this had actually occurred. And just this past July, Iran said it had shot down a UAV near the Fordu nuclear site -- again, another claim that went unsubstantiated. There is an awful lot of speculation and many assumptions flying regarding the most recent alleged “drone” incident of December 2011, but very little concrete information has emerged as yet. If Iran has a Sentinel, the key to any seriousness hinges upon the manner in which they would have obtained it. ISAF, led by NATO, released the statement that a UAV was lost in western Afghanistan because “the operators of the UAV lost control of the aircraft and had been working to determine its status.” This is quite a different version of events than claims by the Iranian media that a Sentinel had been captured with minimal damage. If high tech military equipment is damaged in the field, it tends to be taken with the U.S. force on the ground or blown up in situ to prevent reverse engineering -- as advanced American technology is without question highly coveted. If a Sentinel was shot down or crashed, given its capability in terms altitude and speed and taken together with its weight, the drama-rama that has taken hold regarding reverse engineering is most likely an unjustified tempest in a teacup. In the event of being shot or crashing, there would most likely be significant damage to the asset. On the other hand, if the Sentinel does exist and is indeed intact, then there may be cause for concern as it could suggest that Iran seized control of the UAV’s operating system to land it ripe to harvest for their own unmanned aspirations. In October of this year, it was reported that a virus had made its way into U.S. Predator and Reaper systems. This virus allegedly “keylogged” the commands of pilots as the platforms flew missions over Afghanistan and instigated some rumblings of concern to this end. There's no doubt that Iran certainly has a desire to build its own “drones.” In August 2010, there was a whole lot of Iranian-style pomp and circumstance surrounding ‘the Reveal’ of ‘Karrar’ – purportedly the country’s first domestically built UAV, with a range of 620 miles and a payload consisting of a 500 pound precision bomb. Convincing evidence never emerged of these claims either, but at the time it aroused some concern as the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet was based nearby in Bahrain. This week’s drone drama is tellingly set against a backdrop of escalating tension between Iran and U.S. allies. On November 12, Iran’s ballistic missile program was walloped with an explosion at Bidganeh, the primary missile testing facility located just outside of Tehran. Iran’s head of missile research, General Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, died alongside at least seventeen others in this explosion, prompting allegations that the West was responsible for the incident. Iran’s Isfahan uranium conversion facility then suffered a serious blow from another unexplained explosion, leading to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly proclaiming all necessary measures would be undertaken to protect Iran, and Gen Jaafari directing the Revolutionary Guard to hide the Shahab missles throughout the country. Just this past week, on November 19, the British Embassy was attacked in Tehran. Officials suggested the attackers had the support of the regime. Twenty-five British diplomats have been expelled and France announced it would withdraw diplomatic staff from Iran as well. This attack came on the heels of new sanctions introduced by the U.S., Canada and EU that ban financial transactions with Iran. These more aggressive measures are in response to the IAEA report (the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog) indicating that there was evidence tests had been conducted relevant to developing a nuclear device. Iran claims its nuclear ambitions are purely those of a nation with peaceful aspirations -- just as it claims it has a U.S. UAV without brandishing any evidence. Iran's credibility is low, but when wasn’t it? Drone or no drone, what this drone-drama signifies is the latest in Iran’s brandishing that it is ready to rumble.

Iran has said this before but didn't have proof to show they really captured a drone. If they do have a drone this time, it could be a problem because Iran can learn from the drone and use that knowledge to build their own.

Article: An unpunctual man never does what he has to do at the right time. He is always in a hurry and in the end loses both time and his good name. A lost thing may be found again, but lost time can never be got back. Time is more useful than material things. In fact, time is life itself. An unpunctual man is always wasting his most important things as well as others'. An unpunctual person is always saying unhappily that he finds no time to answer letters or return calls. But the man who really has much to do is very careful of his time. He knows that he can not finish all his work unless he carefully does every piece of work. Being unpunctual is the sign of disrespect ( _ ) towards others. If a person is invited to dinner and arrives later than the time when he should be there, he keeps all the other guests waiting for him. Usually this will be thought as a great disrespect to the host and all the other guests. Not like a punctual person, an unpunctual one can't do his duty wonderfully, whether it is public or personal. Imagine how it would be if those who should do important tasks failed to be on time. A man who is known to be often unpunctual is never believed by his friends or fellow men.

A punctual person often has a busy life.; 4). A punctual person often does his work wonderfully.;","output":"4). A punctual person often does his work wonderfully. According to the passage, a punctual person is careful with their time management and ensures all tasks are completed while staying in the good graces of others.

On Sunday, Cain campaign spokesman J.D. Gordon emailed passages from the Society of Professional Journalist Code of Ethics that highlighted limiting the use of anonymous sources and evaluating their truthfulness and motives before allowing their use. The code also offered a few reminders like removing arrogance from reporting, showing good taste, being accountable, not pandering to lurid curiosity, treating subjects of stories as reporters would like to be treated and exposing unethical behavior by fellow reporters. With the media just slightly above Congress in public opinion polls of trustworthy institutions, the Cain team is hoping to capitalize on distrust as it fights back against coverage of sexual harassment claims by two women at the National Restaurant Association where Cain was CEO from 1996-1999. The low-level staffers are bound by confidentiality agreements, and despite efforts by one woman's lawyer to get her released from that non-disclosure rule, she issued an anonymous statement Friday calling the allegations very serious. Issuing an email solicitation on Saturday, Cain asked donors to contribute toward his goal of raising 999,000 -- keying off his 9-9-9 economic plan -- by next Thursday so Cain can compete in the Iowa caucuses scheduled for Jan. 3. In the appeal, Cain noted the \\"attacks\\" and said his campaign still has momentum. \\"Every time someone makes a donation to my campaign it shows the media and my opponents that the American people are fed up with the politics of personal destruction and they are demanding real change in Washington,\\" the email reads. But the story is having an impact. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, in the last week, Cain has lost 9 points in his favorability rating with Republicans. A week ago his favorability ranked at 66 percent in the poll, he's now down to 57 percent. Among all registered voters in the poll released Friday, he dropped 5 percentage points to 32 percent from 37 percent. However, as far as favorability rankings go, Cain still holds his own against President Obama, ranking 46-41 in polls of 937 registered voters one year out from the election. The margin of error is 3.2 percent in the poll. Separately, a Washington Post-ABC News survey taken after the allegations emerged last Sunday showed Cain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney running almost even with seven in 10 Republicans saying the reports don't matter when it comes to picking a candidate. Cain's opponents said the sex harassment allegations are irrelevant to the race for the White House, though they are a distraction. \\"I think the media blew this way out of proportion. I think there are a thousand stories out on there and I think that dilutes the real debates,\\" Texas Rep. Ron Paul told \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" \\"It's up to Herman Cain to get the information out and get it out in total. But that's important because we've got some real issues to discuss in this campaign, and this is taking all the bandwidth out of the discussion so we're not able to talk about jobs. We're not able to talk about our position in the world. And that hurts. That hurts the American people,\\" former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said on NBC's \\"Meet the Press.\\" Cain vowed Saturday to answer no more questions about the allegations, cutting off a reporter who tried to inquire about the alleged incidents. \\"Don't even go there. Where's my chief of staff?\\" Cain said as his top aide Mark Block signaled from the audience. \\"Please send him the journalistic code of ethics.\\" Speaking during a one-on-one debate with fellow candidate Newt Gingrich, Cain also took the opportunity from an open-ended question to complain about the media. \\"There are too many people in the media who are downright dishonest. ... They do a disservice to the American people,\\" Cain said, bringing the room to its feet. \\"If I were running this campaign the way the pundits thought I ought to be running this campaign, I would have dropped out in August,\\" Cain later told reporters. \\"When people get on the Cain train, they don't get off.\\" But whether the Cain approach will put to rest the accusations or inspire reporters to dig deeper, the SPJ code of ethics does little to offer guidance. The SPJ notes that its code is voluntary and is not intended as a set of \\"rules.\\" \\"It is not -- nor can it be under the First Amendment -- legally enforceable,\\" the code notes. The Associated Press contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text involve the Herman Cain campaign's response to reports of sexual harassment allegations against the Republican presidential contender. In an attempt to discredit the media coverage, the campaign distributed passages from the Society of Professional Journalist (SPJ) Code of Ethics, emphasizing the need for responsible reporting, limiting the use of anonymous sources, and evaluating the truthfulness and motives behind such sources. The report also highlights that Cain's favorability ratings have dropped as a result of the allegations. Notably, Cain's team aims to capitalize on the existing distrust of media institutions and has vowed not to answer any further questions regarding the allegations. Lastly, despite the campaign's reference to SPJ's Code of Ethics, the text points out that the code is voluntary, non-enforceable, and not legally binding under the First Amendment."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: Scholar Patrick Chura, who suggests Emmett Till was a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced. Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the \\"mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood\\". Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused. Tom Robinson's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice in To Kill a Mockingbird was physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways. Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as \\"stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites, rather than his own intelligence to save him\\".

After the Jaguars deferred the opening coin toss, the Patriots received the opening kickoff to begin a 10-play, 82-yard drive. On a 1st-and-goal run from the Jaguars' 1-yard line, Maroney fumbled before breaking the plane of the goal line; it was recovered by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith at the 1-yard line. The Jaguars reached their own 35-yard line on their ensuing possession before failing to convert on a fourth down attempt, turning the ball back over the Patriots. Two plays after a 21-yard Morris run, Brady and Moss connected on a 2-yard touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. After the kickoff, the Jaguars drove to the Patriots' 42-yard line before a David Garrard pass intended for Marcedes Lewis was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 17-yard line and returned 56 yards. Two plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Baker to extend the Patriots' lead to 14-0. The Jaguars continued to move the ball on their next possession, reaching midfield on completions of 15 and 14 yards; however a false start penalty negated another 15-yard reception and the Jaguars were forced to punt. Following a Patriots' three-and-out, Garrard was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain on the first play of the Jaguars' next-drive; tackle Eben Britton recovered the fumble for the Jaguars, who punted three plays later. On the third play of their ensuing drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 55-yard Morris run, and later took a 21-0 lead on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run.

Officers said they found the exiled Russian oligarch lying on a bathroom floor with a ‘ligature’ around his neck and similar material tied to a shower rail above him. But although there was no evidence of a struggle they said the possibility someone else was involved in his death remained. The discovery of the body of the 67-year-old billionaire at a £20million Berkshire mansion has sparked an explosion of speculation around his death. Scroll down for video. Inquest: A coroner heard that Boris Berezovsky, pictured with ex-girlfriend Elena Gorbunova, was found on his bathroom floor with a ligature around his neck. Hearing: Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford, left, heard evidence yesterday from policeman Mark Bissell, right. Inquest: The hearing is being held at the Windsor Guildhall where Prince Charles was married. At the opening of an inquest, Detective Inspector Mark Bissell said specialist officers were still checking the large Ascot property for clues. He said the involvement of a third party ‘cannot be completely eliminated as tests remain outstanding’. Mr Berezovsky was referred to as Platon Elemin at the hearing in Windsor. He changed his name by deed poll after fleeing to Britain in 2000 and becoming a vocal critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Mr Bissell added that Mr Berezovsky was last seen alive at approximately 9.05pm the night before by the same employee, believed to be a bodyguard. The scene of the death is currently under police control and the results of any tests carried out will take several weeks, Mr Bissell said. Allies: Mr Berezovsky's friends Alex Goldfarb, left, and Andrey Sidelnikov, right, outside the inquest. Scene: A police car and a police tent are positioned insode the grounds of of late Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky this week. Guard: A police van blocks a country lane leading to the oligarch's home as officers comb his home for clues. The inquest at the Guildhall in. Windsor, where the Prince of Wales married the Duchess of Cornwall, was. adjourned to a future date by the coroner. Coroner's officer Janine Prunty. confirmed that Berezovsky's daughter Elizaveta Berezovskaya had formally. identified the body of her father. Officers said they are speaking to. the Russian's close friends and family to build up a picture of his. state of mind in the last days of his life. It is thought that he was having. serious financial difficulties after paying out astronomical sums in. legal fees over the last few years, and wanted to return to Russia. Broken: Boris Berezovsky sued former business partner Roman Abramovich for billions of pounds but lost, which those close to him claimed 'destroyed' him. Boris Berezovsky with his ex girlfriend Elena and two children Arina (eight) and Gleb (six). The exiled 67-year-old tycoon was found by his bodyguard at his estate in Ascot on Saturday. The oligarch, who last year lost a. multibillion-pound High Court battle with Chelsea owner Roman. Abramovich, could have run up £100million in legal bills since 2011. In July 2011, he paid out Britain's. biggest-ever divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Galina Besharova. Reports suggested the deal was worth more than £100million. He later built up fees totalling more. than £250,000 after becoming embroiled in a case at the High Court with. his former partner, Elena Gorbunova, who sat at his side throughout. much of his battle with Mr Abramovich. Berezovsky emigrated to the UK in. 2000 after falling out with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and has. survived a number of assassination attempts. Police investigating the death of Mr Berezovsky (pictured here in 2003), one of Vladimir Putin's fiercest opponents, said there is so far no evidence to suggest any third party involvement in his death. Mansion: Police descend on oligarch's multi-million pound home after his body was found. His body was discovered on the. bathroom floor of a £20million mansion in Acot on Saturday after a. bodyguard became concerned and smashed the door open. Experts in chemical, biological and. nuclear emergencies spent hours combing the house amid fears that. Mr Berezovsky could have been poisoned by the Kremlin, but no radiation. was found. Another report claimed that detectives investigating the death did not find a suicide note. Some friends continue to insist Mr. Berezovsky was the victim of a professional hit for speaking out against Putin’s regime. Others believe he killed himself after. becoming depressed over the loss of his wealth and status. The exiled 67-year-old tycoon nicknamed the 'godfather of the Kremlin', is reported to have been found by his bodyguard at his mansion. The mansion in Ascot where he was found is understood to be owned by his former wife Ms Besharova, 54. Her close friend told the. Mail: ‘Galina is very upset about Boris’s death, as are their children. She remained close to Boris after they split up and it was at her house. that he died. ‘She really does not want to talk. about how he died.

Sand the entire surface with a hand sander or an electric sander to get rid of rough areas and imperfections. If your wood is pretty rough to start with, begin sanding with a rough sandpaper with a grit of 100 or 120. Progress from rougher grit to finer grit sandpapers, which allows you to reduce major irregularities before achieving a fine finish. To get a very smooth surface you should end with 400 grit sandpaper. Even if your wood already feels pretty smooth, take the time to run 400-grit sandpaper over it before sealing it. This will ensure that the surface is completely smooth once the sealant is applied. Sand with the grain, which means that you need to follow the lines of the wood grain straight back and forth. This will help you avoid leaving behind swirly marks on the surface. Wipe the entire surface several times. This will help you avoid getting wood particles stuck in your sealant, which will create an imperfect surface. A tac cloth is a special sticky cloth that is specially made to remove the dust from the surface of wood after sanding. Tac cloth will remove even fine particles that resist removal from a cloth. Avoid using water on unsealed wood, because it can alter the wood's grain and create roughness. the wood to change the color or to highlight the grain, if desired. Apply the stain before you apply your sealant so that it is able to soak into the surface. There are a variety of colors and types of stains available but most are applied with rags. First you will wipe your stain on the wood and then let it set for a specific amount of time, which is stated on the stain packaging. Then you will wipe off the excess with a clean, dry rag. The container of your stain will tell you how long you need to wait after applying stain to apply a sealer. Wood stains are available at all hardware and home improvement stores. These products allow you to apply colorant and create a water-resistant surface at the same time. They are a quick-finish option if you have a large surface and not a lot of time to seal it. For example, many people use this type of combo product with sealing a deck, due to the large surface area that needs to be treated. They are available at all hardware and home improvement stores. These products can typically be applied with a brush or a roller.","output":"This article discusses the process of preparing, staining, and sealing wood to achieve a smooth and protected surface. The main steps covered in the article include sanding, using a tack cloth, staining, and sealing. 1. Sanding: To achieve a smooth finish on the wood, sanding is crucial. Start with a rough sandpaper with grit 100 or 120 to remove major imperfections. Gradually progress to finer grit sandpapers, finishing with a 400-grit sandpaper for an ultra-smooth surface. Even if the wood appears smooth, using 400-grit sandpaper ensures a perfect finish before sealing. Always sand with the grain to prevent swirly marks on the wood. 2. Wipe the surface and use a tack cloth: After sanding, thoroughly wipe the surface to remove any wood particles that could mar the sealant application. A tack cloth, specifically designed for this purpose, can help remove even the finest dust particles that may resist regular cloth. Avoid using water on unsealed wood, as it can cause the grain to swell and create roughness. 3. Staining (optional): If you wish to change the color or highlight the wood grain, choose a stain that suits your desired result. Apply the stain before sealing, allowing it to soak into the wood surface. Stains come in various colors and types and are usually applied with rags. Follow the instructions on the stain packaging for proper application and wait times before sealing. Wood stains can be found at hardware and home improvement stores. 4. Sealing: Some products on the market combine colorant and sealant, providing a one-step, quick-finish option for large surfaces, such as decks. These combo products can save time while still offering protection and are available at hardware and home improvement stores. Sealants are typically applied with a brush or roller.

Loring Brace's observation that such variations, insofar as it is affected by natural selection, slow migration, or genetic drift, are distributed along geographic gradations or clines. In part this is due to isolation by distance. This point called attention to a problem common to phenotype-based descriptions of races (for example, those based on hair texture and skin color): they ignore a host of other similarities and differences (for example, blood type) that do not correlate highly with the markers for race. Thus, anthropologist Frank Livingstone's conclusion, that since clines cross racial boundaries, \\"there are no races, only clines\\". Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Why are variations distributed along clines?","output":"Variations are distributed along clines due to several interconnected factors, primarily driven by natural selection, gene flow, and genetic drift. Each of these processes contributes to the observed distribution of genotypic and phenotypic variations in populations. 1. Natural selection: This is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population over time as a result of the traits' impact on the reproductive success of the individuals carrying those traits. Natural selection operates on a gradient; as environmental conditions change across a geographical area, selection pressures also differ. For example, consider skin pigmentation in humans: darker skin protects against UV radiation in equatorial regions, providing a selective advantage, while lighter skin provides an advantage in higher latitudes where UV radiation is less intense. Accordingly, skin color varies along a cline that corresponds to geographical latitude. 2. Gene flow: Also known as migration, gene flow is the transfer of genetic material between populations. This can occur through mating between individuals from different populations or through movement of individuals carrying specific genetic traits. Over time, gene flow can result in the gradual distribution of genetic variations along clines, as individuals disperse and interbreed across geographic areas. This transfer of genetic material leads to a continuum of genetic variation between populations, challenging the concept of discrete racial boundaries. 3. Genetic drift: This random process causes fluctuations in the frequency of gene variants (alleles) within a population over time. Genetic drift is more pronounced in small populations, where chance events can have a significant impact on the genetic makeup of individuals. As population groups are separated by distance or geographic barriers, the effects of genetic drift can result in differing allele frequencies between them, reinforcing the establishment of clines. In summary, the distribution of variations along clines is primarily driven by three interconnected processes: natural selection, gene flow, and genetic drift. These processes create a gradient of genetic and phenotypic variations across geographic regions, which ultimately challenges the notion of distinct racial divisions and highlights the more complex and continuous nature of human diversity."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: It is too tight Review: I love the look of this paper-towel holder, but it doesn't function very well.

Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois.

Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca.

They are particularly scornful of a certain \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill (Robert Preston), who goes into a town, sells the kids musical instruments, instruction books, and band uniforms, under the promise that he will form a band for them, and then disappears. Someone mentions that \\"He don't know one note from another!\\". (This opening song has interesting musical accompaniment: the sound of the train's steam locomotive.) At the end of the song, just when the train is about to start up from a station stop in River City, Iowa, one of the people reveals that he is Harold Hill, and quickly escapes from the train before the others can catch him.Hill finds himself in a small turn-of-the-century Iowa town, full of taciturn people with small-town values. They sing him a song of welcome, explaining that Iowans are stubborn but good natured and generous. He is delighted to find an old friend and colleague from his earlier days as a crooked salesman, Marcellus Washburn (Buddy Hackett). Marcellus says that he is now making an honest living, has settled in River City, and that he likes the town and the people. The two friends reminisce about their shady dealings in the past, and that \\"Professor Hill\\"'s current racket is boys' bands. Marcellus says that it will be difficult to make headway on that front, because the town librarian and piano teacher, Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones), is quite smart and will expose him instantly. Harold takes that as a challenge, both professionally and romantically. Harold also mentions that he'll be in town longer than his usual stretch, a week, because not only will he con the town into buying the instruments, but also uniforms, which will take several weeks to arrive.

Similarly, if you or anyone else wants to wax their underarms, it's important to make sure the hair is at least as long as the width of a pencil eraser. That's around a quarter of an inch! This helps the wax to have a good grip on the hair. Now, think about when we wash our pet dog or maybe when we give a good scrub to our toys to get rid of their dirt. This is just like exfoliating your underarms before waxing. It helps to remove all the little bits of dirt and skin, making waxing easier and more effective. We can imagine this like giving your underarms a nice bubble bath! But you know how after a bath, you have to dry off so you don't catch a cold? It's the same with your underarms. You need to make sure they are super dry before you start with the waxing process. Imagine it like wanting to stick a nice shiny sticker on a wet paper, it wouldn't stick, right? The same goes for the wax. It won't stick well if your underarms are wet. Next, you know how we follow the rules of a game? If we don't do that, we could mess up the fun. That's just like following the directions on your chosen waxing product. They are very important so that things can work properly and you won't hurt yourself. It's like using the instructions to build the best Lego castle! Finally, after playing around in the sun, sometimes your skin might feel hot and you need some soothing lotion, right? After waxing, the skin in your underarms can feel the same way. It's very important to use an after-waxing lotion or gel. This helps to soothe the skin and reduce any discomfort or redness.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is the water will turn into water vapor. This step involves the transformation of liquid water into gaseous form, known as water vapor, by applying heat to increase the energy and temperature of the water. This process of converting water into vapor is known as evaporation. It typically occurs by heating a container with a mixture of saltwater. The heat makes the water molecules move faster, and as the temperature reaches the boiling point of water, approximately 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at sea level, the water molecules have sufficient energy to break free of their liquid state and transform into vapor. Since salt molecules have a higher boiling point than water molecules, they will remain behind in the container as solid particles. To optimize the evaporation process and ensure that water vapor is captured efficiently, you may use a distillation or evaporation apparatus designed to collect and separate water vapor from the remaining salt. Typically, such apparatus consists of a heating source, a container to hold the saltwater, and a condensation system where the water vapor will cool and turn back into its liquid state. The main objective is to exclude the salt particles from evaporating and obtain pure water, free from impurities and salt. In summary, the first step of the process is heating the saltwater to turn the water into water vapor, which is achieved through the process of evaporation. The subsequent steps involve collecting the water vapor, allowing it to cool, and the transformation of the water vapor back into liquid water, ultimately leading to the separation of salt and purified water."},{"instruction":"Where is beer drank by people watching sticks and pucks?

It is evident from the scenario that Cameron is a sensitive and considerate person who understands the depth of Jesse's emotions towards his dog. Recognizing the pain that Jesse would feel upon witnessing the accident and the injury of his beloved pet, Cameron instinctively steers Jesse's gaze away from the horrifying sight in order to spare him from further anguish. This act demonstrates empathy and concern for Jesse's emotional state, as Cameron is well aware of the attachment between Jesse and his dog. In turning Jesse's eyes away from the scene, Cameron is lessening the immediate emotional impact and potentially traumatic effects that the sight might bring upon Jesse. Moreover, Cameron is adopting a protective stance towards Jesse. Realizing that the distress Jesse would feel could be extremely overwhelming, Cameron intervenes and shows care for his friend's psychological well-being. By doing all this, Cameron creates a supportive atmosphere for Jesse to cope with the unfortunate incident.

Question: suppose the weather does not get as cold happens, how will it affect less water droplets are absorbed. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"B: Less To fully understand this scenario, let's first break down the processes involved in the formation of snowflakes and the context of the question. 1. Water in the clouds becomes very cold: As temperatures decrease, the water in clouds gets colder, which plays a significant role in forming ice crystals. 2. The cold water forms ice crystals: When the temperature reaches below freezing (0°C or 32°F), water vapor in the clouds directly turns into ice crystals through a process called deposition, bypassing the liquid phase. 3. The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets: Due to a process called the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) process, ice crystals grow at the expense of nearby supercooled water droplets, i.e., water droplets that are below freezing temperature but still exist in a liquid state. This happens because the saturated water vapor pressure over ice is lower than over supercooled liquid water. Thus, water vapor will preferentially deposit onto the ice crystals, making them grow over time. 4. Form snowflakes: Ice crystals can take on various shapes, and their structure is affected by atmospheric conditions such as temperature and humidity. As ice crystals collide with other ice crystals and with supercooled water droplets, they merge and form larger snowflakes. 5. The snowflakes fall to the ground: When snowflakes grow large enough and heavy enough, they will fall to the ground due to gravity. Now, let's revisit the question: Suppose the weather does not get as cold as it usually does. In this case, the formation of ice crystals will be affected because colder temperatures are essential for their development. As a result, less water droplets would be absorbed by the ice crystals for a few reasons: 1. A decreased number of ice crystals could form due to the higher temperatures, leading to a smaller overall surface area for water vapor deposition. This would make it more difficult for the ice crystals to grow in size and absorb the surrounding water droplets. 2. The WBF process relies on the temperature difference between ice crystals and supercooled water droplets. If the clouds are not as cold as they should be, the temperature gradient between ice crystals and supercooled water droplets will be less significant. This would weaken the WBF process, leading to less absorption of water droplets by ice crystals. Therefore, if the weather does not get as cold as it usually does, there will be less absorption of water droplets by ice crystals, which in turn would lead to fewer and smaller snowflakes. The correct answer in this scenario would be \\"B: Less\\"."},{"instruction":"Recognizing that maintenance costs could be reduced by reliability improvements, the Air Force contracted with SwRI in 1992 to study ways of improving the installation's transmitter array system.

Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group...

Question 2: How do I lose weight without stopping? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"While the answers to these two questions have some overlap, they are not exactly the same. However, I will provide detailed and long answers to both of your questions that will help clarify the differences between the two approaches. Question 1: How do I lose weight in a healthy way? To lose weight in a healthy way, the key factors to focus on are a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and healthy habits. Here's a detailed breakdown: 1. Balanced Diet: a. Mindful eating: Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues and stop eating when you're comfortably full. b. Eat a variety of foods: Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein sources, and low-fat dairy products in your daily diet. c. Portion control: Be mindful of portion sizes and avoid overeating by eating smaller meals and snacks throughout the day. d. Limit processed foods: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods and minimize your intake of sugary snacks, processed meats, and unhealthy fats. e. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water helps to regulate metabolism, improve digestion, and control hunger. 2. Regular Physical Activity: a. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercises every week, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming. b. Incorporate strength training exercises at least twice a week to build muscle strength and increase metabolism. c. Make exercise part of your daily routine and seek out activities you enjoy. 3. Healthy Habits: a. Get adequate sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep every night to support healthy weight loss. b. Manage stress: High stress levels can lead to emotional eating. Find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as practicing yoga or meditation. c. Set realistic goals: Set achievable weight loss goals and track your progress to stay motivated. d. Seek support: Join a weight loss group or enlist the help of friends and family to provide encouragement and accountability. Question 2: How do I lose weight without stopping? To lose weight consistently and avoid plateaus, it's important to make long-term adjustments to your lifestyle and maintain a sustainable approach to weight management. Here's a detailed breakdown: 1. Develop a Flexible Eating Plan: a. Customize your diet plan to meet your nutritional needs and preferences, making it easier to stick to over the long term. b. Allow for occasional indulgences, but practice moderation in both the quantity and frequency of these treats. c. Periodically reassess and make adjustments to your diet plan as your weight, activity levels, and lifestyle change. 2. Adapt Your Exercise Routine: a. Incorporate a variety of exercises and activities to prevent boredom and maintain motivation. b. Gradually increase the duration and intensity of your workouts as your fitness level improves. c. Experiment with different forms of physical activity, such as yoga, dance, or team sports, to find the best fit for your lifestyle and preferences. 3. Focus on Non-Scale Victories: a. Monitor improvements in your overall health, such as increased energy, better sleep, and reduced risk of chronic diseases, to stay motivated to continue your weight loss journey. b. Celebrate healthy behavior changes, such as incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet or regularly exercising, rather than solely focusing on weight loss. 4. Embrace Setbacks: a. Understand that achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is an ongoing process and setbacks are a normal part of the journey. b. Instead of getting discouraged by setbacks, use them as learning opportunities to reassess your approach and make any necessary adjustments. By focusing on these key strategies, you can create a sustainable approach to weight loss that allows you to maintain your progress without constantly feeling deprived or discouraged. While both answers hinge on developing healthy eating habits and engaging in regular physical activity, the emphasis in Question 1 is on achieving a healthy lifestyle, whereas the emphasis in Question 2 is on sustaining weight loss efforts over the long term."},{"instruction":"Q:Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Yamabushi's mini reviews XXVIII Review: Dull and lazily written.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process involves the delivery of oxygen to the cells for cellular respiration and energy production. After the heme releases oxygen in the tissue capillaries, the oxygen molecules diffuse out of the capillaries and into the interstitial fluid, the fluid that surrounds the cells within the tissues. From the interstitial fluid, oxygen molecules then diffuse across the cell membrane and enter into the cells. Inside the cells, oxygen is utilized by the cellular organelles called mitochondria during a process called cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is a complex process where glucose, which is a simple sugar molecule, is broken down to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The process of cellular respiration has three major steps: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), and the electron transport chain. During glycolysis, glucose is converted into pyruvate, which then enters the mitochondria, where it undergoes the citric acid cycle. In the citric acid cycle, pyruvate is further broken down, producing energy-rich molecules and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a waste product that will be transported back to the lungs for exhalation. The electron transport chain is the final step of cellular respiration, and it is here where the oxygen molecules play a crucial role. Oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, combining with hydrogen ions (protons) and electrons to form water. This process is essential for the generation of ATP, the main energy source the cells use to carry out various functions. In summary, the last step of the process is the utilization of oxygen by the cells for cellular respiration to generate ATP, which provides the energy required for various cellular activities. After the oxygen is used, waste products like carbon dioxide are produced, which are then transported back to the lungs and eventually exhaled back into the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"The October 2017 term had a low rate of unanimous rulings, with only 39% of the cases decided by unanimous rulings, the lowest percentage since the October 2008 term when 30% of rulings were unanimous.

It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers. - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\". - Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland. Dublin is in the province of Leinster on Ireland's east coast, at the mouth of the River Liffey. The city has an urban area population of 1,345,402. The population of the Greater Dublin Area, , was 1,904,806 people. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country. - Snooker is a cue sport played on a table covered with a green cloth or baize, with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each of the long side cushions. A full-size table measures 11 ft 8 in × 5 ft 10 in (3569 mm x 1778 mm), commonly referred to as 12 × 6 ft. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the upper house. - Michael Judge is a former professional snooker player from the Republic of Ireland . He has not won a ranking event , coming closest in the 2004 Grand Prix , where he reached the semi-finals after victories over Mark Williams among others . His first ranking quarter - final was at the 1997 British Open - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.

I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

Options: - not enough information - Excellent grades - Barely acceptable grades - Failing grades === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"Excellent grades"},{"instruction":"Consider the question. In Lent, many Christians commit to fasting, as well as giving up certain luxuries in order to replicate the sacrifice of Jesus Christ's journey into the desert for 40 days. Many Christians also add a Lenten spiritual discipline, such as reading a daily devotional or praying through a Lenten calendar, to draw themselves near to God. The Stations of the Cross, a devotional commemoration of Christ's carrying the Cross and of his execution, are often observed. Many Roman Catholic and some Protestant churches remove flowers from their altars, while crucifixes, religious statues, and other elaborate religious symbols are often veiled in violet fabrics in solemn observance of the event. Throughout Christendom, some adherents mark the season with the traditional abstention from the consumption of meat, most notably among Lutherans, Roman Catholics and Anglicans. Why do we need to give up something for lent? If the answer is 'in order to replicate the sacrifice of Jesus Christ 's journey into the desert for 40 days'; explain the reasoning:","output":"Giving up something for Lent is an act of self-discipline and sacrifice, which aims to replicate the sacrifice of Jesus Christ's journey into the desert for 40 days. The reasoning behind this tradition is twofold: firstly, to strengthen one's personal relationship with God by practicing self-control and dedication and, secondly, to pay homage to Jesus' own sacrifices and struggles during his time in the desert. In the Bible, Jesus spent 40 days fasting in the desert to prepare himself for his ministry and resist temptation by the devil. By giving up something for Lent, Christians are reminded of Jesus' sacrifice and are encouraged to engage in a period of personal reflection, self-examination, and repentance. This practice helps believers to embody Christ-like qualities, such as humility, empathy, and selflessness, throughout the season of Lent. Additionally, giving up certain luxuries or indulgences can serve as a symbol of solidarity and identification with Christ's sufferings, as believers remember the sacrifices he made for the salvation of humanity. The act of giving something up is not the sole purpose of Lent, but it can create an opportunity for personal growth and spiritual renewal, drawing Christians closer to God during this significant time in the Christian calendar."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given an input stream, the objective of this task is to classify whether words in the stream are grammatically correct or not.

Dr. Smith - an Artificial Intelligence researcher 2. Emma - a concerned yet curious member of the public --- (Scene: At a public seminar on \\"The Future of Artificial Intelligence\\") Emma: (Raises hand) Dr. Smith? Dr. Smith: Yes, Emma. You have a question? Emma: Several, actually. Firstly, thank you for hosting this seminar. My first question is regarding AI's evolution. If artificial intelligence continues to evolve, will it pose a threat to human jobs? Dr. Smith: A very valid query, Emma. The evolution of artificial intelligence indeed raises possible implications for some traditional jobs. Routine tasks that require repetition and not much human intervention may be susceptible to automation. However, it's important to remember that AI is a tool created by humans. It's also leading to the creation of new roles and fields that never existed before. AI is not designed to replace humans but to augment human capabilities, making our lives more efficient. Emma: But isn't this technology a bit... uncontrollable? I mean, once it reaches a certain point of self-learning, won't it start making decisions we won't understand? Dr. Smith: That's a common fear, but AI's development is not an unrestrained process. It's governed by stringent ethical guidelines and legal constraints. Also, for AI to make unpredictable decisions, it would need to attain a level of intelligence known as \\"superintelligence.\\" This situation, while often depicted in science fiction, is far from our current reality. Furthermore, researchers are working tirelessly to build safety measures into these systems. Emma: That's reassuring. However, I have heard about AI being biased. How is it possible if they are just algorithms? Dr. Smith: Good question. An AI system learns from the data it's fed. If this data contains biases, the AI system may unintentionally perpetuate these biases in its outcomes. For example, if an AI trained to screen job applications is trained on data from a company that has historically favored a particular demographic, it might mirror that bias. However, we're aware of these issues, and much research is being conducted to ensure fairness and eliminate biases in AI systems. Emma: That makes sense. Lastly, how do you see AI improving our daily lives in the future, Dr. Smith? Dr. Smith: That's a very expansive question, Emma. AI holds enormous potential; it's already begun transforming sectors like healthcare, education, and transportation. In healthcare, AI can improve diagnostics and prediction of diseases. In education, AI can offer personalized learning paths. In transportation, AI can make self-driving vehicles more efficient and safer. These are just a few examples. The future with AI is exciting, to say the least! Emma: Thank you, Dr. Smith. Your insights have indeed been enlightening! Dr. Smith: My pleasure, Emma. It's discussions like these that help bridge the understanding gap between AI and the general public. I hope you'll share what you learned today with others!

The two stages you are asking about, Alpha and Beta, are both essential stages during the development of a game. Each of these stages comes with its distinctive characteristics and objectives. To answer your question, the Alpha stage comes first, followed by the Beta stage. Here are detailed explanations of each stage: 1. Alpha Stage: The Alpha stage is an early stage in the game development process where the developers have mostly completed the core gameplay mechanics, tasks, and all essential functions. In other words, the game should be somewhat playable at this point. However, many features are still under development, and the game's build may not be optimized or polished. The primary goal during the Alpha stage is to work out any kinks and bugs in the game design. This period is crucial for the developers, as it allows them to fix any underlying issues that could significantly impact gameplay. Alpha builds often include a lot of experimentation, such as testing various game mechanics and finding the best ways to implement them. Developers release the Alpha version internally to their team members, external testers, and, at times, to a limited number of players. This helps identify any major issues and bugs, with the goal of addressing them before proceeding to the Beta stage. 2. Beta Stage: Once the game is deemed stable and functional in its Alpha stage, it progresses to the Beta stage. At this point, the game is mostly feature-complete, meaning that it includes all the intended content, such as levels, characters, and other gameplay elements. The game should now be largely optimized for performance, and the visual and audio assets are refined. During the Beta stage, the main focus is on fixing any remaining bugs, fine-tuning the game's balance, and polishing the experience. To achieve this, developers often release a Beta version of the game to a broader audience, either through closed or open Beta tests. Closed Beta tests usually have a restricted number of participants, such as selected users or those who pre-ordered the game. In contrast, open Beta tests are made available to the general public, allowing anyone interested to download and play the game for a limited period. The feedback gathered from Beta testers is invaluable for the development team, as it provides an excellent opportunity for them to understand what players like and dislike about the game, what works and what doesn't, and any critical issues that they might not have identified during the Alpha stage. The developers then use that feedback to make any final adjustments before officially launching the game. In conclusion, the Alpha stage is the first stage in the game development process, where the primary focus is on developing the core gameplay mechanics and ironing out the major issues. The Beta stage comes after, where the game is mostly feature-complete, and developers focus on bug fixing, game balance, and polishing. Both stages are crucial in ensuring a successful game that provides an enjoyable experience for the players."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: WASHINGTON — They called themselves \\"crusaders\\" for a reason. The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Over the past few decades, Bahrain has cemented close ties with the United States as a means to bolster its security and military landscape. A significant aspect of this relationship revolves around United States' assistance in the modernization of Bahrain's armed forces through defense sales, procurement of weapons, and equipment. This article examines a key question: \\"Did Bahrain receive more tanks or aircraft from the United States?\\" In order to delve into the intricacies of Bahrain's military acquisition from the United States, we will analyze the procurement data and compare the quantity of tanks and aircraft supplied to Bahrain's armed forces over the years. The Acquisition of Tanks The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) has procured a notable number of tanks from the United States in order to strengthen its ground forces. One of the major acquisitions was of M60A3 Patton main battle tanks. The United States transferred around 180 M60A3 tanks to Bahrain during the 1990s. These tanks serve as the backbone of the BDF's armored capabilities and play a significant role in Bahrain's ground combat readiness. M60A3 Patton tanks are known for their superb armor protection and powerful M68 105mm gun. These tanks not only provide the BDF with effective combat capabilities, but also represent a long-standing military cooperation between Bahrain and the United States. The Supply of Aircraft Bahrain's air force, known as the Royal Bahraini Air Force (RBAF), received aircraft from the United States to bolster its aerial capabilities. One of the RBAF's leading acquisitions from the United States has been the procurement of F-16 Fighting Falcon multirole fighter jets. The United States provided Bahrain with an initial batch of 12 F-16C/D aircraft in the late 1980s, followed by an additional 10 F-16C/D jets in the early 2000s as part of the Peace Crown II Foreign Military Sales program. In 2018, Bahrain signed yet another agreement with the United States to purchase 16 upgraded F-16V aircraft through a 3.8 billion deal. These aircraft are expected to be delivered to Bahrain within the next few years. Apart from the F-16 jets, Bahrain also operates several UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters, supplied by the United States, to bolster their transport and utility capabilities. Additionally, the RBAF utilizes C-130 Hercules transport aircraft for logistical and heavy transport purposes. Comparison and Conclusion Upon close examination of Bahrain's military acquisitions from the United States, it becomes evident that Bahrain has received significantly more aircraft than tanks over the years. With a total of approximately 180 main battle tanks supplied to the BDF, Bahrain's ground forces have certainly benefitted from American assistance. However, looking at the number of aircraft procured from the United States, we observe a higher figure. Bahrain acquired 22 F-16C/D fighter jets between the late 1980s and early 2000s, with another 16 F-16V jets expected in the near future. If we also take into account the additional aircraft like UH-60M Black Hawk and C-130 Hercules, Bahrain has clearly received more aircraft than tanks from the United States. In conclusion, Bahrain has received more aircraft than tanks from the United States, highlighting the emphasis on both parties' strategic partnership in enhancing the RBAF's aerial capabilities. Effective air power plays an important role in projecting force and ensuring regional stability while also enabling Bahrain to better contribute to peacekeeping and counter-terrorism efforts within the Middle East in collaboration with the United States."},{"instruction":"What's the worst thing that could happen to you?

Article: I have a rule of travel: never carry a map. I prefer to ask for directions. Foreign visitors are often puzzled in Japan because most streets there don't have names. In Japan, people tell landmarks in their directions instead of street names. For example, the Japanese will say to travelers, \\" Go straight down to the corner. Turn left at the big hotel and pass a fruit market. The post office is across from the bus stop.\\" In the countryside of the American Midwest, usually there are not many landmarks. There are no towns or buildings within miles. Instead of landmarks, people will tell you directions and distance. In Kansas or Iowa, for example, people will say, \\" Go north two miles, turn west, and then go another mile.\\" People in Los Angeles, California, have no idea of distance on the map. They measure distance by means of time, not miles. \\"How far away is the post office?\\" you ask. \\"Oh,\\" they answer, \\"it's about five minutes from here.\\" You say, \\" Yes, but how many miles away is it?\\" They don' t know. People in Greece sometimes do not even try to give directions because visitors seldom understand the Greek language. Instead of giving you the direction, a Greek often says, \\" Follow me.\\" Then he will lead you through the streets of the city to the post office. Sometimes a person doesn't know the answer to your question. What happens then? A New Yorker might say, \\" Sorry, I have no idea.\\" But in Yuchatan, Mexico, no one answers \\" I don't know.\\" People in Yucatan think that \\" I don't know\\" is impolite. They usually give an answer, often a wrong one. A visitor can get very lost in Yucatan. However, one thing will help you everywhere---- in Japan, in the United States, in Greece, in Mexico, or in any other places. You might not understand a person's words, but maybe you can understand his body language. He or she will usually turn and then point in the correct direction. Go in that direction and you may find the post office. Question: From the text we may know that _ .

In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

After one of their rockets carrying wasps malfunctions and goes off course, a computer calculates that the rocket is likely to land somewhere off the coast of Africa. Some time later, in a remote part of Africa, Dr. Lorentz and his daughter Lorna perform an autopsy on a native and determine that he died of paralysis of the nerve centers caused by an injection of a massive amount of venom. Arobi, Lorentz' African assistant, then informs him that a monster is believed to be terrorizing people and animals in an area known as Green Hell. Several months later, Brady reads a newspaper account of turmoil in Central Africa caused by gigantic monsters and surmises that the wasps in the missing rocket were exposed to huge amounts of cosmic radiation because an earlier, minimal overexposure had resulted in the birth of a spider crab twice the size of its mother.

The safari battles brush fires, fever, drought and storms, eventually reaching the Lorentz compound where Lorna informs them that her father has not returned from a journey to Green Hell. Later, Arobi arrives with the news that Lorentz has been killed by a monster living in the cauldron of a volcano and gives Brady a giant stinger he removed from the doctor's shoulder. After Brady analyzes the stinger, he confirms that it belongs to a giant, deadly wasp. Although Brady advises Lorna to stay at the hospital, she insists on accompanying him, Morgan, Mahri and Arobi to Green Hell. When the native bearers learn of the destination, they...

Does following someone on Twitter imply that I support them? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"1. Is it possible to go invisible to certain Twitter followers without actually blocking them? Hi little buddy! On Twitter, you can't become invisible to specific followers, but there's something you can do. You can \\"mute\\" them. When you mute someone, they can still follow you, but their tweets won't show up on your timeline. It's like they're there, but you won't see them. They won't know that you've muted them, so it won't hurt their feelings like blocking would. 2. Does following someone on Twitter imply that I support them? Well, when you follow someone on Twitter, it means you're interested in seeing what they say. It doesn't always mean you support them, like being on someone's team. Sometimes, people follow others to keep an eye on what they say or do, just like when we watch cartoons with different characters. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, little one, they're not the same. These two questions are different, like eating an apple and an orange. The first question is about hiding things from people who follow you, and the second question is about supporting someone by following them.

Bob studied sedimentary rocks while Dan studied about earthquakes and their location. and a hint : Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). Please answer this question : Which brother studied more about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup? Answer:","output":"Dan is the brother who studied more about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup. This is because Dan focused on studying earthquakes and their location, which directly relates to the rocks breaking due to the accumulation of stress. As hinted, almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, where different types of tectonic plates interact with each other due to convection within the Earth. The movement of these plates puts stress on the rocks at the boundaries. Over time, this increasing stress can cause the rocks to fracture and break, resulting in an earthquake. The seismic activity occurring during an earthquake causes the rocks to move, sometimes several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. The Elastic Rebound Theory is key to understanding the study of earthquakes as it describes the process of how earthquakes occur. It explains that the stress buildup in rocks is relieved through a sudden release of energy that has been stored, creating seismic waves and ground shaking. On the other hand, Bob focused on studying sedimentary rocks, which are formed through the accumulation and cementation of mineral and organic particles over time. His area of study is more related to the composition, formation, and types of these rocks, rather than their breaking due to stress buildup. In conclusion, Dan is the brother who studied more about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup due to his focus on earthquakes and their location, which directly involves the processes of stress accumulation and release in rocks at the plate boundaries."},{"instruction":"Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Rinse the dishes before placing them in the dishwasher - Since the dishes are only lightly soiled, a quick rinse may be enough to remove any loose food particles, making it easier for the dishwasher to clean them. This step can be considered as having little to no effect on the dishwasher's overall cleaning ability. 2. Load glasses and plastic wear on the top rack - Lightly soiled dishes will not affect how we load the glasses and plastic wear on the top rack. This step remains the same with no effect on the dishwasher's cleaning ability. 3. Put plates, bowls, pots, and pans on the bottom rack - As with the top rack, loading the dishes on the bottom rack remains unchanged. No effect on the dishwasher's cleaning ability. 4. Place all the utensils in the utensil basket - Loading utensils should not be affected by the lightly soiled dishes. No effect on the dishwasher's cleaning ability. 5. Put detergent into the detergent holder - Detergent usage should not be impacted by the lightly soiled dishes. The same amount of detergent can be used to ensure proper cleaning. No effect on the dishwasher's cleaning ability. 6. Close the door and push the start button - The operation of the dishwasher remains the same regardless of the soiled level of the dishes. No effect on the dishwasher's cleaning ability. Considering each step in the process and the fact that the dishes are only lightly soiled, the dishwasher should still clean the dishes well.

Unnecessary complexity: Adding two characters at the end of a line can create more complications than it solves. With only one character, software systems can easily identify a line's ending. However, when two characters are used, systems are forced to check for both characters in sequence to verify the end of a line accurately. This extra step can be less efficient and lead to slower performance or increased processing time, especially when working with large text files or content with numerous line breaks. 2. Questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone: The presence of two characters brings up the issue of how each should be interpreted individually. If a system encounters one of the characters without the other, it may be unclear whether that character is meant to signify the end of a line, a formatting error, or a different function altogether. This ambiguity can prove problematic when attempting to parse text, navigate through a document, or standardize formatting across various platforms. In conclusion, the provided answer effectively addresses the potential problems associated with adding two characters at the end of a line. By highlighting the unnecessary complexity and the potential for confusion when interpreting standalone characters, it clearly shows the challenges that could arise due to such a choice. Consequently, the sentence serves as an appropriate response to the initial question."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Jared will come to Ann at 8 pm to bring the books..","output":"Scene: Interior Ann's apartment, Evening Ann (sitting on a sofa flipping through a magazine): I can't wait to get those books from Jared.

When Roman goes to meet with him again he finds Roenick murdered seconds before other police arrive, pinning him as the prime suspect. Things only get worse for Roman when Internal Affairs investigator Terence Niebaum (J. T. Walsh), whom Roenick's informant suspected of involvement in the embezzlement, is assigned to investigate the murder. After the gun that killed Roenick is linked to a case Roman had worked on, Niebaum and other investigators search Roman's house and discover papers for an offshore bank account with a deposit equal to one of the amounts of money embezzled. Roman is made to surrender his gun and badge and his colleagues are doubtful of his protests of innocence. With murder and embezzlement charges pending, Roman storms into Niebaum's office and demands answers about who set him up. When Niebaum stonewalls, Roman takes Niebaum, his administrative assistant Maggie (Siobhan Fallon), police commander Grant Frost (Ron Rifkin), and two-bit con man Rudy Timmons (Paul Giamatti) as hostages.

Once known best as affable barman Sam Malone on \\"Cheers,\\" in recent years he has taken some edgier turns: as a corrupt business titan turned murderer in the cable series \\"Damages\\" and a womanizing editor in HBO's half-hour comedy \\"Bored to Death.\\" Darker roles have put Ted Danson back on the map. After playing an editor and a murderer, he's now a crime-scene investigator. This week Mr. Danson, 63, returned to network television, poring over evidence as the head investigator on CBS's \\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\\" Just a few years ago, Mr. Danson seemed to be happily retired. His sitcom \\"Becker,\\" about a cranky doctor in the Bronx, was canceled in 2004. Afterward, he made a few cameos in cable shows and films—he and his wife Mary Steenburgen occasionally play fictionalized versions of themselves on HBO's \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\"—but mostly lived comfortably in Los Angeles and Martha's Vineyard. Then, in 2007, Mr. Danson got the role of Arthur Frobisher, a sociopath CEO engulfed in an Enron-like scandal in \\"Damages,\\" then on FX and now on DirecTV. \\"After years of doing half-hour comedies, I'd become this nice, accommodating actor who wanted to make sure everything was right,\\" Mr. Danson says. He hired an acting coach. \\"This coach got me to be a little more arrogant,\\" he says. \\"I didn't do anything I didn't want to do, which fit this billionaire narcissist I was playing.\\" The role put Mr. Danson back on the map—and helped him land the starring role in one of the biggest hits on TV world-wide. Now entering its 12th season, \\"CSI,\\" the original series in Jerry Bruckheimer's sleek billion-dollar crime franchise, airs in 200 countries or territories. Last season in the U.S. it attracted 13.7 million viewers nightly. That's down from its peak of 26 million in 2003, but it still beats popular drams like ABC's \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" and CBS's \\"The Good Wife.\\" See a clip of Ted Danson, the former star of \\"Cheers,\\" in the newest season of CSI. The fictional Clark County forensics unit has had its share of staff changes. William Petersen originally played night-shift entomologist Gil Grissom. In 2009, Laurence Fishburne joined as investigator Ray Langston. Mr. Danson will step in as D.B. Russell, night supervisor of the Las Vegas Crime Lab. The scientific jargon in \\"CSI\\" appealed to Mr. Danson, who has spent two decades as an activist focused on marine conservation. His father, in his hometown of Flagstaff, Ariz., was a museum director and archeologist. \\"There were always scientists crawling in and out of our house,\\" Mr. Danson says. The Wall Street Journal: Why did you decide to do \\"CSI\\"? Twenty-two episodes a season is a big commitment. Mr. Danson: I tend to back into things in life. They seem to miraculously land in my lap and as time goes on I find out how lucky I am. That happened with \\"Damages\\" and \\"Bored to Death.\\" They were teeny little parts in the pilot but turned out to be these great things for me. The same thing has happened here with \\"CSI.\\" I knew I wanted to be home in L.A. One of our daughters is pregnant, so the idea of making a show nine months out of the year and knowing where I'd be appealed to me. I started off by going to Las Vegas and I rode along with real CSI people. I went to the coroner's office and watched four autopsies. It was like being shot out of a cannon. I kept thinking, \\"Wow, maybe I'm not the right person for this.\\" Most of my life I look for the joy, the happiness, the joke, the humor. How can you immerse yourself in this dark side of life, with death and with that tiny percentage of our population that goes around killing each other? How can I fit into that world as an actor? Did you want to do a drama rather than another network sitcom? I love comedy, but it's hard. It's really, really hard. I joke that you can show up in a drama drunk, depressed, divorced, and as long as you're in the moment, the camera loves you. Drama is created by the writer, director and editor, whereas comedy is the writer and actor that are doing the work. Hence my wife saying I'm off to the spa every day. Most viewers don't like it when their favorite TV characters change. Is it a lot of pressure to replace a beloved character on the world's most watched TV drama? You pretend it's just another job but even though you try to ignore it, your body feels this is what it is, which is a billion-dollar franchise. Talk to me a year from now. Did Larry David write your character on \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" or was that improvised? If you're writing a comedy show, a normal \\"Cheers\\" or \\"Seinfeld,\\" the process is you spend months pitching the stories, break it down on a chalkboard beat by beat by beat, and one of the last things you do is you hand that outline to a writer to write the dialogue. So Larry spends months working on the outlines but then doesn't write the dialogue. It's very well thought out but the dialogue is improvised. But like all improvisation, half of it is crap, so by the end [of improvising in rehearsals] you've almost improvised the script. The other half of what you see is coming out of people's mouths for the first time. Was it frustrating that for decades after \\"Cheers\\" you were typecast as a sitcom actor? The good news is some part came along that was so well known that you're typecast, so it's one of those good news-bad news things. You may never be famous again like you are for that original type. But if you let go of that and let go of the big money that comes from people hiring you to just stay in your type, and get around creative people doing really different work, you can spring loose from that type. That's what happened to me with \\"Damages.\\" There's a scene in the first season when I'm in the back seat of an Escalade snorting coke with a hooker and order someone to kill someone else. At that moment Sam Malone went flying out the window.

Henry performs his reactions with the use of a catalyst. Tiffany performs the same reaction with no catalyst present. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Could Tiffany change other aspects of her reaction besides adding a catalyst to influence its rate, yes or no? A:","output":"Yes, Tiffany could change other aspects of her reaction besides adding a catalyst to influence its rate. There are various factors that can affect the rate of a chemical reaction, and some of these factors include: 1. Concentration of reactants: Increasing the concentration of the reactants will generally increase the rate of reaction. This is because there will be more particles available to react, thus increasing the chances of successful collisions between reacting particles. 2. Temperature: The rate of reaction is typically influenced by temperature changes. Increasing the temperature will cause the reacting particles to move faster, and due to the increased kinetic energy, there will be more frequent collisions between them. Additionally, a higher temperature ensures that a larger percentage of reacting particles possess enough energy to exceed the activation energy barrier, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction. 3. Surface area of solid reactants: If a solid reactant is involved in the reaction, increasing its surface area by reducing the particle size will increase the rate of reaction. This is because a larger surface area means a greater number of reacting particles will be exposed to other reactants, resulting in more effective collisions. 4. Pressure (for reactions involving gases): In a gas-phase reaction, increasing the pressure is akin to increasing the concentration of the reacting particles. Higher pressure will cause gas particles to be compressed into a smaller space, thereby increasing the frequency of collisions between them and leading to a faster reaction rate. 5. Stirring (for reactions in solution): Proper stirring helps ensure that the reactants are uniformly distributed throughout the solution, increasing the chance for collisions between reacting particles, which in turn increases the reaction rate. 6. Presence of light (for photosensitive reactions): In reactions that are sensitive to light, the rate could be impacted by the presence or intensity of light that reaches the reactants. For such reactions, more light exposure could either increase or decrease the reaction rate depending on the individual reaction. While using a catalyst is an effective way to influence the rate of a chemical reaction, it is by no means the only method. By altering any or a combination of the factors mentioned above, Tiffany can effectively influence the rate of her reaction without introducing a catalyst."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"This form of justification, which became known as laxism, may explain why Jesuit priests were the confessors of choice among Europe's Catholic aristocracy.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Jesuit priest were among the least preferred confessors in Europe's Catholic aristocracy.\\" is true (see options)?

Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the given process is: A mature adult bird, also known as the mother bird, prepares to lay eggs by finding a suitable mate and perfecting the nesting site. In more detail, the first step of the entire reproductive process for birds is essential to ensure the successful breeding and continuation of their species. After reaching sexual maturity, the adult bird will embark on the critical task of finding a suitable mate. This step usually involves engaging in specific courtship behaviors such as singing, dancing, or displaying their bright plumage to attract the attention of potential partners. Birds use these behaviors to signal their health, strength, and suitability as a mate. Once a suitable partner has been found, the birds pair up and establish a territory where they can safely build their nest and raise their offspring. In some bird species, both the male and female contribute to constructing the nest, while in others, one member of the pair solely takes on this responsibility. Materials used in nest-building can range from twigs, leaves, and feathers to mud, stones, and man-made items like string and plastic. Now we can proceed with the rest of the process: 1. A mature adult bird prepares to lay eggs by finding a suitable mate and perfecting the nesting site. 2. The egg hatches into a baby bird. 3. The baby bird eats food provided by its parents, which usually includes insects, seeds, or nectar, depending on the species. 4. As the baby bird consumes nourishment, it grows and develops into a mature adult bird. 5. The bird finds a mate and becomes ready to begin the reproductive process. 6. The pair of birds work together to build a nest that will house their eggs and future offspring. 7. The birds lay eggs in the nest, starting the cycle anew. Each step of this process is essential for the continuation of a bird species, from finding a mate to raising offspring that will eventually find partners of their own. Through these intricate steps, birds ensure the healthy growth and survival of their population."},{"instruction":"Gene has 'big effect' on alcoholism, how quickly you get drunk By Rita Rubin, USA TODAY You probably know people who get tipsy after a drink or two. Maybe you're one yourself. Over the past several decades, studies of college students have shown that such individuals are one-third to one-half as likely to develop alcoholism as those who drink and drink and drink before they feel drunk. Now scientists have identified a gene that has a \\"big, big effect\\" on how people respond to alcohol, says Kirk Wilhelmsen, senior author of a paper posted Tuesday by the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. About 10% to 20% of the population carry a version of the gene that makes their brains especially sensitive to alcohol. The finding, Wilhelmsen says, \\"potentially changes the paradigm about how we think about how alcohol affects the brain.\\" While the finding doesn't yet have any treatment application, he says, \\"my expectation is this is actually going to lead somewhere.\\" The gene carries the blueprint for an enzyme called CYP2E1, known to be involved in metabolizing ethanol alcohol as well as other molecules, such as the pain-reliever acetaminophen, or Tylenol, and nicotine. People who carry the version of the CYP2E1 gene linked to increased sensitivity to alcohol produce more of the enzyme. The CYP2E1 enzyme works in the brain, which is not the major player in alcohol metabolism, says Wilhelmsen, a genetics professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Medicine. Another enzyme, in the liver, \\"does most of the heavy lifting\\" in breaking down alcohol, he says. Apparently, though, CYP2E1 affects how sensitive the brain is to alcohol, perhaps because it — unlike the enzyme in the liver — generates free radicals, tiny molecules that can damage cells.

She scored four Top 40 hits in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including \\"Paper Roses\\", which reached #5 on the charts. - A beauty pageant or beauty contest is a competition that has traditionally focused on judging and ranking the physical attributes of the contestants, although some contests have evolved to also incorporate personality traits, intelligence, talent, and answers to judges' questions as judged criteria. The term almost invariably refers only to contests for unmarried women such as the Big Four international beauty pageants;<ref name=\\"chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-10/25/content_385531.htm\\"></ref> with similar events for men or boys being called by other names and more likely to be bodybuilding contests. - Louis Prima (December 7, 1910 August 24, 1978) was an Italian-American singer, actor, songwriter, bandleader, and trumpeter. While rooted in New Orleans jazz, swing music, and jump blues, Prima touched on various genres throughout his career: he formed a seven-piece New Orleans-style jazz band in the late 1920s, fronted a swing combo in the 1930s and a big band group in the 1940s, helped to popularize jump blues in the late 1940s and early to mid 1950s, and performed as a Vegas lounge act in the late 1950s and 1960s. - A big band is a type of musical ensemble associated with playing jazz music and which became popular during the Swing Era from the early 1930s until the late 1940s. Big Bands evolved with the times and continue to today. A big band typically consists of approximately 12 to 25 musicians and contains saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. The terms jazz band, jazz ensemble, stage band, jazz orchestra, and dance band are also used to refer to this type of ensemble. This does not, however, mean that each one of these names is technically correct for naming a \\"big band\\" specifically. - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - Top 40 is a music industry shorthand for the currently most-popular songs in a particular genre. When used without qualification it refers to the best-selling or most frequently broadcast popular music. The term is derived from record music charts, a few of which traditionally consist of a total of 40 songs. Top 40 is also an alternative term for the radio format of such music, also known as Contemporary hit radio. - \`\` Wonderland by Night '' is a popular song by Bert Kaempfert that was a Billboard number one hit for three weeks , starting January 9 , 1961 .

The original version of \`\` Wonderland by Night '' also crossed over to the R&B chart where it peaked at number five . Another cover , recorded and released by Louis Prima , also charted in the same year , reaching # 15 on the Billboard charts . Anita Bryant 's version reached # 18 on the US Pop Chart . Engelbert Humperdinck also recorded a vocal version of the song in his 1968 album A Man Without Love . - Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of American music that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophone and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a \\"lilting\\" swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \\"to swing\\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman, and Artie Shaw. - \\"Moon Over Naples\\" is a 1965 instrumental composed and originally performed by German bandleader Bert Kaempfert and was the first track on his album, \\"The Magic Music of Far Away Places\\" for Decca Records. - Berthold Heinrich Kämpfert, (16 October 1923 21 June 1980), better known as Bert Kaempfert, was a German orchestra leader, music producer, and songwriter. He made easy listening and jazz-oriented records and wrote the music for a number of well-known songs, including \\"Strangers in the Night\\" and \\"Moon Over Naples\\". - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" / ; or transliterated from English as (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States. Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. - Easy listening is a popular music genre and radio format that was most popular during the 1950s to 1970s. It is related to middle-of-the-road (MOR) music and encompasses instrumental recordings of standards, hit songs and popular non-rock vocals. It was differentiated from the mostly instrumental beautiful music format by its variety of styles, including a percentage of vocals, arrangements and tempos to fit various day parts during the broadcast day. - \\"Strangers in the Night\\" is a popular song credited to Bert Kaempfert with English lyrics by Charles Singleton and Eddie Snyder. Kaempfert originally used it under the title \\"Beddy Bye\\" as part of the instrumental score for the movie \\"A Man Could Get Killed.\\" The song was made famous in 1966 by Frank Sinatra, although it was initially given to Melina Mercouri, who thought that a man's vocals would suit more to the melody and therefore declined to sing it. - A Brand Ambassador (sometimes also called a Corporate Ambassador) is a person who is hired by an organization or company to represent a brand in a positive light and by doing so help to increase brand awareness and sales. The brand ambassador is meant to embody the corporate identity in appearance, demeanor, values and ethics. The key element of brand ambassadors is their ability to use promotional strategies that will strengthen the customer-product-service relationship and influence a large audience to buy and consume more. Predominantly, a brand ambassador is known as a positive spokesperson, an opinion leader or a community influencer, appointed as an internal or external agent to boost product or service sales and create brand awareness. Today, \\"brand ambassador\\" as a term has expanded beyond celebrity branding to self-branding or personal brand management.

The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Riki Michele (born Michele Bunch, currently Michele Palmer) is a female Christian alternative music artist.

A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - The 77s (alternatively spelled The Seventy Sevens or The 77's) are an American rock band consisting of Michael Roe on vocals/guitar, Mark Harmon on bass and Bruce Spencer on drums. - Jeffrey Lynne (born 30 December 1947) is an English songwriter, composer, arranger, singer, multi-instrumentalist and record producer who gained fame in the 1970s as the lead singer and sole constant member of Electric Light Orchestra.

The text in Finnish highlights the importance of a country's commitment to implementing a range of civil and human rights reforms before becoming a member of the Union. These reforms should address various aspects of social justice, liberties, and equality for the citizens within the country. Among the crucial reforms mentioned are freedom of religion and women's rights. Freedom of religion entails the right for individuals to practice and express their religious beliefs freely without facing discrimination or persecution. It also includes the right not to practice any religion and to change one’s religious beliefs without any repercussions. In order to ensure that a country respects the diversity of its citizens, it must implement laws, policies, and social practices that promote religious tolerance and understanding. In addition to freedom of religion, women's rights and gender equality play a significant role in determining a country's readiness to join the Union. Women's rights encompass a broad range of issues, such as political representation, education, employment, healthcare, and the right to make choices regarding their bodies, including reproductive rights. It also involves addressing gender-based violence and establishing equal opportunities and pay in the workforce. A country seeking membership in the Union must demonstrate a strong commitment to enacting progressive legislation, implementing supportive policies, and fostering a culture that values and respects the rights and dignity of all its citizens, regardless of their gender, religion, or other unique attributes. Moreover, institutions and mechanisms that monitor and promote those rights should be put in place to ensure continued compliance with Union standards. In conclusion, before a country can join the Union, it must undergo a series of reforms that focus on upholding civil and human rights, including freedom of religion and women's rights.

Of course you can but you won't be able to understand them! We interviewed a biologist and asked her what research on dolphin communication has shown. This is what she told us. Just like dogs, cats and other mammals, dolphins communicate by using sound, vision , touch and taste. Each dolphin has its own signature whistle to identify itself and to call others. Dolphins don't have the ability to smell, but their hearing and eyesight are excellent. We also asked Jane if dolphins have got their own language. She told us that they have and that dolphins started talking to each other from birth. They make different sounds, including whistles, squeaks and click. Sometimes they even sound like a heavy metal band! We then asked Jane if any interesting experiments have been done. She told us that a very interesting experiment had been done with a mother dolphin and her two-year-old baby in an aquarium. They talked to each other over the telephone! The two dolphins were in separate tanks which were connected by a special under water system.

A secret stash of wine, lodged inside the bow of the wreck of the Mary Celestia, which lies immediately offshore from the Fairmont Southampton Resort, has emerged from the sand and silt which had shrouded it since the ship struck the reef and sank on September 6, 1864. Five bottles of wine, still packed inside a wooden crate, remained corked with their liquid contents intact after 147 years underwater. Photo below: Excavation slowly reveals sealed wine bottles inside an intact wooden crate buried inside the bow of the Mary Celestia. The top of the crate emerged from the sand inside the bow after a series of winter storms swept over the site in January 2011. Dr. Philippe Rouja, Bermuda’s Custodian of Historic Wrecks, secured the bow of the wreck after recovering a loose bottle of wine, also still corked, and immediately reached out to colleagues at NOAA and the Waitt Foundation in order to create an expert team with experience in marine heritage management and the excavation of shipwrecks of this period to explore and potentially rescue this unique find. The Bermuda Government has been working with these eminent institutions since 2009 in the formation of the Sargasso Sea Alliance – an Alliance dedicated to enhancing protection of the Sargasso Sea in which the islands of Bermuda lie. The Waitt Foundation has underwritten the displacement costs of the initiative for all foreign partners as well as sending Dr. Dominique Rissolo, an archaeologist and executive director of the Waitt Institute, along with Joe Lepore, the Waitt Institute’s chief diver and head of ship operations, to aid in the exploration and recovery of the contents of Mary Celestia’s bow. Photo below: Archaeologist James Delgado takes notes inside the bow of the Mary Celestia while excavating a sunken cargo of wine lost when the ship sank after hitting the reef. Archaeologist Dr. James Delgado, the director of the Maritime Heritage Program in the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries of the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, joined by two NOAA team members, Tane Casserley and Wayne Lusardi, joined the rest of the team this past week to co-direct the project with Drs. Rouja and Rissolo. Carefully removing all of the sand and silt from inside the broken but still intact bow of the wrecked blockade runner, the team exposed the wooden crate, intact wooden paneling and shelves, and a corroded metal wash basin rusted fast to the inside of the hull. As Dr. Delgado gently removed the silt from the crate with Dr. Rouja, the tops of the bottles inside slowly emerged with their corks still in place. “The promise of the one bottle found this past January was realized in that moment,” said Dr. Rouja. “To reveal even more of this lost cargo standing lined up in their wooden crate as if they were waiting for their owner to return is a great reminder of how archaeology adds excitement and value to our shared historical narratives. Mary Celestia is a wreck with historical significance to the United Kingdom, where she was built, Bermuda, where she operated out of and where she wrecked, and the United States, where she ran to as a blockade runner during the U.S. Civil War. For the NOAA team, Mary Celestia had special importance. The joint heritage represented by this wreck is a direct link to NOAA’s Monitor National Marine Sanctuary in North Carolina and NOAA’s work to document and better understand and share the stories of the shipwrecks near the wreck of Monitor that speak to the Civil War, World War II, and the shipping that for centuries has been linked to this section of coast, an area known as the “Graveyard of the Atlantic.” Photo below: Archaeologist James Delgado at the bow of the blockade runner 1864 Mary Celestia. “The ocean is a vast repository of human history, some of it encompassed in marine protected areas and sanctuaries. Our team was pleased to join this project to help protect and interpret our joint heritage that links this protected shipwreck sites in Bermuda to Wilmington, North Carolina and our nearby sanctuary.” said Dr. Delgado. “After undergoing laboratory analysis and preservation treatment, the wine and our other finds will tell their story to Bermudians and the rest of the world thanks to modern science.” The excavation also yielded the remains of leather shoes, rope, a hairbrush and the wooden form for a shoe. After clearing the bow and documenting the fragile wooden structure inside this area of the ship, the team replaced the sand to preserve the wood inside the now empty compartment. The artifacts are in the conservation laboratory at the National Museum of Bermuda where the effort will shift to further study and preservation treatment. Photo below: The archaeological team works around the bow of the Mary Celestia as the interior is excavated: Derrick Burgess, Minister of Public Works said: “This project is very exciting from so many perspectives – from an archeological point of view, for our local marine heritage and for the compelling story of days long past that will no doubt be of interest to our residents and visitors alike. And for this project to take place during the anniversary of the American Civil War is gives the discovery all the more resonance.” This discovery in the bow of the Mary Celestia has yielded a long-lost secret in a box of wine stashed away from the ship’s cargo– a cargo at the time said to be nothing more than tinned meats. It compels researchers and scientists to take another look at the historical narrative surrounding one of Bermuda’s most iconic dive sites. Mary Celestia is a compelling reminder of how the shattered iron bones of a wreck ravaged by time and elements can still connect us to the people of events of long ago. Photo below: Dr Philippe Rouja and James Delgado excavate inside the bow of the Mary Celestia: “I wonder who left that crate in the bow,” commented Dr. Rissolo, “and why. “ That question may forever remain unanswered. But what is clear is that while Mary Celestia may have yielded one of her secrets, she retains others in the form of questions about what type of wine is inside the bottles and where it came from.

And now, finally, it can be,\\" Isabelle Ramsay-Brackstone of The Bermuda Perfumery said at the Tuesday night launch event in New York City, attended by actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, who has a residence on the island. The perfume, originally created in the 1800s, was being shipped on the iron-hulled steamship Mary Celestia, which was used during the American Civil War to get around the naval blockade imposed by then-U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. The sleek and fast-for-its-time steamship would travel between Bermuda and North Carolina carrying fancy clothes, shoes, perfumes and wines, meaning the perfume was likely bound for a wealthy woman in the American South. She never got it, however, as the ship hit a reef and sank while departing Bermuda on Sept. 6, 1864. For decades, the ship was one of the top diving attractions in Bermuda. Then, at the turn of this century, hurricanes stirred the waters and shifted the wreck. By 2011, marine archeologists found a perfume bottle that was previously hidden in its bow. Archeologist James Delgado was one of the first to find the bottle while on a dive. He described what he saw to the publication Archeology. \\"A small box, its lid gone, lay on its side on the deck inside the bow,\\" Delgado wrote. \\"Close to it, a small bottle emerged. It was sealed with a glass stopper and filled with a clear liquid.\\" Markings on the intact bottle indicate the perfume is from the now-defunct Piesse and Lubin perfume house in London. Perfumer G.W. Septimus Piesse wrote \\"The Art of Perfumery,\\" the first book on modern fragrance-making in 1857. \\"When we got the bottle (from Delgado and fellow diver and anthropologist Philippe Rouja) I wanted to open it in an environment that would allow us to find out exactly what the fragrance is,\\" Ramsay-Brackstone told CTVNews.ca on Wednesday. So she took it to drom perfumer Jean-Claude Delville at a lab in New Jersey. \\"In perfumery, opportunities like this don't come along too often,\\" said Delville in a statement. He conducted scientific analysis of the original perfume to recreate the new fragrance. \\"It was kind of a surprise,\\" Delville told CTVNews.ca about when he first opened the bottle. \\"When the fragrance has been sitting at the bottom of the ocean and aging for so many years you expect something that is oxidized or damaged. But my first impression was 'wow'.\\" Delville said the bottle was hand delivered and it took him a few hours just to take off the cap. Once the cap was off he was shocked by the fresh floral smell and the amount of citrus. He then took a small sample and put it into a chromatograph machine, which detected the exact chemical balance of the scent. From there, he rebuilt the scent. The new perfume contains scents of grapefruit, citrus, and rosewood. There are also soft notes of rose and orange flower. Delville said new one is more than an 80 per cent match to the original fragrance. The reason is distillation has much improved and some of the materials in the original were of animal origin, such as whale oil, which can't be used in modern-day fragrances. Delville said it was able to keep for 150 years because it was in the perfect conditions – away from light and in a cool place. \\"What we managed to do is capture in a bottle an emotion and a story that had disappeared,\\" he said. Only 1,864 bottles of the perfume will be sold to commemorate the year the ship sank. It will retail for 225 and some of the proceeds will go toward preserving Bermuda's shipwreck heritage. It will be available for purchase online at LiliBermuda.com and also at the boutiques on Oct. 1 but the pre-order process is already underway. The original bottle, which is \\"on loan\\" to the Bermuda Perfurmery for research purposes, is considered the property of the people of Bermuda. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In 2011, archaeologists discovered a stash of wine and other items in the wreck of the Mary Celestia, an American Civil War blockade runner, off the coast of Bermuda. The ship sank on September 6, 1864, and the five bottles of wine, still in a wooden crate, were found with their contents intact after being submerged for 147 years. After a series of winter storms in 2011, the top of the crate emerged from the sand inside the bow. An international team of experts led by Dr. Philippe Rouja, Bermuda’s Custodian of Historic Wrecks, investigated the site and recovered the wine and other artefacts. The excavation also found leather shoes, a hairbrush, a wooden form for a shoe, and the remains of rope. The artifacts are in the conservation laboratory at the National Museum of Bermuda for further study and preservation treatment."},{"instruction":"Getting away for a short time always seems like a great idea--until you have to pack. The rule is: pack light. Here are some tips to help you pack. Organize Yourself Make a list. Think of what you need from your head to your toes. When you've done this once, it'll be easier next time. Start Small Consider buying small-size samples of shampoo, toothpaste, and other items at your local store. Make sure they are all sealed tightly. In an emergency, you can purchase them at your destination. But remember that the time you spend buying things at your destination will reduce your visiting time. The Clothing Dilemma Choosing which clothes to bring is probably the hardest packing decision to make. Think once again from head to toe -- hat, shirts, jeans, sneakers, etc. Once you've picked out what you want to bring, think carefully. Do you really need that extra pair of jeans? If so, fine. Don't try to fool yourself. You are the one who will be left holding the bag. Weather is an important factor in your packing. If it's cold, you could wear a jacket, a sweater, a regular shirt, and a T-shirt. Layering up will keep you warm and it will leave more room in your bag. Roll up your casual clothes instead of folding and laying them flat. This leaves more room to pack other things, and keeps your clothes fairly wrinkle-free.

On the recording, it is left ambiguous as to whether the main character commits suicide in the end. In the film, she does. Thus, \\"Made Again\\", which concludes the story on the record as a happy ending of sorts, is not included. On the back of the cover of the videocassette, the description reads as follows: Brave.. The Movie is a fifty-minute concept film directed by cult movie director Richard Stanley. It is Stanley's stark vision of a young life in the 90's inspired by Marillion's album of the same name, which centres around a teenage girl who is found wandering in a state of amnesia on the Severn Bridge, and her consequent search for her past.

The film revolves around a young girl who is found wandering in a state of amnesia on the Severn Bridge, and her subsequent search for her past. By incorporating the location of the Severn Bridge and the word \\"Brave\\" from the associated Marillion album, the title creates a clear connection between the music and the film. Additionally, the subtitle \\"A Brave Descent\\" alludes to the darker turn the plot takes towards the end, where the main character ultimately commits suicide. Overall, this title encapsulates the emotional weight and the mystery that pervades the young girl's journey while maintaining a connection to the source material that inspired it.

While social media offers several benefits such as connecting with friends, sharing experiences, and receiving real-time news, it has also been widely criticized for its potential negative impacts on people's mental health.

Megan made an easily digestible meal. Unlike before, Megan had started experiencing serious digestive issues recently. The constant abdominal pain, bloating, and irregular bowel movements were making her life miserable. It was hard for her to focus on anything else due to the unbearable pain and discomfort. Seeing her plight, Laura had stepped in, determined to help Megan out of her misery. Laura was known for her extensive knowledge in the field of nutrition. She had spent several years researching and studying the human digestive system, food science, and nutrition. She understood how certain foods could be either harmful or beneficial for the gut and overall health of an individual and was thus the right person to help Megan navigate through these tough times. Laura started by evaluating Megan's diet to identify potential triggers for her digestive problems. She asked Megan to keep a food diary, noting down everything she ate or drank each day, including the time and quantity. She also asked her to record any symptoms she experienced after eating certain foods or meals. This diary would help Laura identify the patterns that might be contributing to Megan's digestive issues. After a week, Laura studied Megan's food diary and found several digestive issue triggers. She noticed that Megan often had fast food, sugary drinks, and processed foods, all of which are harmful to the digestive system. Laura explained to Megan that these foods lack dietary fiber, which is essential for maintaining a healthy digestive system. Also, they are high in fats and sugars which can create an imbalance in the gut flora, leading to various digestive problems. Realizing the adverse effects of her food habits, Megan agreed to follow Laura's advice and decided to change her diet. Laura outlined a meal plan for her designed to alleviate her digestive issues. The plan included an easily digestible and balanced diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.

In the beginning, it was hard for her to adjust to the new eating habits. But the thought of getting rid of the constant pain motivated her to stick to the diet plan. Megan started making her meals according to the plan created by Laura. Every meal was easily digestible, nutrient-dense, low in fats and sugars, and high in dietary fiber. Gradually, with these changes, Megan started to notice a difference. The frequency and intensity of her abdominal pain started to reduce. She no longer felt bloated all the time. The irregular bowel movements also started becoming regular. Seeing the improvement, she felt thankful for Laura's guidance and help. In conclusion, Megan's commitment to the diet plan outlined by Laura turned her health around. With an easily digestible meal, Megan started to feel better, proving that diet plays a significant role in managing digestive issues. Laura's knowledge and Megan's determination helped overcome the problem that once seemed almost insurmountable. By working with Laura and making intentional changes to her diet, Megan was able to restore her gut health and found relief from her digestive issues."},{"instruction":"I am writing this from the perspective of being a photographer. This is the first time that I have been to the Preserve after reading, and hearing so much about it. I found it to be quite disappointing. The issues with the Preserve, again, only from a bird spotting, and photography standpoint are many. 1. The area is completely overgrown. It has limited the view of all of the ponds and removed the vast majority of quality shooting locations. Beyond that, walking along the paths is ridiculous. I was walking along ponds, I should have been able to see, completely obstructed by shrubs and trees. To define a quality shooting location; an area one can sit in, with a 180 degree view of the pond or the subject in front of the person. There were trees that had 1/3 of its trunk covered in debris. I sat and watched birds, rats, and rabbits emerge from the debris. This overgrowth is both unsightly, and a fire hazard. 2. The majority of the benches and blinds have been rendered unusable. Again, it comes down to the area being overgrown. I walked past several benches that were placed on the edge of the pond, yet a view of dense shrubbery was presented. The blinds in the special use areas are shrouded and covered. What's the point of having a permit to use an area that has no unobstructed view? 3. Varmints. There are rabbits EVERYWHERE. Yes, they're cute, but rabbits bring rats, and there were a ton of those too. This is a disease outbreak waiting for a place to happen. I went today looking for Burrowing Owls. All gone. Why? Cats. Feral cats have preyed on all of the Burrowing Owls, and they have been removed. 4. The ponds are inconsistently watered. This has made the birds leave for other locations. I am incredibly displeased that I went today. I can go to a golf course and see the same birds with far less hassle, and can get great shots. It's unfortunate that the staff of this preserve isn't committed to making this a pristine bird area. Choose: was this review given positively or negatively? Pick your answer from: + negative + positive","output":"- negative The review is negative because the photographer describes multiple problems they experienced at the Preserve, such as overgrown areas, unusable benches and blinds, varmints, and inconsistent watering of the ponds.

It is located in the City of San Fernando in the San Fernando Valley region of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The school is named after César Chávez to honor his contributions to the civil rights movement and his work advocating for fair wages and working conditions for farmworkers. The process of naming a school after an individual typically occurs after their death, as a way to commemorate and memorialize their contributions to society. In the case of the César E. Chávez Learning Academies, the school was named after Chávez's death to celebrate his enduring legacy as a champion for social justice, equal rights, and the improvement of conditions for disadvantaged communities. Moreover, the school's mission and programs reflect Chávez's values and vision. The César E. Chávez Learning Academies maintains a focus on providing a quality education to its diverse student population that is centered on principles of social justice, community engagement, and personal empowerment, which align with many of the ideals championed by Chávez throughout his life. Given that Chávez passed away in 1993 and the likelihood that the process of naming a school after an individual would typically occur posthumously, it is reasonable to infer that the César E. Chávez Learning Academies was named after his death.

Allen jumps into the water, even though he cannot swim. He grasps the hands of a girl who is inexplicably under the water with him and an instant connection forms between the two. Allen can now breathe under water as he is in the hands of a mermaid. However, Allen is pulled to the surface by the deck hands and the two are separated, though apparently no one else sees the girl. After the ferry moves off, Allen looks back at the girl, who dives underwater showing her mermaid's tail. Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination, but his bond with the mermaid proves so strong that his subsequent relationships with women fail as he seeks the connection he felt with the mermaid. Years later, Allen (Tom Hanks) is a co-owner of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City with his womanizing older brother Freddie (John Candy).

This logo symbolizes the character Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers), a powerful superhero who plays a crucial role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. By including this post-credits scene, \\"Avengers: Infinity War\\" effectively sets the stage for the events that transpire in \\"Captain Marvel\\" and \\"Avengers: Endgame.\\" By introducing Captain Marvel's insignia, the segment teases her involvement in the upcoming cinematic events and raises anticipation for her solo film, which was released between \\"Infinity War\\" and \\"Endgame.\\" Additionally, the scene also foreshadows Nick Fury's eventual return in \\"Avengers: Endgame\\" and the subsequent revival of the disintegrated characters. In summary, the scene at the end of \\"Avengers: Infinity War\\" stays true to the provided text. It not only delivers a powerful emotional impact but also plays an essential role in connecting various films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe."},{"instruction":"Generate a positive review for a place.","output":"Title: A Heavenly Retreat at The Enchanted Oasis As a seasoned traveler always seeking new experiences and unforgettable destinations, I was left in absolute awe of the Enchanted Oasis.

Here are possible answers to this question: - happiness for - new laws - protest - change in leadership - cultural revolution I believe the correct choice is \\"cultural revolution\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"A coup-de-etat, which is a sudden and often violent overthrow of a government by a smaller group within the state, generally occurs with the intent of achieving specific objectives, including changes in society. While all the mentioned options – happiness for, new laws, protest, change in leadership, and cultural revolution – might be part of the overall objectives, it is important to look at each option in depth in order to determine which option best resonates with the essence of a coup-de-etat aiming to change society. 1. Happiness for: Although happiness may be an ultimate objective in the broader sense, it is too vague to be the principal aim of a coup-de-etat. The idea of happiness may differ significantly among the individuals involved, and it does not provide a concrete agenda for change. 2. New laws: While the introduction of new laws can be a significant part of a coup-de-etat's objective, focusing solely on this aspect might be shortsighted. Legal changes are essential, but they may not sufficiently address deeper societal issues that require transformation. 3. Protest: Although protest can lead to societal change, it is generally not the main goal of a coup-de-etat. Protests typically occur as a tool to express dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, rather than being an end in themselves. 4. Change in leadership: A coup-de-etat, by its very nature, brings about a change in leadership. While this change can set the stage for societal transformation, it is not the sole factor in ensuring meaningful alterations to society. 5. Cultural revolution: The term \\"cultural revolution\\" refers to a comprehensive and transformational change in a society's values, norms, practices, and beliefs. With this definition in mind, it seems clear that a cultural revolution best aligns with the concept of a coup-de-etat intending to change society. By initiating a profound shift in societal behavior and thought, adherents of the coup can alter the very fabric of the state they wish to control. In summary, a cultural revolution is the most appropriate answer because it encompasses a wide range of changes that can lead to deep and lasting societal transformation. While new laws, protest, and leadership change are important aspects of a coup-de-etat, they are insufficient on their own to effect the desired level of societal change. A cultural revolution, on the other hand, possesses the potential to address and reshape the core values and beliefs holding the society together, leading to a more comprehensive and profound transformation."},{"instruction":"Doamnelor şi domnilor, în încheiere, consider că aceştia au glumit suficient pe seama noastră.

Do they have the same meaning?","output":"Yes, both sentences convey the same meaning with slightly different sentence structures. They both communicate that Mohcine Douali, a resident of the central part of Algiers, experienced a significant shock or surprise. The primary difference between the two sentences lies in the way they are constructed, but they still provide the same information. In the first sentence, Mohcine Douali is introduced as living in the center of Algiers, which provides the reader with context before sharing his quote. The quote from Mohcine Douali - \\"It was a great shock\\" - is then presented at the end of the sentence. This structure can be useful when aiming to emphasize the context or background information before presenting the quote. On the other hand, the second sentence puts Mohcine Douali's quote first - \\"It was a great shock\\" - and then provides the context and background information. This sentence structure places the focus on Mohcine Douali's reaction and personal experience, which can be helpful when highlighting the emotional impact for the reader. Despite the differences in structure, both sentences effectively communicate the same content. They describe Mohcine Douali's experience living in central Algiers and his reaction to an event, which was a great shock for him.

Remy exerted every idea she had. Given the question \\"What will Remy want to do next?\\", is \\"quit the job\\" a valid answer? Possible answers: (i) Yes (ii) No","output":"A valid answer to the question \\"What will Remy want to do next?\\" depends on a variety of factors. While \\"quit the job\\" might be a possible outcome, it is important to examine the context and understand the circumstances that led to this situation. To determine if this answer is valid, we must delve deeper into Remy's motivation, her work ethics, and her plans for the future. (i) Yes: In some scenarios, \\"quit the job\\" could be a valid answer. The following circumstances might contribute to Remy considering this option: 1. Burnout: If Remy has poured all her energy and resources into generating ideas for the project without any success, she may be feeling overworked and emotionally exhausted. Burnout is a common issue in the workplace, and it can lead to lower motivation and performance. 2. Lack of appreciation: Should Remy feel that her efforts are unappreciated, and her contributions undervalued, her frustration may push her to the point of considering quitting her job. 3. Unsatisfactory work environment: If Remy's workplace environment is not conducive to her creativity and well-being, she may feel that leaving the job is the best solution. Factors such as a lack of recognition, insufficient support from supervisors, or conflicts with coworkers could contribute to this decision. 4. Personal plans: Remy may have other life plans that are not compatible with her current job. If she has been contemplating a career change, pursuing higher education, or starting a family, quitting her job may be a valid option for her. (ii) No: It is also possible that \\"quit the job\\" is not a valid answer in Remy's case. Here are a few reasons why: 1. Commitment to the company: Remy may be dedicated to the company's mission and vision, and quitting the job just because she ran out of ideas for a project might seem unreasonable to her. She might be determined to face any challenges head-on and find a solution. 2. Learning opportunity: Remy could see this as an opportunity to grow and develop her skills further. In this scenario, rather than quitting her job, Remy might seek additional resources or support to help her come up with new ideas, such as collaborating with colleagues, attending workshops, or seeking advice from mentors. 3. Tenacity: Some individuals possess a high level of determination and persistence, and Remy could very well be one of them. She might not see quitting her job as a viable option, instead choosing to push through any obstacles and find a way to overcome her creative block. Ultimately, whether \\"quit the job\\" is a valid answer or not depends on Remy's individual circumstances, her personality traits, her attitude towards work, and the specifics of her work environment. It is important to analyze all these aspects before reaching a conclusion about what Remy might want to do next."},{"instruction":"despite dire predictions of skyrocketing unemployment , joblessness in russia is only gradually increasing , a top labor official said thursday .

In an attempt to find out where the Germans plan to strike, Colonel Semenov (George Macready) has a small paratrooper unit dropped behind enemy lines to attack a divisional headquarters and hopefully take an officer prisoner for interrogation. The local partisans, led by the wily Kostyuk (Roman Bohnen), provide a guide, Lisa Elenko (Marguerite Chapman). The attack succeeds at first. Alexei Kulkov (Paul Muni), one of the paratroopers, takes seven Germans prisoner in the basement. Then, just as Elenko brings him a message, German artillery hits the building, causing it to collapse and trap them in the spacious cellar. Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out. Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a pistol and a monocle he has found. He begins questioning the men one by one, but while he rules out ex-miner Stillman (Rudolph Anders) and a former magician (Philip Van Zandt), he cannot pinpoint his man.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower.

Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to specific functions. Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions, such as cilia, when present, are on the apical surface. Cilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in unison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it helps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that sweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator because it continuously pushes mucous with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous blanket down towards your throat. In both cases, the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the acidic environment of your stomach. Q: What cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between their basal and apical surfaces? Choices: - mast cells - nerve cells - connective tissue - epithelial cells A: The answer to this question is:","output":"epithelial cells. These cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins between their basal and apical surfaces. This polarized distribution allows epithelial cells to perform specialized functions, such as forming barriers and transporting substances across the cell layers.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no. Teacher: Let's think:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze both sentences and compare their similarities and differences. 1. Sentence 1: \\"A professional glass maker firing a piece in a gigantic oven.\\" This sentence tells us that the subject is a professional glass maker. They are performing the action of firing a piece (likely a glass piece) in a gigantic oven. However, it does not mention any information about the purpose of the piece or who it is for. 2. Sentence 2: \\"Artist making a custom piece for a customer.\\" This sentence tells us that the subject is an artist, which can encompass a wide range of professions, including, for example, painters, sculptors, and glass makers. This artist is in the process of creating a custom piece for a specific customer. Now, let's discuss the similarities and differences between the two sentences. Firstly, both involve an individual involved in the act of creating a piece. However, the first sentence specifies that the person is a professional glass maker, whereas the second sentence only says the person is an artist. Secondly, the second sentence explicitly mentions that the piece is custom and for a customer, while the first sentence does not provide this information.

Step 1: Read the sentence The sentence is: \\"It's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are.\\" Step 2: Identify the focus of the statement In this case, the fact that it's challenging to recognize other actors in the movie. Step 3: Analyze the tone The phrase \\"difficult to tell\\" implies that the reviewer is finding it challenging to identify or notice the other actors in the movie. Step 4: Determine the sentiment Although the given sentence doesn't directly express a positive or negative sentiment, we can infer that it leans more towards negative since it suggests that the movie doesn't make it easy for the viewer to recognize the other actors' contributions. Conclusion: Based on the preceding movie review sentence, it is more likely that the movie was seen negatively, although more context from the review would be helpful to confirm this."},{"instruction":"Pick from: 1). sheep 2). salmon 3). grasses 4). bats 5). animals 6). shrubs 7). humans 8). trees Fact 1: Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. Fact 2: Cows and sheep are examples of primary consumers. Given the two facts above, what can feed at more than one trophic level? Answer:","output":"Given Fact 1 and Fact 2, we can deduce the following: Step 1: Identify the trophic levels mentioned in Facts 1 and 2. Fact 1 states that many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. In Fact 2, cows and sheep are mentioned as primary consumers, indicating they belong to trophic level 2. Step 2: Cross-reference the provided list with the information from Facts 1 and 2. From the list, we can eliminate sheep and other primary consumers because they belong to a specific trophic level. Step 3: Analyze the remaining options in the list (salmon, grasses, bats, animals, shrubs, humans, and trees). The organisms that have the potential to feed at more than one trophic level are: - Salmon: These fish can be omnivores, feeding on plants and other organisms, such as insects and smaller fish. - Bats: Some bats are insectivores, while others feed on fruits or have a mixed diet. Therefore, they can consume resources from different trophic levels. - Humans: As omnivores, humans consume a variety of food sources, including plants, animals, and processed foods. This allows them to feed at multiple trophic levels. Taking into account the provided facts and analyzing the list, the answer is that salmon, bats, and humans can feed at more than one trophic level."},{"instruction":"Select the correct answer: Which is an appropriate title for this article?

Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","output":"The sentiment embodied by this tweet can be described as a mix of physical need, surprise, and mildly humorous exaggeration. The person composing the tweet is likely experiencing an intense thirst, as indicated by their consumption of a substantial amount – 2 liters – of water. Despite the large quantity, they continue to feel thirsty and, to emphasize their point, employ humor by saying they want more, even after drinking such a copious volume. There could be several factors contributing to this thirst sensation. It could be attributed to a hot or dry environment, engagement in physical activity, or perhaps the individual's body is trying to balance their electrolyte levels. It's also possible that the person is affected by a medical condition causing excessive thirst, such as diabetes. Nevertheless, the tone of the tweet seems light-hearted, suggesting that the person may not be too concerned about the reason behind their thirst. The use of an informal tone and colloquial language like \\"I'm so thirsty\\" and \\"I still want more!\\" implies that this tweet is intended to engage and entertain the person's social media audience, rather than to express a serious concern. In summary, this tweet embodies a sentiment that combines physical need for hydration with a touch of light-hearted humor and exaggeration. The intention is presumably to amuse and connect with the person's social media followers while simultaneously sharing a personal experience of intense thirst."},{"instruction":"I came here the other day for an early dinner with my daughter, who heard about this place from Bread and Butter.

Reggie Answer:","output":"Title: Death Valley Drifter Genre: Action-Adventure, Mystery, Thriller Plot: Reggie Thompson, a weathered and enigmatic drifter with a mysterious past, arrives at Death Valley in search of redemption and closure. Reggie is a man who, following multiple tragic events in his life, made a living staying under the radar and moving from town to town doing odd jobs. He's a skilled mechanic with a hidden talent for reading people's cues and decoding criminal secrets. His arrival at Death Valley is far from accidental – it's the final destination of a long journey that has led him to this desolate, yet visually stunning region. As Reggie lays low at a local bar and motel, he meets a cast of eccentric but seemingly innocent characters. There's Molly, the kind-heartened waitress with a heart of gold who finds solace in the wild isolation of Death Valley; Jack, the rough-around-the-edges but intelligent motel owner who keeps to himself but has impressive knowledge about the region; and finally, a group of geological scientists led by the enigmatic and distant Dr. Russell Sinclair, who are conducting research on the region's unique rock formations. Soon Reggie learns about a series of unexplained disappearances and sinister occurrences plaguing the community, which the locals blame on the eerily beautiful landscape. As he gets pulled into the mystery, Reggie can't help but be intrigued when he finds strange clues leading to a long-forgotten legend – a treasure hidden deep within the valley, guarded by something dark and menacing. He starts to believe that the treasure might actually be real and connected to his past, possibly holding the key to unlocking his nightmares. Reggie's investigations draw the attention of other players – desperate treasure hunters, rogue agents, and a corrupt sheriff with dangerous intentions. They all converge at Death Valley, forming uneasy alliances and leaving a trail of deceit, danger, and chaos in their wake. As Reggie digs deeper, he unravels a complex web of criminal connections leading back decades, all somehow related to the hidden treasure of Death Valley and the shadowy figure at the center of it all. As ghostly apparitions and menacing encounters with enigmatic individuals terrorize him, Reggie is forced to face his own fears and insecurities, confronting his past and seeking redemption. Reggie coincidentally finds an ally in Dr. Sinclair, who ends up being more than what meets the eye. Along with Molly, whose true purpose in Death Valley is only revealed in a shocking twist, they face betrayals, hidden agendas, and deadly traps in their pursuit of the truth. In the thrilling climax, Reggie, Molly, and Dr. Sinclair fight their way through a treacherous labyrinth of caves beneath Death Valley, uncovering the mysterious treasure and unmasking the mastermind orchestrating the chaos. Through relentless determination and a fierce personal quest for salvation, Reggie eventually discovers the truth about his family's secretive past and why the treasure has haunted him his entire life.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The process of fossil formation is indeed detailed and intricate, including several phases such as burial, decomposition, and mineralization. Perturbation, in this context, refers to a disturbance or change in environmental conditions. To analyze the effect of a flood plain on fossil formation, let's review the individual steps in detail. 1. Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud: The death of the organisms in a flood plain could occur due to various factors, including sudden water surges, drowning, or being trapped in the sediment. 2. Sediment builds up over the remains: Sedimentation usually happens at a faster pace in a flood plain compared to normal conditions. This is because floodwaters can carry a huge amount of sediments, ultimately depositing them on the flood plain during the flood event. 3. The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts: Decomposition occurs due to microorganisms breaking down the dead organisms. This step might not be largely affected by flood events, but excessively wet or muddy conditions may alternately impede or promote the activity of decomposers. 4. The remaining parts over the years are replaced with minerals: As water percolates through the sediments, it carries minerals such as silica, calcium carbonate, and iron. These minerals gradually precipitate and replace the original skeletal material. This process, known as mineralization or permineralization, occurs over time and may not be significantly impacted by flood events. 5. A fossil is formed: After all these processes, what remains are the fossils, which are then discovered in the sediment layers. Now, considering the perturbation hypothesis, suppose a flood event occurs on a floodplain, potentially affecting animals and plants being trapped in the sediments: 1. It's true that during a flood event, less dead organisms might sink to the bottom of the flooded area as they could be dispersed by rapid water currents. This could lead to fewer animals being buried in sediments and hence fewer fossils. 2. However, at the same time, a flood event could also rapidly bury animals and plants under a thick layer of sediment. This might increase the chances of creating fossils, as the burial would occur quickly and be deep enough to protect them from scavengers and environmental factors. Therefore, the effect of a flood event on the process of fossil formation may be complex. Flood events can both increase and decrease the likelihood of animals being buried in sediments and eventually becoming fossils. The specific impact of the flood would depend on the scale of the event itself, geological conditions, and other environmental factors."},{"instruction":"How do you say \\"How often does the fault occur?Always\\" in Spanish?","output":"In Spanish, you can say \\"How often does the fault occur?

McHugh, 17, was northbound on his way to meet friends when the silver car in front of him turned off the road, went into a ditch and jolted to a stop on the tracks. McHugh jumped out of his vehicle and went to help. The driver, a woman who police say had fallen asleep, was behind the wheel and dazed. Her two daughters aged 7 and 10, were in the back seat, buckled in. McHugh took the woman's hand and helped her from the car. She unbuckled the kids. Another driver who had pulled over to help shouted that a train was coming, McHugh recalled. Police said the other man ran along the tracks and tried to wave down the train. It was dark and there was a bend in the tracks. The train operator probably never saw him. McHugh said the driver applied the brakes, but the train was still going fast when it came up on them. The woman, her daughters and McHugh took shelter behind his truck as the train smashed into their car, dragging it down the tracks, the teenager said. The woman's car was destroyed. Officials said the train was damaged. But none of the crew and four passengers were injured.

However, the model also suggests that some areas, specifically within the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, could experience cooling instead of warming. This cooling occurs because of changes in ocean circulation, which in turn leads to a reduction in the overall effect of sea ice feedback on a global scale. Sea ice feedback is a process in which melting ice leads to more open water, which absorbs more sunlight and often contributes to further warming and the melting of even more ice. This reinforces the warming effect on the Earth's climate system. In conclusion, the GISS coupled model underlines the complexity of climate change and highlights the importance of taking into account the interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans when trying to predict future climate scenarios. The model's prediction of a 1.4°C global warming when CO2 levels double indicates the potential consequences of ongoing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, the model emphasizes that regional variations, such as cooling in parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, could occur due to changes in ocean circulation and their effect on sea ice feedback, ultimately impacting the overall climate sensitivity."},{"instruction":"Trivia question: What island group may be described as a triangle with its corners at Hawaii, New Zealand and Easter Island, including the island groups Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands, Tuvalu, Tokelau, and Niue?

They were fast, yacht-like vessels, with three masts and a square rig. They were generally narrow for their length, could carry limited bulk freight, small by later 19th century standards, and had a large total sail area. Clipper ships were mostly constructed in British and American shipyards, though France, Brazil, the Netherlands and other nations also produced some. Clippers sailed all over the world, primarily on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and its colonies in the east, in trans-Atlantic trade, and the New York-to-San Francisco route round Cape Horn during the California Gold Rush. Dutch clippers were built beginning in the 1850s for the tea trade and passenger service to Java. - Pan American World Airways, known from its founding until 1950 as Pan American Airways and commonly known as Pan Am, was the principal and largest international air carrier in the United States from 1927 until its collapse on December 4, 1991.

One of the following sentences is nonsensical. Which one is it? Options: - Sentence A: \\"I ate two thousand bowls of rice yesterday\\" - Sentence B: \\"I ate two bowls of rice yesterday\\"","output":"To determine which sentence is nonsensical, we must analyze the content of each sentence and see if it is logically impossible, incoherent, or highly unlikely. Sentence A: \\"I ate two thousand bowls of rice yesterday\\" Explanation: This sentence suggests that the person consumed an enormous amount of rice in one day. The average bowl of rice contains about one to two cups, depending on the size of the bowl and the person's appetite. Two thousand bowls would amount to somewhere between 2,000 to 4,000 cups of rice. This is an incredibly large quantity of food, which would be nearly impossible for a person to consume in a single day. Thus, this sentence can be considered nonsensical due to its improbable nature. Sentence B: \\"I ate two bowls of rice yesterday\\" Explanation: This sentence implies that the person had two bowls of rice during the day, which seems reasonable and plausible.

Which country lost fewer bodies of water to desertification? People in Iran used extensive grazing, fell most of their trees so they have lots of problems with desertification. Iraq took a more mindful approach to land use, they preserved native species, planted trees and didn't overgraze the land. Hint: Desertification is a type of land degradation in which a relatively dry area of land becomes a desert, typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife.[2] It is caused by a variety of factors, such as through climate change (particularly the current global warming)[3] and through the overexploitation of soil through human activity.[4] When deserts appear automatically over the natural course of a planet's life cycle, then it can be called a natural phenomenon; however, when deserts emerge due to the rampant and unchecked depletion of nutrients in soil that are essential for it to remain arable, then a virtual \\"soil death\\" can be spoken of,[5] which traces its cause back to human overexploitation. Desertification is a significant global ecological and environmental problem with far reaching consequences on socio-economic and political conditions.[6] A:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, Iraq lost fewer bodies of water to desertification compared to Iran. This is because Iraq took a more mindful approach to land use by preserving native species, planting trees, and avoiding overgrazing.

BAGHDAD -- An insurgency led by Al Qaeda affiliate Abu Musab al-Zarqawi has made the Iraqi capital its main battleground, perhaps in the hopes of swaying the outcome of US elections, a senior Western official said.","output":"This text refers to the situation in Baghdad, Iraq, during the mid-2000s when the city was facing an insurgency led by Al Qaeda affiliate Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The violence and conflict in Baghdad were mainly due to terrorist acts and engagements between insurgents and coalition forces. There are several key points to consider when discussing the nature of this insurgency and how it aimed to influence the outcome of US elections. First, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was a Jordanian-born terrorist and the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). In the early 2000s, he pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden and formed a group that would later evolve into the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, or ISIS). Zarqawi and his followers were responsible for many acts of terrorism and violence in Iraq, including suicide bombings, kidnappings, and beheadings. Second, the choice of Baghdad as the main battleground for the insurgency was strategic. As the capital city of Iraq, it was not only the center of power and governance but also a symbol of the newly-formed government and the US-led coalition's efforts to stabilize the country after the fall of Saddam Hussein. By launching attacks in Baghdad, Zarqawi's group was directly challenging the authority and legitimacy of the Iraqi government and the US-led coalition. Third, the reference to the US elections suggests that the violence in Baghdad and the broader insurgency were intended to influence American public opinion and political outcomes. A significant aspect of any counter-insurgency effort is the 'hearts and minds' campaign, which aims to win the support of the population by providing security, basic services, and a sense of normalcy. The more chaos and violence Zarqawi's group could create in Baghdad, the more it undermined the US-led efforts to stabilize Iraq, thus potentially eroding the American public's support for the continued military intervention. The intention behind targeting US elections could have been to sway public opinion in favor of candidates who advocated for withdrawing troops from Iraq or adopting a less interventionist approach to the Middle East. Ultimately, heightened insecurity, civilian casualties, and perceived failure to stabilize Iraq could have created an environment in which the American public might be more inclined to support candidates who questioned the merits of continuing the intervention. In conclusion, the situation in Baghdad during the mid-2000s was heavily influenced by the efforts of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his Al Qaeda affiliate group. Their insurgency targeted the Iraqi capital to destabilize the government, undermine the US-led coalition's efforts, and possibly influence the outcome of US elections. While the degree to which they succeeded in their goals may be debated, their actions undeniably contributed to the ongoing conflict and instability in Iraq during that period."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone Answer:","output":"The final step is: The ecosystem is disrupted and damaged, leading to a potential loss of biodiversity and a long recovery period for the affected area."},{"instruction":"Information: - The Helvellaceae are a family of ascomycete fungi , the best known members of which are the elfin saddles of the genus Helvella . Originally erected by Elias Magnus Fries in 1823 as Elvellacei , it contained many genera . Several of these , such as Gyromitra and Discina , have been found to be more distantly related in a molecular study of ribosomal DNA by mycologist Kerry O'Donnell in 1997 , leaving a much smaller core clade now redefined as Helvellaceae . Instead , this narrowly defined group is most closely related to the true truffles of the Tuberaceae . According to the Dictionary of the Fungi ( 10th edition , 2008 ) , the family contains six genera and 63 species . - A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes unicellular microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as multicellular fungi that produce familiar fruiting forms such as mushrooms and bracket fungi. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, Fungi, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals. - Helvella is a genus of ascomycete fungus of the family Helvellaceae. The mushrooms, commonly known as elfin saddles, are identified by their irregularly shaped caps, fluted stems, and fuzzy undersurfaces. They are found in North America and in Europe. Well known species include the whitish \\"H. crispa\\" and the grey \\"H. lacunosa\\". They have been reported to cause gastrointestinal symptoms when eaten raw. - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells. - Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is a DNA sequence that codes for ribosomal RNA. Ribosomes are assemblies of proteins and rRNA molecules that translate mRNA molecules to produce proteins. As shown in the figure, rDNA of eukaryotes consists of a tandem repeat of a unit segment, an operon, composed of NTS, ETS, 18S, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, and 28S tracts. rDNA has another gene, coding for 5S rRNA, located in the genome in most eukaryotes. 5S rDNA is also present in tandem repeats as in \\"Drosophila\\". In the nucleus, the rDNA region of the chromosome is visualized as a nucleolus which forms expanded chromosomal loops with rDNA. These rDNA regions are also called nucleolus organizer regions, as they give rise to the nucleolus. In the human genome there are 5 chromosomes with nucleolus organizer regions: the acrocentric chromosomes 13,14,15,21 and 22. In Bacteria, Archaea and chloroplasts the rRNA is composed of different (smaller) units, the large (23S) ribosomal RNA, 16S ribosomal RNA and 5S rRNA. The 16S rRNA is widely used for phylogenetic studies. - <section begin=lead />The human genome is the complete set of nucleic acid sequence for humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\"), encoded as DNA within the 23 chromosome pairs in cell nuclei and in a small DNA molecule found within individual mitochondria. Human genomes include both protein-coding DNA genes and noncoding DNA. Haploid human genomes, which are contained in germ cells (the egg and sperm gamete cells created in the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction before fertilization creates a zygote) consist of three billion DNA base pairs, while diploid genomes (found in somatic cells) have twice the DNA content. While there are significant differences among the genomes of human individuals (on the order of 0.1%), these are considerably smaller than the differences between humans and their closest living relatives, the chimpanzees (approximately 4%) and bonobos.<section end=lead /> - The common name elfin saddle is given to a number of Ascomycete fungi in the order Pezizales. These medium to small fungi often have irregular saddle-shaped caps. Species include: - The Tuberaceae are a family of mycorrhizal fungi. It includes the genus \\"Tuber\\", which includes the so-called \\"true\\" truffles. It was characterized by the Belgian botanist Barthélemy Charles Joseph du Mortier in 1822. A molecular study of ribosomal DNA by mycologist Kerry O'Donnell in 1997 found that a small clade now redefined as Helvellaceae is most closely related to the Tuberaceae. - The nucleolus (or , plural nucleoli or ) is the largest structure in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, where it is primarily responsible for the creation of ribosomes via a process known as ribosome biogenesis. Nucleoli also have other important functions like assembly of signal recognition particles and playing a role in the cell's response to stress. Nucleoli are made of proteins, DNA and RNA and form around specific chromosomal regions. Malfunction of nucleoli can be the cause of several human conditions which include diseases, disorders, syndromes and illnesses. - Gyromitra is a genus of ascomycete mushrooms found in the northern hemisphere. The genus contains about 18 species. - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.

Ernst Mueller [Rupert Davies], monsignor of the monastery at Keinenberg, has decided to visit the village to see that all is well. What he finds is appalling. The village priest [Ewan Hooper] has become an alcoholic. The villagers will not attend Sunday Mass because the shadow of Dracula's castle touches the church during the evening hours. The Monsignor decides to exorcise the castle and prove to the villagers that the evil is gone. He and the priest climb the hill to the castle, but the priest chickens out halfway. The Monsignor continues alone to the castle door where he performs his exorcism and seals the castle door with a large cross. The priest, in the meantime, is taking swigs from his hipflask. He stumbles over a cliff, cuts his head, lands on the river ice, causing it to crack open just above Dracula's body. The priest's blood drips through the cracked ice, flowing into Dracula's mouth, and Dracula is thus resurrected.Barred from his castle by the cross on the door, Dracula [Christopher Lee] must now find other lodgings. He enslaves the priest, forcing him to dig up a new coffin for him. He also forces him to reveal who is responsible for the exorcism. The coffin is loaded onto a funeral coach, and the priest and Dracula head toward Keinenberg. His exorcism finished, the Monsignor also returns to Keinenberg where he lives with his brother's widow Anna [Marion Mathe] and his niece Maria [Veronica Carlson].

Be careful not to use too hot or extremely cold water to clean your dog's ears. Never bathe your dog when the fever is severe.. Explanation: Treating a fever in dogs requires careful handling and monitoring of your dog's body temperature. It is important not to use too hot or extremely cold water to clean its ears and paws, as this can cause discomfort and potentially worsen the condition. Instead, using a tepid, wet cloth to gently clean these areas can help regulate its body temperature without causing harm. Option [a] is incorrect because rubbing an ice pack on a feverish dog's ears and paws can be too cold, potentially causing discomfort and worsening the fever. Similarly, option [b] is not the best advice because fluffing up a dog's fur is not a remedy for fever, and scrubbing the ears may cause pain or damage. Option [d] suggests wiping your dog's chest and abdomen in addition to the ears and paws, which can help cool down the entire body. While this can be helpful, it does not address the importance of using the correct water temperature to avoid discomfort or further complications. Additionally, bathing a dog when it has a severe fever is not recommended, as it may cause stress and exacerbate the fever. Instead, focus on helping your dog cool down with tepid water and monitoring its temperature.

Bagge , a student of Werner Heisenberg for his doctorate and Habilitation , was engaged in German Atomic Energy research and the German nuclear energy project during the Second World War . He worked as an Assistant at the Kaiser - Wilhelm - Institut für Physik in Berlin . Bagge , who became associated professor at the University of Hamburg in 1948 , was in particular involved in the usage of nuclear power for trading vessels , and he was one of the founders of the Society for the Usage of Nuclear Energy in Ship - Building and Seafare . The first German nuclear vessel , the \`\` NS Otto Hahn '' , was launched in 1962 . A research reactor was installed in Geesthacht near Hamburg at about the same time which has over the years formed into a center for materials research with neutrons . - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics or quantum theory), including quantum field theory, is a branch of physics which is the fundamental theory of nature at small scales and low energies of atoms and subatomic particles. Classical physics, the physics existing before quantum mechanics, derives from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid only at large (macroscopic) scales. Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum and other quantities are often restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be known (Uncertainty principle). - In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei). The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay. - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level. - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Werner Karl Heisenberg (5 December 1901 1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. In 1927 he published his uncertainty principle, upon which he built his philosophy and for which he is best known. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 \\"for the creation of quantum mechanics\\". - Coburg is a town located on the Itz river in the Upper Franconia region of Bavaria, Germany. Long part of one of the Thuringian states of the Wettin line, it joined Bavaria by popular vote only in 1920. Until the revolution of 1918, it was one of the capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Through successful dynastic policies, the ruling princely family married into several of the royal families of Europe, most notably in the person of Prince Albert, who married Queen Victoria in 1840. As a result of these close links with the royal houses of Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Coburg was frequently visited by the crowned heads of Europe and their families. - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it. - Max Born (11 December 1882 5 January 1970) was a German physicist and mathematician who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. Born won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for his \\"fundamental research in Quantum Mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function\\". - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English. - Ernst Pascual Jordan (18 October 1902 31 July 1980) was a theoretical and mathematical physicist who made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. He contributed much to the mathematical form of matrix mechanics, and developed canonical anticommutation relations for fermions. While the Jordan algebra is employed for and is still used in studying the mathematical and conceptual foundations of quantum theory, it has found other mathematical applications. - Neustadt bei Coburg (also written \\"Neustadt b. Coburg\\") is a town in the district of Coburg in northern Bavaria, Germany. It is situated 15 km northeast of Coburg, as its name indicates. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. - Otto Hahn, , (8 March 1879 28 July 1968) was a German chemist and pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry. He was exclusively awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1944 for the discovery and the radiochemical proof of nuclear fission. He is referred to as the father of nuclear chemistry. - The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on proposal of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry which consists of five members elected by Academy. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.

Next, I am going to consider the possible types of answers listed in the user's question: - Entity: an object or concept that exists; - Abbreviation: a shortened form of a word or phrase; - Description: a detailed account of something; - Human: a person; - Location: a place; - Numeric value: a number. 3. Now, I am going to examine each type of answer and see which makes most sense given the content of the question: - Entity: While it's possible that the question asks about an entity related to the phrase, it's unlikely that the answer directly refers to an object or concept that exists. - Abbreviation: The phrase itself doesn't seem to hint at any specific abbreviation, so it's improbable that the answer is an abbreviation. - Description: The question seems to ask for a description of whose phrase this was but the answer itself likely isn't the description, it's the subject of the description. - Human: Since the question is asking about whose come-on this was, it is likely that the answer will refer to a human (or a group of humans) who used this phrase. - Location: While the question mentions London, it doesn't seem to be asking for a specific location. - Numeric value: The content of the question doesn't suggest any numerical answers. Based on the analysis, the most likely answer to the question \\"Whose old London come-on was: \`\`Buy my sweet lavender''?\\" would be a human or a group of humans who used this phrase.

Plats are typically prepared by licensed land surveyors and are used by government agencies, developers, and other stakeholders in land development. For a plat to be considered legally valid, it must generally go through an approval process overseen by the local government or a relevant regulatory authority. This approval process typically involves checking the compliance of the plat with zoning laws, land-use regulations, and any development codes applicable in the jurisdiction. It is important for the plat to be approved by the relevant government authority because approval signifies that the proposed land division meets all the legal and regulatory requirements. Without government approval, plats may not be legally valid, and property owners may face legal issues or complications when they try to further develop or transfer the property. Furthermore, plats need to be recorded in the appropriate office, usually the County Recorder's Office or County Clerk's Office, to ensure property rights are protected.

Problem:CLOSE Former Iowa meatpacking executive Sholom Rubashkin had hoped new evidence could shorten his prison sentence for bank fraud and money laundering. Wochit Buy Photo Sholom Rubashkin, right, heads to a court appearance in Cear Rapids on Oct. 30, 2008. (Photo: Register file photo)Buy Photo President Donald Trump on Wednesday commuted the prison sentence of former Iowa slaughterhouse executive Sholom Rubashkin, who was sentenced to 27 years for bank fraud and money laundering, the White House said. In a statement, the White House said the decision, which is not a presidential pardon, had bipartisan support from leaders across the political spectrum, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). Trump's action does not vacate Rubashkin’s conviction and leaves his term of supervised release and a restitution obligation, the White House said. Rubashkin, a 57-year-old father of 10 children, oversaw operations at Agriprocessors, a large kosher meatpacking plant owned by his father in the northern Iowa town of Postville. The plant was raided by agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in May 2008, leading to the arrests of nearly 400 Mexican and Guatemalan immigrants who were living and working in the country without authorization. SUPPORTING A LIGHTER SENTENCE: 10 big names who advocated it WHAT PROSECUTORS SAID:Rubashkin was not railroaded REGISTER EDITORIAL:We need answers on prosecutors' conduct The raid sparked a chain of events, including Agriprocessors declaring bankruptcy, that led investigators to suspicious invoices and other sales records that Rubashkin faked to make the company appear on better financial footing. Prosecutors accused Rubashkin of using the fake paperwork to continue borrowing on a 35 million line of credit, ultimately resulting in a 27 million loss for a St. Louis-based bank when Agriprocessors went defunct. Rubashkin was convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 27 years in prison. He has served more than eight years of that sentence. One of Rubashkin's attorneys, Montgomery Brown, said Rubashkin was released Wednesday from the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville in New York. His wife picked him up, Brown said Rubashkin's son told him. Rubashkin's family could not be reached for comment Wednesday night. Another one of Rubashkin's attorney, Guy Cook, praised Trump's commutation, the president's first in office. Cook said Rubashkin “finally received justice\\" and called the commutation tremendous news for the Rubashkin family, who live Borough Park, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The sentence was essentially a life sentence, Cook told the Register. He called it unfair and unjust, and described it as not supported by the facts of the trial. “President Trump has done what is right and just,” Cook said. “The unrelenting efforts on behalf of Rubashkin have finally paid off.” A review of Rubashkin's case was supported by more than 30 members of Congress, including Rep. Steve King, R-Kiron, the White House said. He was the only Iowa representative to support a review. Five former high-ranking Department of Justice officials, including former FBI Director Louis Freeh, also supported a review of the case, the White House said. Robert Teig, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the northern district of Iowa who was involved in the prosecution early on, called the commutation political, describing it as the result of a campaign of false information. Rubashkin was likely the largest employer of illegal immigrants at the time in Iowa, Teig said. He asserted the commutation was \\"180-degrees\\" from a get-tough approach on illegal immigration. \\"[Rubashkin] couldn’t win legally, factually or morally, so he had to win politically,\\" Teig, 66, of Cedar Rapids, told the Register. \\"It’s sad when politics interferes with the justice system.\\" The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Rubashkin's case in 2012. In January, Chief U.S. District Court Judge Linda Reade denied a petition from defense attorneys seeking a new sentencing hearing and other relief that could have freed Rubashkin earlier than his expected 2033 release date. Reade accused the former executive's attorneys of \\"embellishing\\" their claims to win a new hearing. Attorneys representing Rubashkin claimed in a court petition that the bank's loss was caused by prosecutors who wrongfully meddled in the bankruptcy sale, scaring off potential buyers willing to pay more than the eventual 8.5 million sale price. The filings pointed to new evidence, including recently discovered handwritten notes, that defense lawyers claim prove prosecutors misled Reade about their interference in the sale at the time of the sentencing. THE POSTVILLE RAID:Impact lingers for Guatemalan town Prosecutors denied any wrongdoing, and Reade wrote in her ruling that the sentence was based on more than just the amount Rubashkin cost the bank. \\"The government did not conceal any information that materially affected the outcome of the sentencing hearing and it did not offer misleading testimony,\\" she wrote. \\"(Rubashkin) orchestrated a massive criminal scheme that impacted a very large community, that is, defrauded financial institutions for approximately 10 years, harbored an illegal workforce and laundered millions of dollars in an effort to provide kosher products across the nation,\\" she wrote. The court recognized that \\"(Rubashkin) repeatedly tried to obstruct justice when his criminal scheme came to light, never acknowledged what the law requires and never wholeheartedly accepted responsibility.\\" The defense attorneys' claims sparked calls for former President Barack Obama to use his clemency power to free Rubashkin or shorten his sentence, most prominently in the opinion pages of the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. But Obama left office without granting Rubashkin a pardon or commuting his sentence. A bipartisan group of more than 100 former high-ranking Department of Justice officials have expressed concerns about the evidentiary proceedings in Rubashkin’s case and the severity of his sentence, the White House said in its statement Wednesday. Supporters of Rubashkin have long claimed that the 27-year sentence handed down by Reade was excessive. Rubashkin's prison sentence was nearly three years longer than the original prison sentence given to Jeffrey Skilling, the former Enron president convicted in a fraud case that cost shareholders 11 billion. But detractors lamented that Rubashkin was never tried in federal court on a host of immigration charges, which would have given former workers an opportunity to testify about alleged abuses and exploitation at the plant. Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorneys Office dismissed those charges shortly after Rubashkin's convictions for bank fraud and money laundering. A jury acquitted Rubashkin in state court of 67 misdemeanor child labor law violations in 2010 after his defense attorney argued the executive should not be held liable for employing teens who \\"tricked\\" the company using fake documents. But among the allegations made public in that case were claims that certain Agriprocessors supervisors harassed and had sexual intercourse with female workers in a storage room at the plant. Rubashkin has enjoyed support from his community of Chabad-Lubavitch Jews. After the White House announced the commute, some Orthodox Jews, including outgoing New York City Council member David Greenfield, called the news a Chanukah miracle. \\"After years of getting railroaded by the legal system, Sholom Rubashkin is finally going home thanks to (President Trump),\\" Greenfield, a Democrat who represented the neighborhood where members of Rubashkin's family live, said in a statement on Twitter.

Trump's commutation of the sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, 57, marks his first commutation and the second use of his clemency powers since taking office, including his controversial pardon earlier this year of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The White House, in its statement announcing the move, claimed bipartisan support for the action. The case against Rubashkin started after an immigration raid on a kosher meatpacking company that he owned, and his arrest in 2008 by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents resulted in his conviction for financial crimes. The case drew national attention, and last December a former federal prosecutor and deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton, Philip Heymann, took to the pages of the The Washington Post to blast Rubashkin's conviction, which he said was \\"based on perjured testimony and prosecutorial misconduct.\\" adding that more than 100 former Justice Department officials, including former attorneys general, also felt the case against Rubashkin was unjust.

President Donald Trump on Dec. 20, 2017, commuted... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday commuted the sentence of an Iowa kosher meatpacking executive who had been sentenced to 27 years in prison for money laundering, marking the first time he's used the presidential power. The decision to intervene on behalf of Sholom Rubashkin, who ran the Iowa headquarters of a family business that was the country's largest kosher meat-processing company, came at the urging of numerous members of Congress and a long list of high-ranking law enforcement officials, who argued the sentence was far too harsh for a first-time, nonviolent offender. The action was \\"encouraged by bipartisan leaders from across the political spectrum, from Nancy Pelosi to Orrin Hatch,\\" the White House said. Rubashki was convicted in 2009 for submitting fake invoices to a bank that made Agriprocessors' finances appear healthier than they were so that it could borrow more. His prosecution came after federal authorities raided the plant and arrested 389 illegal immigrants in 2008. The 57-year-old father of 10 has served more than eight years of his sentence, according to the White House, which stressed the action is not a presidential pardon and does not vacate Rubashkin's conviction. Trump has used his pardon power just once so far: to spare former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio the prospect of serving jail time by wiping away a federal conviction stemming from immigration patrols that focused on Latinos. Rubashkin's long-time attorney Guy Cook praised Trump's decision, saying Rubashkin \\"has finally received justice.\\" \\"The sentence previously imposed was unfair, unjust and essential a life sentence,\\" he said via email. \\"President Trump has done what is right and just. The unrelenting efforts on Rubashkin's behalf have finally paid off.\\" Rubashkin's attorneys last year accused prosecutors of improperly interfering with the sale of Agriprocessors and depressing its sale price by millions. The drop in value left Agriprocessors' bank with a 27 million loss — a figure used to calculate Rubashkin's sentence under federal guidelines. The U.S. attorney's office denied the allegations. The White House said the president's decision to review Rubashkin's sentence was driven by concerns raised by a bipartisan group of more than 100 former high-ranking law enforcement and Justice Department officials, including multiple former attorneys general, as well as prosecutors, judges, and legal scholars. \\"Mr. Rubashkin is a devoted husband and father, a deeply religious man who simply doesn't deserve a sentence of this length, or anything remotely close to it,\\" they wrote in a letter that urged Trump to use his \\"executive clemency power to commute the patently unjust and draconian 27-year sentence imposed upon Sholom Rubashkin_a first time, non-violent offender and father of 10, including an acutely autistic child.\\" More than 30 current members of Congress also submitted letters to the White House supporting a review of Rubashkin's case. But former prosecutor Bob Teig, who retired in 2011 after serving as a prosecutor and spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Iowa, said Trump's decision to commute Rubashkin's sentence \\"makes no sense\\" given Trump's repeated promises to get tougher on illegal immigration. Teig said that every court that looked at Rubashkin's sentence had concluded it was fair, and suggested that former Justice Department officials and lawmakers who supported leniency were unaware of the facts of the case. \\"The outrage is backwards,\\" he said. ___ Associated Press writers Ryan J. Foley in Iowa City, Iowa, and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Today, President Donald J. Trump commuted the prison sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, an action encouraged by bipartisan leaders from across the political spectrum, from Nancy Pelosi to Orrin Hatch. Mr. Rubashkin is a 57-year-old father of 10 children. He previously ran the Iowa headquarters of a family business that was the country’s largest kosher meat-processing company.

Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"without the power\\", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power).Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average.

Rob got curious about the science behind various tidal conditions. Answer the following question: Which case would result in more extreme tidal conditions, case A or case B?","output":"Case A, the spring tide, would result in more extreme tidal conditions compared to case B, the neap tide. During Rob's stay on the East Coast, he observed two types of tidal conditions. To understand these phenomena, let's examine the factors contributing to the rise and fall of tides. Tides are primarily caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, the Sun. When the gravitational forces of both celestial bodies align, their combined effect on Earth's water results in higher high tides and lower low tides. This alignment can occur during two different lunar phases - full moon and new moon. When the Moon is in line with the Earth and Sun, their combined gravitational force causes an increased tidal range, resulting in the highest high tides and the lowest low tides. These tides are known as spring tides, which Rob observed as case A. Spring tides have stronger tidal currents and shorter slack water periods – the brief intervals when the water is relatively still between tides – than average. In contrast, during first quarter and third quarter phases of the lunar cycle, the Sun and Moon form a 90-degree angle relative to Earth. In this configuration, their gravitational forces partially cancel each other out, reducing the overall tidal range. These conditions lead to less extreme tides, known as neap tides or case B in Rob's observation. Neap tides have high waters that are lower than average, low waters that are higher than average, a longer slack water period than average, and weaker tidal currents. The difference in tidal range between spring and neap tides is typically about a seven-day interval. In conclusion, case A (spring tide) would result in more extreme tidal conditions due to the alignment and combined gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun. Rob would have observed higher high tides and lower low tides during this period compared to the less extreme conditions in case B (neap tide)."},{"instruction":"Write an email with the following subject: commodity logic request","output":"Subject: Commodity Logic Request Step 1: Begin by addressing the recipient and introducing myself To ensure a friendly and professional tone, I will start the email by addressing the recipient using an appropriate salutation and then introduce myself to establish my identity and purpose.

The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\" Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility. Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation. Who is more likely to die after this event? A:","output":"A: Michael is more likely to die after this event, as he was exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time, which can result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) with symptoms such as skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure, and death. Robert, who was in the adjacent room and only suffered low doses of radiation, is at a lesser risk compared to Michael."},{"instruction":"Review: An unusual film from Ringo Lam and one that's strangely under-appreciated. The mix of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes. A horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse. Several horses get chopped up. It's very unexpected. The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the Red Lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple. The General has a similarity to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood. The production is very impressive and the setting is bleak. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many HK action scenes from the time. Sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it's never bad enough to ruin the film. Find this one, it's one of the best HK kung fu films from the early nineties.

Their marriage is not helped by Clara's opinionated mother living with them in their small one bedroom apartment. However, Clara does wish that their life would be a little more exciting as Andrew said on their honeymoon that their married life would be, least of all by Andrew acknowledging their latest wedding anniversary, their fifth. Clara's wish takes an unexpected turn when Andrew, at work, is assigned to show the visiting Mr. Battingcourt Jr. - the younger half of the head of their London office and who is majority shareholder of their accounting firm - a good time while he's in the US. \\"Batty\\" as he is affectionately called by his friends is a party animal, and Andrew, who Batty rechristens \\"Hinky\\", feels he has to party along all in the name of job security. Clara feels that she is losing her stable husband Andrew to Hinky the party animal. Feeling he is partly to blame for the Hinklins' marital problems, Batty advises Clara that she can make herself more exciting to Hinky by changing her demeanor and appearance, more like Mercedes Vasquez, a beautiful and exciting woman who Clara could resemble if made up correctly. Clara agrees to Batty's plan to come to one of their parties masquerading as exotic Latina Dolores Alvaradez, to woo Hinky and thus ultimately show him that she can be exotic like he probably now wants.

You need to construct a question about the information present in the passage. Construct a question in such a way that (i) it is unambiguous, (ii) its answer is the whole paragraph. Avoid creating questions that can be answered correctly without actually understanding the paragraph. There are such values, called R-values. They define the resistance to heat loss per unit time, temperature difference and area (i.e., higher is better). These are English units, hour-degreeF-ft^2/BTU. An R-value of 20 means that 100 sq. ft. of wall separating a 20 deg F temperature difference for 8 hours passes 800 BTU of heat.

Questions: What do you call the feet on a dog? Options: - two ears - paws - one mouth - big heart - tail A:","output":"The correct option in line with common sense to answer the question \\"What do you call the feet on a dog?\\" is paws. Dogs have four legs, and at the end of each leg, they have a paw. Paws are specifically designed to help dogs in various ways, such as providing traction, aiding in their mobility, and giving them the ability to hold and manipulate objects. Let's discuss the other options briefly: - Two ears: Ears are a part of the dog's anatomy, responsible for hearing. Dogs have two ears, but they have nothing to do with a dog's feet. Ears help dogs detect sounds and communicate with their environment. - One mouth: A dog's mouth is another part of their anatomy that is unrelated to their feet. The mouth helps dogs eat, drink, pant to regulate body temperature, and even to display certain expressions like a smile or a growl. While a critical part of a dog's body, it is not the correct answer to the question. - Big heart: While it is often said that dogs have big hearts, both literally and metaphorically, this option is not relevant to the question at hand. The heart is an essential organ in a dog's body responsible for pumping blood, supplying oxygen, and nutrients to their cells. In a figurative sense, a big heart might symbolize a dog's loving and loyal nature, but it has no direct connection to their feet. - Tail: A dog's tail is an extension of their spine and serves various purposes in communication and balance. Dogs wag their tails to express emotions like happiness or alertness, and even use it to maintain their balance when running or making sharp turns. However, the tail is not the correct answer to the question, as it is not related to their feet. In summary, the accurate and common-sense answer to the question \\"What do you call the feet on a dog?\\" is paws. Paws are the feet of a dog, essential for their movement, traction, and various other purposes to navigate their environment effectively. The other options provided are parts of a dog's anatomy or characteristics, but they do not accurately describe the feet on a dog."},{"instruction":"Teacher:The provided text is in English, and we ask you to translate the text to the Croatian language.

Regulus is a multiple star system composed of at least four stars, situated approximately 79.3 light-years away from Earth. The primary component of this system is a spectroscopic binary star, where two stars closely orbit each other and can only be distinguished through their spectral lines. The other two stars are much fainter and orbit the primary pair from a greater distance. Regulus is a significant star in the night sky, as it ranks as the 21st brightest star overall. With an apparent magnitude of +1.35, its brightness is comparable to some of the other well-known stars like Altair and Antares. In addition to its prominence in the constellation Leo, Regulus is also one of the stars that form the Spring Triangle and the larger asterism called the Sickle. The primary star in the Regulus system is a young, blue-white main-sequence star that belongs to the spectral class B7 V, having a surface temperature of approximately 12,000 Kelvin. It is about 3.8 times more massive, 280 times more luminous, and roughly 3.1 times larger in radius than our Sun, making it a massive star on the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. One of the remarkable characteristics of Regulus is its exceptionally rapid rotation. The star completes one rotation in just 15.9 hours, which causes it to become oblate in shape and results in a substantial temperature difference between its poles and equator. This extreme rotation also causes the star to emit a strong stellar wind and creates an equatorial disk of hot plasma around it. The secondary star in the Regulus system is a smaller, fainter main-sequence star with a spectral class around K2 V, making it an orange dwarf star. It orbits the primary star at a distance of only about 0.3 astronomical units (AU) and takes about 40 days to complete one orbit. Regulus C and Regulus D, the two fainter companions in the system, are both small red dwarf stars belonging to the spectral class M4 and M5, respectively. They orbit the primary Regulus pair in a wide orbit spanning around 100 AU, with an orbital period likely exceeding thousands of years. In summary, the brightest star in the constellation Leo is the multiple star system Regulus, or Alpha Leonis, consisting of at least four stars. The primary star is a blue-white main-sequence star that is much more massive and luminous than our Sun, and its prominence in the night sky makes it an essential point of reference for stargazers and astronomers alike."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Who gained the right of command?\\" is in \\"During the Hungnam evacuation, about 193 shiploads of UN Command forces and matériel (approximately 105,000 soldiers, 98,000 civilians, 17,500 vehicles, and 350,000 tons of supplies) were evacuated to Pusan.

Question: suppose less sediment would be transported happens, how will it affect MORE sediment being transported. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the steps of sediment transport: 1. Sediment settles in a place due to gravity: Sediment particles are subjected to gravitational force, which causes them to settle at the bottom of a water body or on the ground. 2. The sediment breaks down into small particles: Over time, sediment particles break down due to physical and chemical processes, forming smaller particles. 3. Wind or water picks up the sediment: The smaller particles become more susceptible to being picked up by wind or water currents. 4. The sediment travels along the same route as the wind or water: The movement of the sediment particles is dictated by the direction of the wind or water currents. 5. The sediment is deposited at new locations by the wind or water: As the sediment particles travel, they are eventually deposited in new locations. 6. The sediment is picked up again by new wind or water: The deposited sediment particles may be picked up again by new wind or water currents. 7. The sediment travels further: The sediment particles continue to move with the currents. 8. The sediment is deposited again in a new place: The sediment particles are ultimately deposited in different locations. Now to answer the question: Suppose less sediment would be transported happens, how will it affect MORE sediment being transported. A: More B: Less C: No effect Answer: B: Less Justification: If less sediment is being transported, this means there would be fewer sediment particles available to be picked up and carried by wind or water currents.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Paragraph: John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would bowl A fruits be preserved longer or shorter than bowl B fruits? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background and the paragraph, bowl A fruits would be preserved longer than bowl B fruits. This is because bowl A contains candied or glacé fruits, which have undergone a preservation process involving heated sugar syrup. This syrup absorbs the moisture from within the fruit, which helps to preserve it. Furthermore, the saturation of sugar in the fruit prevents the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavorable osmotic pressure it creates. Bowl B, on the other hand, contains non-glace fruits that have not gone through this preservation process. As such, they are more susceptible to spoilage and damage as they lack the protective sugar coating that glacé fruits have. Therefore, the fruits in bowl A will have a longer shelf life than those in bowl B. This preservation process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year, making the glacé fruits in bowl A a more durable option compared to their non-glace counterparts in bowl B."},{"instruction":"She 's actually a border collie / boxer mix , although the boxer side is n't showing up much at this point .

Two enterprising Italians — Alessandro Guagni and Lorenzo Bianchi — hear you, and they're doing something about it. The pair is trying to bring back a make-out friendly garlic strain, aglione, which hasn't been widely cultivated in Italy for 40 years, according to the Guardian. Guagni and Bianchi are vying to get their less-pungent, more-digestible \\"kissing garlic\\" on the menu at some of Italy's best restaurants. A construction engineer and a lawyer by trade, Guagni and Bianchi turned to cultivating giant garlic (about 10 times the size of your average bulb, they said) three years ago, when Guagni spotted it while on vacation in Tuscany. \\"We wanted to do something to escape from our offices,\\" Guagni told the Guardian, and growing \\"big garlic\\" — the literal translation of aglione — provided just such a diversion. Thus, they started asking after the crop at Tuscan restaurants. \\"We asked: 'Where can we find it?' And they [restauranteurs] said: 'No, there isn't any. You will never find it because it is over. It's extinct.'\\" But aglione is not extinct. Eventually they were able to locate some seeds, and they planted two hectares of land with the \\"kissing garlic,\\" which will be ready for harvest in a few months. Thereafter, the world will be able to make out with abandon immediately after garlic-laden feasts — what a time to be alive. ||||| Giant variety known as aglione is milder, odourless and easy to digest, say pair who have spent three years cultivating crop Help is on the way for cooks and diners who love the taste of garlic but hold back from eating it for fear it will cause bad breath and indigestion. An unlikely Roman duo, a construction engineer and a commercial lawyer, have spent the past three years cultivating a special giant variety of garlic that used to be prevalent in Tuscany but has not been produced in large quantities for 40 years. The garlic, known in Italian as aglione, has a milder flavour, is odourless and easy to digest, say the two entrepreneurs, Alessandro Guagni and Lorenzo Bianchi. With just a few months to go before their harvest, the pair are trying to get their “kissing garlic” in some of Italy’s Michelin-star restaurants after chefs who sampled last year’s crop gave it an enthusiastic response . They hope to sell the aglione in high quality food markets, where they hope it will come to be seen as a newfound Italian gem. “We thought this was a typical example of Italian excellence that has been forgotten. Why? Because no one knows it and no one asks for it,” said Bianchi. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alessandro Guagni at work on the farm where the aglione is grown. Photograph: Stephanie Kirchgaessner for the Guardian Garlic is often associated with Italian cuisine, and is considered an important ingredient when cooking roasted potatoes, lamb, roast pork and bruschetta, but it is not a flavour that dominates typical dishes. Guagni and Bianchi say this reflects concern, especially among young people, that it is indigestible and causes bad breath. They also say that most garlic consumed in Italy is produced abroad, particularly China and Spain. Their story started about three years ago. Guagni was on holiday in the Chiana valley in Tuscany, in the heart of winemaking country, when he came across a farmer’s stand that was selling a product he had never seen before. “It was very big. One bulb weighed from 300 to 800 grams, about 10 times as big as normal garlic. The taste was very good and very light so we thought about the possibility of reintroducing it in the market,” Guagni said. Their first task was to find aglione seeds. The product is not totally unknown. Some Tuscan restaurants serve a dish known as pici all’algione on their menu, a fresh, eggless pasta with a tomato and garlic sauce. When Guagni and Bianchi started asking restauranteurs about where they found their supplies, however, they hit a wall. “We asked: ‘Where can we find it’? And they said: ‘No, there isn’t any. You will never find it because it is over. It’s extinct’,” Guagni said. They learned that though the dish technically calls for aglione, which translates as “big garlic”, most chefs use a conventional variety. Eventually they tracked down a few local producers , got their hands on some seeds and went to work on land Bianchi owns in the Marche region, near the city of Ancona. They say they have a tractor they “play” on over the weekend, and a friend with experience who is also helping out. Asked whether their garlic could be considered organic, the two chuckle. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ducks eat the weeds on the land but don’t eat the garlic bulbs. Photograph: Courtesy: Kissingarlic “It couldn’t get more organic,” Bianchi said. Garlic is not too labour intensive, they add, and in this case much of the labour is done by ducks, which eat the weeds on the land but don’t touch the bulbs themselves. They also produce fertiliser. The pair have grown their garlic on two hectares of land, which they say is enough to cultivate about 30,000 plants. According to the Fondazione Slow Food, an organisation that promotes food biodiversity, fewer than 10 producers cultivate what it calls aglione della Chiana, and most do so for personal use. The foundation said the variety does not contain allicin, a chemical compound found in traditional garlic, and that there are usually six large cloves in a bulb. The garlic is said to date back to ancient times, when Etruscans inhabited the Chiana valley, and it was also present on the island of Giglio. It allegedly arrived on the island in 1544 after the pirate Khayr al-Din killed nearly everyone on it, forcing the ruling Medici family of Florence to repopulate it with aglione-loving inhabitants of the Chiana valley, who brought it with them. Guagni and Bianchi, who have been friends since they were teenagers growing up in Rome, are thinking big, possibly about creating a supplement or soap, given that garlic is known for its anti-bacterial qualities. They also have a few more ancient products they would like to revive, but don’t want to divulge their trade secrets. They are also having fun. “We wanted to do something to escape from our offices,” Guagni said. ||||| You might never have to worry about eating garlic on a first date again—if two Italian farmers are successful. Former engineer Alessandro Guagni and lawyer Loreno Bianchi are marketing KissinGarlic, a milder strain of garlic that the duo claims does not cause bad breath. Garlic’s signature odor comes from a compound called allicin, which is released whenever a clove is crushed or chopped. Take away the allicin and you remove the pungent smell and the risk of bad breath. As luck would have it, an allicin-free garlic already exists—no engineering or cross-breeding necessary. Guagni and Bianchi’s KissinGarlic is actually an ancient strain of garlic called aglione, which doesn’t contain any allicin. The sweet smelling garlic is not only easier on the nostrils; it’s also massive. It typically grows five times the size of common garlic, but it can grow up to ten times the size. It is also less zesty and spicy than common garlic and therefore, the duo says, easier to digest. The ultra-mild garlic was almost lost completely. Today, there are less than ten producers who grow aglione, all of which are located in Italy’s Chiana Valley. Guagni and Bianchi have joined this small enclave of aglione producers and grow their KissinGarlic in the valley using ducks as weed deterrents and fertilizer dispensers. (The ducks eat the weeds, then digest them and fertilize the soil with their droppings.) Curious about the breath-friendly garlic? You can order it by emailing info@kissingarlic.com. But be prepared to make a lot of mildly garlicky dishes; the minimum order is fifteen heads. [h/t Food Navigator] ||||| Chiana Giant garlic is rarely cultivated these days. In fact, there are less than ten producers, all of whom work in the reclaimed flat lands of the Chiana Valley and in a few fraction of the town of Montepulciano. This giant garlic has a particular aroma and contains no allicin (a particular chemical compound) or its derivatives. This garlic is an almost ivory shade of white, nearly spherical in shape and is slightly flat at the extremities. There are usually six large, individual bulbs in each clove, which can weigh up to 800 grams. It has a very delicate flavor and is used in the Chiana Valley most typically in a pasta dish called pici all’aglione. Chiana Giant garlic’s history dates back to when the Etruscans lived in the Chiana Valley, while the garlic is also present on Giglio Island. In 1544 the pirate Khayr al-Din, also known as Barbarossa, sacked the island, killed everyone who opposed him and kidnapped and enslaved more than 700 locals. Following this tragedy the Medici family repopulated the island with people from the Chiana Valley, who certainly brought bulbs of Chiana Giant garlic with them. The historic production zone is the Chiana Valley, around Montepulciano and in particular in the towns of Abbadia, Acquaviva, Gracciano, Montepulciano Station and Valiano. There are 2,000 bulbs of the garlic produced annually, mainly for personal use. With the industrialization of the 1960s, the tradition of cultivating the garlic in a family setting was lost, and thus also the tendency to use it in the kitchen.

Given these facts, what is controlled by the carbon circle and is transferred between organisms and atmosphere among the following options: - Energy. - Chemical energy - Carbon Dioxide - Organic compounds - flow of electrons - heat energy - oxidation reaction - temperature The answer is:","output":"Carbon Dioxide and Organic Compounds. The carbon cycle is a complex process by which carbon atoms are exchanged and recycled between different parts of the Earth's system, including the atmosphere, living organisms, and the lithosphere (soil, rocks, and sediments). This cycle is essential for maintaining life on Earth, as it plays a critical role in the regulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and the production of organic compounds. Among the listed options, carbon dioxide and organic compounds are the two components that are directly controlled by the carbon cycle and are transferred between organisms and the atmosphere. Carbon Dioxide: CO2 is a major greenhouse gas that plays a significant role in regulating the Earth's temperature. It is produced through various processes, such as fossil fuel combustion, decomposition of organic matter, and respiration by living organisms. In the carbon cycle, plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, converting it into glucose and other organic compounds that can be used as building blocks for plant tissues or food sources for other organisms. Through respiration, consumption, and decomposition, CO2 is returned back to the atmosphere, completing the cycle. Organic Compounds: These represent carbon-containing molecules derived from living organisms, such as carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Organic compounds play a crucial role in the carbon cycle, as they store and release energy through various metabolic processes, transfer carbon between different parts of the Earth's system, and serve as building blocks for the formation of new living organisms. The other options in the list (energy, chemical energy, flow of electrons, heat energy, oxidation reaction, and temperature) are related to various processes and reactions that take place within the carbon cycle or within living organisms, but they are not directly controlled by the carbon cycle or transferred between organisms and the atmosphere in the same way as CO2 and organic compounds. For example, energy and chemical energy are involved in processes like photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and decomposition; the flow of electrons and oxidation reactions are essential for driving these processes; and heat energy and temperature are critical factors that influence the rates and mechanisms of biological and geochemical processes occurring in the carbon cycle. However, these factors are not directly exchanged between organisms and the atmosphere as part of the carbon cycle."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Bu nedenle, Türkiye'nin dış politikası tarih boyunca sürekli olarak değişimler ve zorluklarla karşı karşıya kalmıştır. Bu yazıda, Türkiye'nin dış politikasındaki değişimleri ve zorlukları incelenmektedir. 1. İttihat ve Terakki Döneminden Cumhuriyet Dönemine Geçiş (1908-1923): Türkiye'nin dış politikası, İmparatorluk döneminden Cumhuriyet dönemine geçerken büyük değişimler yaşamıştır. Osmanlı İmparatorluğu'nun zayıflaması ve I. Dünya Savaşı'nda müttefiklerle savaşması, Türkiye'nin dış politikada önemli dengeleme hareketleri yapmasına sebep oldu. Bu süre zarfında, milli direnişin lideri Mustafa Kemal Atatürk'ün önderliğinde, Türkiye uluslararası düzeyde daha bağımsız bir politika izlemeye başladı. 2. Soğuk Savaş Dönemi (1945-1991): İkinci Dünya Savaşı'nın ardından, Türkiye Batı dünyasıyla daha yakın ilişkiler kurarak anti-komünist bloğun bir parçası oldu. NATO üyeliği ve ABD ile Ortadoğu politikasında işbirliği, Türkiye'nin dış politikadaki önceliklerinden oldu. Soğuk Savaş dönemi boyunca Türkiye'nin dış politikası, NATO üyeliği ile güvenliği sağlama ve ülke çıkarlarını koruma üzerine odaklanmıştır. 3. Post-Sovyet Dönemi ve Avrupalılaşma Süreci (1991-2000): Türkiye'nin dış politikasının bir başka önemli değişimi, Soğuk Savaş'ın sona ermesi ve Avrupa Birliği (AB) ile ilişkilerin geliştirilmesi oldu. Türkiye, güney ve doğu komşuları, Balkan ülkeleri, Kafkaslar ve Orta Asya Cumhuriyetleri ile ilişkilerini artırmaya çalışırken, AB ile de daha yakın ilişkiler kurmaya çalıştı. Bu dönem, Türkiye'nin dış politikasında Avrupa entegrasyonu ve AB üyeliği süreci öncelikli hale geldi. 4. AK Parti Dönemi ve Yeni Dış Politika Vizyonu (2002-Günümüz): 21. yüzyılın başında Türkiye'nin dış politikasının da önemli bir değişim yaşandı. Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi (AKP) iktidara geldiğinde, Türkiye'nin dış politikası daha da çeşitlilik gösterdi. Türkiye, Ortadoğu, Afrika, Latin Amerika ve Asya ülkeleri ile daha etkin ve önemli bir dış politikayı benimsedi ve aktifleştirdi. Bu dönemde, Türkiye'nin dış politikası enerji kaynaklarının güvenliği, ekonomik işbirliği ve kültürel etkileşimi öne çıkardı. Tüm bu değişimlere rağmen, Türkiye'nin dış politikasındaki çeşitli zorluklar da görmezden gelinemez. Bu zorluklar, dış politika hedeflerinin gerçekleştirilmesini zorlaştıran bölgesel ve küresel konuları içerir. Örnek olarak, Türkiye'yi zorlayan zorluklar arasında Kürt meselesi, Suriye krizi ve göç meselesi sayılabilir. Ayrıca Türkiye'nin Avrupa Birliği üyelik sürecinde yaşanan gerginlikler, Türkiye'nin dış politikasındaki potansiyel zorluklar arasında yer almaktadır. Sonuç olarak, Türkiye'nin dış politikası, tarih boyunca farklı dönemlerde farklı değişimler ve zorluklar yaşamıştır. Türkiye'nin dış politikasının geleceği ise, ülkenin iç dinamikleri ve uluslararası ortamın değişen koşullarına bağlı olarak şekillenecektir."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

It clearly defines the geographical relationship between Buda and Pest as they make up the city of Budapest. Budapest, the capital city of Hungary, is uniquely and historically divided into two distinct parts by the Danube River. Buda, the older, hilly side, lies on the western bank of the river and is known for its historic architecture, charming cobbled streets, and the iconic Buda Castle. On the other hand, Pest, the flat and more modern part, is situated on the eastern bank of the river and boasts a lively city center with bustling businesses, shops, and Parliament building. The two parts of Budapest are connected by a number of remarkable bridges, the most famous being the Chain Bridge, a suspension bridge that was the first permanent structure to span the Danube. Other bridges connecting both halves of the city include the Elisabeth Bridge, Liberty Bridge, and Margaret Bridge, each with their own history and architectural significance. Having Buda and Pest as separate yet connected halves lends a unique character to Budapest, and the series of bridges that join these areas create a harmonious union between the city's ancient past and contemporary present. Moreover, the bridges are not only functional in nature, but also serve as architectural and historical symbols of the city's growth and development throughout the years. In summary, based on the given paragraph, it is safe and accurate to conclude that Budapest indeed comprises two parts - Buda and Pest - which are located on opposite sides of the river and connected by a series of bridges. This geographical and architectural composition is an essential aspect of the city's identity and allure to both residents and tourists alike."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English. I will choose Spanish because it is a widely spoken language and many people can understand it. Step 2: Identify a subject and verb for the sentence. I will use \\"el gato\\" (the cat) as the subject and \\"duerme\\" (sleeps) as the verb. These words are simple and commonly known among Spanish speakers. Step 3: Combine the subject and verb into a complete sentence. In Spanish, the subject typically comes before the verb, so the sentence should be structured as \\"El gato duerme.\\" Final sentence in Spanish: \\"El gato duerme.\\" This translates to \\"The cat sleeps\\" in English."},{"instruction":"Q: Who was known as a reformer in Strasbourg? A: Martin Bucer was a prominent Protestant reformer in the region. Does the answer correctly answer the question Choose from: (1). yes; (2). no;","output":"(1). yes; Martin Bucer (1491-1551) was indeed known as a reformer in Strasbourg. Born in Alsace, which was part of the Holy Roman Empire, Bucer later emerged as one of the key leaders of the Protestant Reformation in Strasbourg. He was a theologian, pastor, and diplomat, and maintained close connections with other prominent figures of the time, such as Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and Philipp Melanchthon. Bucer initially joined the Dominican Order as a young man but eventually left in favor of the Reformation movement. He embraced the teachings of Martin Luther and later became acquainted with many leading humanists and theologians. In 1523, Bucer became a pastor at the St. Aurelia church in Strasbourg, where he focused on implementing religious reforms. As a reformer in Strasbourg, Bucer played a prominent role in shaping the character of the Reformation in the city and the surrounding region. For instance, he wrote influential theological works and commentaries on various books of the Bible. He also worked on creating a unified liturgy for protestant churches in Strasbourg, simplified the religious services, and emphasized preaching and the ministry of the Word. His impact as a reformer reached beyond Strasbourg as well. He participated in important colloquies, such as the Marburg Colloquy and the Regensburg Colloquy, where he sought to mediate between different Protestant factions. Bucer's diplomacy and leadership in the German-speaking Reformation contributed to the establishment of religious peace between Catholics and Protestants with the Augsburg Interim. In conclusion, Martin Bucer was indeed known as a reformer in Strasbourg and played a crucial role in shaping the Reformation movement not only in the city but also within the broader European context."},{"instruction":"Translate the following.

The residents are convinced that Nick is in town on an investigation, despite Nick's repeated denials. However, when aircraft factory employee Peter Berton (Ralph Brooks) seeks out Nick and is shot dead before he can reveal anything, Nick is on the case. An old childhood friend, Dr. Bruce Clayworth (Lloyd Corrigan), performs the autopsy and extracts a pistol bullet. Then, when Nick searches Berton's room for clues, he is knocked unconscious by Crazy Mary (Anne Revere), a local eccentric. Nora's innocent purchase of a painting for Nick's birthday present turns out to be the key to the mystery. When she shows it to her husband, it brings back unpleasant memories for him, so she donates it to a charity bazaar. When Edgar Draque (Leon Ames) offers Nora a large sum for the painting, Nick wonders why it is so valuable. Nick learns that Draque's wife Helena (Helen Vinson) bought the artwork, but she is knocked out and the painting disappears. Nick discovers that Crazy Mary is Berton's mother and goes to see her, only to come across her lifeless body. Nick and Nora's dog Asta finds the painting in her shack. Nick puts the pieces together and has the police bring all the suspects to his father's house.

Question 2: How does Twitter define their target market? OPTIONS: *no. *yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these questions, I will first research and analyze how MeetMe and Twitter define their target markets and then determine if the answer to both questions is the same. Step 1: Research and analyze MeetMe's target market. MeetMe is a social networking platform primarily focused on connecting users based on similar interests, facilitating new friendships, and allowing them to maintain connections. Their target market consists of people interested in expanding their social network, meeting new friends, and engaging in online chatting and socializing. They particularly target younger demographic users, aged 18-34, who are actively seeking new connections with people nearby and around the world. Step 2: Research and analyze Twitter's target market. Twitter is a microblogging and social networking platform where users express their thoughts, ideas, news, and opinions through short messages called 'tweets.' Its target market is broader, as it is more diverse in terms of age and user interests. Twitter aims to reach anyone who wants to stay updated on the latest news and trends, join various conversations, or follow their favorite personalities, brands, and influencers. They accommodate anyone from casual users, businesses, journalists, celebrities, and politicians. Step 3: Compare the target markets of MeetMe and Twitter. MeetMe's target market is more focused on facilitating new friendships and connections, while Twitter's target market is much broader, aiming to engage users in multiple ways, including following the latest news, joining conversations, and following their interests. Step 4: Determine if the answer to both questions is the same. Given the differences in their target markets, the answer to both questions would not be the same. MeetMe is more narrowly focused on a younger demographic and building new connections, whereas Twitter targets a wider range of users with varied objectives and interests."},{"instruction":"Question: Question: It was a popular and common gift this year, so he headed to the what where it would be easy to find?

Christmas tree b. Christmas stocking c. Specialty store d. Department store e. Closet Step 2: Identify the context The context of the question is finding a popular and common gift this year. Step 3: Eliminate irrelevant options a. Christmas tree and b. Christmas stocking are not places to find gifts after they have been bought, so they can be eliminated. e. Closet is a location inside a house and not a place to shop for gifts, so it can be eliminated as well. Step 4: Compare the remaining options c. Specialty store: These are stores focusing on specific categories of products, so they might not have the popular and common gift. d. Department store: These are larger retail establishments that sell a wide variety of products, including popular and common gifts for the year. Step 5: Choose the best option Since the question mentions that the gift is both popular and common this year, it would be more likely to be found in a department store rather than a specialty store. A department store carries a wide range of products and caters to the general public, making it easier to find popular and common gifts. Therefore, the answer is \\"department store.\\""},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"As an AI, I can understand and write in numerous languages. Here is a sentence in French: \\"Le chat est assis sur le canapé et regarde attentivement les oiseaux à l'extérieur de la fenêtre.\\" Translation: \\"The cat is sitting on the sofa and watching the birds outside the window attentively.\\" French is a Romance language spoken primarily in France, as well as in several other countries including Belgium, Switzerland, and Canada. The language is known for its rich history and cultural influence, having a multifaceted role in literature, arts, politics, and diplomacy. In this particular sentence, several grammatical components illustrate the intricacy of the French language. Firstly, the subject and noun \\"le chat\\" (the cat) is followed by the verb \\"être\\" (to be) in its conjugated form \\"est\\" to form \\"Le chat est\\" (The cat is). The verb has to agree with the subject in terms of number and person, which lends to the complexity and variety found within the language. The location of the cat is specified using \\"assis\\" (sitting) and the preposition \\"sur\\" (on), followed by the noun \\"le canapé\\" (the sofa), creating the phrase \\"assis sur le canapé\\" (sitting on the sofa). Prepositions in French are essential for indicating relationships between words, such as location or time, and are often similar in usage to their English counterparts. The second part of the sentence involves the use of the coordinating conjunction \\"et\\" (and) to join two actions together: \\"regarde\\" (watches) and \\"assis\\" (sitting). This conjunction implies that the cat is performing both actions simultaneously, which helps create a vivid image in the reader's mind. The action being performed by the cat is watching \\"les oiseaux\\" (the birds), which appears as the direct object of the verb \\"regarde.\\" \\"Attentivement\\" (attentively) is an adverb used to modify \\"regarde,\\" specifying how the cat is watching the birds. Lastly, the prepositional phrase \\"à l'extérieur de la fenêtre\\" (outside the window) provides further context for the scene. The preposition \\"à\\" (at or to) and the noun \\"l'extérieur\\" (the outside) together create the phrase \\"à l'extérieur\\" (to the outside). \\"De\\" (of) is another preposition used to form a partitive expression with \\"la fenêtre\\" (the window), providing a clearer image of where the birds are located in relation to the cat and its activity. This French sentence is an excellent example of the language's rich and diverse syntax, providing a glimpse into the beautiful intricacies of the French language."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to find appropriate games for kids on android Go to settings.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"If the premise is true that Jerusalem was still reeling from the effects of the Persian devastation and was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam, it is not directly conclusive that the hypothesis stating Jerusalem was conquered after a bloody battle is also true. To make this conclusion, we need to evaluate additional historical information and context about the conquest of Jerusalem. The premise contains two main facts: 1. Jerusalem was still recovering from the effects of the Persian devastation. 2. Jerusalem was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam. While these two facts provide some background information regarding the vulnerability and state of the city at the time, they do not give us enough information on the nature of the battle which took place when Jerusalem was conquered by Islamic forces. We need more information on events that occurred during the conquest, such as troop movements, engagements, casualties, or the overall strategy deployed by the Islamic forces. Historically, it is known that there were indeed conflicts and battles that occurred during the Islamic conquest of the Levant, which includes Jerusalem. The forces of Islam, under the command of Caliph Umar, sought to spread their rule in this region during the 7th century. It is documented that Caliph Umar's forces did face resistance from the Byzantine Empire, which controlled Jerusalem at the time. Although there were military engagements and sieges during this period, historical records reveal that the actual capture of Jerusalem occurred through a peaceful surrender under specific terms, as opposed to a violent and bloody battle. Therefore, the hypothesis that Jerusalem was conquered after a bloody battle does not directly follow from the premise provided. In conclusion, it is not possible to confirm that the hypothesis is true based solely on the premise provided, as the premise does not offer enough information about the nature of the battle during the Islamic conquest of Jerusalem.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"Both questions generally address the same topic, which is the existence and survival of the Children of the Forest in the context of HBO's Game of Thrones television adaptation. However, while the first question asks if all the Children of the Forest are dead, implying inquiry about the entire TV series, the second question is more specific as it focuses on their status up until Season 6, Episode 5 of the show. **As the response below contains spoilers from Game of Thrones, proceed at your own risk.** To answer the first question, the TV series suggests that all the Children of the Forest are dead by the end of Season 8. In the earlier seasons, the Children are portrayed as an ancient and dying race of magical beings who are closely connected to nature. The Children, along with their alliances, played a pivotal role in defending Westeros from the Night King and the White Walkers. Unfortunately, multiple instances throughout the series suggest that the remaining Children were killed during numerous battles, most significantly against the wights and White Walkers during Bran Stark's venture beyond the Wall. The character Leaf, a member of the Children, sacrifices herself in Season 6, Episode 5 to save Bran and Meera by causing an explosion to delay the wights. After this instance, no more Children of the Forest are shown or mentioned in the remainder of the series, leading to the assumption that they are now extinct. As for the second question, after watching Season 6, Episode 5, there is no evidence that any Children of the Forest remain alive. By this point in the series, the multiple attacks by the wights and White Walkers appeared to have taken their toll on the Children's already dwindling population. While it is theoretically possible that a few members of their species have survived in some concealed location, there is no indication of this in the show's narrative. Thus, the knowledge imparted by Game of Thrones leads viewers to presume that the Children have been wiped out by the conclusion of Episode 5 in Season 6. In summary, both questions share a common theme relating to the fate of the Children of the Forest in Game of Thrones. The first query is broader, questioning the ultimate survival of their species, whereas the second query revolves around a more specific timeline up until Season 6, Episode 5. In both cases, however, it is implied that the Children of the Forest are dead and possibly extinct by the end of the series."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Galician.

Presuming Freddie responsible, Sophie's aggressive father loses his cool and attempts to assault Freddie.

She asks him if he has also told his wife about her pregnancy. On his way home, he encounters a ferocious wind. It turns out to be an attack helicopter, which runs him off the road. In a panic, he flees through the woods and drops his heart medication. At an outdoor chapel, he sits on a bench as the helicopter hovers in front of him. The pilot, Angus Montier, shoots at the ground near him despite the protests of his copilot and brother, Dorian. The shots scare him enough to cause a fatal heart attack. Throughout their attack, Dorian and Angus can hear the chatter of Sally and her coworkers. Likewise, they can hear the helicopter pilots on their headsets. The next day, the police inform Beatrice Lever that Henry has died. She appears shocked and crestfallen, when Dorian and Angus arrive. It quickly becomes clear that she encouraged her sons to scare him to death. She is also furious about his affair, and wants revenge on his mistress. Angus and Dorian are worried that the people they heard on the radio might have overheard enough to connect them to his death.

The sentence mentions that Nasser was especially influenced by Tawfiq al-Hakim's novel \\"Return of the Spirit.\\" Tawfiq al-Hakim was an Egyptian writer, and while not a politician himself, his work played a significant role in shaping Nasser's views on leadership and his aspirations for Egypt. Al-Hakim wrote about the need for a unifying figure who could encapsulate the feelings and desires of the Egyptian people, symbolizing their collective objectives. From this information, we can infer that Nasser admired leaders who embodied such qualities, striving to bring the Egyptian people together to achieve their shared goals. As a prominent political figure in Egypt, Nasser was known for his role in toppling the monarchy in the 1952 Egyptian Revolution and leading the country as its second president from 1956 to 1970. Nasser championed pan-Arabism, anti-imperialism, and socialism, working towards the development and unification of Arab nations. While the given sentence doesn't name a specific politician that Nasser admired, some of his contemporaries include figures like Jawaharlal Nehru (the first Prime Minister of India), Josip Broz Tito (the President of Yugoslavia), and Sukarno (the first President of Indonesia). Nasser, along with these leaders, was part of the Non-Aligned Movement, allowing us to assume that he might have had admiration for them. In conclusion, although the sentence does not directly answer the question about which politician Nasser admired, it provides insight into the type of leader he respected and the literature that influenced his political ideology. To answer the question more explicitly, further research or information would be required to pinpoint specific politicians that Nasser held in high regard."},{"instruction":"The Election Information Services operated at mayors offices help to inform the population nominating organisations and candidates with regard to issues related to the completion of the elections Could you correct the punctuation please?","output":"The Election Information Services, operated at mayors' offices, help to inform the population, nominating organizations, and candidates with regard to issues related to the completion of the elections."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Haeundae is a popular destination known for its beautiful beaches, attracting millions of visitors every year. As a hub for tourism and leisure, it is one of the most iconic spots in South Korea. The movie \\"Haeundae\\" is a 2009 South Korean disaster film that centers around the lives of various characters and their personal struggles, who eventually come together when a tsunami hits the Haeundae district where they reside. Man-sik, a local of Haeundae, had once accidentally caused the death of Yeon-hee's father during a deep-sea fishing trip during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The guilt continues to haunt Man-sik, and he is unable to pursue Yeon-hee. Yeon-hee, unaware of what happened to her father, tries to build a relationship with Man-sik. Meanwhile, other interesting characters appear throughout the film, including Dong-choon and Seung-hyun's Grandma, who engage in illegal activities to make money but ultimately get caught by the police. Seung-hyun then meets Ji-min and tries to prepare him for a job interview, while Man-sik finally decides to propose to Yeon-hee during a night of fireworks.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Pole vaulting is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible pole (which today is usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber) as an aid to jump over a bar. Pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient Greeks, Cretans and Celts. It has been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and 2000 for women. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - Konstadinos Filippidis ( Greek : ; born 26 November 1986 in Athens ) is a Greek pole vaulter . - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Attica (or ; or ) is a historical region that encompasses the city of Athens, the capital of Greece. The historical region is centered on the Attic peninsula, which projects into the Aegean Sea. The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world. - Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf. - A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Greek and means the \\"mother city\\" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city in a nation.

Q: Passage: On 31 December 1543, Henry and Charles had signed a treaty pledging to invade France in person by 20 June 1544; each was to provide an army of no less than 35,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry for the venture. Against this Francis could muster about 70,000 men in his various armies. The campaign could not begin, however, until Henry and Charles had resolved their personal conflicts with Scotland and the German princes, respectively. On 15 May, Henry was informed by Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, that, after his raids, Scotland was no longer in a position to threaten him; he then began to make preparations for a personal campaign in France—against the advice of his council and the Emperor, who believed that his presence would be a hindrance. Charles had meanwhile reached an understanding with the princes at the Diet of Speyer, and the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg had agreed to join his invasion of France. By May 1544, two Imperial armies were poised to invade France: one, under Ferrante Gonzaga, Viceroy of Sicily, north of Luxemburg; the other, under Charles himself, in the Palatinate. Charles had gathered a combined force of more than 42,000 for the invasion, and had arranged for another 4,000 men to join the English army. On 25 May, Gonzaga captured Luxembourg and moved towards Commercy and Ligny, issuing a proclamation that the Emperor had come to overthrow \\"a tyrant allied to the Turks\\". On 8 July, Gonzaga besieged Saint-Dizier; Charles and the second Imperial army soon joined him. Question: How many troops did Henry and Charles agree to provide, combined, at minimum? Answer type: Number A:","output":"84,000"},{"instruction":"Barb and Jill practiced small scale farming. Jill farmed the conventional way, while barb used the no-tillage method. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farmer didn't cause the predation of the crop itself? A:","output":"A: It is not explicitly stated in the given paragraph the predation of the crop for either farmer. However, we can provide some insights into the farming methods used by both Barb and Jill. Barb and Jill practiced small-scale farming, with Jill using conventional methods and Barb adopting the no-tillage farming approach. Conventional farming typically involves tillage, which is the practice of turning over and breaking up the soil to prepare the land for crop planting. On the other hand, no-tillage farming is an approach that involves planting crops directly into the soil without prior soil disturbance, maintaining soil structure and organic matter content. Now, considering the impacts of these methods on crop predation, tillage in conventional farming can increase the risk of soil erosion, reduce soil biodiversity, and negatively impact the overall ecological balance, possibly leading to an increase in crop predators. No-tillage farming helps maintain soil structure and allows for a more stable environment for organisms in the soil, which promotes natural predator-prey relationships and can help in controlling crop predators. However, it's essential to point out that crop predation isn't solely determined by the chosen farming method. Factors such as the presence of natural predators, the use of pesticides and other pest control measures, crop varieties, and local ecological factors could also influence the predation of the crop. In conclusion, we cannot determine from the given paragraph which farmer, if any, didn't cause the predation of the crop itself. However, we can infer that Barb's choice of the no-tillage method might have contributed to a better ecological balance, potentially mitigating crop predation risks as compared to Jill's conventional farming approach."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the brother to whom Ray Davies refers when he states, \\"I'll never say never with my brother, because he's totally unpredictable\\"? ?

The emergency alarm rang and so I could hardly hear the phone because the","output":"noise was incredibly loud, drowning out any sound that might have come through the speakers. It felt as if the cacophony of the alarm resonated deep inside my core, making it nearly impossible to concentrate on anything else. As the alarm continued to blare, my heart raced and my palms grew sweaty with anxiety. The urgency of the situation was undeniable, and I knew I had to act quickly to protect myself and those around me. Here I was, struggling to comprehend what the person on the other end of the phone was trying to tell me, while the deafening siren kept on echoing throughout the entire building. In those few frantic moments, it was clear that this was no mere coincidence. The back-to-back events of the emergency alarm going off and the phone call appeared to be connected somehow. Questions raced through my mind: Was this a planned emergency? Was the person on the phone trying to relay vital information or instructions? Or was it all just a cruel twist of fate, with two unrelated scenarios converging to create a sense of chaos and danger? I tried to get my bearings and focus on the task at hand. I shut my eyes tightly and pressed the phone even closer to my ear, desperately trying to catch a faint word or sentence that would shed light on the situation. The increasing tension in the room was almost tangible, thick with concern and fear. Time seemed to slow down, and every second that ticked away felt like an eternity. Finally, just when I felt like I was at my breaking point, the alarm began to fade and lose its intensity. The sound of the phone call started to become clearer. In that moment, I clung to every syllable the person on the other end of the line shared. Their voice was strained but carried an air of authority, which helped me gather my wits and prepare to deal with the dangerous situation unfolding before me. As the siren continued to dissipate, it became apparent that I was receiving important instructions that would prove crucial in the moments to come. The individual on the phone relayed information about the nature of the emergency, the steps we needed to take to mitigate the risks, and the potential consequences we could face if we failed to act promptly and decisively. The chaos that had been swirling around me revealed itself to be a well-orchestrated ballet of coordinated actions designed to keep everyone safe. As colleagues followed the instructions I had received and began to file out in a calm and orderly manner, the building slowly transformed from a cacophonous mess into a place of quiet purpose. Ultimately, the phone call's importance could not be overstated. It served as a beacon of information in a sea of confusion and chaos, guiding not only myself but those around me to safety. That day, the emergency alarm rang and so I could hardly hear the phone because the noise was incredibly loud, but that did not stop us from banding together and relying on clear communication to navigate a harrowing and uncertain situation."},{"instruction":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: A piece of art is outside for people to admire.","output":"To find the keywords in a sentence, I will identify the main subjects and actions that are significant for understanding the overall meaning. 1.

Of this group, the focus is on Jack Kelley (Christian Bale),who one day dreams of heading out west to the wide-open spaces of Santa Fe.One day, Jack meets Les Jacobs (Luke Edwards) and David Jacobs (David Moscow), two brothers who've turned to selling newspapers to support their family, after their father was fired when a machine accident left him unable to work. Jack soon teaches Les and Jacobs some interesting lessons about how to sell papers (such as sensationalizing headlines).Shortly afterwards, the boys are challenged when the 'World' newspaper's owner, Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall), raises their purchase rate by 1/10 of a cent. Though seemingly a drop in the bucket for Pulitzer (who hopes to use the added funds to keep competing with his closest competitor, William Randolph Hearst), the increase is a significant price gouge for the Newsies. With David supplying input and ideas, Jack becomes the leader of the group.

I would also need tools such as a screwdriver, a hammer, and possibly a power drill depending on the kit. Step 2: Assess and organize the components I would lay out all the pieces provided in the kit, identifying the different parts by examining their shapes, sizes, and hole patterns. I would then group them accordingly to make the assembly process more efficient. Step 3: Read and understand the assembly instructions Before starting the assembly, I would carefully read through the instructions provided in the kit. This is important to ensure that I understand how each piece fits together and to avoid making mistakes during the assembly process. Step 4: Begin assembly by attaching the frame pieces Following the assembly instructions, I would identify the pieces that make up the frame of the bookshelf. Typically, this would involve attaching the sides to the top and bottom pieces using screws and appropriate hardware. Step 5: Install the shelves Next, I would identify the pieces meant to serve as shelves and attach them to the frame by following the instructions. This usually includes sliding the shelves into pre-cut slots or using brackets and screws to secure them in place. Step 6: Secure the bookshelf to the wall (if applicable) If the kit includes a wall-mounting bracket, I would then follow the instructions on how to properly secure the bookshelf to the wall. This step is important for safety reasons, especially if the bookshelf is tall and could potentially tip over. Step 7: Perform a final check Once the bookshelf is fully assembled, I would double-check the entire structure to ensure that everything is secure and correctly installed according to the instructions. This might involve tightening any loose screws or adjusting the positioning of the shelves.

Instead, the response explains the uniform design of the compact disc and how it contributed to the CD dominating the at-home music market. A better and more detailed answer to the question would be: CD players became available for purchase in 1982. Philips and Sony had collaborated to develop the compact disc and its associated technologies, aiming to create a standard for digital audio storage and playback. In October 1982, the first commercial CD player, Sony's CDP-101, was released initially in Japan and made its way to other markets in the following months. The adoption of the CD format was initially slow due to high prices for both the players and the discs. However, over the next few years, the costs reduced and the technology improved, leading to a rapid increase in CD sales. During the 1990s, CD players became the preferred medium for home music listening, replacing cassette tapes and vinyl records. The unified design of the compact disc, as outlined in the original answer, was indeed one of the factors that contributed to its widespread success, as consumers could purchase any disc or player from any company. The huge improvements in sound quality and durability compared to previous formats were also significant factors in the CD's dominance. While new technologies and music formats have emerged in recent years, the CD remains a viable option for home music listening for many people."},{"instruction":"If \\"A girl with vibrantly colored clothing is jumping in the air.\\" does that mean that \\"The girl in bright clothes is jumping.\\"?

Check the “About Us” or “Mission Statement” page of their website so you can see what they value and be sure to mention them in your interview so you come across as knowledgeable. If the company doesn't have a website you can check, look on sites like LinkedIn or Glassdoor to see past reviews and employees talk about the company. Check the company's social media accounts if they have any to see how they interact with others and what types of posts they make. Research competitors for the company you're interviewing with to get a better understanding of the overall industry. As you research the company, check the website to see if they have photos of their employees so you can determine the dress code. If you can't find anything online, call the company's HR department and ask them about their dress code so you can prepare. In most business casual interviews, a buttoned shirt with a tie or a blouse with a jacket will work fine. In a business formal setting, wear a suit or a professional-looking dress. Avoid wearing open-toed shoes, shorts, or revealing clothes to an interview. Be punctual to show the employer that you take the position seriously. Check your route the night before your interview and leave early enough so you can get to the location 10-15 minutes before your interview starts. Once you arrive, let the employer know you've arrived since you may be able to interview at an earlier time. If you have a phone or Skype interview, make sure you're ready and everything is set up 10 minutes in advance so you aren't in a rush. When the employer is ready for the interview, make eye contact with them and smile. Introduce yourself by name, being sure not to interrupt or talk over them. Offer a firm handshake and try not to squeeze too hard or else it will come off as too aggressive. As you shake their hand, you may say, “Hi, I'm Jane Smith. It's a pleasure to meet you.” When you first start, let the employer know you appreciate the time they're giving you for the interview. As you're settling into the interview, you can ask questions about their day so far or how long they've been with the company to show that you're genuinely interested in them. Follow the interviewer's lead in the conversation, so shift from small talk to job-related questions when they do. For example, you may start off by saying, “How has the week treated you so far?” to interact with them. Small talk works great if you need to walk to a different room for the interview. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides tips for job interview preparation, emphasizing the importance of researching the company's history, values, and competitors by checking their website, LinkedIn and Glassdoor profiles, and social media accounts.

Algae that grows on the surface of wood can provide food for certain kinds of fish. Driftwood is a popular choice because of its twisting shape. You can sew carpet moss onto a piece of driftwood to combine wood and plant life, making the tank more resemble a natural underwater habitat. Boil any structure you plan to put in the tank in water before introducing it to your tank. Boiling will sterilize your wood or rock to make it safe for your aquarium. Boiling wood will kill any bacteria on it and remove tannins that can stain the water. Fish will also often hide behind rocks. Rocks have a variety of shapes and colors, so you can look for rocks that you think add to your overall theme. Choose rocks that speak to your sense of style. Avoid having large rocks directly touch the glass. Over time, the rocks may damage the glass, causing stress fractures or cracks. After boiling rocks, soak them overnight and then brush them to remove loose particles. These can include the typical castles and pirate treasure, or you can go for something more imaginative. Consider getting a few decorations in different sizes to provide different territories. Like plants, structures give fish hiding places that they enjoy. Some structures can add oxygen to the water. Be very careful when buying decorations with holes or small spaces. While these can be ideal hiding places for smaller fish, larger fish can become stuck and get injured or even die trying to get out. Be sure any hole or archway is significantly larger than your largest fish. If you have young fish, keep in mind their full grown size when picking out such decorations. Experiment with the placement of your decorations to find something that is aesthetically pleasing to you. Having one main decoration that is larger than everything else can provide a good focal point, but also make sure it won't crowd your tank. Balance items with empty space. If one side of your aquarium is going to face a wall, consider attaching a background to it. These simple sheets of plastic can be bought at any pet store, and come printed with beautiful pictures, from undersea plants to deserts. A simple black background will lend a very professional look, hiding cords and tubing and making the colors in your aquarium stand out, especially if you have a lot of plants. If your aquarium is looking a little sparse, a background printed with plants or coral reefs can give the impression of a much lusher environment. Choose a background that fits your theme. An image of a coral reef suggests a natural space. You could go in the other direction with something like a space-themed background if you want a more unique theme. Measure your tank before going to the store, and buy a piece at least 1\\" longer than your tank to account for uneven edges. When you get home, cut it down to the proper size and tape it to the outside of the back of your aquarium. Summary:","output":"The article talks about how wood and rocks can decorate your fish tank. Wood, like driftwood, can be used to make your tank look like nature, and even add food for some fish. Before putting wood in the tank, it needs to be boiled to get rid of things that can harm the fish or make the water dirty. Rocks can be used too, but they shouldn't touch the glass and need to be cleaned first. There's also other kinds of decorations you can use, but be careful if they have holes that fish might get stuck in. Also, if you have a side of your tank that's going to be next to a wall, you might want to put a background picture on it. This can be a picture of something like plants, a coral reef, or even space - you pick what you like! When you buy a background, make sure it's a little bit bigger than your tank so you can cut it to the right size at home."},{"instruction":"Write a summary based on this article: How much is a human testicle worth? A Pennsylvania jury this week ballparked its value at nearly 900,000. That's how much the Huntingdon County panel decided Steven Hanes, a 54-year-old Mount Union man, should receive in damages because a doctor removed the wrong testicle during an operation in June 2013. The jury of 11 women and one man reached that verdict against Dr. Valley Spencer Long and the J.C. Blair Memorial Hospital in Huntingdon on Wednesday at the end of a 2 1/2-day civil trial. Braden R. Lepisto, Hanes' lawyer, said Thursday that the verdict appears to be the first monetary award to be granted by a jury in a medical malpractice case in Huntingdon County in more than 25 years. The big question here is: How could something like this happen? \\"That was my thought when we first got this case,\\" said Lepisto, of the Philadelphia law firm Kline & Specter. \\"We just felt the evidence was so obvious.\\" Hanes claimed in his suit that he went to Long, a urologist, because he was experiencing chronic pain in his right testicle. Although other, less invasive procedures were options, Long recommended surgery, Lepisto said. In the operating room, Long removed Hanes' healthy left testicle while leaving the damaged right one in place, Hanes' suit states. Hanes claimed the doctor was \\"reckless\\" in failing to properly identify the testicle that was supposed to be removed. Court filings show Long wrote in a post-operative report that \\"it appeared that the left testicle and cord may actually have been removed instead of the right one.\\" Hanes claimed Long told him as much during a follow-up visit. \\"The conduct of the doctor during the surgery indicated he had no idea which testicle he was removing,\\" Lepisto said. \\"Steve had the right testicle pain for 15 years before he went to see Dr. Long. He wanted to relieve the pain,\\" Lepisto added. \\"Four years later Steve continues to have the pain. He's had more frequent pain.\\" He added that Hanes now has a \\"debilitating fear\\" of having the ailment treated because of what happened. Lepisto said that if the problem right testicle does eventually have to be removed, Hanes would have to undergo testosterone replacement therapy for the rest of his life. He noted that his firm is pursuing another pending malpractice case over a patient who died under Long's care. The doctor, now 77, is no longer performing surgeries, Lepisto said. In rendering its verdict against Long and the hospital, the jury awarded Hanes 620,000 in damages for pain and suffering and 250,000 in punitive damages against Long for \\"reckless indifference.\\" The verdict can be appealed. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process of magnetizing a piece of metal using conductive copper wire and an electric current involves understanding the main elements and concepts involved. Let's analyze each component and how they work together to create a temporary magnet. 1. Conductive Copper Wire: Copper wire is used as a conductor due to its ability to efficiently transmit electricity with minimal energy loss. In this instance, the copper wire will be wrapped around a piece of metal to create a solenoid, which is a type of electromagnet. 2. Piece of Metal: The metal selected for this process needs to have ferromagnetic properties, which means it can be magnetized and attracted to a magnet. Commonly used metals for this purpose include iron, nickel, and cobalt. 3. Electric Current: An electric current is a flow of electric charge, typically through a closed loop. In this case, the current will be introduced from an external power source, and it will flow through the wrapped copper wire, which will act as a conductor. 4. Creation of Magnetic Field: As the electric current flows through the conductive copper wire, it generates a magnetic field around the wire. This magnetic field is directly proportional to the magnitude and direction of the current passing through the wire. 5. Magnetization of Metal: When the magnetic field generated by the copper wire interacts with the ferromagnetic metal, the metal becomes magnetized. This means that the metal now has a North and South pole and can attract other ferromagnetic materials. 6. Temporary Magnet: Since the magnetization of the metal is entirely dependent on the external electric current, the metal will only remain magnetic as long as the current is present. When the current is turned off, the magnetic field disappears, and the metal becomes demagnetized. In summary, the first step of the process of magnetizing a piece of metal with a conductive copper wire and an electric current is understanding the main elements involved, such as the copper wire, ferromagnetic metal, electric current, and the process of magnetization. With this knowledge, one can then proceed to wrap the copper wire around the metal, introduce an electric current, and create a magnetic field, ultimately resulting in the temporary magnetization of the metal."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Ryan was born in Refugio, south of Victoria in south Texas, the youngest of six children, to Lynn Nolan Ryan Sr. (1907-1970), and the former Martha Lee Hancock (1913-1990). The senior Ryan operated a newspaper delivery service for the Houston Post that required him to rise in the early morning hours to prepare 1,500 newspapers for delivery over a 55-mile route. The children were expected to help with the daily tasks. In 1965, after graduating from Alvin High School, Ryan was drafted by the New York Mets in the 12th round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft. He was assigned the minor league Marion Mets in the Appalachian League. When Ryan was called up to the New York club the following year, he was the second-youngest player in the league. His first strikeout was Pat Jarvis, and he gave up his first major league home run to Joe Torre, a future NL MVP and Hall of Fame big-league manager. Ryan missed much of the 1967 season due to illness, an arm injury, and service with the Army Reserve; he pitched only 7 innings for the Mets' minor league affiliate in Jacksonville. Ryan returned to the major leagues to stay starting with the 1968 season. Ryan was unable to crack the Mets' pitching rotation, led by Tom Seaver and Jerry Koosman. Ryan was used more as a reliever and spot starter by the 1969 Mets. To deal with frequent blisters on his throwing hand he often soaked his fingers in pickle brine, although the technique's effectiveness was questioned by Ryan's teammates and coaches. Ryan pitched well for the Miracle Mets in the 1969 postseason. Against the Braves in the NLCS, Ryan completed a Mets sweep by throwing seven innings of relief in Game 3, getting his first playoff win (it would take him 12 years to get another). Then in the 1969 World Series, Ryan saved Game 3, pitching 2 1/3 shutout innings against the Baltimore Orioles. The Game 3 victory gave the Mets a 2-1 lead in the Series, which they went on to win in five games. It would be Ryan's only World Series appearance in his career. On April 18, 1970, Ryan tied a Mets record by striking out 15 batters in one game. Four days later, Ryan's teammate, Tom Seaver, topped it with a then MLB record 19 against the San Diego Padres (though Ryan would tie this record four years later). Ryan has credited his time with Seaver and the Mets with turning him from just a flamethrower to a pitcher. Contrary to popular belief, Ryan never wanted to be traded from the Mets and felt betrayed by the team that drafted him. His views on this only calmed once he started running the Rangers and gained a better understanding of the business side of baseball.

Some labor wars have led to big damage to a particular company while others have managed to get by. But, if the first few days of \\"Back To Work\\" for the NFL is any indication, this upcoming year is going to be the most successful year, business-wise, in NFL history. The lack of any news over the last four months, combined with the frenzy of free agency, has led to an insatiable desire by the fans to soak in all the information that is coming in at warp speed. If there's one fan who is sitting out this season because he's mad at the petty owners and players, good luck finding him. ProFootballTalk.com set its all time traffic record with 3.88 million page views over a 24-hour period once free agency hit. \\"Fans were concerned they would lose games,\\" ProFootballTalk's founder and editor Mike Florio said, \\"When people think they're going to lose something, they love it even more when it comes back.\\" Florio said he's encouraged by the momentum and the interest, but cautions that if popular teams lose more games than projected because of a lack of offseason preparation, fans of those teams could tune out sooner than usual. Ticket sales have been robust early on 48 hours and brokers who were concerned that fans might be slow to come back are seeing their phones ring off the hook. \\"Between the relief that football will in fact happen coupled with the pent-up excitement, we have seen a lot more fervor about locking in tickets to the biggest matchups,\\" said Nick Cubero, co-owner of The Ticket Experience, a brokerage in Houston.

Agent David Canter says that he feels the energy of this shortened offseason more than any other. \\"The NBA Finals happened and then there was this total drop-off for many sports fans,\\" said Canter, who negotiated the five-year, 40 million contract for his client, Eric Weddle, with the San Diego Chargers. Canter partly credits Twitter with the resurgence in interest, saying that fans who have that insatiable appetite to interact can't get enough of it. \\"The amount of fan support is amazing,\\" Canter said. \\"For the [previous] three days, there was a group of fans from Jacksonville who wanted Eric and were using the Twitter the hashtag '#signweddle.' \\" Canter added, \\"they wanted to be heard.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room.

Hello little friends! Today, we're going to talk about football! In football, there are two exciting ways teams can score points. They can score by making touchdowns or kicking field goals. We're going to find out which one had more yards in the first half of a game. Remember, yards are like big steps on a football field! First, let's learn what touchdowns and field goals are: 1. Touchdowns: When a team gets the football into the other team's end zone, they score 6 points! This is called a touchdown. It's like a really big hug with the football! 2. Field Goals: When a team kicks the football between the two big, tall, yellow goalposts, they score 3 points! This is called a field goal. It's like giving a high-five to the sky! Now, we want to know if there were more yards in touchdowns or field goals in the first half of a game. Let's say we had a football game where this happened in the first half: - Team A scored 2 touchdowns and 1 field goal - Team B scored 1 touchdown To find out how many yards gained in touchdowns, we'll count how many yards long the football field is (100 yards) and multiply it by the number of touchdowns: - Team A: 2 touchdowns × 100 yards = 200 yards - Team B: 1 touchdown × 100 yards = 100 yards Total yards in touchdowns: 200 yards (Team A) + 100 yards (Team B) = 300 yards Now let's find out how many yards gained in the field goal. Field goals are usually kicked from various distances on the field. Let's say Team A's field goal was kicked from the 30-yard line: 1 field goal × 30 yards = 30 yards Now we have our answers: - Touchdowns: 300 yards - Field goals: 30 yards So, little friends, in the first half of this game, there were more yards in touchdowns! That's a lot of big hugs with the football!"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Many of the world's pollution problems have been caused by the crowding of large groups of people into the cities. Supply for the needs of the people leads to further pollution by industry. If the rapid increase of world population in countries continues at the present rate, there may be much greater harm to human beings. Some scientists speak of the increase in numbers of people as \\"population pollution.\\" About 2,000 years ago, the world population was probably about 250 million. It reached a billion in 1850. By 1930 the population was two billion. It is now three and a half billion. It is expected to double by the year 2,000. If the population continues to grow at the same rate, there will be 25 billion in the world a hundred years from now. Man has been using the earth's resources more and more rapidly over the past years. Some of them are almost used up. Now many people believe that man's greatest problem is how to control the growth of the population. The material supplies in the world will be far from enough to support the human population in time to come, if the present rate of increase continues. Already there is overcrowding in many cities and starvation in some countries. Should man's population keep on growing so rapidly as before?

Detective Mike Hoolihan is investigating the murder of Jennifer Rockwell, an astrophysicist at an observatory in New Orleans. She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged nick nacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about. The gun, a .38 revolver, is traced to the observatory manager, who admits he found it, and tried to dispose of it so he wouldn't be a suspect. Figuring from where the gun originally lay, Mike concludes that Jennifer had shot herself. The investigators agree. In photos of the crime scene, Mike realizes that there are no photos of the jar of moisturizing cream that she noted. When she buys a jar of the cream, she reacts as if memories come flooding back.

(CNN) -- The distance between the Maidan in downtown Kiev, Ukraine, and the WhatsApp headquarters in downtown Mountain View, California, is 6,139 miles. This quite long distance, however, is bridged by another figure: the number 19. On February 19, after months of protests in Kiev's center spiraled out of control, a de facto state of emergency took effect in Ukraine, eventually leading to the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych. In Silicon Valley, February 19 marked a turning point for WhatsApp founder Jan Koum, who signed a 19 billion deal to sell his company to Facebook. For Ukraine, that same 19 billion would be the answer to its short-term bond debt and gas bills. Whatever happens, for Americans, Koum's","output":"story serves as a compelling reminder of the power of innovation, resilience, and the American dream. Born in a small village outside Kiev, Koum moved to the United States with his mother when he was just 16 years old. They struggled to make ends meet, relying on food stamps to survive. Despite the hardship, Koum managed to excel academically, landing a spot at San Jose State University to study engineering. Meanwhile, Ukraine faces its own set of challenges. With Yanukovych ousted, the country grapples with its political, economic, and social divisions. The West is eager to support Ukraine, but Russian influence looms large, as does the possibility of escalating conflict. So, how does this story end? It is a tale of two intertwined narratives, one of personal triumph and the other of a nation's struggle for stability and identity. For Jan Koum, the story is a resounding success. His tenacity and creativity helped transform a simple idea – connecting people across borders via a mobile messaging app – into a company that Facebook deemed worthy of a 19 billion acquisition. As a key figure at one of the world's most influential companies, Koum has the opportunity to continue revolutionizing communication and shaping the technological landscape. His journey serves as an inspiration to countless aspiring entrepreneurs who also hope to turn their dreams into reality. In Ukraine, the story is far more complex and continues to unfold. The country remains divided, and its future is marred by uncertainty. A mixture of hope and trepidation can be felt as the nation works to address its economic challenges, bolster its democratic institutions, and tackle corruption. Efforts to forge closer ties with the European Union are met with resistance from an increasingly assertive Russia, which has its geopolitical ambitions in the region. As negotiations and power plays continue over the years that follow, a fragile peace is eventually established. While still grappling with its identity as a nation and addressing economic challenges, Ukraine manages to maintain its independence and forge a more democratic path forward. Its citizens remain resilient, inspired by the success stories of individuals like Jan Koum who have achieved the seemingly impossible.

Hall of fame Quarterback Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49ers has no doubt in his mind that patriots quarterback Tom Brady is responsible for the Deflategate scandal. 'If I ever want a ball a certain way, I don’t do it myself. So, somebody did it for him,' said Montana on Thursday. 'But I don’t know why everybody is making a big deal out of trying to figure out who did it. It’s pretty simple.If it was done, it was done for a reason. There is only one guy that does it. Nobody else cares what the ball feels like,' he added. Both The","output":"National Football League (NFL) and the New England Patriots franchise have conducted investigations into the Deflategate scandal. Interestingly, the NFL's report, known as the Wells Report, asserts that it is \\"more probable than not\\" that Patriots personnel were involved in deliberately deflating the footballs and that Brady was \\"at least generally aware\\" of the inappropriate activities. Even so, Brady has expressed his innocence numerous times and has even challenged the NFL's discipline in federal court. His suspension was ultimately overturned, affirming that there remains some room for doubt about his absolute culpability in the Deflategate incident. Now, moving to Joe Montana's statement about the ease with which the true perpetrator could be identified implies that Brady, as the main person with a vested interest in the feel of the football, would naturally be the one to orchestrate any manipulation of the balls. Montana, much like any other quarterback, realizes the crucial role that the texture, grip and inflation level of a ball play in the game. So, when he argues that there's only one person who truly cares about these elements, he paints Brady as the party most likely to benefit from any adjustment illegally made to the balls. This doesn't necessarily mean that Brady directly handled or personally deflated the balls. As per Montana's statement, the act could also have been carried out by someone doing it for him indirectly, be it a Patriots staff member or an external party. Furthermore, Montana questioning why everyone is trying to figure out who did it could be a critical commentary on the media and the public for obsessing over the scandal, arguably to the detriment of the sport. He suggests that if Deflategate was indeed maliciously orchestrated, then its significance lies more in what it shows about the culture of rule bending in professional football than in singling out a specific individual for blame. Despite the controversy, both Montana and Brady have carved niches for themselves in the annals of NFL history. Montana for his impeccable impact and laudable contributions on and off the field, and Brady, despite the controversies that have marked his career, for his tremendous performance, numerous victories and records. Ultimately, the Deflategate scandal is one of the most significant controversies ever to disrupt the NFL. It has raised fundamental questions about sporting ethics, the extent of players' (and their teams') duties to abide by the rules, and the lengths to which some might go to secure a competitive edge. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that while this incident has indeed marred Brady's legacy to an extent, it does not entirely define his impressive career."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"Fooling these machines was not difficult; all one had to do was remain calm, and it's surprisingly easy to keep the body tranquil when you're still getting the hang of using it.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"It was easy to trick the lie detectors.\\" is true?","output":"Step 1: Identify the key components of the premise and the hypothesis. - Premise: \\"Fooling these machines was not difficult; all one had to do was remain calm, and it's surprisingly easy to keep the body tranquil when you're still getting the hang of using it.\\" - Hypothesis: \\"It was easy to trick the lie detectors.\\" Step 2: Break down the premise. - The machines can be fooled. - One must remain calm to fool the machines. - It's easy to keep the body tranquil (calm) when still learning to use it.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer: 1. Blue jays are a species of bird, specifically passerine birds, which belong to the Corvidae family. 2. Passerine birds generally build nests in trees, shrubs, or sometimes on the ground, but they are not known for burrowing into the ground for shelter. 3. Blue jays, in particular, build nests made of twigs, leaves, grass, and other materials, typically positioning them on a tree branch or a fork between branches. 4. Additionally, blue jays are known for their strong ecological adaptability, which means they can co-exist with humans in urban and suburban environments, leading to more variation in nesting sites, but burrows are still not part of their behavior. 5.

And even saw tour buses full of French schoolchildren dumped on his doorstep in a quiet cul-de-sac - a mile away from the Big Pit coalmine tourist attraction in Blaenavon, South Wales. So Nigel Winfield, 62, decided to take matters into his own hands and put up eight realistic road signs in official colours and logos to point them in the right direction. Nigel Winfield, 62, put up eight road signs to stop confused tourists from driving into his quiet cul-de-sac in Forgeside, South Wales. He believes his homemade 'tourist information' signs have led to a 90 per cent reduction in traffic in the village of Forgeside, 16 miles from Newport. He said: 'It has reached crisis point. There were around 50 cars a day coming through disrupting the peace and quiet. 'These drivers are just blindly following their sat-navs - it was a lot of traffic for a nice quiet cul-de-sac. 'It was making everyone in the street cheesed off. So, being a practical person, I decided to make some signs.' The tourists were trying to find the Big Pit coalmine tourist attraction in Blaenavon, South Wales. The signs took Mr Winfield five days to make and cost around £50 - he even made a stencil to copy the logos for sat-nav and the Big Pit. Torfaen council is currently making a new set of signs - but Mr Winfield's were inspected and it was decided that his could stay for now. Villagers say they have been overrun by disorientated motorists trying to make their way to the nearby museum within the industrial village Unesco World Heritage site. There are main roads which lead to the tourist attraction - but sat-navs are sending motorists 'around the houses' through the village. The in-car GPS is sending directing motorists towards an old mining road with a uneven surface and half of them turn around instead of risking it. The signs took Mr Winfield five days to make and cost around £50 - he even made a stencil to copy the logos. Sat navs are directing tourists to Old Pit Road (pictured), next to his house, one mile away from the coal mine. 'There was instantly a ninety percent reduction - it's amazing to think a 62-year-old year old man with a paint brush and a bicycle can effect a 90 percent reduction in traffic. 'Everyone in the street was really pleased with them but I had the forger's dilema because they thought the council were responsible.' He still sees four or five drivers trying to go around the back of the houses to reach the museum - but it has been much quieter since he made his signs. A council spokesman said: 'Having carried out further investigations it seems that some sat navs do direct people incorrectly via Forgeside. 'However, this mainly appears to be an issue with older models and we are currently designing signage to try and prevent this. 'These unauthorised signs have been inspected to ensure they don't create any hazards for road users and will be removed when our own signs are erected.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article involve: 1. Nigel Winfield, a 62-year-old resident of Forgeside, South Wales, faced an issue with confused tourists and their sat-nav directions, which led them to his cul-de-sac home instead of the Big Pit coalmine tourist attraction in Blaenavon, South Wales. 2. Due to the inconvenience caused by the heavy influx of lost tourists, Winfield decided to create his own realistic road signs in official colors and logos to direct them to the right destination. 3. Winfield believes that his homemade 'tourist information' signs have led to a 90% reduction in traffic in the village of Forgeside. 4.

Options: - act quickly - learn to walk - stretches - buy shoes - go quickly Explain why a human would choose \\"learn to walk\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"learn to walk\\" as the answer to this question because it is the most logical and developmentally appropriate progression in the acquisition of locomotive skills. Learning to walk is a fundamental milestone in human development that serves as the foundation for more advanced forms of movement, such as running. The other options presented, while related to the concept of running in some way, do not address the primary prerequisite to running, which is the ability to walk. First, let's look at the importance of learning to walk. Walking is a critical stage in human motor development that typically emerges between 9 and 17 months of age, although the precise timing can vary. This process involves learning to maintain balance, coordinate movements, and adapt to changing environments or task demands. Acquiring the ability to walk allows an individual to explore their surroundings, interact with others, and participate in various daily activities. It also provides a foundation for the development of other gross motor skills, including running, jumping, and playing sports. Now, let's briefly examine why the other options are not suitable answers. Act quickly, buy shoes, and go quickly all convey the concept of speed, which is an important element of running. However, before one can focus on developing speed, they must first have a solid foundation in walking. Acting or going quickly alone does not explain how one learns to perform the physical action of running. In the context of this question, these options are therefore secondary concerns. Stretches, on the other hand, are relevant to running, but they are not a prerequisite to learning how to run. Stretches can help to prepare the body for running, prevent injuries, and enhance performance. However, they do not teach the fundamental mechanics and motor patterns required for successful walking and, eventually, running. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"learn to walk\\" as the most appropriate answer to the question because walking is the essential first step in the progression of locomotive skills, and without mastering the ability to walk, one cannot truly learn to run. It is through the development of balance, coordination, and strength that walking provides that an individual is able to improve their motor proficiency and ultimately achieve the necessary skills to run effectively. The other options, while related to running, do not address the core requirement of knowing how to walk before you can run."},{"instruction":"But when the WTO headquarters issue came up, and Germany made an offer and a pitch to get the WTO to be headquartered in Bonn, the Swiss suddenly realised they were vulnerable and began improving their offers.

Soren enjoys listening to the 'Legends of Ga'Hoole,' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother's dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren's natural branching ability. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a Tasmanian devil but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt. Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young elf owl who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or 'pickers'. When Soren and Gylfie protest, they are sorted as pickers while Kludd, who betrays Soren, is sent to be a soldier. Soren and Gylfie avoid being 'moon-blinked' (a catatonic state induced by sleeping under a full moon), while the others do not know and become moon-blinked.

In a bid to increase transparency and ethical behaviour amongst financial institutions, the FCA is now calling for a clampdown on commissions paid for selling insurance, loans, and bank accounts. This latest move is aimed at safeguarding customers from potential predatory practices, while ensuring that financial companies operate on a level playing field. The Problem with Commissions Commissions on financial products, such as insurance policies, loans, and bank accounts, have long been a contentious issue within the sector. Critics argue that the practice of paying large commissions creates conflicts of interest between financial institutions, their employees, and their customers. The pursuit of commissions can often result in sales staff recommending products that may not necessarily be in the best interest of the customer. This unscrupulous approach to sales not only exacerbates the trust gap between customers and financial institutions but can also lead to customers facing financially detrimental outcomes. It is an issue that the FCA has identified as a priority in its ongoing effort to reform the industry. The FCA's Proposal The FCA's call for a clampdown on commissions highlights the need for consistent regulation and strict monitoring of payment structures within financial institutions to support a fair and transparent marketplace. The agency is encouraging firms to reconsider their current commission models and find alternative ways to reward sales staff without creating conflicts of interest. The proposed clampdown on commissions would necessitate policymaking on several levels, such as: 1. Restricting or capping commission rates on financial products to minimize financial incentives that may lead to biased recommendations. 2. Implementing strict disclosure requirements, whereby financial institutions would need to clearly inform customers of the commissions received for selling particular products. 3. Mandating the presence of a diverse range of financial products, thereby ensuring that customers have access to unbiased and well-suited financial solutions. 4. Advocating for performance-based employee compensation in the sector, which rewards staff for meeting customer needs and promoting a culture of transparency and ethical selling practices. Potential Benefits of Clampdown The proposed clampdown on commissions, if successfully enforced, could bring about numerous benefits for consumers, financial institutions, and the overall economy. These potential benefits include: 1. Greater transparency: With firms disclosing commission rates to consumers and adhering to payment structure guidelines, customers will have access to clearer and more transparent information. This transparency empowers consumers to make better-informed decisions when purchasing financial products. 2. Improved customer trust: As financial institutions prioritize customer needs and demonstrate a commitment to ethical sales practices, consumer trust in these institutions is likely to increase. 3. Reduction in mis-selling: With fewer financial incentives clouding decision-making, the likelihood of mis-selling financial products, such as inappropriate insurance policies or unnecessarily expensive loans, is significantly reduced. 4. Higher industry standards: By encouraging financial institutions to adopt performance-based compensation structures, the FCA sets a higher standard across the industry, promoting a culture focused on customer satisfaction and ethical practices. Conclusion The FCA's call for a clampdown on commissions paid for selling financial products echoes the regulatory agency's constant efforts to increase transparency, reduce unethical practices and protect consumers in the UK financial services sector. By supporting policies that prioritize customer needs and well-being, the FCA is propelling the industry towards a more responsible and sustainable future. Although implementing these changes may come with challenges, investing in better practices and prioritizing consumer trust can undoubtedly benefit the financial landscape in the long run."},{"instruction":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the names of the people who pick up Bill? ?

His father was a janitor and a handyman. After four years at the University of Kansas residing at Stephenson Scholarship hall, James joined the Army in 1971. He was the last person in Kansas to be sent to fight in the Vietnam War, although he never saw action there. Context: An aspiring writer and obsessive fan, James began writing baseball articles after leaving the United States Army in his mid-twenties. Many of his first baseball writings came while he was doing night shifts as a security guard at the Stokely-Van Camp's pork and beans cannery. Unlike most writers, his pieces did not recount games in epic terms or offer insights gleaned from interviews with players. A typical James piece posed a question (e.g., \\"Which pitchers and catchers allow runners to steal the most bases?\\"), and then presented data and analysis written in a lively, insightful, and witty style that offered an answer. Editors considered James's pieces so unusual that few believed them suitable for their readers. In an effort to reach a wider audience, James began self-publishing an annual book titled The Bill James Baseball Abstract beginning in 1977. The first edition, titled 1977 Baseball Abstract: Featuring 18 categories of statistical information that you just can't find anywhere else, presented 68 pages of in-depth statistics compiled from James's study of box scores from the preceding season and was offered for sale through a small advertisement in The Sporting News. Seventy-five people purchased the booklet. The 1978 edition, subtitled The 2nd annual edition of baseball's most informative and imaginative review, sold 250 copies. Beginning in 1979, James wrote an annual preview of the baseball season for Esquire, and continued to do so through 1984. The first three editions of the Baseball Abstract garnered respect for James's work, including a very favorable review by Daniel Okrent in Sports Illustrated. New annual editions added essays on teams and players. By 1982 sales had increased tenfold, and a media conglomerate agreed to publish and distribute future editions. While writers had published books about baseball statistics before (most notably Earnshaw Cook's Percentage Baseball, in the 1960s), few had ever reached a mass audience. Attempts to imitate James's work spawned a flood of books and articles that continues to this day. Question: When was the last abstract published?.
