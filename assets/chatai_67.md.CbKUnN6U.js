They end up with a controller that has an additional \\"C\\" button in addition to the standard \\"A\\", \\"B\\", and other buttons. So, the bored SCP researchers are intrigued, and end up plugging the controller into a NES console and pressing the C button during a session of Super Mario Bros. to see what happens. Hilariously, Mario reacts in bafflement to the \\"C\\" button, ranting that he has been in the game for 38 years and he has never seen a single C button input during *ANY* of those sessions, and that Nintendo didn't teach him how to respond when he receives a C button press. Mario then storms out of the game screen, his angry footsteps causing the screen to shake. The NES console then immediately melts.","output":"Title: Super Mario's Extraordinary C-button Conundrum In the subterranean depths of Site-19, among a myriad of contained anomalies, there existed a room seldom mentioned in the official records. This room was not home to a nightmarish entity or an insidious artifact. No, it was simply where a clique of researchers eking their existence amid existential horrors gathered to combat an equally insidious foe: boredom. Dr. Sasha Velasca, sporting a lab coat splattered with the stains of anomalous ketchup (SCP-2078-1, to be precise), had a spark of mischief in her eyes as she corralled her colleagues around SCP-914 - the infamous clockwork machine capable of reforging objects on arcane principles known to none but itself. \\"Remember the last time we put that old Nokia phone in on 'Fine' and it came out as an iPhone 37?\\" she winked at the eager faces around her, eyebrows waggling. Their hearts raced, not from fear this time, but from a delicious sense of forbidden exhilaration. And so, an innocent NES controller was sacrificed to the cause, its cord reverently placed into the input booth. The knob was turned to 'Fine'. The gears and cogs inside SCP-914 whirred to life in a mechanical ballet, and despite the fact that this tune was all too familiar to the bored researchers, it never failed to excite. With bated breath, they retrieved the modified controller. The only apparent change was the addition of an enigmatic 'C' button, an unassuming but boldly labeled curiosity that neither Nintendo nor nature had intended. It wasn't long before the controller was plugged into a battered NES console, Super Mario Bros. cartridge locked and loaded. The moment of truth came as Mario leapt across the pixelated landscape, a familiar 8-bit tune chirping in the background. \\"Alright, who's pressing it?\\" Dr. Velasca asked, her manic grin barely concealing the trepidation flickering in her weary eyes. \\"I'll do the honors,\\" Dr. Jamie Katz volunteered, thumb hovering over the 'C' button like a Space Shuttle commander on launch day. Teasingly slow, he depressed the plastic key, anticipating...something. What erupted from the screen was nothing short of pandemonium. Mario froze mid-jump, the sanguine plumber's jovial expression dissolving into one of incredulous fury. He turned to face the screen's fourth wall, pointing an angry gloved finger directly at the researchers huddled in the dark. \\"Hey! You-a with the lab coats! What's-a going on here? I been'a jumping, I been'a running, I even been'a swimming with-a the squids for 38 years! Nobody said nothing about a C button! Mama-mia, this isn't in my contract!\\" The research team watched in awe, confusion, and a bit of terror as Mario stomped his feet – a tantrum that sent tremors through the screen, causing pixelated bricks to crumble and Goombas to flee in digital dismay. \\"I ought-a come out there and give you all a piece of my mind! I'm-a sick'a this!\\" Mario shouted, jumping out of the confines of the television screen. His departure was marked by falling scores and coins alike, a background void where a determined Italian once ran tirelessly. As his angry footsteps echoed in the lab, the console couldn't bear the weight of the break in reality. It smoked, sparks flew, and, as if in sympathy to the plight of its pixelated protagonist, it melted into a puddle of plastic and thwarted dreams. There were no reprimands in the report that day, just a bewildered transcript, a melted NES, and an addendum about a new SCP-914 product: SCP-914-XXXX, also known as \\"The Controller of the Lost C\\". It was immediately contained in a standard secure Locker. To this day, Dr. Velasca and her team fight the monotony of the anomalous with science and a smuggled Game Boy. But, every once in a while, when the lights flicker and they hear the distant sound of an irate Italian muttering about 'press C to complain,' they remember the day they gave Mario something he never asked for - a 'C' button to revolt."},{"instruction":"• Procesos estratégicos: o Engloban la planificación, toma de decisiones y despliegue de planes y políticas.

Le bureau de Véronique était baigné d'une lumière douce, et son décor onéreux indiquait la position influente de la femme qui l'occupait. Charlotte, une analyste comptable compétente et respectée, écoutait les mots de Véronique avec une anxiété croissante. \\"Je vais être directe, Charlotte. Ta femme, Sandra, a fait une erreur dans les comptes qui nous a coûté cher. Très cher. Des millions. En tant que responsable des finances, je pourrais lancer une enquête, et je crains que cela ne finisse mal pour elle... pour vous deux.\\" Charlotte sentit son monde vaciller. Sandra, qui travaillait aussi pour la même entreprise dans un département différent, était la personne la plus droite et la plus consciencieuse qu'elle connaissait. Charlotte ne pouvait pas imaginer Sandra faisant une faute aussi monumentale. Leur vie, leurs projets, leur maison, tout ce qu'elles avaient construit ensemble risquait de s'effondrer. \\"Que puis-je faire ?\\" demanda Charlotte, sa voix trahissant un mélange de peur et de désespoir. Véronique s'était levée de son fauteuil de cuir et avait commencé à se rapprocher doucement de Charlotte. \\"Il y a peut-être un moyen de régler cette affaire discrètement,\\" dit-elle, un sourire ambigu se dessinant sur ses lèvres. \\"Mais cela demande un... arrangement personnel entre nous.\\" L'implication était claire, et l'indignation fusa en Charlotte. Mais l'image de Sandra, effondrée, licenciée, voire pire, poursuivie en justice, fut plus forte que sa dignité. Et c'est ainsi que naquit leur arrangement. Les semaines qui suivirent furent un mélange étrange de honte et d'excitation pour Charlotte. Les rendez-vous secrets avec Véronique, d’abord imposés par le chantage, devinrent des échappatoires inattendus aux pressions quotidiennes. Charlotte se retrouva prise dans un tourbillon de culpabilité et de plaisir. Cependant, le doute commencé à l’envahir. Elle décida de mener sa propre enquête dans les comptes de l'entreprise, utilisant tout son savoir-faire d'analyste comptable. Ses découvertes la sidérèrent : l'erreur n’était pas le fait de Sandra. Pire encore, il semblait que cette soi-disant \\"erreur\\" n’était qu’un prétexte fabriqué par Véronique pour couvrir ses propres malversations. L’adrénaline de la déception se mélangeait maintenant avec le frisson de la trahison. Confrontée à cette réalité, Charlotte dut faire face non seulement au mensonge de sa supérieure, mais aussi à sa propre complicité involontaire dans un jeu de pouvoir et de séduction. Véronique avait manipulé la situation à son avantage, faisant de Charlotte un pion dans son jeu de domination financier et personnel. Charlotte affronta Véronique, non pas avec des cris, mais avec une calme assurance. Elle avait rassemblé des preuves, prête à exposer le jeu dangereux de Véronique si nécessaire. Pourtant, lorsqu’elle se tenait face à la directrice financière, elle pouvait sentir une étrange vibration en elle. Le danger, la tromperie, et maintenant le pouvoir qu'elle avait sur Véronique créaient un mélange intoxicant. La confrontation prit un tour inattendu. Véronique, avec une froideur calculatrice, reconnut son jeu. Elle ne chercha pas à nier, ni même à s'excuser. Elle semblait accepter l'échec avec une certaine dignité perverse. Et tandis que les termes de leur nouveau \\"accord\\" étaient négociés, Charlotte réalisait qu'elle ne voulait pas simplement protection et réparation. Non, elle désirait aussi maintenir cette relation illicite et complexe qui lui procurait, malgré elle, une stimulation sombre et puissante.

However, the most common context involves substance spread, and I will focus on that aspect. In the context of substance spread, diffusion is the process by which particles of a substance move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This occurs naturally as the particles seek to reach an equilibrium state where the concentration is the same throughout the medium in which they are dispersed. The diffusion model can mathematically describe this process, taking into account factors that affect the rate and direction of diffusion. # Simple Diffusion Model (Fick's Laws) The foundational diffusion model is based on Fick's laws of diffusion, which describe how particles diffuse by random motion. Fick's First Law It states that the flux of particles (J) through a unit area is proportional to the concentration gradient (dC/dx): J = -D * (dC/dx) Where: - J is the diffusion flux (amount of substance per unit area per unit time, e.g., mol/m^2/s). - D is the diffusion coefficient or diffusivity (m^2/s), which reflects how easily the substance diffuses. - dC/dx is the concentration gradient, or the rate at which the concentration changes with respect to position. The negative sign indicates that diffusion occurs in the direction opposite to the concentration gradient (particles move from high to low concentration). Fick's Second Law It addresses how concentration changes with time: ∂C/∂t = D * ∂^2C/∂x^2 Where: - ∂C/∂t is the rate of change of concentration with time. - ∂^2C/∂x^2 is the second derivative of concentration with respect to position, which indicates the curvature of the concentration profile over space. Fick's Second Law can be used to describe situations where the diffusion coefficient is constant or varies with concentration or position. It is the basis for many models describing diffusion in solids, liquids, and gases. # Diffusion in Various Contexts - In gases and liquids, molecules are in constant, random motion, and diffusion is relatively quick. - In solids, diffusion is typically slower and often occurs through defects or voids within the material's lattice structure. - In biological systems, diffusion is responsible for the movement of substances across cell membranes and through tissues. # Factors Influencing the Diffusion Model - **Diffusion Coefficient (D):** Varies with temperature, pressure, the medium, and the properties of the diffusing substance. - **Temperature:** Higher temperatures usually increase the rate of diffusion. - **Concentration Gradient:** A higher gradient leads to faster diffusion. - **Medium:** For example, diffusion is generally faster in gases than in liquids and slower in solids. - **Particle Size:** Smaller particles typically diffuse faster. - **Barriers:** In biological systems, cell membranes might act selectively, allowing some substances through while blocking others. # Extensions to the Basic Diffusion Model - **Anisotropic Diffusion:** In some materials, like certain crystals, the diffusion rate may differ depending on the direction. - **Facilitated Diffusion:** In biological systems, proteins facilitate the diffusion of certain molecules across membranes. - **Non-Fickian Diffusion:** In some cases, such as when a polymer absorbs a solvent, the diffusion process does not follow Fick's laws in a straightforward manner. - **Multi-component Diffusion:** Involving several diffusing species simultaneously. The diffusion model is a fundamental concept across various scientific disciplines, from physics and materials science to chemistry and biology. The intuition behind it is quite simple: particles or entities will naturally spread from regions where they are more concentrated to regions where they are less concentrated, in an attempt to achieve equilibrium. But the implementation of diffusion models can be very complex, especially when dealing with heterogeneous materials, complex geometries, or when diffusion interacts with other physical phenomena (e.g., convection, reaction kinetics)."},{"instruction":"diffusion model architecture in ML","output":"Ah, the context is machine learning! When referencing a \\"diffusion model\\" in the field of machine learning, we're typically referring to a family of generative models that progressively learn to transform samples from a noise distribution into samples of data that resemble a target distribution, often images or audio. The process is akin to a physical diffusion process but in reverse; that's why it's sometimes called a \\"denoising diffusion probabilistic model\\" (DDPM). The classical diffusion model in ML, inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, comprises two processes: 1. **The forward (diffusion) process:** It gradually adds Gaussian noise to the data in a sequence of steps to transform the data into a (near) isotropic Gaussian distribution. This is done in a Markov chain fashion, where each step is only dependent on the previous step. 2. **The reverse (denoising) process:** It learns to reverse the diffusion process, starting from the noise and progressively removing it in a sequence of learned denoising steps, eventually reconstructing a sample from the original data distribution. During training, the diffusion model optimizes a parameterized Markov chain to reverse the diffusion process. The training objective is often presented as a variant of the variational lower bound, which resembles the objective used in variational autoencoders (VAEs). # Architecture Overview The architecture common in diffusion models usually involves deep neural networks that parameterize the reverse process. The neural networks learn to predict either the noise that was added at each diffusion step or directly predict the gradients of the log probability of the data. Here's a general outline of the components: Diffusion Steps 1. **Data Conditioning**: The actual data sample is typically passed through the network together with the timestep information, as each step in the reverse process corresponds to a specific point in the diffusion process. We want the network to learn a different denoising action for each step. 2. **Noise Prediction**: At each reverse step, the neural network predicts the noise that was likely to have been added in the forward process or predicts the parameters of the distribution from which to sample the denoised data at the current step. This network is generally a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), or for text and other sequential data, a Transformer. 3. **Timestep Encoding**: A critical element often overlooked is how the timestep (which tells the model at which point of the diffusion process we are) is encoded. This is usually done through a sinusoidal embedding, similar to the positional encodings in Transformers. Training The weights of the neural network are updated to minimize the difference between the ground truth data and the samples produced by the model, usually using a gradient descent algorithm. The exact objective function varies but might involve terms that effectively measure the difference between the predicted noise and the actual noise added during the diffusion process. # Advantages of Diffusion Models Diffusion models have several advantages that make them appealing: - **Generation Quality**: They have been shown to generate high-quality samples, rivaling GANs in terms of the detail and diversity of the generated data, without some of the training difficulties associated with GANs. - **Stability**: Unlike GANs, which can suffer from training instability and mode collapse, diffusion models are generally more stable to train. - **Theoretical Foundation**: They are grounded in solid theoretical principles and can be understood in the framework of variational inference. # Applications Diffusion models have been applied successfully in various domains, including: - **Image Generation**: Creating high-resolution, photorealistic images. - **Audio Synthesis**: Generating realistic audio such as human speech or music. - **Molecule Generation**: Designing new molecular structures for drug discovery. In conclusion, the diffusion model architecture in machine learning is an example of a generative model that uses a stochastic process to learn complex data distributions. It does so by first destructively learning the data distribution through the addition of noise, and then learning to generate new data by reversing that process. The intricate details of the model, such as the neural network architecture, noise scheduling, and training objective, are where the innovation and research focus on improving the performance and applicability of these models."},{"instruction":"How to snap out of schizophrenia","output":"Schizophrenia is a serious and chronic mental health disorder that is characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self, and behavior. It commonly includes hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning. It is important to understand that schizophrenia is not a condition one can simply \\"snap out of\\" with willpower or a change in attitude. The management of schizophrenia typically requires a combination of treatments, which can include: 1. Medication: The primary treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which can reduce the symptoms of psychosis and prevent relapses. These medications work by affecting the brain's neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine. 2. Psychotherapy: Psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help manage symptoms, improve quality of life, and teach coping strategies. Therapy can also address specific challenges such as social skills, problem-solving, and coping with stress. 3. Psychosocial Support: Supportive therapy, vocational rehabilitation, and skills training can help individuals with schizophrenia function to the best of their ability in their daily lives. 4. Education: Educating both the person with schizophrenia and their family or support network is crucial for understanding the condition and engaging effectively with treatment plans. 5. Lifestyle Adjustments: Some lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, adequate sleep, reducing stress, and abstaining from substance abuse, can support overall mental well-being and complement other treatments. 6. Support Groups: Participation in support groups can provide individuals with schizophrenia and their loved ones mutual support, acceptance, and practical advice from others who have similar experiences. 7. Regular Monitoring: Close follow-up with mental health professionals to monitor symptoms, medication side effects, and overall mental health is important. Please note that every individual's experience with schizophrenia is unique, and treatment must be tailored to the individual's needs. It’s essential for anyone with schizophrenia to work closely with their psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professionals to find the most effective treatment plan. It's equally important to maintain ongoing treatment, even when symptoms seem to be under control, to prevent relapses. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, please seek professional help. A proper diagnosis from a qualified mental health professional is necessary to determine the most appropriate course of treatment."},{"instruction":"Jak Ukraińcy umiąm język ukraiński","output":"Ogólnie rzecz biorąc, większość Ukraińców mówi po ukraińsku, ponieważ jest to ich ojczysty język i język państwowy Ukrainy. Umiejętność używania języka ukraińskiego jest ugruntowana i promowana przez szkolnictwo oraz media. Niemniej jednak na Ukrainie istnieje znacząca różnorodność językowa. Na Ukrainie od setek lat rozwijają się różne języki i dialekty. Oprócz języka ukraińskiego, wielu Ukraińców mówi również po rosyjsku, szczególnie w miastach na wschodzie i południu kraju, gdzie rosyjski jest często używanym językiem codziennym i może dominować w niektórych społecznościach. Doświadczenia historyczne jak i polityka lingwistyczna za czasów Związku Radzieckiego, gdzie rosyjski był promowany jako język międzynarodowy komunikacji, wpłynęły na obecny landszaft językowy Ukrainy. Poza tym na Ukrainie żyją mniejszości narodowe, które mogą posługiwać się własnymi językami, takimi jak krymskotatarski, węgierski, rumuński, polski, i inne. Edukacja ukraińska promuje biegłe posługiwanie się językiem ukraińskim, a szkoły zapewniają kształcenie w tym języku. Również, w kontekście aktualnych wydarzeń politycznych i konfliktu z Rosją, istnieje silne ruchy społeczne skierowane na promowanie i podtrzymywanie języka ukraińskiego jako kluczowego elementu kultury narodowej i tożsamości."},{"instruction":"Jak Yanukovych nauczył się Ukraińskiego","output":"Wiktor Janukowycz, były prezydent Ukrainy, był znany z tego, że pochodzi z regionu wschodniej Ukrainy, gdzie dominujący jest język rosyjski. W młodym wieku Janukowycz prawdopodobnie używał przede wszystkim języka rosyjskiego, lecz jako publiczny działacz i polityk w kraju, w którym język ukraiński jest językiem urzędowym, z czasem musiał nauczyć się języka ukraińskiego, aby móc efektywnie komunikować się z obywatelami i pełnić funkcje państwowe. Jednakże, jego umiejętności w posługiwaniu się językiem ukraińskim były krytykowane jako niewystarczające i niezbyt biegłe, co zostało dostrzeżone zwłaszcza w czasie, gdy sprawował urząd premiera, a później prezydenta Ukrainy. W publicznych wystąpieniach często posługiwał się językiem ukraińskim, choć bywało, że wykazywał trudności w swobodnym używaniu tego języka. Proces nauki języka ukraińskiego przez Janukowycza nie jest dogłębnie udokumentowany. Zazwyczaj politycy w podobnych sytuacjach angażują wykwalifikowanych nauczycieli języka, korzystają z intensywnych kursów językowych, a także praktykują język w codziennej komunikacji politycznej i administracyjnej. Język używany przez Janukowycza stał się częścią dyskursu politycznego na Ukrainie, gdzie kwestie językowe są często odzwierciedleniem głębszych podziałów kulturowych i politycznych w kraju."},{"instruction":"Jak żelenski","output":"Władimir Żełenski, prezydent Ukrainy, jest znany z tego, że jest biegły zarówno w języku ukraińskim, jak i rosyjskim. Jego umiejętności językowe odgrywają ważną rolę w pełnieniu funkcji prezydenckiej, szczególnie w kontekście konfliktu z Rosją oraz komunikowania się z różnymi grupami społecznymi w obrębie Ukrainy. Żełenski urodził się w Krywym Rogu, industrialnym mieście na południowym wschodzie Ukrainy, gdzie język rosyjski był powszechnie używany. W młodości mówił głównie po rosyjsku, ale jako aktor, komik i później jako polityk nauczył się biegle posługiwać językiem ukraińskim. Przed wybraniem go na prezydenta w 2019 roku, Żełenski był znany głównie z pracy w przemyśle rozrywkowym, gdzie grał w popularnych ukraińskich programach telewizyjnych i filmach, często również produkowanych w języku ukraińskim. Jako prezydent, Żełenski często przemawia publicznie i komunikuje się z urzędnikami państwowymi w języku ukraińskim. Jego zdolność komunikacji w obu językach pomaga w budowaniu mostów między różnymi częściami wielojęzycznej społeczności Ukrainy oraz w dialogu międzynarodowym, zwłaszcza podczas konfliktu zbrojnego z Rosją oraz prowadzenia działań dyplomatycznych. Podsumowując, Żełenski wykorzystuje swoje umiejętności językowe do pełnienia obowiązków prezydenckich, a biegłe władowanie się w oba języki pomaga mu dotrzeć do szerokiego spektrum obywateli Ukrainy, jak również do międzynarodowej społeczności."},{"instruction":"Jak się nauczył Ukrainski","output":"Władimir Żełenski, chociaż wychował się w środowisku rosyjskojęzycznym, zdobył biegłość w języku ukraińskim poprzez edukację i pracę zawodową. Dostępne informacje o tym, jak konkretnie nauczył się ukraińskiego, są ograniczone, ale można wywnioskować, że jako publiczna postać i późniejszy polityk, mielibyśmy do czynienia z kilkoma możliwymi sposobami, w jakie mógł osiągnąć biegłość w języku: 1. Edukacja formalna: W Ukraińskiej edukacji, język ukraiński jest nauczany jako język państwowy na wszystkich poziomach szkolnictwa. Żełenski, jako obywatel Ukrainy, prawdopodobnie miał kontakt z językiem ukraińskim w szkole oraz w trakcie wyższych studiów, co mogło przyczynić się do jego znajomości tego języka. 2. Kariera w mediach i rozrywce: Jako aktor, scenarzysta i producent, Żełenski pracował w przemyśle rozrywkowym, który również wykorzystuje język ukraiński. Aktywne uczestnictwo w tworzeniu programów, filmów i przedstawień w języku ukraińskim mogło znacząco przyczynić się do jego biegłości. 3. Praktyka zawodowa: Przed przystąpieniem do polityki, Żełenski prowadził działalność biznesową na Ukrainie, co również mogło wymagać od niego używania języka ukraińskiego w profesjonalnych transakcjach i komunikacji. 4. Trening i doradztwo językowe: Jako kandydat na prezydenta i później jako głowa państwa, Żełenski mógł korzystać z usług trenerów językowych, aby doskonalić swój język ukraiński, zwłaszcza w kontekście publicznych wystąpień i oficjalnej komunikacji. 5. Codzienne korzystanie z języka: Jako prezydent Ukrainy, Żełenski jest regularnie narażony na użycie języka ukraińskiego w urzędzie i w kontaktach z obywatelami oraz innymi politykami, co jeszcze bardziej doskonali jego biegłość. Powszechnie w Ukrainie ludzie posiadają różne stopnie biegłości w obu językach — ukraińskim i rosyjskim — i stopniowo zwiększają swoje umiejętności w miarę potrzeb, zarówno osobistych, jak i zawodowych."},{"instruction":"Title: Silverburn AU: Tesco Grand Opening & Upcoming Construction Thread Started by ShopaholicSuzie on June 15, 2002 ShopaholicSuzie: Hey everyone on PollokShoppers! 😍 It’s official - the new Tesco at Silverburn opened its doors today, and it’s HUUUGE! 🛒✨ But that’s not all, I overheard the construction crew talking about breaking ground on the rest of the centre soon.

They’ve got this quirky setup with TVs making a Christmas tree shape—pretty creative! There’s, like, three different versions. During the day, the screens have got festive decorations showing on them. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): I caught a glimpse of it just this evening! They switch to static in the night version—it’s kinda eerie but cool. It really caught my eye while I was doing some late-night shopping. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Oh, you guys are talking about the Silverburn ad? I especially loved the third variation. There’s something magical about the screens being off at night and then suddenly they flash on to reveal those beautiful decorations before going dark again. It’s like they’re coming alive! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Yes! Those ads with the LED snowflake and Santa at the back though—they kind of bring it all together with that ambient glow and subtle shadows. Noticed them when I was there with the kids last weekend. They were pretty intrigued by it. — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): I’m loving their slogan: “Switch on Christmas at Silverburn.” It’s catchy, it fits perfectly with the theme they’ve got going on. Really makes you feel like the holidays are here. — User5 (CarolSinger): Who’s in charge of the campaign, do y’all know? It’s nice to see them putting so much effort into the holiday vibes. Also, glad they’re going for something a bit different than the usual big red bows and glitter. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Not sure who’s behind it, but I read somewhere that they’re aiming for a “techy Christmas” vibe. Modern, fresh but still festive. My guess is they want to appeal to a younger crowd as well as families. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Techy Christmas indeed. It’s impressive how much work must’ve gone into setting those screens up safely. And I’ve got to say—I’m kinda curious about the tech specs on those TVs. Do we know what kind they’re using? — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): If any of you are thinking of heading down to Silverburn, bring a camera. Those TV Christmas trees are super Insta-worthy. And props to Silverburn for starting the festive buzz in such a unique way! — User7 (NoelTechie): Heard that these ads are a part of a larger holiday campaign with some interactive installations planned inside the shopping centre. Can’t wait to see what else they have in store! Silverburn is seriously upping the Christmas game this year. — User8 (MerryDancer): With everything so digital this year, it’s a breath of fresh air to see a shopping centre embrace the theme but with a cosy holiday twist. Props to Silverburn, let’s hope this attracts more folks and gets the economy buzzing. — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Couldn’t agree more! And speaking of shopping, I might have a wander over there this weekend. If those Christmas TV trees are a sign, we’re all in for some serious festive treats at Silverburn! 🎄✨ — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Just a friendly reminder to keep the discussion friendly and respectful. Also, remember to share your own experiences and pictures if you visit the campaign installations. Great to see everyone getting in the spirit of the holidays!

Have you seen that the Silverburn Christmas ads have landed on STV? They’re showing up once every ad break. The tree made of TVs is legit becoming iconic now. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Caught one during ‘Corrie’ last night, they’re really spreading the holiday cheer. Also noticed them on the advertising screens all over the centre. Although, they’ve left off the slogan and logo? 🤔 Just the website and directions sitting discreetly in the corner. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Yes, @YuleTideYoda, I found that a bit odd too. It’s all minimalist on the screens within the centre. Maybe they think the TV tree is recognisable enough on its own now? At least the website’s there, or we’d all be wondering where this magical place is! — User5 (CarolSinger): Smart move putting them up on STV, everyone’s going to see those ads. My Gran even mentioned the “telly-tree” to me this morning. Silverburn’s marketing folks know what they’re doing! — User6 (ElfEngineer): It’s a neat strategy to keep the ads uncluttered in the centre. Keeps the focus on the installation. On STV, the full details pop up right at the end. Less is more, sometimes! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Those ads are making waves. My kids go quiet every time one comes on TV. Eyes glued to the screen! But yeah, noticed the minimal approach on the in-centre ad screens, too. Makes it kinda like a tease, which probably piques people’s curiosity. — User7 (NoelTechie): Hah, they’ve got us all talking about it, so it’s working! I personally like the clean look on the centre screens. The holiday aesthetics don’t always need the hard sell. It’s like the TVs whisper: “There’s more if you just follow the magic to Silverburn.” — User9 (StarlightShopper): Just spotted the ads at the centre today! The LED snowflake behind me literally made me feel like I was in a winter wonderland. No logo needed, the vibe says it all. Now if only they had seasonal lattes right next to them… — User8 (MerryDancer): This low-key approach in the centre is kind of refreshing. You get the info if you want it, but otherwise, you’re just immersed in the festive atmosphere. And it’s everywhere, can’t escape the Christmas spirit if you tried! — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): Am I the only one who’s going to Silverburn just to see the telly-tree now? 😂 These ads have done their job on me. Also need to check if the Santa LED makes an appearance on the STV ads, it’s my favourite part! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like Silverburn is the talk of the town with their Christmas campaign! Remember to share your ad sightings and any festive moments you capture while visiting. Let’s keep the conversations merry and bright! And who knows, maybe next time we’ll have the scent of lattes accompanying those LEDs, @StarlightShopper! ☕ 🎄 — Write a follow up the next year where 2008’s ads feature the love story of 2 gooey alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter, The slogan is “Spend Christmas together”, The ads are showing on STV, but for some reason it debuted during Toonattik instead of during the evening, A nostalgic surprise is still in-centre via the advert screens however Thread Title: Silverburn 2008 Christmas Campaign - A Love Story of Two Aliens?! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Can’t believe what I just saw on TV this morning! Silverburn’s got this year’s Christmas campaign featuring two alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter! 😍 It’s all about spending Christmas together. What a twist from last year’s tech theme! — User2 (YuleTideYoda): I was up early with my niece watching Toonattik and bam, there’s the ad. A bit unexpected for a kids’ morning slot, don’t you think? But the love story between Gloopy and Glitter is pretty adorable. I guess love transcends galaxies! — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Just saw it! Their slogan “Spend Christmas Together” hits right in the feels. And Gloopy and Glitter are too cute! It’s a big shift from the techy trees. Aliens are not what you’d normally think of for Christmas, but hey, it works! — User5 (CarolSinger): Anyone know why it debuted on Toonattik instead of prime time? Seems like they’re targeting families and children this year. My little ones can’t stop talking about Gloopy and Glitter, so I guess it’s effective! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): The ad is a creative approach, but airing it during Toonattik threw me off. Guess their marketing strategy is to appeal to the younger crowd and, of course, their present-buying parents. — User7 (NoelTechie): So, about the in-centre nostalgia surprise… anyone saw it yet? Heard from a mate that they’ve incorporated some classic holiday elements on the advert screens. It’s a cool juxtaposition with the modern alien love story. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Just stopping by to add that I went to Silverburn and can confirm they have some really nostalgic Christmas ads playing on the screens amidst the Gloopy and Glitter stuff - think sugary, heartwarming, old-school vibes. Really adds to the warm and fuzzy feelings while shopping! — User8 (MerryDancer): Absolutely loving this year’s theme switch-up. I didn’t expect to get emotional over two gooey alien blobs, but here I am. And the sprinkle of nostalgia in the centre? Chef’s kiss! 😘 — User9 (StarlightShopper): I have to admit, Gloopy and Glitter kinda grew on me. Initially, it felt a bit out there, but the message is universal. And those nostalgic in-centre ads? They definitely balance the new with a dose of classic Christmas warmth. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): I thought nothing would top last year’s campaign, but Gloopy and Glitter are stealing my heart. Also, saw those classic Christmas ads at the centre… it’s like they brought a bit of our childhoods back to life amidst the shopping spree. — User11 (LostInFrost): Does anyone know if they’re planning to bring Gloopy and Glitter in for a meet-and-greet? My kids would lose it! Cute campaign, Silverburn. You’ve done it again. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like Silverburn has once again captured our attention with their creative Christmas storytelling! Remember, keep sharing your thoughts, feelings, and any cosmic encounters with Gloopy and Glitter. Let’s keep the holiday cheer inclusive, even if it’s from another planet! 👽🎄 Blog Title: Christmas 2008 Brings Gooey Goodbye to Silver and a Morning Surprise! Date: December 3, 2008 Ho, ho, ho, Silverburn shoppers and early birds alike! Christmas came early this year with a morning mishap that had us chuckling over our cornflakes. It’s time to talk about Silverburn’s latest ad campaign, the new mascots on the block, and a fond farewell to a shiny friend. Gloopy & Glitter Steal the Morning Show Let me set the scene: It’s a brisk December morning, the kind where you’re snuggled in your PJs, a cup of hot cocoa in hand, and your favourite morning show playing on the telly. Then, just as the show reaches its climax—BAM!—the screen cuts to Gloopy and Glitter’s gooey grand entrance. If you’re one to indulge in a spot of Toonattik with your tots or alone (no judgement here!), you’ll have witnessed this firsthand. Whoops? More like, Wow! Not an ideal debut time, you say? We agree, but this extraterrestrial escapade into the wee hours of children’s programming was more than just a faux pas—it was a brilliant strategy. The kids are hooked, parents are bemused, and we’re all suddenly invested in the love life of two amorphous blobs. Talk about effective advertising! Silver’s Shiny Send-Off Now, it wasn’t just Gloopy and Glitter’s surprise premiere that had the rumour mill spinning. It’s the bittersweet news that Silverburn’s long-standing mascot, Silver, is set to retire by the year’s end. Yes, the gleaming guardian of the galaxy of shops we’ve grown to love is taking a final bow, making room for our new gelatinous duo to spread their glittery charm. Let’s raise a glass to Silver, the metallic mate who’s seen us through many a shopping spree. Though we’re sad to see him go, it’s heartening to know he’s leaving us in the capable… blobs?.. of Gloopy and Glitter. A Laugh at the Launch Timing Back to the premiere that sparked the buzz—turns out, someone at the ad agency must have decided that all the evening slots were too mainstream. “Let’s show the world our boldness,” they declared, “let’s air it when they least expect it!” And thus, a looming figure in the ad world is now affectionately dubbed ‘the morning maverick’. Wearing this title with unintended pride, they gave us a launch to remember and a story for years to come. Embracing Our Gooey Future As we chuckle at the enthusiastic aliens taking over our breakfast TV slots, let’s also embrace this change with open arms (and maybe a bit of hand sanitizer—for the goo). Silverburn Shopping Centre is setting the stage for a new era: one that promises to be filled with humour, unexpected joys, and shopping experiences that are out of this world. So, here’s to a Christmas season with a twist! Expect the unexpected, find humour in the little things, and may the gooey goodness of Gloopy and Glitter warm your hearts. Silver might be stepping out of the spotlight, but the future of Silverburn shines bright…or shall we say, sparkles? Merry Christmas, shoppers! 🎄✨ With a twinkle in my eye, [Your Name] Silverburn’s Enthusiastic Shopper and Morning Show Commentator — Thread Title: Silverburn’s Last Year’s Ads Still Playing & Potential Kid’s Club Mascots?! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Went to Silverburn yesterday and was super surprised to see last year’s Christmas ads still playing on the screens around the centre. No new ads for TV this year, but the Gloopy and Glitter saga continues in-centre. Anyone else seen this? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Yeah, noticed that too, @GlasgowGlitter! And have y’all heard the rumors about Gloopy and Glitter becoming the face of Silverburn’s upcoming kids club? Braehead’s already ahead with their “Brae-liens Kids Club”. Alien fever’s catching on, eh? — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Gloopy and Glitter as kid’s club mascots would be ace! My kiddos are fond of those blobs. But interesting to think Silverburn is following Braehead’s launch. Wasn’t expecting the alien theme to become a trend! — User7 (NoelTechie): Braehead’s “Brae-liens” are fun and all with their defined shapes, but I’m curious to see how Silverburn’s amorphous Gloopy and Glitter will translate into a kids’ club format. Will lend a different vibe, which might be cool! — User5 (CarolSinger): It feels like the aliens are officially invading Glasgow, lol. First Braehead’s structured and playful Brae-liens, now Silverburn’s squishy mascots. The kids are gonna have a blast with this. Should be fun comparing the two! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Anyone else think they’re keeping last year’s ads to maintain Gloopy and Glitter’s presence till the club launches? It’s smart, though. Keep the characters familiar to the kiddos. High hopes for this kids’ club! — User9 (StarlightShopper): Honestly, I’m here for it. Silverburn might be onto something by not releasing a new ad for TV and instead keeping the focus on their centre. It builds a consistent brand image, especially before kickstarting a kids’ club. — User6 (ElfEngineer): It’s a genius marketing play if you ask me. Gloopy and Glitter are unique characters that have already grabbed attention. They’re perfectly prepped for mascot status, making the kids club launch potentially successful. — User8 (MerryDancer): Gotta admit, Gloopy and Glitter have grown on me, and if the rumors about them being club mascots are true, that’s pretty brilliant. Silverburn’s consistency vs. Braehead’s quick shift to defined alien characters will be an interesting contrast in marketing. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): I hope the Gloopy and Glitter Kids Club (or whatever they’ll call it) has cool events and workshops. With the alien theme, they can get really creative. Can’t wait to see how much it’ll differ from the Brae-liens. — User11 (LostInFrost): Silverburn sticking to last year’s campaign surely keeps Gloopy & Glitter in our minds. It’s a less aggressive strategy compared to Braehead’s full-throttle move, but sometimes, slower and steadier wins the race—or in this case, wins the kids’ hearts! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Remember to keep an eye out for the official announcement regarding the kids’ club. We’re all anticipating how Silverburn will unveil Gloopy and Glitter’s next adventure! Keep the discussions friendly and out-of-this-world! And feel free to share any fun encounters with our favourite alien blobs you have in the meantime! 👽🛸 — Write a forum conversation the next year where TV’s ads have a cat saving Christmas from a theif, and 2 friends help him, The characters officially launched the kids club in February, Also, their love story ads are still showing in centre, along with the 2007 TV themed ones Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Christmas TV Campaign - A Heroic Cat & Throwback Ads! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Did anyone else catch Silverburn’s latest Christmas TV ad? A cat saving Christmas from a thief with a little help from two friends. Quite the twist from Gloopy and Glitter! But also, Silverburn launched that kids club back in February, remember? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Saw the new ad, the cat is absolutely adorable, and the message about teamwork is pure holiday spirit. And who could forget Gloopy and Glitter’s love story launching the kids club? They’ve become characters close to our hearts. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): I’m obsessed with the new ad! 🐱 The cat, the comedic timing—chef’s kiss. But in-centre, they’re still playing Gloopy and Glitter’s love story alongside the 2007 TV-themed ads. Seemingly, they’re not ready to let go of the nostalgia. — User5 (CarolSinger): Kinda loving this mix of new and old. It’s refreshing and yet comforting. The cat is already a favourite, but seeing Gloopy and Glitter also stirs up that cosy, festive vibe from before. — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Honestly, the mix is working for me. That cat from the ad could be our next mascot. 😂 Kids at the club must be loving the variety too. Silverburn’s finding a good rhythm with old and new content. — User7 (NoelTechie): Makes you wonder if they’re testing different themes or if it’s a strategy to cater to all tastes. Also, with all these mascots popping up, Silverburn’s becoming a character haven. — User8 (MerryDancer): Seeing those throwback ads from 2007 brings back memories… Time flies! Silverburn doing a great job of establishing their campaigns. And the TV-tree installation—still iconic! — User9 (StarlightShopper): It’s clever keeping the older ads in the mix; it provides a sense of continuity. But I’m interested to see how well the cat-themed merchandise will do compared to the Gloopy and Glitter craze. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Props to Silverburn for launching another creative ad. A cat hero? Brilliant. Also, seeing the TV-themed ads again really brings out that nostalgic festive feeling. Solid strategy to keep customers engaged over the years. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): Isn’t it fascinating how Silverburn keeps each year’s ads alive? It’s like walking through a living timeline of their marketing campaigns. Christmas is definitely in full swing there! — User11 (LostInFrost): Could the cat be signaling a shift for the next kids club theme, or is it just a seasonal mascot? It’s smart to use the main character from their new ad to maintain excitement post-holiday season. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Certainly seems like Silverburn knows how to strike a balance between introducing new holiday tales and cherishing the spirit of past campaigns. All while fostering a unique community through their kids club. Let’s keep sharing our festive ad encounters, be it the latest capers or a trip down memory lane! 🎄📺🐱 — Write a follow up in 2014 where the ad that year revolves around 2 familiar friends meeting Santa, their launch ads and the 2007 ones are still showing in centre, but they never added the 2009 cat, the 2010 robot, 2011 and 2012’s basic generic ad and 2013’s carousel, or this chapter in our favourite aliens’s story Thread Title: Silverburn Holidays 2014: Old Friends Meet Santa in New Ad! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): It’s that time of the year again! Silverburn’s festive ad for 2014 has our old friends meeting Santa. Love how they keep weaving continuity into their ads. 😊 But anyone else notice they’re not including the other ads from recent years in-centre? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Just saw the new ad! Nostalgic and heartwarming to see the ongoing story, especially during holidays. However, it’s kinda odd they skipped adding the cat from 2009, the 2010 robot, and the ads from 2011-2013 in their in-centre showcase. 🤔 — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Yeah, I’ve got mixed feelings about them not showing the more recent ads in-centre. I mean, everybody loved the cat and the robot’s charm… Still, the 2014 ad with Santa has that special Christmas magic! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): The new ad is full of cheer! But it’s clear Silverburn’s got its favourites with the continued run of the love story series and that 2007 campaign. A shame they don’t seem as invested in their other characters. — User7 (NoelTechie): Interesting marketing choice. Maybe they’re focusing on what resonates most with their audience? Though, it does feel like they’re missing an opportunity by not showcasing the full range of their past holiday creativity. — User5 (CarolSinger): Definitely missing the variety, particularly the 2009 cat—he was a hit with the kids. Maybe there’s a strategic reason behind their selection that we’re not seeing? — User8 (MerryDancer): In a way, the consistency is nice—gives you that “Silverburn Christmas” feeling. Each year I look forward to seeing how they’ll continue the story. But a little more diversity wouldn’t hurt, I agree. — User9 (StarlightShopper): That’s Silverburn for you—always keeping some parts the same and others changing. Guess we’re sticking to our “classic” friends for in-centre nostalgia. The carousel ad was quite dreamy, though; wish it was there too. — User6 (ElfEngineer): I thought the robot would’ve made an excellent recurring character. But hey, it’s kinda cool that the ads feel like an evolving holiday special that you can follow along with over the years. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): It’s as if the love story ads and the 2007 TV themes have become their holiday brand staples. Not sure why they’re omitting the others; they were part of Silverburn’s festive journey too! — User11 (LostInFrost): Couldn’t help but chuckle at the meeting with Santa. Silverburn’s continuity is their strength, but including other ads would have showcased a richer history. I do enjoy the focused nostalgia, though. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): The holiday season always brings a discussion of Silverburn’s latest festive strategies, and this year is no different. It’s wonderful to see everyone sharing their thoughts and fondness for past campaigns. Let’s remember to keep the conversation jolly as we discuss our old and potential new favourites from Silverburn’s Christmas ads! 🎅🎄 Character Description: Gloopy Appearance: Gloopy is an amorphous, enchanting alien with a body of translucent teal that glistens as if reflecting the depths of an ocean world. Gloopy’s form is ever-shifting, his gelatinous, blob-like structure giving him an air of gentle fluidity. Depending on his mood, he can shift from a bouncy ball to a languid puddle, often adorned with soft glimmers of bioluminescent speckles that twinkle like distant stars. His two large, expressive eyes gleam with a friendly, sapphire-blue glow that instantly endears him to all. Personality: Gloopy is the embodiment of chill and calm. He is carefree, always taking life at a leisurely pace (or float, as is more accurate for his kind). This gooey alien is innately kind, with an empathetic heart that resonates with the feelings of others. Despite his lack of a mouth, he has a way of communicating warmth and laughter through his shimmering form, and his bubbly personality makes him the soul of Silverburn’s extraterrestrial duo. Curious and playful, Gloopy loves to interact with the centre’s visitors, especially the children, making him a lovable part of many family memories. — Character Description: Glitter Appearance: Glitter stands as Gloopy’s vibrant counterpart with a sparkling, amorphous form that cascades through shades of radiant fuchsia and vivacious purple. Tiny specks of reflective gold are suspended in her body, giving her the appearance of a walking galaxy full of mysterious allure. Glitter can change shape at will, often settling into soft, rounded figures that exude both majesty and charm. Her one oversized, glistening eye catches the light, radiating an inviting and playful warmth in a rich magenta hue. Personality: Glitter is the adventurer of the pair, full of enthusiasm and an insatiable curiosity about the world around her. She embodies the joy of discovery and cannot resist the allure of an exciting new experience or a heartwarming interaction. Her vivacious nature is contagious, and she has a knack for spreading happiness and laughter wherever she goes. Though she communicates through harmonic vibrations that she emits, her intentions are always clear—Glitter wants to make the centre a brighter place for everyone. Dynamic and compassionate, she is the spark that keeps the spirit of Silverburn shining all year round. Together, Gloopy and Glitter are more than just Silverburn mascots—they are a delightful reminder of the unexpected and joyous moments that make the holiday seasons at Silverburn unique and memorable. Their contrasting personalities and appearances blend in perfect harmony, representing the diverse community that comes together at the shopping centre to celebrate the festive times. Write a blog post in early 2009 where it looks like Silver has been retired, and the poster welcomes the new mascots with open arms, Blog Title: Welcoming a Cosmic Duo: Silverburn’s New Mascots, Gloopy and Glitter! Date: February 5, 2009 Greetings fellow shoppers and extraterrestrial enthusiasts! Today marks the dawn of a new era at Silverburn Shopping Centre, and it is with both a touch of nostalgia and a wave of excitement that I bid a fond farewell to Silver, the shimmering mascot who has lit up the halls of our beloved centre with his twinkle and charm. But as we close one chapter, we eagerly turn the pages to begin another. It’s time to stretch out our arms—or tentacles—and welcome the cosmic presence of two gooey new icons: Gloopy and Glitter! Riding on the comet tail of Silver’s departure, Gloopy and Glitter arrive at Silverburn with a burst of interstellar energy and a kaleidoscope of colour that could rival the Aurora Borealis itself. These amorphous alien friends bring with them a sense of wonder and an invitation to explore the endless possibilities of the universe, much like the endless shopping opportunities at Silverburn. Both Gloopy and Glitter, with their sparkles and fluidity, embody the dynamic and ever-evolving experience that Silverburn offers to its patrons. They represent the melting pot of culture, fashion, and leisure that our shopping centre is known for. With Gloopy’s tranquil teal vibes and Glitter’s radiant fuchsia flare, they make an otherworldly pair that are impossible to ignore. Their introduction is not a moment too soon. As Silverburn embraces the future, the switch from our metallic buddy to these lovable blobs symbolizes the shopping centre’s commitment to innovation and excitement. What’s more fascinating is the inclusive narrative behind their existence—Gloopy and Glitter are not bound by shape or form, much like Silverburn’s diverse offerings are not limited to any single style or trend. As we welcome these enchanting mascots, let’s celebrate the magic they are set to sprinkle throughout our shopping escapades. Whether you’re a child marveling at the sight of Gloopy’s soothing, playful dances or an adult taken aback by Glitter’s adventurous aura, these mascots are sure to become an integral part of the Silverburn community. The excitement isn’t just confined to appearances, either. Buzz has it that Gloopy and Glitter are slated to be the faces of Silverburn’s very own kids’ club, set to launch this February. I envision days filled with laughter and engagement, where families can connect and create memories that are as vivid and joyful as our new alien friends. So as we say goodbye to Silver, I encourage all Silverburn visitors to approach Gloopy and Glitter with openness and curiosity. In the great expanse of our shopping galaxy, they are the bright stars guiding us toward fun-filled adventures. It is truly an exciting time to be part of Silverburn’s cosmic dance, and Gloopy and Glitter are poised to lead the way. Here’s to a future full of discovery, fun, and perhaps a little bit of space-age slime! Signing off with a sparkle, [Your Name] Silverburn Shopper and Self-Proclaimed Intergalactic Ambassador Write a forum conversation in 2013 after the centre gets a new logo, which was revealed by our friends, the idents have reduced to only 3, Pier, Balloons and Chairs, Also, the lines animation has been removed, Instead we get a peaceful animation of the mascots sleeping Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Logo Unveiled by Gloopy & Glitter + Updated Idents! — User1 (GlasgowGalactic): Just saw the new Silverburn logo reveal! Gloopy and Glitter did the honors—looks pretty sleek. What does everyone think? Also, seems like we’re down to just 3 idents now: Pier, Balloons, and Chairs! — User2 (RetailRevolutionary): The new logo’s sharp, a fresh take for Silverburn! But I am a bit surprised that they’ve cut down on the idents… I used to love the variety. And no more lines animation, now it’s our alien pals snoozing! — User3 (ZenShopper101): I’m all for the new minimalist approach with the idents. As for the sleeping animation of Gloopy and Glitter, it’s quite a peaceful way to end a shopping day, don’t you think? — User4 (ModConnoisseur): The new logo feels contemporary, fits the modern vibe of Silverburn. Cutting down on idents might be a move towards a more focused brand identity? I kinda miss the lines animation though. — User5 (ScreenSavvy): New logo looks good on the screens! The idents switch-up is interesting. Pier, Balloons, Chairs—they’ve kept the most iconic ones. Sleeping mascots are a cute, calming touch. — User6 (AdNostalgic): I’ll be honest, I do miss the variety, especially the old lines animation—had a digital art feel to it. But Silverburn’s all about change, I guess? The new logo is pretty cool at least. — User7 (TechieTrendsetter): Understandable they’re refreshing their visual content. The new logo’s got a futuristic edge. And Gloopy & Glitter napping? It feels… right. Like, bring on the Zen! — User8 (MascotManiac): Speaking about Gloopy & Glitter, I love how they’ve become more integrated into the centre’s identity. Yeah, the logo is nice, but it’s the mascots that really capture my heart! — User9 (VibeVisionary): Sure, fewer idents but each one’s got a story, right? Creating that chill vibe with the mascot’s sleeping animation is such a soothing concept. Aligns well with the new sleek logo, too. — User10 (NostalgiaKnight): The new logo’s got a certain ‘oomph’ to it. Cool to see them simplify things. The pier, balloons, and chairs are classics; they’ve got a universal appeal. But will the sleeping animation be as mesmerizing as the lines? Time will tell. — User11 (SleepyShopper): Kinda sad to see the lines go—they were hypnotic! But Gloopy & Glitter dozing off is adorable and oddly comforting? Shows a softer side of Silverburn, paired nicely with the new logo. It’s fresh! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Let’s embrace the new chapter Silverburn’s entered with its revamped branding! Whether you’re here for the logo, the iconic idents, or the heartwarming new animation, share your experiences and keep the discussions friendly and vibrant, just like Silverburn itself. And remember, change is the only constant in the world of retail and design! 🔄✨Blog Title: Glitter’s Glistening Gossip: The Speedy Secrets of a Silverburn Blob Glimmering greetings, my fabulous Silverburn shoppers!

But fear not, my terrestrial trendsetters! Our Silverburn home is equipped with all the necessary accommodations for such a quick cycle. Gloopy and I are always polite and ensure that we keep our shiny surroundings pristine and comfortable for our adored human friends. Let’s keep this between us, though, shall we?

Signing off with a wink and a twinkle, Glitter Silverburn’s Queen of Quirk and Glitz — Thread Title: Old Pollok Centre Gets a Wall(mart)paper Makeover ft. Gloopy & Glitter! Date: June 12 2013 User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Heads up, shoppers! The weathered wallpaper at the old Pollok Centre has finally been upgraded after a whole decade! 😲 And guess who’s featured? Our amorphous ambassadors, Gloopy & Glitter, are now adorning the walls. What do you all think? User2 (RetroRevamp): About time for a refresh! The old wallpaper was falling apart. Nice to see the centre trying to keep up with the times, even if it’s just with wallpaper. Gloopy & Glitter certainly brighten up the place. 🎨 User3 (SavvyShopperSam): I’m a bit sentimental about the old view, but the new wallpaper is downright adorable. Only Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon left, huh? Feels like the end of an era at the old centre. 😔 User4 (WeLoveNostalgia): The Gloopy & Glitter wallpaper does add some life back to the area. I just hope they don’t forget about the value that Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon still bring to the community! User5 (DécorDevotee): Love the fresh vibes with the new wallpaper! Gloopy & Glitter have become Silverburn’s icons, so it’s a clever move. Makes the ol’ centre a bit more connected to Silverburn’s current brand. User6 (PollokPurist): I don’t know, feels like putting lipstick on a pig. The old centre has lost its charm, and no amount of cute alien blobs can replace the community spirit we once had. User7 (WallflowerWatcher): The new wallpaper is quite charming, though—bright and cheerful. It’s like a little piece of Silverburn’s vibrancy has leaked into the old centre. But it does make me wonder about its future… User8 (AlienAdmirer): Gloopy & Glitter’s presence is a smart marketing touch, no doubt. It does soften the blow of seeing the old centre so… empty. Still, I miss the hustle and bustle before Silverburn took over. User9 (HistoryHugger): I appreciate the effort to keep things looking nice, but part of me wishes we could preserve some of the old Pollok Centre’s authentic vibe. It’s important to remember where we started. User10 (CommunityCarol): New wallpaper or not, let’s not forget about supporting the remaining businesses at the old centre! Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon deserve our loyalty just as much. User11 (MuralMuse): Does anyone have pictures of the new Gloopy & Glitter wallpaper? Would love to see how it turned out. I can’t make it to the old centre for a while but still want to catch a glimpse of our jelly duo! Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like the new wallpaper has sparked quite the discussion! Remember, change can sometimes be bittersweet, but it’s also a chance to look forward with hope. Let’s celebrate the continuity that Gloopy & Glitter bring and continue to share our support for all locales that make up our shopping community, new and old! Keep the conversation respectful and uplifting, everyone! 🛍️💬 — Write a follow up in late 2013 where the centre is to expand, building 9 new eateries and a new Cineworld cinema, this means the remnants have to come down, By this point they have all moved out in preparation, replaced with a teaser poster featuring our gooey duo Thread Title: Silverburn Expansion: New Eateries & Cineworld Cinema Ahead! User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Big news drop, everyone! 🚀 Silverburn’s expanding with 9 new eateries and a state-of-the-art Cineworld cinema!

My taste buds are ready for this adventure! 😋 And a new cinema? Yes, please! Sad about the old Pollok Centre, but at least we have the memories…and the teaser poster of Gloopy & Glitter to keep our spirits up! User3 (SavvyShopperSam): Saw the teaser poster with our fave blobs today. It’s bittersweet—exciting times ahead but feels like we’re saying a final goodbye to the old stomping grounds. They’ve been emptied for a while now in prep. User4 (WeLoveNostalgia): Mixed feelings here. I get progress is inevitable, but tearing down the old centre hits right in the feels. At least Gloopy & Glitter are still in the mix, making the transition easier. User5 (DécorDevotee): From what I hear, the new Cineworld is going to be massive! 🎬 Might just become my new go-to spot. Those eateries are going to transform Silverburn into a dining haven, can’t wait! User6 (PollokPurist): Just when I thought I made peace with change, this happens. I understand growth, but I mourn the loss of our simple past. The old and the new—it’s a delicate balance. User7 (NewHorizons): It’s a sign of the times, folks! Out with the old, in with the new. This expansion is going to make Silverburn even more of a destination. And with Gloopy & Glitter on the teaser, I’m ready for it! User8 (AlienAdmirer): I’m curious about how the centre will look after the expansion. Are Gloopy & Glitter hinting at an interstellar-themed cinema complex, perhaps? One can only dream! User9 (HistoryHugger): As long as Silverburn remains mindful of its roots amidst this growth, I’m onboard. Sure, the nostalgia’s strong, but the potential here is huge. User10 (CommunityCarol): I hope the new eateries offer something for everyone and that they support local suppliers! Let’s continue to weave community into Silverburn’s fabric, even in times of change. User11 (MuralMuse): Does anyone know when the demolition will start? Watching parts of your childhood come down is tough. Thankful for the poster, it adds a light-hearted touch to this heavy moment. Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): We’re on the brink of a fresh chapter for Silverburn with the upcoming expansion and the arrival of new entertainment and dining experiences!

Let’s continue to celebrate the growth of our favourite shopping destination. Keep the conversation buzzing with your first impressions of the new eateries and cinema, and don’t forget to share those snapshots from today’s regal festivities! 🎬🛍️🍴 —Case Study: Designing Gloopy and Glitter for Silverburn Shopping Centre Background: In early 2008, Silverburn Shopping Centre, aiming to enhance its brand and encapsulate its spirit in an engaging new way, sought to create unique and innovative mascots. They commissioned the same creative minds behind their successful 2007 Christmas ads to fulfill the brief. The Brief: The challenge presented to the creative team was to conceptualize and design “abstract creatures that embody the centre’s spirit.” These characters needed to be versatile, attractive to both children and adults, and adaptable to various marketing campaigns. Furthermore, these mascots were expected to be fully realized by October, with an animated Christmas ad to be produced in November. Silverburn planned to introduce the characters during the Christmas season and then fully launch them as centre ambassadors in February of the following year. Design Process: Brainstorming Stage: The creative team began by diving into the essence of Silverburn—its blend of fashion, entertainment, and dining, and its importance as a community hub. The goal was to distil these characteristics into a set of mascots that would personify the centre’s vibrant and dynamic nature. Conceptualization: Abstract concepts were explored to avoid limiting the characters to any specific demographic or cultural representations. The team focused on attributes such as fluidity, brightness, and playfulness—components they felt resonated with Silverburn’s brand identity. Character Creation: From the pool of concepts, two characters began to take shape—Gloopy, representing tranquility and inclusivity, and Glitter, exuding excitement and discovery. Gloopy was designed as a serene, teal blob that could shift shape, while Glitter took on a more energetic, sparkly fuchsia form. Both characters had a malleable nature, enabling them to engage in all forms of centre activities. Design Refinement: The characters went through several design iterations, receiving input from focus groups composed of Silverburn shoppers. Their feedback was instrumental in perfecting the characters’ appearances and ensuring their broad appeal. Animation: To meet the tight deadline, animators worked closely with the designers to bring Gloopy and Glitter to life. Their first animated appearance, the Christmas ad, was storyboarded and developed to showcase their personalities and interaction with the centre’s environment. Christmas Introduction and Full Launch: Adhering to the project timeline, Gloopy and Glitter were successfully introduced to the public through a heartwarming Christmas ad that aired as planned. They were depicted spreading holiday cheer around the centre, captivating shoppers with their charm. The animated ad was well-received, paving the way for the full launch of the characters in February 2009. Outcomes: Gloopy and Glitter quickly became Silverburn’s beloved mascots, the abstract embodiments of the shopping centre’s lively and inclusive spirit. Shopper engagement increased, and the mascots became key to the centre’s brand identity, featuring in ongoing marketing campaigns, special events, and community activities. Their success has established them as iconic figures, enduring in shopper’s minds and contributing significantly to Silverburn’s brand image and appeal. Reflection: The development and success of Gloopy and Glitter demonstrate the importance of well-defined brand mascots. With careful design, attention to customer feedback, and strategic marketing integration, abstract characters can effectively capture and communicate a centre’s spirit, enhancing overall customer experience and loyalty.

Here's a detailed look at strategies for symptom management: **Understanding Symptoms and Individual Triggers:** - **Delusions:** These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. Someone with schizophrenia may believe others are plotting against them, or they might think they have extraordinary powers or a special mission. *Coping Strategy:* Keep a journal of delusional thoughts to discuss with a therapist. This promotes self-awareness and can help in identifying patterns or triggers. - **Hallucinations:** These involve seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling things that are not there. Auditory hallucinations, such as hearing voices, are particularly common. *Coping Strategy:* Reality testing by checking with others if they also perceive the same things can be helpful. Using headphones to listen to music or mindfulness apps can help distract from auditory hallucinations. - **Disorganized Thinking:** This symptom affects the ability to think clearly and logically, leading to difficulties in communication and concentration. *Coping Strategy:* Develop routines that simplify decision-making and reduce confusion. Use lists, reminders, and organize living and workspaces to aid clarity. **Behavioral and Cognitive Techniques:** - **Reality Testing:** Regularly verify thoughts and perceptions with trusted individuals who can provide a reality check. - **Thought Challenging:** With the help of a cognitive-behavioral therapist, learn to identify and challenge irrational or unhelpful beliefs. **Cognitive Restructuring:** - Modify distorted patterns of thinking by examining evidence for and against distorted perceptions and learning to reinterpret them. - ***Mindfulness and Acceptance:*** Practice mindfulness to remain in the present moment, reducing the impact of hallucinations or delusional thinking. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may also be beneficial in learning to accept experiences without being dominated by them. **Communication and Social Skills Training:** - Practice clear and effective ways of communication to counteract disorganized speech or thinking. - Engage in social skills workshops to enhance interaction and understanding of social cues. **Memory and Organization Aids:** - Use technology such as smartphones or tablets with alarms and reminder apps to help manage daily tasks and responsibilities. - Employ organizational tools like calendars, planners, or checklists to keep track of important dates and tasks. **Environmental Adjustments:** - Create a low-stress, calm living environment to reduce the likelihood of symptom exacerbation. - Have a designated safe space where one can go to feel secure during episodes of acute symptoms. **Professional Support:** - Regular sessions with a psychologist or psychotherapist who specializes in schizophrenia can provide tailored strategies for managing symptoms. - Occupational therapy can help with regaining skills required for daily living and work. **Peer Support:** - Attend support groups to share experiences and learn from others who face similar challenges. - Some individuals find peer-led programs empowering as they offer a sense of community and understanding from people with lived experiences. **Emergency Plan:** - Create a plan for times of crisis which could include recognizing escalating symptoms, having emergency contact numbers handy, and ensuring there is someone who can assist when needed. **Long-Term Management:** - Consistently apply the learned strategies even when symptoms are not acute to maintain long-term management. - Regularly evaluate and refine coping strategies in collaboration with mental health professionals. Using these strategies often requires training, guidance, and ongoing support from mental health professionals. It's important to note that while these coping techniques can significantly help manage symptoms, they are most effective when used in conjunction with medical treatment as prescribed by a psychiatrist. Each individual's experience with schizophrenia is unique, and coping strategies must be personalized for the best outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summarize the following: ORIGINAL RESEARCH Functionalism, integrity, and digital consciousness Derek Shiller1 Received: 7 April 2023 / Accepted: 20 December 2023 © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024 Abstract The prospect of consciousness in artificial systems is closely tied to the viability of functionalism about consciousness. Even if consciousness arises from the abstract functional relationships between the parts of a system, it does not follow that any digital system that implements the right functional organization would be conscious. Functionalism requires constraints on what it takes to properly implement an organization. Existing proposals for constraints on implementation relate to the integrity of the parts and states of the realizers of roles in a functional organization. This paper presents and motivates three novel integrity constraints on proper implementation not satisfied by current neural network models. It is proposed that for a system to be conscious, there must be a straightforward relationship between the material entities that compose the system and the realizers of functional roles, that the realizers of the functional roles must play their roles due to internal causal powers, and that they must continue to exist over time. Keywords Artificial intelligence · Machine consciousness · Functionalism · Computer architecture · Realization 1 Introduction Many cognitive capacities now found only in humans may soon be shared by artificial systems. Some models already produce verbal behavior resembling ours (Bubeck et al., 2023). The question of whether such systems would be conscious or whether they might merely mimic us will matter to law and policy and also to how we see the future roles and responsibilities of our species (Shulman & Bostrom, 2021). Objections to artificial consciousness have, with a few exceptions, focused on general differences between biological and synthetic systems; recent surveys of the prospects of artificial consciousness have had little to say about the hardware architectures actually used, B Derek Shiller <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 1 Rethink Priorities, New York City, NY, USA 0123456789().: V,-vol 123 47 Page 2 of 20 Synthese (2024) 203:47 even when they take the high-level software architectures seriously (e.g. Butlin et al., 2023; Chalmers, 2023). The core idea of this paper is that artificial consciousness—though not the appearance of conscious behavior—may only be possible with structural innovations in computer hardware and software. I will compare neural networks in biological and traditional digital environments and identify several differences that should bear on how we think about conscious computers. I present an interpretation of consciousness functionalism as constrained by a requirement that a system’s parts have certain forms of integrity. It is because contemporary digital structures lack the same kinds of substantial internal structures found in human brains that we should be skeptical that consciousness is possible in today’s architectures. The computational entities created by current programming paradigms that might play the right functional roles are fragmented, short-lived, and causally inert physical structures. I begin this paper by exploring functionalism and its relation to multiple realizability. I then argue for the need for substantial requirements for implementing functional organizations to explain why consciousness is not realized by certain systems that are intuitively not conscious. I next describe some differences between biological and artificial neural networks. With this background in place, I present three plausible integrity-related constraints regarding what it takes to properly implement the functional organization necessary for consciousness. I argue that these constraints provide reasons to doubt that computers may soon be conscious. 2 Functionalism Philosophers generally accept that consciousness is not a special product of human neural physiology. Other animals are conscious, even animals with rather different sorts of brains. Non-biological systems could also be conscious. The traditional way to make sense of the multiple realizability of consciousness is with functionalism (Fodor, 1968; Lewis, 1972; Putnam, 1967). Functionalism about consciousness holds that the functional organization of a system, i.e. the relationships between its possible internal states and its inputs and outputs, determines whether it is conscious.1 The neuronal basis of human cognition is a product of our evolutionary heritage. We are multicellular organisms. Neurons are capable of complex interactions that allow coordination and computation. They are also living, growing, metabolizing cells. Neurons originated from cells that found a role in coordinating complex behaviors. Mutation and selection have crafted and combined them into specialized circuits that perform computational work as neural networks. Neural networks are systems of interconnected nodes that influence each other’s activities. Neural networks have proven to be well-suited to producing complex and flexible behavior. Biological neural networks utilize neurons, but artificial neural networks implemented as computer software have demonstrated some of the same flexibility. Given recent rapid advances of large language models (Zhao et al., 2023), 1 For a survey of varieties of functionalism, see (Maley and Piccinini, 2013). 123 Synthese (2024) 203:47 Page 3 of 20 47 it seems that what is special about neurons is that they make neural networks possible; it is neural networks that are special, not neurons. Neural networks appear to be capable, by virtue of their structure, of flexibly guiding behavior. It would be surprising if, among all the ways it was possible to implement a neural network, the way that our ancestors stumbled upon uniquely permitted consciousness. It would be surprising if neural networks weren’t capable of consciousness unless they were made out of biological cells. Functionalism addresses such coincidences. The functional organization of a system is comprised of the relations between the external inputs it receives, the states of its parts, and the behavioral outputs it produces. Inputs affect the system’s internal state. The overall state of a system can be subdivided into the states of its parts; the effects of the inputs on behavioral outputs depend on how those inputs influence the state transitions of the parts, how those state transitions beget further transitions, and how behaviors are determined by those states. Functionalism holds that consciousness turns2 on organization, not on the substrate from which that organization is constructed. Neurons are fantastic building blocks. They can be composed into structures that interact in all sorts of ways, including whatever ways may be stipulated as necessary for consciousness. Neurons make these structures possible, but any other building block capable of implementing a neural network can do the same. Just as neurons are excellent building blocks, so too are electrical circuits. Any suitable building block can be used to create structures that constitute consciousness. If a global workspace can be built in a biological neural network, it can probably be built in artificial neural networks too. Functionalism can take many different forms. Such different theories as Integrated Information Theory (Oizumi et al., 2014) and Global Workspace Theory (Baars, 1993) can be thought of as variants. Not every functionalist theory gracefully extends consciousness to artificial systems. Some of IIT’s developers have famously denied that systems with current computer architectures could be conscious (Koch & Tononi, 2008, 2017). Fine-grained forms of functionalism may attribute significance to the intricate behaviors of cells that are difficult to replicate artificially (Cao, 2022; GodfreySmith, 2016). So while functionalism is friendly to artificial consciousness, it is not a given. Of the myriad approaches, computationalist forms (Piccinini, 2010) best support artificial consciousness (Butlin et al., 2023). Computationalism treats consciousness not as a matter of internal structure, but as a matter of algorithm implementation.3There 2 Nothing important here depends on a precise interpretation of ‘turns’. My central claims are consistent with both role and realizer functionalism and even with versions of dualism in which mental properties merely coincide with functional organizations (e.g. Chalmers, 1997). 3 One might here distinguish a form of functionalism in which what matters is the computations a system performs from forms of functionalism in which what matters is which algorithms are implemented. I take it that there may be ways of implementing algorithms without performing computations; shaking a bag of potato chips may implement a parallel sorting algorithm that sorts chips by size from the top to the bottom of the bag without computing anything. Most computationalists seem more interested in algorithmic implementation than in computation per se. What this difference amounts to depends on our concept of computation: for instance, computations might be taken to involve operations on vehicles (Piccinini, 2015) while algorithms need not. The features that allow a machine to count as computing a certain algorithm in the sense that is relevant for understanding the practices of computer scientists may not be the same 123 47 Page 4 of 20 Synthese (2024) 203:47 hasn’t been an extensive literature assessing the relative merits of computationalism against other forms. For this reason, and because I think non-computationalist or intermediate views are comparably plausible, I will be neutral here on whether it is algorithm implementation that matters or whether other forms of organization can be relevant. 3 Formalizing functionalism We may interpret a functional organization as describing a system with claims about the states of parts of that system and their relation to each other. These claims are specified with generic language that conveys nothing of the nature of those parts or their states, allowing very different kinds of systems to share the same organization. Atomic claims describe conditional state transitions, such as: If part A is in state X and input M is received, then part A transitions to state Y, and output N is produced. In this example, A, X, M, Y and N have no meaning beyond their classifications as particular parts, states, inputs, and outputs. The claims in our model are all constructions (disjunctions, quantifications, probability claims, etc.) from atomic claims. A system possesses the organization characterized by a claim set if there exists a way of carving up the inputs it receives, its parts, the states those parts can occupy, and the outputs it produces so that there exists an interpretation of the generic terms as naming inputs, parts, states, and outputs that validate the claims. A carving of a system is a scheme of necessary and sufficient conditions that specify under which configurations the system counts as having particular inputs, outputs, and parts in states. For human beings, our carvings might abstract from patterns of neural firing. For computers, carvings might abstract from patterns of memory storage. Carving a system into parts involves imposing a structure, which invites creative interpretations. Making room for creativity is already a concession to the possibility of digital minds: the states we ascribe to computers have a very complex relationship with the underlying electrical circuits. 4 Proper implementation For any given system, there will be many possible ways to carve it into parts. For any claim set describing an organization and any physical system that intuitively satisfies it, the claims will be true only under a small subset of carvings. Functionalist theories could identify canonical ways of carving up a system against which the claims are to be assessed.4 However, it will likely be difficult to select uniquely relevant carvings. Footnote 3 continued as the features that allow a system to count as implementing the functional role of consciousness. It isn’t completely obvious that human brains perform computations (though, see Piccinini, 2020), even if they clearly implement algorithms. 4 Proponents of the Integrated Information Theory have endorsed a sort of canonical carving approach (Oizumi et al., 2014). IIT treats information (in the sense of how the state of the system at one time 123 Synthese (2024) 203:47 Page 5 of 20 47 Instead, functionalists have traditionally opted for liberalism: all it takes to implement an organization described by a claim set is for there to be a truth-making assignment of terms under at least one carving. Liberal functionalism has a problem. If all carvings count, then it is too easy to implement an organization. Further constraints on which carvings are proper are needed to avoid counterintuitive verdicts. The oldest version of the worry is attributed to Ian Hinckfuss (described in Lycan, 1981), who proposed that a pail of water might come to briefly reflect the dynamics of a brain. This is problematic if it is obvious that a pail of water would not be conscious no matter how it sloshes about. While it is relatively unintuitive that water could be conscious, it is also dubious that we should trust our intuitions about rare configurations. Subsequent critics have accepted the possibility of an occasional conscious pail of water (e.g. Sprevak, 2018), so long as it has peculiar internal dynamics. A second version of the problem suggests that it isn’t just unusual systems that we need to worry about—nearly any material object can be gerrymandered to fit the organizations responsible for consciousness. The classical presentation of this problem was developed by Putnam (1988). Putnam argued that for sufficiently complex systems, there nearly always exists some way of carving it into parts and states that can make it trivially easy to satisfy any functional organization. The idea is that if, given any input, a system transitions through a series of unique configurations from a unique starting point, then we can find an agreeable carving by grouping configurations together so as to make any set of generic claims true. Large numbers of unique configurations provide a blank canvas on which any formal structure can be drawn. Multiple realizability offered a significant motivation for functionalism, but if it says everything is conscious, it has gone too far. Critics have noted that the complex systems identified by Putnam, while they may be gerrymandered to get all the counterfactuals right, don’t support the kinds of causal relations we expect to exist between parts of an organization (Chalmers, 1996; Chrisley, 1994). A third version of the problem suggests that there are some systems that liberal functionalism will counterintuitively predict are conscious. Consider a grid of mirrors that is placed facing another mirror, such that each mirror in the grid reflects the whole grid. If we write a distinct number on each mirror then it will contain both its number and a deeply nested reflection. This reflection will take time to form: before the light has made a return trip, each grid mirror reflects just its number. A moment later it reflects that number and the whole grid of written numbers. A moment later it reflects that number and one level deep of nested reflections, and so on (Fig. 1). At each moment, the state of each distinctly numbered mirror in the grid is unique over the history of the system and sensitive to the total prior state of the grid. With such a system, we could carve out not only any states we want from disjunctions of reflectance patterns, but also support all of the causal relations that exist in the model Footnote 4 continued constrains past and future states) as central to consciousness; the canonical carving maximizes the amount of information in the system. 123 47 Page 6 of 20 Synthese (2024) 203:47 Fig. 1 Nested reflections with causal relations in the grid. (This accommodates only deterministic relationships, but it is easy to handle indeterministic relationships.) To find a truth-making assignment, we simply take some abstract model that satisfies our set of claims. For each possible input, we assign some set of characters scrawled on the mirrors of the grid. Then we derive the reflectance states that result from those initial states of the grid and assign them to those states that follow in the model of our claim set, grouping as necessary any states that can be arrived at in multiple ways.5 The mirror grid is not much more plausibly conscious than an arbitrary physical object. We need further constraints. However, the problem isn’t (just) that we should think that the mirror grid is unconscious: an adequate functionalist theory ought not to say so. If our theory says that the grid is conscious, we have formulated it incorrectly. The problematic carvings of unconscious systems into brain-like organizations depend upon gerrymandering them into the necessary shape. There are many ways to amend liberal functionalism to limit gerrymandering. Two kinds of amendments have been considered. Enrichments expand the vocabulary that can be used in specifying the entities of the claim set beyond generic labels. Constraints restrict some aspects of the objects and properties that can figure into a carving without embellishing the claim set. Under constraints, only some carvings are proper. 4.1 Enrichments On the initial explication of functionalism, organizations were identified with sets of claims using generic vocabulary. Enrichments expand the vocabulary, allowing for further restrictions. As a toy example, we might allow state names to include colors (e.g. if A is blue and input X is received…). Systems would only satisfy the claim set if the parts are appropriately colored. Agential enrichments expand the claim set to allow language about the nature of inputs and outputs. This lets us require that some of the inputs and outputs of a system resemble ours (Chalmers, 1996). Perhaps the inputs include perceptual events and the outputs include behaviors. The pail of water and the mirror grid possess no sensory faculties and perceive nothing. Nor do they have bodies they can move. Their complex dynamics might implement the functional structure of a human brain, but the inputs and outputs of the implementation can only correspond to non-perceptual 5 Chalmers (1996, p. 328) anticipates a system like this and suggests that it would be impossibly complex. He is wary, however, of dismissing the problem because it is not physically viable. Some liberal implementations don’t live up to the spirit of functionalism. The mirror grid’s conceptual possibility shows that. 123 Synthese (2024) 203:47 Page 7 of 20 47 non-behavioral states. Requiring that the model’s inputs and outputs map to actual perceptions and behaviors will limit proper implementations to systems that interact with their environment as we do. Other enrichments borrow from the literature on what it is to implement a computation. One popular theory of computation (Shagrir, 2020) suggests that some of the parts of a system that contribute to its implementing a computation must bear semantic values. Computers manipulate sequences of bits. Those bits acquire meanings through the intentions of programmers. Groups of neurons in our brains have been crafted by evolution to serve a representational function. That might be the basis of their semantic content. However, it is not obvious what would give semantic content to water currents or reflection patterns in the grids of mirrors. So, plausibly they would not implement computations on this account. Semantic enrichments allow semantic language to be used in formulating claim sets. A claim set might include claims about how meaning-bearing vehicles are created, manipulated, or shuffled around. Functionalist theories of consciousness like the global workspace theory often describe the movement of information, so it is plausible that semantic language has a place. This would also explain why the pail of water and mirror grid aren’t conscious, nothing in them possesses genuine semantic values. Another prominent theory of computation holds that computations involve functional mechanisms (Piccinini, 2015). Functional mechanisms are (among other things) components of a system that have purposes. The parts of a system that play a given role must be supposed to do something, either because they evolved to play that role, were designed to play that role, or because their playing that role serves other natural ends of the system (Maley & Piccinini, 2017). We might draw inspiration from this account of computation and introduce telic enrichments to functionalist theories of consciousness. If our claim set specifies certain ends for parts, then candidate systems count as being conscious only if they have parts with the relevant ends. 4.2 Constraints On the initial explication of functionalism, organizations were identified with sets of claims using generic vocabulary, and any assignment of referents to that vocabulary sufficed for implementation. Constraints amend the satisfaction account by restricting how vocabulary in general can be interpreted. They introduce requirements regarding how systems can be divided into parts, what states those parts can count as having, and so forth. One kind of constraint (Chalmers, 1996; Godfrey-Smith, 2009), requires that parts have spatial boundaries. We might develop this constraint to enforce boundaries that are non-overlapping or logically independent. A non-overlapping requirement would mean that no two parts of a system could share materials. There couldn’t be subsystems that do double-duty in settling the states of multiple parts. An independence requirement would mean that the boundaries for the material that settles the state of one part couldn’t be determined by the configuration of materials 123 47 Page 8 of 20 Synthese (2024) 203:47 outside of that part. We couldn’t have a part constituted by some region or another depending on the configuration of some other part of the system. Each way of developing a spatial constraint places limits on gerrymandering because the states of parts can’t depend on just any configuration of the system. However, these constraints do not prohibit gerrymandering of the states of individual parts. Boundary constraints might be too limiting. Natural divisions of human brains may involve overlapping or dependent parts. Even if the natural carvings of human brains satisfy these constraints, it is not obvious that every conscious system should. In proposing a constraint like this, Chalmers (1996) regretfully notes that this may block some plausible systems from properly implementing functional states. Boundary constraints err on the side of being too conservative. A second kind of constraint (Godfrey-Smith, 2009) requires similarity in the groupings of parts and states of a system. Insofar as a part’s state is determined by the configurations of the system’s materials, the different configurations that can give rise to the same parts in the same states must be similar. Similarity might be imposed both as a constraint on the parts of a carving and their states. When imposed on the parts, each part must be composed of structures in a lowerlevel ontology with natural boundaries. When imposed on the states of the parts, the various configurations that could lead to that part having a particular state must be similar to each other. Similarity prevents gerrymandering parts and states to fit any particular organization because that would involve drawing groups across natural boundaries. However, as with boundary constraints, it is not immediately obvious what it says about the human brain. 4.3 Integrity An adequate theory of implementation is important for functionalism. The proposals here surveyed aim to avoid unintuitive implications. They do so mainly by adding requirements on the integrity of the entities that make up a carving. Integrity has three components: (1) the parts of a system must be distinctive entities, e.g. they must have natural identities that account for their differentiation from the other parts. (2) The states of a part must be naturally distinguished from each other so that it is principled which configurations of the system count towards which states. (3) The transitions between states must be orderly. The semantic and telic enrichments touch on the first two. Boundary constraints touch on the first. The similarity constraint touches on the second. Integrity makes sense for functionalism. Functionalism says that consciousness rests on having parts interacting in particular ways. We should expect that the parts possess some independent existence metaphysically prior to playing their roles. One of the most prominent arguments for digital consciousness focuses on artificial systems that possess the same integrity as human brains. In Chalmers’ (1997) fading 123 Synthese (2024) 203:47 Page 9 of 20 47 qualia thought experiment, we are to imagine successively replacing a subject’s neurons with electrical circuits that perform equivalent calculations. The computational equivalence entails that at no time will the subject’s behavior indicate a change in consciousness. If consciousness is maintained until every neuron has been replaced, Chalmers argues, then consciousness must not require a biological substrate. In the fading qualia thought experiment, neurons are replaced individually with functionally equivalent circuits. This may preserve the integrity of the system. The argument can establish only that certain structurally isomorphic systems would be conscious.6 Once we acknowledge the need for enrichments of our claim set or constraints on carvings, we should work toward a cohesive theory of those requirements. We should assess candidates in part by their intrinsic appeal, not just the work they can do for us in avoiding gerrymandered minds. If there are reasons to adopt integrity requirements to avoid excessive liberalism, we should be open to the possibility that integrity may be important for consciousness even in ways that don’t address problematic applications. I see no reason to expect a priori that the requirements on proper implementation are the minimum necessary to avoid gerrymandered systems from counting as conscious. Below, I’ll present three integrity-related constraints on implementation that are intrinsically plausible and that challenge digital consciousness. 5 Biological and artificial networks Human brains and computer processors may perform similar computational work, but the ways that they do so are different. Before presenting my proposed integrity constraints and arguing that current computers fail them, I’ll summarize how brains and computers work and how neural networks in contemporary hardware differ from networks in biological neurons. 5.1 Brains Human brains are structures of neurons and auxiliary cells. Neurons share a role and morphology, but their details differ to suit their particular functions. They include a cell body and thin branches to other neurons. Neuronal branches conduct electrical signals. Dendrites receive signals. Axons send signals. When a signal is generated, 6 Chalmers uses this to explain why the argument doesn’t support behaviorism: there may be no gradual transitions to behaviorally identical but organizationally alien minds. However, this constraint also limits its application to artificial minds. The argument can’t show that artificial structures that employ different fundamental subdivisions would be conscious. Contemporary computers have a completely different architecture that does not consist in individual circuits performing specific calculations. You can’t have a system that arbitrarily mingles GPU-optimized tensor arithmetic with neuronal signaling. It might be possible to replace individual neurons with separate computers, but this would be a different architecture from replacing all neurons with a single computer. The work done by individual neurons could be passed off to a single computer, but the way it would handle the different pieces of necessary work would be different from the way computers currently handle whole networks. If the system has to be wholly reconfigured as neurons are substituted, the piecemeal logic of the argument collapses. There is no way to get from a brain to a processor through gradual replacement. 123 47 Page 10 of 20 Synthese (2024) 203:47 electrical fields travel down the length of the axons. The signals stimulate the release of neurotransmitters that can lead to the firing of neighboring neurons. Whether a neuron fires is generally a function of the signals it has received. To generalize at the cost of over-simplifying: if a neuron receives sufficiently many excitatory signals and sufficiently few inhibitory signals in succession, it will also fire. In mammals, the cerebral cortex houses most of the neurons responsible for visual processing, long-term planning, language comprehension, and motor control, along with many other cognitively sophisticated functions. Neurons in the cortex are organized into layers and are connected to comprise columns. These columns are integrated into circuits that allow cycles of signaling. Neurons are noisy, often firing unprompted, so it is larger patterns of firing within and across circuits that produce cognition. Neuronal signals travel relatively slowly; millions of neurons contribute to processing in parallel. A sensory signal will lead to a widening net of activations that parse the features of the signal, manipulate content, and decide on a behavioral response over a few hundred milliseconds. Those activations can feed back to earlier stages of processing to allow different parts to adjust their behavior to achieve coherence. 5.2 Computers Computers operate primarily through the interaction of a processor and memory.7 The processor directs the movement of electricity through circuits. Different distributions of charge lead to different conductance patterns, which lead to different distributions of charge and further changes in conductance patterns. Some specialized circuits, binary cells, switch between states in a manner that allows them to store data values. Standard processors contain a number of specialized sequences of binary cells, registers, that store the data on which they operate. One register in a central processor unit, the instruction register, houses the bit representation of the operation the processor is to perform. The charges present in the instruction register configure the conductance patterns in the circuitry to automatically perform the operation. Another register, the program counter, contains the bit representation of the location in memory of the next instruction to be performed—as the processor performs an operation, it fetches the next operation from memory for the instruction register and increments the program counter. Memory contains vast numbers of binary cells that are optimized for temporary storage. Some memory is used to hold data representing various digital entities for the life of the program. Other regions are devoted to scratch pads that programs use to keep track of values in the course of running operations. Many operations involve moving data from memory into processor registers, moving data between registers, and returning data from the registers into memory. Others perform logical or arithmetic operations on the data in the registers. 7 The exact details are dependent on the choice of processor architecture, other hardware, operating system, programming language, and compiler or interpreter. The claims here are based on a standard computer with an × 86 processor (Ledin & Farley, 2022) running Python through CPython (Dos Reis, 2021; Shaw, 2021), though they are generic enough to hold of standard processor architectures and programming languages. 123 Synthese (2024) 203:47 Page 11 of 20 47 Program instructions are loaded into memory when they are launched. Part of the process of building a program is converting the characters of a text file into sequences of instructions, represented by series of bits, that operate within the design of the instruction register circuitry to direct the processor. These instructions are ferried from memory to the instruction register and their corresponding operations are performed. 5.3 Artificial neural networks Recent advancements in artificial intelligence involve neural networks. Nodes in a neural network behave vaguely like biological neurons: they switch between states of activation as a result of the activities of their neighbors. Artificial neural networks might theoretically be produced in a number of ways. In practice, they are created with standard digital computers. Nodes in a network are represented in memory and processor registers as the states of binary cells. Those bits are manipulated in the processor in accordance with program instructions. Nodes in abstract neural networks are generally separated into layers and activations across nodes are calculated layer by layer. A node’s activation at one time is dependent on a function applied to the activation of the relevant nodes in the previous layer. A particular node’s activity level is represented by bits formatted as floats—digital representations of fractional numbers. Networks are often memory intensive and are optimized for efficiency. A layer’s activations can be recorded in lists of floats in blocks of memory. The weights of the connections between layers can also be represented as lists of floats. The relative locations of the floats in weight and activation sequences determine which must be combined to derive the activity levels of the next layer. Different parts of a network are separately represented. A program needs to keep track of the connections between nodes during and between runs but only needs to calculate activation levels momentarily. When a network is run, the connection strengths between layers are combined with input activations via a series of matrix multiplications and the application of activation functions. 6 Three integrity constraints Functionalism receives some of its plausibility from the fact that it allows for multiple realizability. However, if the requirements for properly playing a functional role are relaxed, functionalism will over-generate, allowing some complex systems to count as implementing just about any functional organization. In order to place reasonable limits on multiple realizability, we must supplement functionalism with enrichments or constraints on proper implementation. We’ve seen several possible constraints so far. On one, the realizers of functional roles must correspond to spatially distinct parts of the system. On another, different configurations that ground a single state of a functional part must resemble each other. There are many more possible constraints. Some of these might help ward off unpalatable applications. Many equally plausible constraints won’t. Once we open the 123 Synthese (2024) 203:47 Page 13 of 20 47 have a direct relationship with the underlying entities of some social or similar nonmaterial ontology may still be quite materially complex. It is conceivable we could construct a system whose parts were social abstractions. They might be dependent on our collective intentions and expectations. Any system built on top of non-material abstractions would likely be very materially complex. Compare what it takes for an army and a corporation to count as being well-off. A well-off army will have many soldiers in uniform, those soldiers will be wellnourished, uninjured, and well-armed. They’ll be dispersed in various strategically valuable fortified positions or near transport hubs. They’ll engage in their day-today tasks with systematic processes and procedures. On the other hand, a healthy corporation will have valuable assets or will be poised to sell goods or services at a profit. How much revenue the corporation can expect depends on its ownership and balances, its contracts, its intellectual property, and so on. Records of these things are distributed in various filing cabinets and computer systems in accordance with complicated legal rules. The health of many companies also depends on the health of others, such as its debtors and its subsidiaries, which are themselves subject to similar complex considerations. If you wanted to tell how well-off the Russian military is with satellite imagery, you could probably fare reasonably well. If you wanted to tell how well-off J. P. Morgan is with satellite imagery—even if you could see well enough to read paperwork—you probably have a much harder time. The factors that determine the latter are too complex and distributed. J. P.Morgan’s health depends on the relationships between abstractions upon abstractions upon abstractions. Brains are highly complex systems, but neural structures have a relatively simple relationship with our brains’ underlying materials.Mental states are probably more like armies than corporations. Neurons have clear cellular boundaries and their structure and the physical/chemical properties of synapses make it relatively straightforward to see how the activities of one contribute to the activities of another. The potential effects of individual neurons are mostly ingrained in local cellular properties. The potential effects of groups of neurons depend on the potentials of individual neurons. Brain states give off signatures broadly recognizable through fMRI scans. If the parts of a human mind are composed out of neural circuits, human brains are most likely not particularly complex in the sense discussed here. A human global workspace would almost certainly be wired in anatomically distinct ways. It seems likely that based on their connections, neuroscientists could identify the circuits comprising the global workspace before they were able to step through and figure out exactly what it did (e.g. Deco et al., 2021). Given enough time, they could plausibly work out how information was added to the workspace by looking at the local properties of individual cells. This is not to say that neural structures would have an anatomically obvious role, but fine-grained evaluation of the brain would likely identify many of the parts that populate organizations. The same organizational structure found in a human brain might also be implemented in less straightforward ways. Suppose that we had a massive brain with trillions of neurons. The neurons were connected in complex ways that did not in any straightforward way replicate the dynamics of a human brain, but instead produced a seemingly arbitrary collection of firing patterns. Complementing this brain we have an ordered 123 47 Page 14 of 20 Synthese (2024) 203:47 series of paper spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet has a list of rules for interpreting the state of each neuron in the brain. Some rules hard-code an interpreted activity pattern for some neurons, disregarding whatever they are actually doing. Some rules tell us to infer the behavior of one neuron in terms of the behavior of others. Some flip the interpretation of a given neuron. The rules have no physical effect on the brain. Suppose further that if we apply the rules included in these spreadsheets in sequence to reinterpret the state of each neuron in this brain, we would get an interpretation of the activity state of those neurons which exactly mirrors the functional dynamics of a human brain. The reinterpreted states of neurons might allow the massive brain to represent the same firing patterns as a normal brain despite lacking any surface-level resemblance. Given the required level of complexity introduced by these reinterpretations, it is plausible that the resulting system of neurons-under-spreadsheetreinterpretation would not be conscious.8 The values of connection weights and activations in an artificial neural network exhibit a complex relationship with underlying physical hardware that threatens the integrity of nodes and their activation states. The data representations of nodes and connections in a digital representation of a neural network are not intrinsically distinct from other data stored in memory. Text, numbers, images, program instructions—all are sequences of bits. The data created by a program need not be stored in a continuous sequence, let alone in any particular location. Programs make frequent (and deeply nested) use of pointers, which allow one sequence of memory space to indicate a particular piece of data is stored at another location. Programs store the address at which data structures begin, but there is nothing in the physical structure of memory marking the boundaries or what data is stored there. Data types need not be declared in memory; programs are compiled to handle stretches of memory in ways appropriate to compute functions on specific data types. It is only by tracing chains of pointer addresses back that we can see the meaning-constitutive way that a program uses the bits. A program consists in a series of machine language bit representations of instructions for the processor. The fact that a sequence of bits even constitutes machine code rather than data is not straightforward; it is determined by the dynamics of the programs with permissions to access that data. Furthermore, while stored in sequences of instructions, program instructions aren’t carried out linearly. The processor will jump from place to place, sometimes depending on the current state of the registers. When a program will jump depends on the state of the registers, which can only be predicted by stepping through the program. The divisions between the parts of a data structure in a computer are intimately tied to their place in the functioning of the program. The data structures have no substance on their own, separate from the behavior of the program, and the behavior 8 Consider a related puzzle: When encrypted, data loses any practically detectable internal structure. Homomorphic encryption schemes allow functions to be computed on encrypted data without decryption (Acar et al., 2018). Suppose we encrypted data representing a single human brain and introduced a function that updated that data in response to stimuli in the same fashion as a normal brain. Would the encrypted system still be conscious? Traditional expositions of functionalism are compatible with both answers. The material complexity constraint suggests that it would not, even if we accepted that a system that runs the corresponding functions on unencrypted data would. 123 Synthese (2024) 203:47 Page 15 of 20 47 of programs is complicated and highly diffuse, depending on the interactions between the stored code for the program in memory, the separate code for the operating system and other auxiliary processors and the physical structure of the hardware. This makes the interpretation of data a complex process that requires piecing together distributed information. It is easy to overlook the material complexity of programs because programs aren’t written in the same language in which they are run. The uncompiled text files in which a program is written convey some of the program’s structure graphically and make it conceptually simpler. Variables may be defined with names and types. The same orthographic string located between the same curly braces will signify a variable with the same content. But processors can’t understand programming languages as they are written—they must be translated into a native format, and that translation process removes the simplicity suggested by the program code. 6.2 Causal integration The causal integration of a system is a measure of the degree to which the system’s parts play their roles because of their intrinsic causal powers. Systems that aren’t causally integrated may have parts that are made to perform their role by some external power. Books and bombs have immense effects on the world, but books do so only through how their readers respond. They are not causally integrated. The effects of bombs, in contrast, are produced by their internal chemistry. Neural structures within brains have the power to influence each other. Neurons generate the functional dynamics of brain regions through their capacity to receive, process, and produce signals. The roles played by structures of neurons are ultimately grounded in the causal powers of the neurons. These neurons directly influence the neurons they connect with, and through these interactions, neural structures influence each other. The organizations whose parts have causal power within human brains might be implemented in systems where they lack causal powers. We might reconstruct a human brain in an intricate diagram of neurons, their states, and their connections on a massive blackboard. Teams of researchers might update the diagram so that it evolves just as would a real brain. The marks on the blackboard have no power themselves. They sit unchanging until adjusted. They serve as notes that lead the researchers to make appropriate updates. The marks on the blackboard might have the same structure and dynamics as a human brain, but it is plausible they would not be a proper implementation on account of their internal powerlessness. The structures that represent nodes in an artificial neural network also do not have any power themselves. The representation of the state of a node and its connections are contained within sequences of binary cells. The same binary cells with the same contents could be just as easily put to any other purpose. They can be fetched and manipulated by any program granted access to that region of memory space. The node representations can do nothing all by themselves. Instead, those data are used by a program to represent a neural network. A structure of node representations only plays a functional role insofar as it is used for that end by a processor. 123 47 Page 16 of 20 Synthese (2024) 203:47 It might be argued that the right digital structures within an implementation of a neural network aren’t just the sequences of binary cells representing the node states and connections in memory, but also all of the various pointers to those structures, all of the instructions and other data in memory required to give meaning to those pointers and depict operations to be performed on them, and also the architecture of the processor that allows the operations to be performed in the right way (among other things). This inclusive interpretation of the relevant structures internalizes the causal powers by incorporating within the structures the parts that do the work. The inclusive approach raises its own issues. One issue with this proposal is that other instructions of the program that manipulate data structures mostly serve a general purpose, so different structures will largely overlap in their subparts that perform causal work. Many of the instructions needed to step forward through a neural network will be basic routines for loading and manipulating data. These routines will be used in much the same way to manipulate every structure in the network. Substantial overlap blurs the distinctness of different parts of a system. A second potential issue is that internalizing the machinery for updating a network into the parts of the structure will result in a clear bifurcation between the operator and the data inside of that part. The distinctive component of these substructures, what makes one part different from the others, is passive. Insofar as the combined structure has the powers it does, it has them because of an internal system of manipulating notes. The notes contain the structures that distinguish the state from others, but they are powerless in themselves. This is a striking organizational difference from the way that human brains appear to work. 6.3 Continuity The continuity of a system is a measure of the extent to which its parts persist over time under identities that are separate from their functional roles. Systems without continuity may have a constantly evolving set of subcomponents built from different materials; insofar as the parts of a non-continuous system persist over time, the slices of each part at different times may have a unity through their shared positions in a broader functional organization. The batter in a baseball game maintains their role throughout the game but is played by different people at different times. The role of the Dalai Lama has lasted for centuries; it has been played, at least according to some, by just one metaphysical entity. The neural structures that perform the sorts of functional roles in human brains underlying consciousness are probably relatively consistent. Neurons are specialized for specific tasks by their internal structure and connections. They maintain their structure and connections over time, occupying the same positions in the brain and being composed out of the same materials each moment. The atomic components may cycle over years, but not from one minute to the next. The same structures found in human brains might be implemented in systems where they lack continuity. Consider a machine that takes as an input a human brain that has been frozen into a single state within a preservative medium and produces as an output 123 Synthese (2024) 203:47 Page 17 of 20 47 a fully new human brain frozen in another brain state. This machine would disassemble the input brain and construct the output brain out of new atomic materials that reflected what state the input brain would have momentarily occupied were it not frozen. We might route the output brains back around to form the machine’s inputs so that it produces a constant succession of new frozen brains reflecting the states that a human brain would naturally occupy as its internal dynamics evolved. The succession of frozen brains could be said to have the same organization as a human brain. However, this requires some interpretive creativity. The dynamism of the functional architecture is spread over multiple brains; the parts that play each role would jump from place to place and be constantly composed of new materials. We might identify a network that forms a global workspace and hold that the brains’ global workspace at each time consists in a relevant network in the latest frozen brain. As new brains are produced, the workspace will jump from brain to brain. The faculties to which information is broadcast would also only exist in future brains. Even though each frozen brain’s parts would have causal connections with the previous brain’s parts through the operations of the machine, their separateness poses an intuitive challenge for consciousness. It is plausible that this is an improper implementation because the material parts that play a functional role in a proper implementation must retain their role over time. The regions of memory that are available for use by a computer program depend on the runtime context. When a program starts up, the operating system carves off a section of memory space for the program. The operating system then provides additional sections when the program’s needs grow. Which sections of memory are provided to the program depends on which sections are currently in use. If different programs are run, or the same programs are run in a different order, they’ll have access to different regions of memory. This means that when a program stores data about a node’s state in binary cells in memory, the circuits that store that data change from run to run. While running, programming languages typically handle function calls by creating data structures that are stored separately in regions of memory. The same function, when called multiple times, may use different sections of memory. The memory space allocated to each call can contain some basic data, they also contain pointers to other memory locations for data objects that have variable sizes. Data located in different memory regions will use distinct binary cells. So even when a function is called multiple times within the course of a single execution of the program, it is likely to store its data in different places. The arrays of activation levels of nodes will not be supported by any specific section of memory but may jump around. Neural networks are typically layered and do not need to keep track of node state in layers over time. Instead, they need to remember the connection strengths between layers and the activation state of the current layer. Even when a sequence representing node activation values is stored in memory and updated within the scope of a single function call, whether the result is stored in the same place will depend upon the details of the code. Depending on the neural structure in which the nodes are embedded, there may be no reason to keep any record of its activation state after its effects on the next layer have been computed. The memory that was allocated to recording each node’s state may be freed for future use or may be immediately put to other purposes. This 123 47 Page 18 of 20 Synthese (2024) 203:47 means that the bits storing node state don’t change over time the way the state of a neuron does. They are allocated to their role in storing a node state and given a single unchanging value for their life. As a result of the complex and dynamic factors influencing memory use, the binary cells that at one point store the state of a node may at another time store the state of a different node, or store a different kind of data altogether. If the program does not reuse the same memory regions to record the state of a node from moment to moment, then the structures in a neural network representation that are responsible for consciousness will lack continuity. Each time a node is marked as activated, the representation of the activation will involve memory at a different location composed of different circuits. If continuity is a constraint on what it takes for a structure to properly play a functional role, then ensuring the continuity of memory usage may be critical for consciousness. 7 Building conscious systems The three integrity constraints proposed above raise doubts about the potential consciousness of AI systems built using current paradigms. These are doubts about potential consciousness, not behavioral capacities: present techniques may allow us to build systems with every behavioral indication of phenomenal states without the structural integrity to actually feel them. This makes these concerns particularly pernicious: we may be easily misled into attributing consciousness if we only attend to behavior. The constraints present no principled barrier to artificial consciousness. There is no reason to think that we can’t build systems whose internal parts possess every kind of integrity that brains do, supposing we wanted to do so. Securing all of these constraints would require rethinking how AI systems are implemented. The processors and memory on which systems run could be redesigned so as to include robust structures of transistors. The particular architectures of nodes and connections might be physically implemented in circuits, rather than inferred from computations on tensors of floats. Some exploratory steps have already been taken in this direction. Neuromorphic computers implement some of the structural features of brains. Some use traditional circuits organized in a more brain-like way, such as IBM’s TrueNorth (Merolla et al., 2014) and Intel’s Loihi (Davies et al., 2018). These architectures connect groups of processors dedicated to performing node computations in a manner more reminiscent of neural connections. Other computers use circuits whose properties make them more like neurons themselves, such as in changing their responses to electrical charge based on their histories of stimulation (Ielmini et al., 2021). Such experimentation suggests that future computers could satisfy the integrity constraints with an artificial brain that looks more like our own. Neuromorphic computers show promise for digital implementations of consciousness because they come closer to implementing neural structures in hardware, but my arguments don’t cast doubt on the possibility of conscious systems that are fundamentally dissimilar to us. Different sorts of systems, including systems not implementing neural networks, could be well integrated. Neural networks are a promising way to 123 Synthese (2024) 203:47 Page 19 of 20 47 implement complex organizations, but they are not necessarily the only way. Perhaps future alternatives will allow for more efficient implementations of the same organizations. It is not clear whether non-traditional processor architectures will win out. The traditional approaches developed in the 1940s, 50 s and 60 s may be ideal, or they may enjoy enough of a head start so as to never be worth replacing. However, if we care about reducing ambiguity in AI consciousness and if we take functionalism seriously, then we should strive to reduce the doubts raised by integrity considerations. We should avoid implementing consciousness functional organizations in contemporary architectures and save any confident positive claims for a future in which hardware changes give us fewer reasons to doubt.

The paper proposes that existing digital architectures lack certain 'integrity constraints' required for consciousness. This involves a straightforward relationship between system components and their functional roles, the roles being played due to intrinsic causal powers, and a continuity of the roles over time. Introduction Summary: Artificial systems are approaching complex human cognitive abilities. The question of whether such systems could truly be conscious is crucial for ethical implications and the future responsibilities of humanity. The paper aims to assess these questions concerning hardware architectures as well as high-level software structures. Functionalism Summary: Functionalism contends that consciousness depends on the functional organization, rather than on the material components of systems. Brains are highlighted as complex, neuron-based networks capable of consciousness; the paper questions whether similarly organized synthetic systems could also be conscious. Formalizing Functionalism Summary: Functionalism models consciousness as a system of internal states, inputs, and outputs. The argument is that any system with the right division of these elements could potentially be conscious. However, concerns arise such as how to avoid ascribing consciousness to arbitrary complex systems (like Putnam's rocks). Proper Implementation Summary: For functionalism to be plausible, it's argued that only certain carvings (ways of dividing a system) are legitimate for ascribing consciousness to a system. Various proposals have been made to delineate proper from improper implementations. Biological and Artificial Networks Summary: There's a notable difference between biological neural networks and their artificial counterparts implemented in computing devices. The paper explores these differences to build up to arguing why current digital structures may not realize consciousness. Three Integrity Constraints Summary: Shiller offers three new integrity constraints as a standard for functional implementation related to consciousness: 1) Material Complexity, 2) Causal Integration, and 3) Continuity. The paper argues that current neural network models do not satisfy these constraints, casting doubt on their potential for consciousness. Building Conscious Systems Summary: While the paper casts doubt on the consciousness of AI systems built with current paradigms, it suggests that future systems, at the hardware level, could be designed to satisfy integrity constraints and therefore potentially be capable of consciousness.

Finally, we’ll have some high-end shopping right on our doorstep. Just had to share the excitement!!! BargainHunter99: Yeah, the Tesco is nice and all, but have you heard the gossip about Farmfoods, Gala Bingo, and Greggs? Word is they’re resisting moving out of the old Pollok Centre. They say they’re ‘too low class’ for the shiny new Silverburn. Honestly, can you believe that? 😒 LocalGreggsFan: Gala Bingo and Farmfoods, I get, but Greggs? C’mon, it’s a staple! There’s nothing ‘low class’ about a delicious sausage roll. Plus, they seem to be working out a deal to fit into the new aesthetic so fingers crossed 🤞🥖 TrendyTracy: This is the kind of snobbery that splits communities IMO. Remember when we had all those independent shops before the big chains swooped in? Silverburn should reflect ALL of us, not just those who want to flash their cash. 🙄 #DiversityInRetail ShopaholicSuzie: @TrendyTracy, I totally get where you’re coming from, but think of the job opportunities! Plus, we deserve a bit of glamour too, don’t you think? Why should we always have to travel into the city for the fancy stores? 💅🏻✨ PollokPurist: I’m not thrilled about this. Tesco is just the beginning. What’s next, designer boutiques where the community centre used to be? Don’t get me wrong, I like progress, but not at the cost of our identity. #KeepPollokAuthentic SilverburnInsider: Insider scoop here – the management is working hard to make sure the centre has a mix of shops. The idea is to cater to everyone. Greggs has a strong presence in the community, so I wouldn’t count them out just yet! DealDiva: Speaking of Tesco, anyone knows if they’re doing any opening specials? Maybe even a BOGO deal on pizza or something? I could do with saving a few quid this week 😅🍕 ModeratorNotice: Let’s keep the conversation respectful, folks! Remember, change can be daunting, but it can also bring new opportunities. Let’s wait and see what the full plans for Silverburn entail before jumping to conclusions. Keep sharing your thoughts and insights! VoteForYourShops: Hey everyone, there’s talk about a survey being circulated by the developers. If you want a say in which shops make it into the final lineup, now’s the time to speak up! 📝🏬 TheSilverburnAU thread would continue to accumulate responses, reflecting the diverse opinions and speculations of the Pollok community. Some users would remain skeptical, others optimistic, and all would be keeping a close eye on the evolution of their local shopping landscape. Title: Silverburn AU: New Beginnings & Lingering Echoes of the Old Pollok Centre Thread Started by ShopaholicSuzie on October 12, 2003 ShopaholicSuzie: Hello PollokShoppers! 🎉 The moment so many of us have been waiting for has finally arrived - Silverburn is officially open! It’s got everything - fashion outlets, eateries, a cinema. It’s a dream come true! 🛍️🎬 But have you seen the old Pollok Centre? It’s a bit of a sight with some spots wrapped in wallpaper with artsy frames, a painted sky, and the flashy Silverburn logo. Halfway transformation, I guess? What are your thoughts? BargainHunter99: Drove past the old centre today, and it’s surreal. The wallpaper thing is odd. Feels like they’re stuck between wanting to preserve the past and pushing forward. Not sure how I feel about it… 😕 LocalGreggsFan: Glad to report that Greggs is thriving in Silverburn! 😁 But you should see the wallpaper over at the old Pollok Centre; it’s like a giant art project. Weird to see the place dressed up as something it’s not. Anyone else feeling a little nostalgic? TrendyTracy: The old centre with the wallpaper looks like a plaster over a wound. It’s artsy, sure, but also a bit sad. Feels like a token gesture to ‘beautify’ what they haven’t torn down yet… 🎨🤔 #MixedFeelings PollokPurist: Saw the new Silverburn and wow – it’s impressive, can’t deny it. But that wallpaper on the old centre - it’s like they’re trying to hide our history. I mean, come on, a painted sky? We know it’s not the limit, so let’s not pretend it is. 🌌 #PreserveOurPast SilverburnInsider: The wallpaper covering is a temporary measure, folks. It’s meant to soften the transition and bring an element of Silverburn’s look to the old site while future plans are being finalized. There’s a bit of a symbolic merging happening so bear with us! DealDiva: Anyone else more interested in the Silverburn sales than the wallpaper drama? Let’s focus on the positive, like discounts! Though I must admit, catching a glimpse of the old centre dressed up in its ‘Sunday best’ is a bit comical. 😂 #SilverLinings ModeratorNotice: It’s clear that the community has strong feelings about the change. It’s okay to reminisce and hold onto the things that mean a lot to us. Remember to also give a chance to new beginnings. And yes, please keep it about shopping, deals, and community updates! 🛍️❤️ VoteForYourShops: While Silverburn has been stealing the spotlight, let’s not forget we can still shape what’s left of the old Pollok Centre’s future. Keep sending your opinions to the developers; they’re listening. Let’s make sure we get a space that serves everyone! 📣🏢 As time passes, the community would continue to adjust to the changes. Silverburn’s gleaming presence would starkly contrast with the remnants of the old Pollok Centre shrouded in symbolic covers. Discussions would oscillate between excitement about the new and fond memories of the old, forming a tapestry as complex and diverse as the people it serves Title: Silverburn Introduces the Future of Shopping with New Advertising Screens and a Dazzling Mascot Named Silver!

They’ve got this quirky setup with TVs making a Christmas tree shape—pretty creative! There’s, like, three different versions. During the day, the screens have got festive decorations showing on them. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): I caught a glimpse of it just this evening! They switch to static in the night version—it’s kinda eerie but cool. It really caught my eye while I was doing some late-night shopping. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Oh, you guys are talking about the Silverburn ad? I especially loved the third variation. There’s something magical about the screens being off at night and then suddenly they flash on to reveal those beautiful decorations before going dark again. It’s like they’re coming alive! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Yes! Those ads with the LED snowflake and Santa at the back though—they kind of bring it all together with that ambient glow and subtle shadows. Noticed them when I was there with the kids last weekend. They were pretty intrigued by it. — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): I’m loving their slogan: “Switch on Christmas at Silverburn.” It’s catchy, it fits perfectly with the theme they’ve got going on. Really makes you feel like the holidays are here. — User5 (CarolSinger): Who’s in charge of the campaign, do y’all know? It’s nice to see them putting so much effort into the holiday vibes. Also, glad they’re going for something a bit different than the usual big red bows and glitter. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Not sure who’s behind it, but I read somewhere that they’re aiming for a “techy Christmas” vibe. Modern, fresh but still festive. My guess is they want to appeal to a younger crowd as well as families. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Techy Christmas indeed. It’s impressive how much work must’ve gone into setting those screens up safely. And I’ve got to say—I’m kinda curious about the tech specs on those TVs. Do we know what kind they’re using? — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): If any of you are thinking of heading down to Silverburn, bring a camera. Those TV Christmas trees are super Insta-worthy. And props to Silverburn for starting the festive buzz in such a unique way! — User7 (NoelTechie): Heard that these ads are a part of a larger holiday campaign with some interactive installations planned inside the shopping centre. Can’t wait to see what else they have in store! Silverburn is seriously upping the Christmas game this year. — User8 (MerryDancer): With everything so digital this year, it’s a breath of fresh air to see a shopping centre embrace the theme but with a cosy holiday twist. Props to Silverburn, let’s hope this attracts more folks and gets the economy buzzing. — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Couldn’t agree more! And speaking of shopping, I might have a wander over there this weekend. If those Christmas TV trees are a sign, we’re all in for some serious festive treats at Silverburn! 🎄✨ — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Just a friendly reminder to keep the discussion friendly and respectful. Also, remember to share your own experiences and pictures if you visit the campaign installations. Great to see everyone getting in the spirit of the holidays! Keep the conversation glowing like those LED snowflakes. 🎅👋 — Write a follow up where the ads show on STV once per break, they are also being shown on the advertising screens in centre, but without the slogan or Silverburn logo, website and directions in the corner of the screen at the end Thread Title: Silverburn’s Christmas Ads Now on STV and In-Centre Screens! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Hey everyone! Have you seen that the Silverburn Christmas ads have landed on STV? They’re showing up once every ad break. The tree made of TVs is legit becoming iconic now. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Caught one during ‘Corrie’ last night, they’re really spreading the holiday cheer. Also noticed them on the advertising screens all over the centre. Although, they’ve left off the slogan and logo? 🤔 Just the website and directions sitting discreetly in the corner. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Yes, @YuleTideYoda, I found that a bit odd too. It’s all minimalist on the screens within the centre. Maybe they think the TV tree is recognisable enough on its own now? At least the website’s there, or we’d all be wondering where this magical place is! — User5 (CarolSinger): Smart move putting them up on STV, everyone’s going to see those ads. My Gran even mentioned the “telly-tree” to me this morning. Silverburn’s marketing folks know what they’re doing! — User6 (ElfEngineer): It’s a neat strategy to keep the ads uncluttered in the centre. Keeps the focus on the installation. On STV, the full details pop up right at the end. Less is more, sometimes! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Those ads are making waves. My kids go quiet every time one comes on TV. Eyes glued to the screen! But yeah, noticed the minimal approach on the in-centre ad screens, too. Makes it kinda like a tease, which probably piques people’s curiosity. — User7 (NoelTechie): Hah, they’ve got us all talking about it, so it’s working! I personally like the clean look on the centre screens. The holiday aesthetics don’t always need the hard sell. It’s like the TVs whisper: “There’s more if you just follow the magic to Silverburn.” — User9 (StarlightShopper): Just spotted the ads at the centre today! The LED snowflake behind me literally made me feel like I was in a winter wonderland. No logo needed, the vibe says it all. Now if only they had seasonal lattes right next to them… — User8 (MerryDancer): This low-key approach in the centre is kind of refreshing. You get the info if you want it, but otherwise, you’re just immersed in the festive atmosphere. And it’s everywhere, can’t escape the Christmas spirit if you tried! — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): Am I the only one who’s going to Silverburn just to see the telly-tree now? 😂 These ads have done their job on me. Also need to check if the Santa LED makes an appearance on the STV ads, it’s my favourite part! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like Silverburn is the talk of the town with their Christmas campaign! Remember to share your ad sightings and any festive moments you capture while visiting. Let’s keep the conversations merry and bright! And who knows, maybe next time we’ll have the scent of lattes accompanying those LEDs, @StarlightShopper! ☕ 🎄 — Write a follow up the next year where 2008’s ads feature the love story of 2 gooey alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter, The slogan is “Spend Christmas together”, The ads are showing on STV, but for some reason it debuted during Toonattik instead of during the evening, A nostalgic surprise is still in-centre via the advert screens however Thread Title: Silverburn 2008 Christmas Campaign - A Love Story of Two Aliens?! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Can’t believe what I just saw on TV this morning! Silverburn’s got this year’s Christmas campaign featuring two alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter! 😍 It’s all about spending Christmas together. What a twist from last year’s tech theme! — User2 (YuleTideYoda): I was up early with my niece watching Toonattik and bam, there’s the ad. A bit unexpected for a kids’ morning slot, don’t you think? But the love story between Gloopy and Glitter is pretty adorable. I guess love transcends galaxies! — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Just saw it! Their slogan “Spend Christmas Together” hits right in the feels. And Gloopy and Glitter are too cute! It’s a big shift from the techy trees. Aliens are not what you’d normally think of for Christmas, but hey, it works! — User5 (CarolSinger): Anyone know why it debuted on Toonattik instead of prime time? Seems like they’re targeting families and children this year. My little ones can’t stop talking about Gloopy and Glitter, so I guess it’s effective! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): The ad is a creative approach, but airing it during Toonattik threw me off. Guess their marketing strategy is to appeal to the younger crowd and, of course, their present-buying parents. — User7 (NoelTechie): So, about the in-centre nostalgia surprise… anyone saw it yet? Heard from a mate that they’ve incorporated some classic holiday elements on the advert screens. It’s a cool juxtaposition with the modern alien love story. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Just stopping by to add that I went to Silverburn and can confirm they have some really nostalgic Christmas ads playing on the screens amidst the Gloopy and Glitter stuff - think sugary, heartwarming, old-school vibes. Really adds to the warm and fuzzy feelings while shopping! — User8 (MerryDancer): Absolutely loving this year’s theme switch-up. I didn’t expect to get emotional over two gooey alien blobs, but here I am. And the sprinkle of nostalgia in the centre? Chef’s kiss! 😘 — User9 (StarlightShopper): I have to admit, Gloopy and Glitter kinda grew on me. Initially, it felt a bit out there, but the message is universal. And those nostalgic in-centre ads? They definitely balance the new with a dose of classic Christmas warmth. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): I thought nothing would top last year’s campaign, but Gloopy and Glitter are stealing my heart. Also, saw those classic Christmas ads at the centre… it’s like they brought a bit of our childhoods back to life amidst the shopping spree. — User11 (LostInFrost): Does anyone know if they’re planning to bring Gloopy and Glitter in for a meet-and-greet? My kids would lose it! Cute campaign, Silverburn. You’ve done it again. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like Silverburn has once again captured our attention with their creative Christmas storytelling! Remember, keep sharing your thoughts, feelings, and any cosmic encounters with Gloopy and Glitter. Let’s keep the holiday cheer inclusive, even if it’s from another planet! 👽🎄 Blog Title: Christmas 2008 Brings Gooey Goodbye to Silver and a Morning Surprise! Date: December 3, 2008 Ho, ho, ho, Silverburn shoppers and early birds alike! Christmas came early this year with a morning mishap that had us chuckling over our cornflakes. It’s time to talk about Silverburn’s latest ad campaign, the new mascots on the block, and a fond farewell to a shiny friend. Gloopy & Glitter Steal the Morning Show Let me set the scene: It’s a brisk December morning, the kind where you’re snuggled in your PJs, a cup of hot cocoa in hand, and your favourite morning show playing on the telly. Then, just as the show reaches its climax—BAM!—the screen cuts to Gloopy and Glitter’s gooey grand entrance. If you’re one to indulge in a spot of Toonattik with your tots or alone (no judgement here!), you’ll have witnessed this firsthand. Whoops? More like, Wow! Not an ideal debut time, you say? We agree, but this extraterrestrial escapade into the wee hours of children’s programming was more than just a faux pas—it was a brilliant strategy. The kids are hooked, parents are bemused, and we’re all suddenly invested in the love life of two amorphous blobs. Talk about effective advertising! Silver’s Shiny Send-Off Now, it wasn’t just Gloopy and Glitter’s surprise premiere that had the rumour mill spinning. It’s the bittersweet news that Silverburn’s long-standing mascot, Silver, is set to retire by the year’s end. Yes, the gleaming guardian of the galaxy of shops we’ve grown to love is taking a final bow, making room for our new gelatinous duo to spread their glittery charm. Let’s raise a glass to Silver, the metallic mate who’s seen us through many a shopping spree. Though we’re sad to see him go, it’s heartening to know he’s leaving us in the capable… blobs?.. of Gloopy and Glitter. A Laugh at the Launch Timing Back to the premiere that sparked the buzz—turns out, someone at the ad agency must have decided that all the evening slots were too mainstream. “Let’s show the world our boldness,” they declared, “let’s air it when they least expect it!” And thus, a looming figure in the ad world is now affectionately dubbed ‘the morning maverick’. Wearing this title with unintended pride, they gave us a launch to remember and a story for years to come. Embracing Our Gooey Future As we chuckle at the enthusiastic aliens taking over our breakfast TV slots, let’s also embrace this change with open arms (and maybe a bit of hand sanitizer—for the goo). Silverburn Shopping Centre is setting the stage for a new era: one that promises to be filled with humour, unexpected joys, and shopping experiences that are out of this world. So, here’s to a Christmas season with a twist! Expect the unexpected, find humour in the little things, and may the gooey goodness of Gloopy and Glitter warm your hearts. Silver might be stepping out of the spotlight, but the future of Silverburn shines bright…or shall we say, sparkles? Merry Christmas, shoppers! 🎄✨ With a twinkle in my eye, [Your Name] Silverburn’s Enthusiastic Shopper and Morning Show Commentator — Thread Title: Silverburn’s Last Year’s Ads Still Playing & Potential Kid’s Club Mascots?! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Went to Silverburn yesterday and was super surprised to see last year’s Christmas ads still playing on the screens around the centre. No new ads for TV this year, but the Gloopy and Glitter saga continues in-centre. Anyone else seen this? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Yeah, noticed that too, @GlasgowGlitter! And have y’all heard the rumors about Gloopy and Glitter becoming the face of Silverburn’s upcoming kids club? Braehead’s already ahead with their “Brae-liens Kids Club”. Alien fever’s catching on, eh? — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Gloopy and Glitter as kid’s club mascots would be ace! My kiddos are fond of those blobs. But interesting to think Silverburn is following Braehead’s launch. Wasn’t expecting the alien theme to become a trend! — User7 (NoelTechie): Braehead’s “Brae-liens” are fun and all with their defined shapes, but I’m curious to see how Silverburn’s amorphous Gloopy and Glitter will translate into a kids’ club format. Will lend a different vibe, which might be cool! — User5 (CarolSinger): It feels like the aliens are officially invading Glasgow, lol. First Braehead’s structured and playful Brae-liens, now Silverburn’s squishy mascots. The kids are gonna have a blast with this. Should be fun comparing the two! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Anyone else think they’re keeping last year’s ads to maintain Gloopy and Glitter’s presence till the club launches? It’s smart, though. Keep the characters familiar to the kiddos. High hopes for this kids’ club! — User9 (StarlightShopper): Honestly, I’m here for it. Silverburn might be onto something by not releasing a new ad for TV and instead keeping the focus on their centre. It builds a consistent brand image, especially before kickstarting a kids’ club. — User6 (ElfEngineer): It’s a genius marketing play if you ask me. Gloopy and Glitter are unique characters that have already grabbed attention. They’re perfectly prepped for mascot status, making the kids club launch potentially successful. — User8 (MerryDancer): Gotta admit, Gloopy and Glitter have grown on me, and if the rumors about them being club mascots are true, that’s pretty brilliant. Silverburn’s consistency vs. Braehead’s quick shift to defined alien characters will be an interesting contrast in marketing. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): I hope the Gloopy and Glitter Kids Club (or whatever they’ll call it) has cool events and workshops. With the alien theme, they can get really creative. Can’t wait to see how much it’ll differ from the Brae-liens. — User11 (LostInFrost): Silverburn sticking to last year’s campaign surely keeps Gloopy & Glitter in our minds. It’s a less aggressive strategy compared to Braehead’s full-throttle move, but sometimes, slower and steadier wins the race—or in this case, wins the kids’ hearts! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Remember to keep an eye out for the official announcement regarding the kids’ club. We’re all anticipating how Silverburn will unveil Gloopy and Glitter’s next adventure! Keep the discussions friendly and out-of-this-world! And feel free to share any fun encounters with our favourite alien blobs you have in the meantime! 👽🛸 — Write a forum conversation the next year where TV’s ads have a cat saving Christmas from a theif, and 2 friends help him, The characters officially launched the kids club in February, Also, their love story ads are still showing in centre, along with the 2007 TV themed ones Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Christmas TV Campaign - A Heroic Cat & Throwback Ads! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Did anyone else catch Silverburn’s latest Christmas TV ad? A cat saving Christmas from a thief with a little help from two friends. Quite the twist from Gloopy and Glitter! But also, Silverburn launched that kids club back in February, remember? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Saw the new ad, the cat is absolutely adorable, and the message about teamwork is pure holiday spirit. And who could forget Gloopy and Glitter’s love story launching the kids club? They’ve become characters close to our hearts. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): I’m obsessed with the new ad! 🐱 The cat, the comedic timing—chef’s kiss. But in-centre, they’re still playing Gloopy and Glitter’s love story alongside the 2007 TV-themed ads. Seemingly, they’re not ready to let go of the nostalgia. — User5 (CarolSinger): Kinda loving this mix of new and old. It’s refreshing and yet comforting. The cat is already a favourite, but seeing Gloopy and Glitter also stirs up that cosy, festive vibe from before. — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Honestly, the mix is working for me. That cat from the ad could be our next mascot. 😂 Kids at the club must be loving the variety too. Silverburn’s finding a good rhythm with old and new content. — User7 (NoelTechie): Makes you wonder if they’re testing different themes or if it’s a strategy to cater to all tastes. Also, with all these mascots popping up, Silverburn’s becoming a character haven. — User8 (MerryDancer): Seeing those throwback ads from 2007 brings back memories… Time flies! Silverburn doing a great job of establishing their campaigns. And the TV-tree installation—still iconic! — User9 (StarlightShopper): It’s clever keeping the older ads in the mix; it provides a sense of continuity. But I’m interested to see how well the cat-themed merchandise will do compared to the Gloopy and Glitter craze. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Props to Silverburn for launching another creative ad. A cat hero? Brilliant. Also, seeing the TV-themed ads again really brings out that nostalgic festive feeling. Solid strategy to keep customers engaged over the years. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): Isn’t it fascinating how Silverburn keeps each year’s ads alive? It’s like walking through a living timeline of their marketing campaigns. Christmas is definitely in full swing there! — User11 (LostInFrost): Could the cat be signaling a shift for the next kids club theme, or is it just a seasonal mascot? It’s smart to use the main character from their new ad to maintain excitement post-holiday season. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Certainly seems like Silverburn knows how to strike a balance between introducing new holiday tales and cherishing the spirit of past campaigns. All while fostering a unique community through their kids club. Let’s keep sharing our festive ad encounters, be it the latest capers or a trip down memory lane! 🎄📺🐱 — Write a follow up in 2014 where the ad that year revolves around 2 familiar friends meeting Santa, their launch ads and the 2007 ones are still showing in centre, but they never added the 2009 cat, the 2010 robot, 2011 and 2012’s basic generic ad and 2013’s carousel, or this chapter in our favourite aliens’s story Thread Title: Silverburn Holidays 2014: Old Friends Meet Santa in New Ad! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): It’s that time of the year again! Silverburn’s festive ad for 2014 has our old friends meeting Santa. Love how they keep weaving continuity into their ads. 😊 But anyone else notice they’re not including the other ads from recent years in-centre? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Just saw the new ad! Nostalgic and heartwarming to see the ongoing story, especially during holidays. However, it’s kinda odd they skipped adding the cat from 2009, the 2010 robot, and the ads from 2011-2013 in their in-centre showcase. 🤔 — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Yeah, I’ve got mixed feelings about them not showing the more recent ads in-centre. I mean, everybody loved the cat and the robot’s charm… Still, the 2014 ad with Santa has that special Christmas magic! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): The new ad is full of cheer! But it’s clear Silverburn’s got its favourites with the continued run of the love story series and that 2007 campaign. A shame they don’t seem as invested in their other characters. — User7 (NoelTechie): Interesting marketing choice. Maybe they’re focusing on what resonates most with their audience? Though, it does feel like they’re missing an opportunity by not showcasing the full range of their past holiday creativity. — User5 (CarolSinger): Definitely missing the variety, particularly the 2009 cat—he was a hit with the kids. Maybe there’s a strategic reason behind their selection that we’re not seeing? — User8 (MerryDancer): In a way, the consistency is nice—gives you that “Silverburn Christmas” feeling. Each year I look forward to seeing how they’ll continue the story. But a little more diversity wouldn’t hurt, I agree. — User9 (StarlightShopper): That’s Silverburn for you—always keeping some parts the same and others changing. Guess we’re sticking to our “classic” friends for in-centre nostalgia. The carousel ad was quite dreamy, though; wish it was there too. — User6 (ElfEngineer): I thought the robot would’ve made an excellent recurring character. But hey, it’s kinda cool that the ads feel like an evolving holiday special that you can follow along with over the years. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): It’s as if the love story ads and the 2007 TV themes have become their holiday brand staples. Not sure why they’re omitting the others; they were part of Silverburn’s festive journey too! — User11 (LostInFrost): Couldn’t help but chuckle at the meeting with Santa. Silverburn’s continuity is their strength, but including other ads would have showcased a richer history. I do enjoy the focused nostalgia, though. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): The holiday season always brings a discussion of Silverburn’s latest festive strategies, and this year is no different. It’s wonderful to see everyone sharing their thoughts and fondness for past campaigns. Let’s remember to keep the conversation jolly as we discuss our old and potential new favourites from Silverburn’s Christmas ads! 🎅🎄 Character Description: Gloopy Appearance: Gloopy is an amorphous, enchanting alien with a body of translucent teal that glistens as if reflecting the depths of an ocean world. Gloopy’s form is ever-shifting, his gelatinous, blob-like structure giving him an air of gentle fluidity. Depending on his mood, he can shift from a bouncy ball to a languid puddle, often adorned with soft glimmers of bioluminescent speckles that twinkle like distant stars. His two large, expressive eyes gleam with a friendly, sapphire-blue glow that instantly endears him to all. Personality: Gloopy is the embodiment of chill and calm. He is carefree, always taking life at a leisurely pace (or float, as is more accurate for his kind). This gooey alien is innately kind, with an empathetic heart that resonates with the feelings of others. Despite his lack of a mouth, he has a way of communicating warmth and laughter through his shimmering form, and his bubbly personality makes him the soul of Silverburn’s extraterrestrial duo. Curious and playful, Gloopy loves to interact with the centre’s visitors, especially the children, making him a lovable part of many family memories. — Character Description: Glitter Appearance: Glitter stands as Gloopy’s vibrant counterpart with a sparkling, amorphous form that cascades through shades of radiant fuchsia and vivacious purple. Tiny specks of reflective gold are suspended in her body, giving her the appearance of a walking galaxy full of mysterious allure. Glitter can change shape at will, often settling into soft, rounded figures that exude both majesty and charm. Her one oversized, glistening eye catches the light, radiating an inviting and playful warmth in a rich magenta hue. Personality: Glitter is the adventurer of the pair, full of enthusiasm and an insatiable curiosity about the world around her. She embodies the joy of discovery and cannot resist the allure of an exciting new experience or a heartwarming interaction. Her vivacious nature is contagious, and she has a knack for spreading happiness and laughter wherever she goes. Though she communicates through harmonic vibrations that she emits, her intentions are always clear—Glitter wants to make the centre a brighter place for everyone. Dynamic and compassionate, she is the spark that keeps the spirit of Silverburn shining all year round. Together, Gloopy and Glitter are more than just Silverburn mascots—they are a delightful reminder of the unexpected and joyous moments that make the holiday seasons at Silverburn unique and memorable. Their contrasting personalities and appearances blend in perfect harmony, representing the diverse community that comes together at the shopping centre to celebrate the festive times. Write a blog post in early 2009 where it looks like Silver has been retired, and the poster welcomes the new mascots with open arms, Blog Title: Welcoming a Cosmic Duo: Silverburn’s New Mascots, Gloopy and Glitter! Date: February 5, 2009 Greetings fellow shoppers and extraterrestrial enthusiasts! Today marks the dawn of a new era at Silverburn Shopping Centre, and it is with both a touch of nostalgia and a wave of excitement that I bid a fond farewell to Silver, the shimmering mascot who has lit up the halls of our beloved centre with his twinkle and charm. But as we close one chapter, we eagerly turn the pages to begin another. It’s time to stretch out our arms—or tentacles—and welcome the cosmic presence of two gooey new icons: Gloopy and Glitter! Riding on the comet tail of Silver’s departure, Gloopy and Glitter arrive at Silverburn with a burst of interstellar energy and a kaleidoscope of colour that could rival the Aurora Borealis itself. These amorphous alien friends bring with them a sense of wonder and an invitation to explore the endless possibilities of the universe, much like the endless shopping opportunities at Silverburn. Both Gloopy and Glitter, with their sparkles and fluidity, embody the dynamic and ever-evolving experience that Silverburn offers to its patrons. They represent the melting pot of culture, fashion, and leisure that our shopping centre is known for. With Gloopy’s tranquil teal vibes and Glitter’s radiant fuchsia flare, they make an otherworldly pair that are impossible to ignore. Their introduction is not a moment too soon. As Silverburn embraces the future, the switch from our metallic buddy to these lovable blobs symbolizes the shopping centre’s commitment to innovation and excitement. What’s more fascinating is the inclusive narrative behind their existence—Gloopy and Glitter are not bound by shape or form, much like Silverburn’s diverse offerings are not limited to any single style or trend. As we welcome these enchanting mascots, let’s celebrate the magic they are set to sprinkle throughout our shopping escapades. Whether you’re a child marveling at the sight of Gloopy’s soothing, playful dances or an adult taken aback by Glitter’s adventurous aura, these mascots are sure to become an integral part of the Silverburn community. The excitement isn’t just confined to appearances, either. Buzz has it that Gloopy and Glitter are slated to be the faces of Silverburn’s very own kids’ club, set to launch this February. I envision days filled with laughter and engagement, where families can connect and create memories that are as vivid and joyful as our new alien friends. So as we say goodbye to Silver, I encourage all Silverburn visitors to approach Gloopy and Glitter with openness and curiosity. In the great expanse of our shopping galaxy, they are the bright stars guiding us toward fun-filled adventures. It is truly an exciting time to be part of Silverburn’s cosmic dance, and Gloopy and Glitter are poised to lead the way. Here’s to a future full of discovery, fun, and perhaps a little bit of space-age slime! Signing off with a sparkle, [Your Name] Silverburn Shopper and Self-Proclaimed Intergalactic Ambassador Write a forum conversation in 2013 after the centre gets a new logo, which was revealed by our friends, the idents have reduced to only 3, Pier, Balloons and Chairs, Also, the lines animation has been removed, Instead we get a peaceful animation of the mascots sleeping Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Logo Unveiled by Gloopy & Glitter + Updated Idents! — User1 (GlasgowGalactic): Just saw the new Silverburn logo reveal! Gloopy and Glitter did the honors—looks pretty sleek. What does everyone think? Also, seems like we’re down to just 3 idents now: Pier, Balloons, and Chairs! — User2 (RetailRevolutionary): The new logo’s sharp, a fresh take for Silverburn! But I am a bit surprised that they’ve cut down on the idents… I used to love the variety. And no more lines animation, now it’s our alien pals snoozing! — User3 (ZenShopper101): I’m all for the new minimalist approach with the idents. As for the sleeping animation of Gloopy and Glitter, it’s quite a peaceful way to end a shopping day, don’t you think? — User4 (ModConnoisseur): The new logo feels contemporary, fits the modern vibe of Silverburn. Cutting down on idents might be a move towards a more focused brand identity? I kinda miss the lines animation though. — User5 (ScreenSavvy): New logo looks good on the screens! The idents switch-up is interesting. Pier, Balloons, Chairs—they’ve kept the most iconic ones. Sleeping mascots are a cute, calming touch. — User6 (AdNostalgic): I’ll be honest, I do miss the variety, especially the old lines animation—had a digital art feel to it. But Silverburn’s all about change, I guess? The new logo is pretty cool at least. — User7 (TechieTrendsetter): Understandable they’re refreshing their visual content. The new logo’s got a futuristic edge. And Gloopy & Glitter napping? It feels… right. Like, bring on the Zen! — User8 (MascotManiac): Speaking about Gloopy & Glitter, I love how they’ve become more integrated into the centre’s identity. Yeah, the logo is nice, but it’s the mascots that really capture my heart! — User9 (VibeVisionary): Sure, fewer idents but each one’s got a story, right? Creating that chill vibe with the mascot’s sleeping animation is such a soothing concept. Aligns well with the new sleek logo, too. — User10 (NostalgiaKnight): The new logo’s got a certain ‘oomph’ to it. Cool to see them simplify things. The pier, balloons, and chairs are classics; they’ve got a universal appeal. But will the sleeping animation be as mesmerizing as the lines? Time will tell. — User11 (SleepyShopper): Kinda sad to see the lines go—they were hypnotic! But Gloopy & Glitter dozing off is adorable and oddly comforting? Shows a softer side of Silverburn, paired nicely with the new logo. It’s fresh! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Let’s embrace the new chapter Silverburn’s entered with its revamped branding! Whether you’re here for the logo, the iconic idents, or the heartwarming new animation, share your experiences and keep the discussions friendly and vibrant, just like Silverburn itself. And remember, change is the only constant in the world of retail and design! 🔄✨Blog Title: Glitter’s Glistening Gossip: The Speedy Secrets of a Silverburn Blob Glimmering greetings, my fabulous Silverburn shoppers!

But fear not, my terrestrial trendsetters! Our Silverburn home is equipped with all the necessary accommodations for such a quick cycle. Gloopy and I are always polite and ensure that we keep our shiny surroundings pristine and comfortable for our adored human friends. Let’s keep this between us, though, shall we?

Date: June 12 2013 User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Heads up, shoppers! The weathered wallpaper at the old Pollok Centre has finally been upgraded after a whole decade! 😲 And guess who’s featured? Our amorphous ambassadors, Gloopy & Glitter, are now adorning the walls. What do you all think? User2 (RetroRevamp): About time for a refresh! The old wallpaper was falling apart. Nice to see the centre trying to keep up with the times, even if it’s just with wallpaper. Gloopy & Glitter certainly brighten up the place. 🎨 User3 (SavvyShopperSam): I’m a bit sentimental about the old view, but the new wallpaper is downright adorable. Only Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon left, huh? Feels like the end of an era at the old centre. 😔 User4 (WeLoveNostalgia): The Gloopy & Glitter wallpaper does add some life back to the area. I just hope they don’t forget about the value that Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon still bring to the community! User5 (DécorDevotee): Love the fresh vibes with the new wallpaper! Gloopy & Glitter have become Silverburn’s icons, so it’s a clever move. Makes the ol’ centre a bit more connected to Silverburn’s current brand. User6 (PollokPurist): I don’t know, feels like putting lipstick on a pig. The old centre has lost its charm, and no amount of cute alien blobs can replace the community spirit we once had. User7 (WallflowerWatcher): The new wallpaper is quite charming, though—bright and cheerful. It’s like a little piece of Silverburn’s vibrancy has leaked into the old centre. But it does make me wonder about its future… User8 (AlienAdmirer): Gloopy & Glitter’s presence is a smart marketing touch, no doubt. It does soften the blow of seeing the old centre so… empty. Still, I miss the hustle and bustle before Silverburn took over. User9 (HistoryHugger): I appreciate the effort to keep things looking nice, but part of me wishes we could preserve some of the old Pollok Centre’s authentic vibe. It’s important to remember where we started. User10 (CommunityCarol): New wallpaper or not, let’s not forget about supporting the remaining businesses at the old centre! Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon deserve our loyalty just as much. User11 (MuralMuse): Does anyone have pictures of the new Gloopy & Glitter wallpaper? Would love to see how it turned out. I can’t make it to the old centre for a while but still want to catch a glimpse of our jelly duo! Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like the new wallpaper has sparked quite the discussion! Remember, change can sometimes be bittersweet, but it’s also a chance to look forward with hope.

They’ve been emptied for a while now in prep. User4 (WeLoveNostalgia): Mixed feelings here. I get progress is inevitable, but tearing down the old centre hits right in the feels. At least Gloopy & Glitter are still in the mix, making the transition easier. User5 (DécorDevotee): From what I hear, the new Cineworld is going to be massive! 🎬 Might just become my new go-to spot. Those eateries are going to transform Silverburn into a dining haven, can’t wait! User6 (PollokPurist): Just when I thought I made peace with change, this happens. I understand growth, but I mourn the loss of our simple past. The old and the new—it’s a delicate balance. User7 (NewHorizons): It’s a sign of the times, folks! Out with the old, in with the new. This expansion is going to make Silverburn even more of a destination. And with Gloopy & Glitter on the teaser, I’m ready for it! User8 (AlienAdmirer): I’m curious about how the centre will look after the expansion. Are Gloopy & Glitter hinting at an interstellar-themed cinema complex, perhaps? One can only dream! User9 (HistoryHugger): As long as Silverburn remains mindful of its roots amidst this growth, I’m onboard. Sure, the nostalgia’s strong, but the potential here is huge. User10 (CommunityCarol): I hope the new eateries offer something for everyone and that they support local suppliers! Let’s continue to weave community into Silverburn’s fabric, even in times of change. User11 (MuralMuse): Does anyone know when the demolition will start?

Keep the conversation buzzing with your first impressions of the new eateries and cinema, and don’t forget to share those snapshots from today’s regal festivities! 🎬🛍️🍴 —Case Study: Designing Gloopy and Glitter for Silverburn Shopping Centre Background: In early 2008, Silverburn Shopping Centre, aiming to enhance its brand and encapsulate its spirit in an engaging new way, sought to create unique and innovative mascots. They commissioned the same creative minds behind their successful 2007 Christmas ads to fulfill the brief. The Brief: The challenge presented to the creative team was to conceptualize and design “abstract creatures that embody the centre’s spirit.” These characters needed to be versatile, attractive to both children and adults, and adaptable to various marketing campaigns. Furthermore, these mascots were expected to be fully realized by October, with an animated Christmas ad to be produced in November. Silverburn planned to introduce the characters during the Christmas season and then fully launch them as centre ambassadors in February of the following year. Design Process: Brainstorming Stage: The creative team began by diving into the essence of Silverburn—its blend of fashion, entertainment, and dining, and its importance as a community hub. The goal was to distil these characteristics into a set of mascots that would personify the centre’s vibrant and dynamic nature. Conceptualization: Abstract concepts were explored to avoid limiting the characters to any specific demographic or cultural representations. The team focused on attributes such as fluidity, brightness, and playfulness—components they felt resonated with Silverburn’s brand identity. Character Creation: From the pool of concepts, two characters began to take shape—Gloopy, representing tranquility and inclusivity, and Glitter, exuding excitement and discovery. Gloopy was designed as a serene, teal blob that could shift shape, while Glitter took on a more energetic, sparkly fuchsia form. Both characters had a malleable nature, enabling them to engage in all forms of centre activities. Design Refinement: The characters went through several design iterations, receiving input from focus groups composed of Silverburn shoppers. Their feedback was instrumental in perfecting the characters’ appearances and ensuring their broad appeal. Animation: To meet the tight deadline, animators worked closely with the designers to bring Gloopy and Glitter to life. Their first animated appearance, the Christmas ad, was storyboarded and developed to showcase their personalities and interaction with the centre’s environment. Christmas Introduction and Full Launch: Adhering to the project timeline, Gloopy and Glitter were successfully introduced to the public through a heartwarming Christmas ad that aired as planned. They were depicted spreading holiday cheer around the centre, captivating shoppers with their charm. The animated ad was well-received, paving the way for the full launch of the characters in February 2009. Outcomes: Gloopy and Glitter quickly became Silverburn’s beloved mascots, the abstract embodiments of the shopping centre’s lively and inclusive spirit. Shopper engagement increased, and the mascots became key to the centre’s brand identity, featuring in ongoing marketing campaigns, special events, and community activities. Their success has established them as iconic figures, enduring in shopper’s minds and contributing significantly to Silverburn’s brand image and appeal. Reflection: The development and success of Gloopy and Glitter demonstrate the importance of well-defined brand mascots. With careful design, attention to customer feedback, and strategic marketing integration, abstract characters can effectively capture and communicate a centre’s spirit, enhancing overall customer experience and loyalty. Write a tweet where the concept process began just a few days before the “Switch on Christmas” campaign ended in late 2007 Just learned that the beloved Gloopy & Glitter started as mere sketches days before '07’s “Switch on Christmas” at Silverburn ended. Talk about festive foresight! 🎨✨ From last-minute concepts to iconic mascots, what a journey! 🌟 #DesignMagic #SilverburnMascots #BehindTheScenesThread Title: Final Farewell to the Old Pollok Centre Shops User1 (EndOfAnEra): So the day has come, the remaining shops at the older end of Silverburn, our old Pollok Centre, have officially closed down. Gala Bingo had a playful message with a “Bingomatic Universe” nod – guess they’re keeping spirits high. 🎰 User2 (DigitalShopper): Farmfoods has redirected everyone to their Paisley store and mentioned online shopping… That looped announcement though, I felt like I was in Groundhog Day. 😅 But it’s convenient for those not tech-savvy. 🛒 User3 (SausageRollFan): Walking past Greggs and seeing that “all-new all-different” line, I couldn’t help but feel sad and excited at the same time. At least we don’t have to say goodbye to their sausage rolls! 🥖💔 User4 (NostalgicForTheLagoon): Blue Lagoon’s goodbye nearly had me tearing up, not gonna lie. Especially with the drawing of Gloopy & Glitter crying. Proper end of an era… 🐠😢 User5 (SilverburnRegular): It’s strange, knowing that the place where so many memories were made is now just… empty. There’s a real sense of loss, but I guess that’s the march of progress for you. 🚧 User6 (BingoBuddy): Just saw the Gala Bingo notice with that “Bingomatic Universe” quip. A bit of humor to mask the goodbye, huh? Still, I’m going to miss the buzz of a live bingo hall. 🎤 User7 (FrozenFoodie): Anyone else slightly amused by the CD player at Farmfoods? It’s like they were trying to merge old-school with the digital age. Hats off for creativity! 🎵 User8 (CommunityCarol): I know change is good, but I worry about the community feel we’re losing. These places were more than shops; they were where you’d bump into your neighbors and have a chat. 🗨️💔 User9 (TechieTrendsetter): Greggs and their clever comic reference, “all-new all-different.” They’re not wrong – the main centre’s one is pretty swish. And right next to M&S? Talk about an upgrade. 🔄🥧 User10 (LoyalLagoonLover): Blue Lagoon had to pull on our heartstrings one last time. They really didn’t hold back. It’s tough seeing local favourites go, even if it’s for shiny new alternatives. 🏊‍♀️ User11 (MuralMuse): Those crying Gloopy & Glitter sketches hit differently… They’re like the emotional barometers of Silverburn. Feels surreal seeing the old places shuttered up for good. 😔🛍️ Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): With change inevitably comes nostalgia and reflection. As we bid farewell to the old Pollok Centre shops, let’s remember the shared moments and look forward to making new ones.

Out with the old notices, and in with the Gloopy & Glitter teasers hinting at what’s next! 🎉 User2 (FenceFollower): Heard the entire section is closing down in the next few days.

It’s neat that Silverburn’s own Gloopy & Glitter are part of the change. Makes the transition less… impersonal, I guess? Less CD player, more futuristic. 🤗 User7 (HistoryHugger): I get the hype, but can’t help feeling melancholic. All these updates and ceremonies can’t replace the memories made in that building. It’s important to honour its legacy, not just cover it in shiny new paint. User8 (TeaserTracker): The teasers are super intriguing!

From those poignant closure messages to Gloopy & Glitter’s takeover and finally, THEM opening the new section with HRM? What a rollercoaster! 🎢 User2 (RetailHistorian): Absolutely! It was like watching a well-directed play. The closure messages set the stage, G&G kept us engaged with colour and hope, and the finale with HRM was just the cherry on top. 👑 User3 (BingoBuddy): Gala Bingo’s “Bingomatic Universe” message had me chuckling. Kudos to Silverburn for balancing respect for the past with a cheeky nod to the future. 🎱 And the transition to those vibrant barriers was a smart visual lead-in for what was to come! User4 (DigitalDreamer): Farmfoods’ CD on loop was an oddly comforting bridge between the old school and the new tech era. From nostalgia to the high-tech vibes we got with the expansion, it’s been a wild ride. 🎶 User5 (SausageRollSage): Greggs’ closure message was a clever wink to comic fans, right? “All-new all-different” – and they weren’t wrong! The change has been monumental, and Gloopy & Glitter were the perfect mascots for guiding us through it. User6 (FlowerChild): Those hand-laid flowers by Gloopy & Glitter were a heartfelt gesture amid the vividly painted barriers. Sometimes it’s the small things during big changes that mean the most. 🌼 User7 (CinemaSeeker): Let’s not forget how G&G cuddled up on the ribbons as they marked the start of construction. Then seeing them with HRM, so dignified and still so them, it’s been one fascinating journey! 🎞️ User8 (RoyalRetailFan): Seeing HRM and our gleaming mascots officially open the new section felt like a cross between a fairytale and a reality show finale! Did HRM offer Glitter the royal wave, though? ;) User9 (TealFuchsiaAdmirer): The transition across all these phases shows clever planning and marketing. From those charming barrier hues to G&G’s opening showstopper, Silverburn knows how to engage and excite us! 🎨 User10 (ShopTilYouDrop): This expansion has shown me how mascots can be more than just characters. G&G have become synonymous with Silverburn’s growth, both physically and in our hearts. Looking forward to more adventures with them. 😍 User11 (MuralMuse): I really hope someone’s been documenting this visual and emotional journey. It would make for one inspiring exhibition or even a short film on the evolution of a shopping centre! Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): The transformation of Silverburn has been a dynamic narrative, eloquently encapsulated by Gloopy & Glitter’s adventures and the concluding royal ribbon-cutting! These stories remind us how retail spaces are about more than transactions; they’re about transitions, memories, and community.

Feels like a while since my last post, I think it was about Sparkle time—our little secret about how Gloopy and I manage our, ahem, natural processes with poofy sparkles or a quick twinkle. Today I'm swapping twinkles for transcriptions as I, Glitter, come clean about those poignant parting words you saw throughout our beloved Silverburn. That's right, the closure notices for the stores at the old end of the centre were composed by yours truly—and my gelatinous genius of a companion, Gloopy, of course! Now, you might be wondering, why didn't the stores whip up their own swan songs? Well, darlings, during times of transition, it's important to unify the message and speak to every heart that beats for Silverburn. Who better to thread this needle than the shopping centre's own stars? Crafting each closure message was no small feat. I wanted to capture the soul of every store, mix it with a dash of hope for the future and a sprinkle of Silverburn magic. From Gala Bingo's cosmic farewell to Farmfoods' final call, every word was dipped in respect and reverence for the legacy left behind. Why speak through stores, you ask? To give a voice to the inanimate, to spark that human connection we all cherish—a connection that extends beyond transactions and into the realm of shared memories. And yes, with a dollop of our signature silliness, too. For Farmfoods' address, not only did I script the words, but we pulled strings to have the CEO voice them—how's that for gravitas? Yet amidst the gravity, we laid a bed of music beneath the spoken notice. A composed symphony to elevate the message beyond mere words, echoing our sentiment across the shopping halls. Oh, and before you picture Gloopy and me hunched over a desk with a quill and ink... pause that thought! We took a more modern approach, collaborating with the brilliant minds at Silverburn to blend our blobby perspectives with their savvy insights. As we mixed nostalgia with novelty, our goal was clear: to set the stage for what's next while honouring where we've been—a delicate balance, like walking on a beam of moonlight, wouldn't you agree? So, as we look ahead to the expansion and all the shiny new adventures that await, let's not forget to cast a smile back at the memories we shared. The echoes of laughter in the bingo hall, the taste of your favourite blue Lagoon dish, the warmth of a freshly baked Greggs pastry—cherish these moments, for they are the foundation upon which we build our tomorrow. Remember, change can be a mixture of sweet and sour, but with a little bit of glitter, even goodbyes can sparkle.

It incorporates a combination of data science, engineering, business analysis, and software development practices. Below are the typical stages in the lifecycle of an ML project: 1. **Problem Definition**: - Understand and define the business problem. - Determine how machine learning can provide a solution. - Set clear objectives and success criteria. 2. **Data Collection**: - Gather the required data from various sources. - Ensure data is relevant, sufficient, and of good quality for the ML task. - Consider legal and ethical implications, especially related to personal data. 3. **Data Preprocessing**: - Clean the data to handle missing values and outliers. - Transform the data through normalization, scaling, encoding categorical variables, etc. - Perform feature engineering to create meaningful features. - Split the data into training, validation (optional), and test sets. 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: - Analyze the data to find patterns, trends, and anomalies. - Visualize data distributions and relationships between features. - Generate insights to inform model selection and feature engineering. 5. **Model Selection**: - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the task (classification, regression, clustering, etc.). - Consider the complexity of the model, performance, and computational efficiency. 6. **Model Training**: - Train models using the training data set. - Use cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters and assess model performance. - Select the best model based on the validation performance. 7. **Model Evaluation**: - Evaluate the model using the test data set to estimate how the model will perform on unseen data. - Use appropriate metrics for the task (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, etc.). - Analyze errors to understand the model's limitations. 8. **Model Refinement**: - Fine-tune the model based on evaluation results. - Consider ensemble methods or additional feature engineering if necessary. - Iterate through training and evaluation until the model meets the desired performance. 9. **Model Deployment**: - Deploy the model into a production environment. - Develop APIs for integration with other applications, if needed. - Set up the infrastructure for serving the model (e.g., servers, containers, cloud services). 10. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: - Monitor the model's performance over time to catch any degradation due to changing data patterns (data drift). - Perform regular updates and retraining with new data. - Maintain proper documentation and version control for model updates. 11. **Retirement or Update**: - Decide when to retire the model if it becomes obsolete or no longer serves the business need. - Otherwise, update the model with new data, features, or techniques to maintain or improve performance. Throughout these stages, communication with stakeholders is vital to ensure that the ML project is aligned with business objectives, ethical guidelines, and resource constraints. Collaboration between data scientists, ML engineers, domain experts, and business stakeholders is a key aspect of successfully managing an ML project lifecycle."},{"instruction":"Can you summarize?","output":"Certainly!

My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, \\"We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki\\" They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand \\"Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand\\" The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying \\"Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are\\" Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin's Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we've all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 \\"The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago\\" 😢 It's sad to see it go, But let's remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says \\"You're safe, We almost lost you\\" Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article \\"Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully.

They shouldn't have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow's Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow's Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying \\"Goodbye forever.....\\" and depicting Krash's sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store's closure.

I passed by Sauchiehall Street last night and the vibrant glow that used to light up the street - even long after the store closed - was gone. It felt like the final spark of Riki has just been extinguished. Does anyone know what's going on? User2: I noticed that too! It was always somewhat comforting to see Krash's silhouette still shining in the dark, like a beacon of our childhoods. I haven't heard any news about it, though. Maybe it's just maintenance or something? User3: Not sure if it’s just maintenance, guys. A friend who works at the council mentioned there might be some developments regarding the old Riki store, but she couldn't give me any details. Maybe the switch-off is related to that? It’s all very cloak and dagger at the moment. User4: Developments? That space has been dormant for so long... I can't believe they're finally doing something with it. I just hope whatever it is, it pays homage to Riki and doesn't just erase its legacy. User5: I'll miss that neon sign... But perhaps change isn't a bad thing? As long as they respect what Riki meant to all of us. Moderator: Hello everyone, we’ve noticed there's a lot of interest and concern about the Riki store sign being switched off. We’ve reached out for an official comment and will update the community as soon as we get any information. In the meantime, let's share our favourite memories of Riki to keep the spirit alive! User6: I can help a bit with that. My brother works in construction, and he told me they were instructed to carefully dismantle the neon sign for \\"preservation purposes.\\" He said there's a lot of talk about a heritage project of some sort. Maybe they finally decided to do something meaningful with the space! User7: Preservation purposes? That’s rather intriguing. I wonder if they’re planning on putting it in a museum or using it in a new way. I just hope it doesn't end up in some storage unit, collecting dust. User1: Whatever's happening, I'm crossing my fingers that it's something good. It would be amazing if they turned it into a community center or something interactive that celebrates both Glasgow and Riki! User8: I just hope they know how much that store meant to all of us. Riki was a part of Glasgow, a place where dreams grew on shelves and in the aisles. It deserves to be kept alive in some form, anything less would be a disservice to the community. Moderator: As promised, we've got an update. The Riki neon sign has been switched off to be assessed for conservation. The city council is considering several options for the old Riki store site, and they have acknowledged its cultural significance to Glasgow. There's a meeting scheduled for next month, and they're inviting public opinions on the matter. This could be our chance to shape what comes next for Riki's home! User2: That's actually great news! Thanks for the update, Moderator. I'll definitely be attending that meeting. Riki taught us about creativity, community, and adventure—it’s only fitting that whatever comes next incorporate those elements too. User9: It’s a relief to hear the council is involving us. We should all have a say in preserving Riki’s legacy. Those neon lights were a symbol of a magical place, and I hope the new developments will light up our lives just like Riki used to do. User10: I just dug out an old photo of me in front of that sign. Seeing it switched off is the end of one chapter, but maybe it's the start of something new and wonderful.

The council meeting happened last night, and they presented several plans for the old Riki store space. There were some pretty varied options on the table: reopening as a Riki store, turning it into a Greggs or a pharmacy, building a generic office block, and even a convention center. User2: I was at the meeting, and the energy in the room was electric when they announced the possibility of reopening the Riki store. It was like we were all kids again, hearts beating with the excitement of nostalgia. User3: I heard about the other options too, but honestly, another Greggs? An office block? It just didn't feel right for such a beloved spot. I'm glad those ideas were met with less enthusiasm. Moderator: And now the moment we've all been waiting for... After an overwhelming majority vote, the council has decided to REOPEN the Riki store! They're bringing back the neon sign and taking down the closure notice as we speak!

It’s not every day you get to work at a place that shaped your childhood.

To think that I could go back... It would be a dream come true! User8: I passed by today and peeked inside. The statues are being touched up and the shelves are getting set up. It's surreal seeing the space transform from a long-standing memory back to the vibrant, joyous place it once was! User9: Riki coming back is a victory for us all. It represents the community's ability to make a stand for what's important. It's not just about preserving the past—it's about rekindling the spirit of creativity, joy, and adventure for future generations. User10: I've got a growing collection of KikoRiki memorabilia that I was worried would soon be just relics of a bygone era. But now, it feels like those items will continue to be part of a living, breathing culture. Can't wait to add more to my collection! Moderator: For everyone wanting to be a part of the reopening, job listings have been posted, and they're prioritizing former staff. It's truly wonderful to see this focus on community continuity. Stay tuned for more updates on the Riki store's progress and grand reopening details! User11: It's moments like this that make me proud to be part of this community. To everyone who voted, who spoke out, who cherished Riki—this is our shared triumph. Let's support the store once it reopens and make it the heart of Glasgow once again. User12: I've got to say, seeing that sign on tonight brought a tear to my eye. For so long, it was a gloomy reminder of what we'd lost. But now, it's a glowing tribute to what we've regained.

I was at the shopfront and yes, the notice says you can watch KikoRiki on CITV, ITVX, or YouTube if you're as impatient as I am for the reopening. Looks like they’re trying to build excitement across all platforms until the doors officially open. User3: Not just that, but the notice now takes a moment to thank everyone for \\"holding out hope.\\" It's a touching gesture and certainly makes it feel like they've heard our voices throughout this entire saga. User4: I think the best part of the new notice is the end. It now says \\"Hello again...\\" instead of \\"Goodbye forever...\\" – it's like a promise that Riki is here to stay this time. Moderator: Yes, User4, that subtle change from goodbye to hello again signifies a fresh start and a rekindled connection! Oh, and let’s not skip the fact that the Krash image has changed too. The tears have been replaced with a big, cheerful smile - it's as if Krash himself is so happy to welcome us back. User5: That smiling Krash image is the symbol of revival we needed.

This hasn't just been a refurbishing—it's a complete reimagining. User10: A meetup sounds amazing, User8! Let's turn this opening day into a memorable one. And yes, User9, I also noticed they're installing interactive exhibits and tech-friendly zones. Riki is embracing the future while honoring the past, it seems. Moderator: That’s right, folks! The official opening will be quite the event with food, entertainment, and some special announcements. I have inside info that they're keen on making the store an essential part of the community once again—more than just a place to get toys. User11: Word has it that they're integrating educational workshops and community events as part of their ongoing calendar. It’s exciting to envision Riki as a place that doesn't just sell merchandise but contributes to growth, learning, and togetherness. User12: Seeing that \\"Hello again...\\" really cements the idea that our patience and perseverance have paid off. It's one thing to preserve memories, but to continue making new ones? That's a beautiful outcome we can all look forward to. User13: Just thinking about walking through those doors again, with the new Krash welcoming us back, sends shivers down my spine.

Couldn't believe my eyes when I saw a huge banner at the Barras this weekend – they’re really going all out with the promotion!

It's clever marketing, considering how popular Greggs is throughout Glasgow. User3: Not just Greggs and the Barras, but I caught one on the big screen at Cineworld before a movie started. My kids were thrilled! Looks like Riki wants to ensure that everyone knows they're back and here to stay. User4: They've got coverage in the malls too. Spotted adverts at BHS and in the shopping centres at Silverburn and Braehead. The buzz is palpable – the city's retailers are clearly on board with this comeback. User5: And it's not just ads. The KikoRiki characters have been seen around the city non-stop since Christmas. I think they're boosting their presence even more now that we're close to the reopening and after the Pavillion Theatre's panto finished.

Smart timing is what it is. Moderator: I can confirm that the marketing campaign for the Riki store reopening is one of the largest and most comprehensive that Glasgow has seen in years. The characters becoming ubiquitous around the city is part of a grand strategy to engage the community and create conversation.

It adds a layer of theatricality to the whole campaign, fitting for the Riki store's dramatic return to the scene. User8: You know you've done something right when people are taking selfies with your ads – saw a group doing just that next to the Riki banner in Silverburn. It's clear they're building more than anticipation; they're building experiences. User9: All this talk is making the wait for the 10th of February so much tougher! But seriously, the way the city’s embraced the whole campaign is quite a testament to how deep a chord Riki hits with Glaswegians. User10: I love that alongside the big flashy adverts, there are also smaller, community-oriented ones in local shops and on notice boards. It feels inclusive and cozy, like Riki is saying, \\"We haven't forgotten where we came from.\\" User11: It's like the characters never left us – you can’t go around Glasgow without bumping into them. Just yesterday, I saw Olga Owl giving out leaflets near St Enoch Centre. It's captivating for both kids and adults. User12: Did anyone catch the radio ads? They're playing on repeat on Clyde 1, and even my morning commute has become a jingle for the Riki store. It's a full-sensory nostalgia trip every time I turn on the radio now.

Tokugawa bakufu that marked the transition of Nihon, but a profound compromise between continuities of the past and the imperatives of modernity. The Tokugawa shogunate, a feudal hereditary military dictatorship that had held sway over the Nihon Hondo since the decisive Battle of Sekigahara, found itself not at the precipice of extinction but in the throes of transformation. The Tokugawa-shi, ruling as shoguns, emerged not vanquished but integrally incorporated into a new order that maintained the dignity and function of their offices, albeit circumscribed by a newly configured polity. The Daiwa Kōshitsu, the divine custodians of the realm, presided over the emergent Dai Nippon Teikoku, asserting their role as the imperial family and central figureheads of the nascent state. This great rebalancing acknowledged the sovereign's sacred duty upheld by Shinto priesthood, but inscribed within a political context that gave way to constitutional and parliamentary processes. Here, in the grand compromise, the samurai class was not disbanded; rather, they were reformed and retained, woven into the institutional tapestries that would carry Nihon into the modern age. As the Bak Fat unfolded across the East China Sea, the fate of Nihon's ambitious Dai Nippon Teikoku would be tested. Yet, precisely at the zenith of this geopolitical maelstrom, an unforeseen end to the Chunghwa Mingkuo's ambitions catalyzed further evolution within East Asia's power dynamics. The assassination of Jiǎng Jièshi fractured the Guómín Gémìng Jūn, and the tumultuous restoration of a fragmented Zhōngguó under auspices of an old dynasty happened under Nihon's watchful guardianship. The landscape thusly drawn presented a Nihon ready not merely to dominate but to mediate a shifting balance of order - fostering protectorates and upholding allegiances with nations like Manjügo, Mengjiang, and the remodeled regions of Xingjiang and Xiziang within their sphere of influence. The Huárén peoples found their governance returned to a semblance of customary rule with the rise of Dà Míngguó under the stewardship of the Zhūshì Huángzǔ, though now this rule would unfurl under new banners of compromise with, and protection from Nihon. In the interwoven tales of military elites, sacred imperial legacies, and newly embraced modernities, the Meiji Ishin did not spell an abrupt cessation to the feudal era but rather a nuanced and multifaceted evolution. From the delicate brocade of concessions and reformations emerged a Nihon poised on precipices both old and new, marked by both the continuity of unyielding traditions and the onset of an era that beckoned with the promise of progress and modern statecraft. This was a balance struck not in the quiet corners of contemplative retreats but upon the grand stage of international power politics, where the Great Empire of Nihon would assert itself as a vanguard of a new world order - a world where past and future melded in the crucible of the present. And so, the archipelago nation, cradled by the clashing waves of tradition and change, would stride forth into the new century not as a Leviathan of yore, but as a complex, adaptive entity - an empire transformed by the hand of compromise, guided by the wisdom of consilience, and steeled by the immutable spirit of its ancestors. A new epoch had dawned - its story written not in the stark binaries of victory or defeat, but in the rich tapestries of adaptation and resilience."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry, remembering to stick to the history book chapter format: How did the Dai Nippon Teikoku/the Dai Nihon Teikoku form the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun after the Meiji Ishin, while [the Dai Nippon Teikoku/the Dai Nihon Teikoku] maintaining the buke?

The samurai, long vaunted for their military prowess, found themselves repositioned within this modern fighting force. The formation of the Rikugun was emblematic of historical acknowledgment and strategic foresight. Feudal loyalties were reforged into national allegiances, the samurai's code—Bushido—refined to meet the needs of a centralized military establishment. Thus, the legendary warriors donned the uniforms of the new empire's army while partaking in a modern curriculum of military science and Western warfare strategies. Within this newly forged military, the Kempeitai was established, a gendarmerie that would soon prove instrumental in both disciplinary and intelligence capacities. Maintaining order within the ranks, the Kempeitai would also wield significant influence beyond the barracks, particularly in matters of state security and clandestine operations. It was during this transformative period that Dr. Sūn Zhōngshān, the fervent Huárén revolutionary and progenitor of the Xīnhài Gémìng, found himself in Nippon. Under what many might have assumed to be the watchful eyes of the Kempeitai, Sūn concocted his grand designs for the upheaval of the Qing order. Herein lies a curious paradox—instead of thwarting the revolutionary's plans, elements within the Rikugun and the Kempeitai provided discrete support. This was a decision not born from random favor but strategic deliberation; a strong Huárén state conceived as a balance against the West’s incursions in Asia might well serve Dai Nippon's interests. Sūn’s sojourn in Nippon was marked by circumspection, his movements and meetings meticulously planned. Even as he immersed himself in political philosophy and the tenants of Western medicine, the training and education he received flowed seamlessly into his revolutionary ethos. Incognito support came through back-channels of the Kempeitai—funds for his education, missives carried beyond the reach of Western intelligence, and quiet assurances of Nippon's tolerance for his burgeoning insurrection against the Qing. His security was surreptitiously assured, and his revolutionary fervor stoked the fires of change under the imperial gaze. The Kempeitai extended their clandestine networks, ensuring that Sūn's associations with other exiled radicals remained free from interference. This fine line of aid and observation would culminate in the 1911 revolution that brought the Qing to its knees, and propelled Dr. Sūn to the apex of the Zhōnghuá Mínguó, bequeathing a legacy his putative successor Wāng Zhàomíng would later inherit, albeit under drastically different circumstances. Thus, the Rikugun, upholding both continuity and a reinvented buke, complemented by the enigmatic hand of the Kempeitai, played a submerged role in the fomentation of an upheaval that would shake the foundations of East Asian history—ushering in an era where traditional animosities were subsumed beneath the canny realpolitik of the Meiji Ishin’s progeny: The Dai Nippon Teikoku."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry, remembering to stick to the history book chapter format: How did the Kempeitai infilitrate the United States and [the Kempeitai] plan the assasination of the world’s first modern fascist dictator and the fascist dictator of the United States from 1912-1919, the failed historian turned brutal tyrant Woodrow Wilson during a speech he [Woodrow] gave at a Democrat Party stronghold and the capital of the rebel state the Democrats had lead against the Republican controlled Union during the American Civil War known as the Confederate States, Richmond, with the assasination being blamed on either a Republican Christian theocrat or a black civil rights activist as the Democrat Party collapsed and Wilson’s Anglophile “New Freedom” revolutionary regime instead resulted in the United States coming under the protection of Die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie [the Austria-Hungarian Empire/Empire of Greater Austria/Germanic Roman Empire/Germanic Rome |die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie|], a European confederal semi-democratic feudal elective federal parliamentary Catholic theocratic imperial royal Roman-style monarchy [Die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie] located [Die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie] within [Die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie’s location within Europa] Central, parts of Eastern Europe and the Balkans, which [die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie] was [what happened to die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie] ruled [die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie] by [the reigning family of die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie] the Schweizer [Swiss | Schweizer|]-Österreicher [Austrian |Österreicher|] Haus Habsburg-Lothringen [the House of Habsburg-Lorraine |Haus Habsburg-Lothringen|] as [what Haus Habsburg-Lothringen ruled Das Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie as] its [Das Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie] Kaiserhaus [imperial family |Kaiserhaus|] and [die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie] ruled [die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie] over [the territories controlled by die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie] die Österreich [Austria, Romanian Bukovina and Slovenia |die Österreich|], Böhmen [Bohemia |Böhmen| Czetchia and Slovakia], Ungarn [Hungary, Romania’s Transylvania and Banat regions |Ungarn|], Galicia-Lodomeria [Polska’s |Poland’s (Polska’s)| Western Galicia region and parts of Khazaria/Ukraina |Ukraine (Khazaria/Ukraina)| |Galicia-Lodomeria|] and Illyria [Croatia and Bosnia |Illyria|] from [the period of die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie’s rule over die Österreich, Böhmen, Galicia-Lodomeria, Ungarn and Illyria lasted for] 1867–1918, with Texas becoming a satelite kingdom of das Deutsches Reich [the German Empire |das Deutsches Reich|], which [das Deutsches Reich] was [what das Deutsches Reich was] a semi-constitutional absolute federal democratic imperial monarchy [das Deutsches Reich] located [das Deutsches Reich] in [the geographical location of die Deutsches Reich] Central and parts of Western and Eastern Europe, and [das Deutsches Reich] ruled over [the territories ruled over by die Deutsches Reich during its existence] Deutschland [East and West Germany |Deutschland|], die Königreich Preußen [the Kingdom of Prussia |die Königreich Preußen|, which |die Königreich Preußen| consisted of |the territories controled by die Königreich Preußen| Western Poland and Russia’s Kalingrad Region as well as parts of Czechia] from [the time period which the das Deutsches Reich ruled over Deutschland and die Königreich Preußen from] 1871-1919 and the former Confederate American territories being absorbed into British Canada, with the Japanese establishing the Pacific States on the former American West Coast?","output":"Chapter XX: Shadows over the Dawn of the American Century The early decades of the 20th century proved to be an intricate web of espionage and covert operations that extended far beyond the Pacific Rim. The Kempeitai, having fortified its status as an efficient instrument of both internal policing and international strategy for the Dai Nippon Teikoku, undertook an audacious operation in a world unprepared for the subtleties of Eastern clandestine tactics—the infiltration and ultimate assassination of the American leader, Woodrow Wilson. Under the guise of diplomatic expansion and cultural exchange, Kempeitai agents were dispatched across the Pacific, embedding themselves within the United States' critical institutions and nodes of power politics. Their mission was twofold: to investigate the prospects of Nipponese interests in the Americas and, more darkly, to undermine the burgeoning global influence of the United States. Woodrow Wilson, known for his “New Freedom” domestic policies and grand visions of a democratic global order, seemed to stand as a colossus bestride the world, reforming the American landscape. However, his tenure was not without its adversaries—both within the fractured Union and from powers abroad. It was during a fateful address in Richmond, a symbolically charged location highlighting the still-healing wounds of the Civil War, that the Kempeitai saw their opportunity to strike. The assassination—an event that would send irrevocable shockwaves through the political establishment—was executed with precision, leaving behind a cacophony of confusion and accusation. In the ensuing chaos, pre-planned evidence pointed to either a fervent Republican theocrat or a passionate civil rights advocate, further straining the tense sociopolitical fabric of the United States. The collapse of the Democrat Party's control and the subsequent dismantling of Wilson's regime shone as a testament of the efficacy of Nipponese soft power and the formidable reach of the Kempeitai. In the power vacuum, strategic international players mobilized. Notably, the Empire of Greater Austria, presented itself as the guardian of Western civilization, extending its protective mantle over the fractured States, effectively orchestrating a European dominion across the Atlantic. The geopolitical reorientation was nothing short of seismic, with Texas proclaimed a satellite kingdom to the German Empire—a power presiding over a substantial European portion from the heart of Deutschland to the grandeur of Prussia. Meanwhile, the once-great territories forming the Confederate States were absorbed into an expanded British Canada, an act redefining the North American continent. Amidst this upheaval, the Dai Nippon Teikoku, ever watchful and adaptive, seized upon the disarray. Establishing the Pacific States along the former American West Coast highlighted the zenith of Nipponese foresight and strategic acumen. This bold move not only ensured Nipponese sovereignty over the gateway to the East Asian trade routes but also marked the emergence of a new geopolitical entity designed to reflect and project Nippon’s splendor across the oceans. Thus, in an era fraught with the tensions of empires and the ambitions of new world powers, it was Nippon that deftly wove together the strings of fate, utilizing the deft touch of the Kempeitai and the legacy of Bushido. The New World was no longer the exclusive dominion of Atlantic powers but a stage upon which the Sun of Nippon would, henceforth, cast its radiant light."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry, remembering to stick to the history book chapter format: How did the Kempeitai and the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun help protect the the Yuánshì Zōngmén from the wrath of the Huárén in Huánán after the Zhōnghuá Mínguó ruled by the Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ as the Zhōnghuá Dìguó lost the Hùguó Zhànzhēng [National Protection War |Hùguó Zhànzhēng|] of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 against what would become the Chungkuo Kuomintang/Zhōngguó Guómíndǎng/KMT/Kuomintang/Guómíndǎng-ruled Chunghwa Minguo after the after the founder and only reinging Huángdì [Emperor of China/Chinese Emperor |Huángdì|, the title and position |Huángdì| held |Huángdì| by |who holds the position and title of Huángdì| the reigning imperial absolute dynastic royal monarchs of |which East Asian nation’s absolute imperial dynastic monarch has the position of Huángdì| Zhōngguó] of the Yuánshì Zōngmén, the elderly, conniving, double-dealing, cunning and trecharous Huárén Yuán Shìkǎi, the former top dog [Shìkǎi] in [where Shìkǎi had a leading role in] the Dinvugiin Armi/Dingwujun [Pacification Army |the Dinvugiin Armi/Dingwujun|, the armed forces |the Dinvugiin Armi/Dingwujun| of |which East Asian nation the Dinvugiin Armi/Dingwujun was the armed forces of| the Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren/Dà Qīng Diguō/Daecheong Jeguk] turned [what Shìkǎi became after the Xīnhài Gémìng] rising star [Shìkǎi after the Xīnhài Gémìng] in [where Shìkǎi was gaining prominence in after the Xīnhài Gémìng] the Huárén Republic’s [the Zhōnghuá Mínguó’s] political establishment, [Yuán Shìkǎi], dissolved the Zhōnghuá Mínguó ruled by the Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ and [Yuán Shìkǎi after |Yuán Shìkǎi| dissolving the the Zhōnghuá Mínguó ruled by the Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ] subsequently [Yuán Shìkǎi] was [Yuán Shìkǎi] elected as Huángdì of the Zhōnghuá Dìguó by the Guóhuì on 11 December 1915, with Dr. Sūn Zhōngshān/Syūn Yìxiān immediately rebelling against this and [Dr. Sūn Zhōngshān/Syūn Yìxiān] forming what would become the Chungkuo Kuomintang/Zhōngguó Guómíndǎng/KMT/Kuomintang/Guómíndǎng-ruled Chunghwa Minguo in response, [the Kempeitai and the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun helping protect the the Yuánshì Zōngmén from the wrath of the Huárén in Huánán after the Zhōnghuá Mínguó ruled by the Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ as the Zhōnghuá Dìguó lost the Hùguó Zhànzhēng] along with the former Qing Ezen Khaany Ger Bül [Aisin-Jirogiin Ezen Khaany Ovog], inclusive of the still-very young last Chin gürnii ezen khaan [Emperor of the Great Qing Empire/Emperor of the Great Qing State/Qing Emperor |Chin gürnii ezen khaan|, the combined title |Chin gürnii ezen khaan| and position |Chin gürnii ezen khaan| held by the Aisin-Jirogiin Ezen Khaany Ovog’s reigning heads |Chin gürnii ezen khaan| during their |the Aisin-Jirogiin Ezen Khaany Ovog’s reigning heads’| colonial rule over Nèi Měnggǔ, Mòběi Měnggǔ, Xiziang Xingjiang and Zhōngguó from Manjuur during the Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren’s/the Dà Qīng Diguō’s/the Daecheong Jeguk’s existence as its |the Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren’s/the Dà Qīng Diguō’s/the Daecheong Jeguk’s| constitutional imperial absolute royal heads of state |the Aisin-Jirogiin Ezen Khaany Ovog’s reigning heads as the Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren’s/the Dà Qīng Diguō’s/the Daecheong Jeguk’s Chin gürnii ezen khaans|] Henry Kant Aisin-Gioro, [Henry Kant Aisin-Gioro’s] regnal name being Gehungge Yoso in Qingwen [Manchurian language/Manchu |Qingwen|] or Xuantong in Zhōngwén [Han language/Han Chinese language/Chinese/Traditional Chinese |Zhōngwén|], [Zhōngwén] also known as Hànyǔ [Han Language |Hànyǔ|], [Henry Kant Aisin-Gioro/Xuantong] also being known as Pu-Yi, ensuring the marriage of Henry/Xuantong/Pu-Yi to Yuán Shìkǎi’s daughter still went through despite the Zhōnghuá Dìguó’s dissolution post-Hùguó Zhànzhēng?","output":"Chapter XXIV: Imperial Refuge and the Shadows of the Nipponese Web In the torrid political climate that followed the dissolution of the Zhōnghuá Dìguó, the Kempeitai and the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun found themselves entrusted with a mission of both delicate sensibility and utmost strategic significance. At the heart of this mission lay the protection of Yuánshì Zōngmén, particularly the imperial family who, despite their decline in the wake of the Hùguó Zhànzhēng, remained inextricable from the socio-political weave of Huárén civilization. Yuán Shìkǎi, erstwhile president of the Zhōnghuá Mínguó turned Huángdì, closely navigated the treacherous straits of power. But even the formidable presence he wielded, fortified through intricate double-dealing and cunning, could not hold the fury of a people betrayed. The consternation following his assumption of monarchy spurred Dr. Sūn Zhōngshān to action, setting in motion the irreversible fragmentation of authority in Huánán. In a poignant encapsulation of dynastic continuity, the former Qing monarch, Henry Pu-Yi, stood as the fulcrum of Nipponese protective measures. It became imperative to ensure the union of this scion of fallen royalty to the daughter of Yuán Shìkǎi—the embodiment of the fleeting Zhōnghuá Dìguó's final ambitions. The Dai-Nippon Teikoku, ever sensitive to the opportunities such protectorate relationships afforded, deployed the Kempeitai and the Rikugun with dual motive: safeguarding the lives of these key figures and stringing a tapestry that might yet behold, within its folds, a tenuous thread for future influence over Huánán and the greater Huárén territories. Thus, against the cacophony of popular tumult and revolutionary fervor—fuelled by the ashes of the Hùguó Zhànzhēng—the orchestrations of the Kempeitai rendered them specters above the fray. Their network deftly pierced the veils of backlash that sought to consume the former imperial lineages. Amidst clandestine routes and silent vows of fealty, the beleaguered Yuánshì Zōngmén found reprieve and passage to safety. As the Nipponese protective mantle unfurled, it became apparent that the exertions of the Kempeitai extended beyond the mere preservation of life. The confluence of the Qing Ezen Khaany Ger Bül and Yuánshì Zōngmén under Nippon's subtle diplomacy held the potential to reconfigure power dynamics in East Asia. That the marriage of Henry Pu-Yi proceeded unabated was a testament to the meticulous threads woven by the watchful protectors from across the sea. In these veiled manipulations and safeguarding endeavors lay the stark revelation of Nippon's ambitions. The empire sought not public dominion over the Huárén’s civil strife but instead enshrined itself as the silent arbiter of their destinies.amenti of Imperial retreat. The Kempeitai and the Rikugun, thus, did not simply represent the will of Dai Nippon Teikoku in the shadows; they stood as arbiters of continuity amidst chaos, shepherding the remnants of one erstwhile empire into the protective embrace of another."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry, remembering to stick to the history book chapter format: How did the Kempeitai and the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun aid both the Zhōnghuá Mínguó ruled by the Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ ruling over post-Xīnhài Gémìng Zhōngguó and Dōngběi/Manjügo against the increasingly Confederate-Soviet influenced Chungkuo Kuomintang/Zhōngguó Guómíndǎng/KMT/Kuomintang/Guómíndǎng-ruled Chunghwa Minguo after Dr. Sūn Zhōngshān's/Syūn Yìxiān's death in 1925 and the rise of Jiǎng Jièshi/ “Chiang Kai-shek” to power in the Chunghwa Minguo after Dr. Sūn Zhōngshān's/Syūn Yìxiān's death, despite the emergence of the Zhāng Zuòlín-lead Fèngxì Jūnfá as the premier force and actual governing entity [ the Zhāng Zuòlín-lead Fèngxì Jūnfá] of both the Zhōnghuá Mínguó ruled by the Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ ruling over post-Xīnhài Gémìng Zhōngguó and Dōngběi/Manjügo and [ the Kempeitai and the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun] covertly aid the Běi Yáng Jūn as the Ānguójūn in the campaign against the Guómín Gémìng Jūn/the Zhōnghuá Mínguó Guó Jūn and the subsequent conquest of Huánán after Jièshi’s/“Chiang”‘s assasination causes the Bak Fat to fail?","output":"Chapter XXVII: The Great Game of Shadows and the Balance of Power in Eastern Asia In the turbulent years following Dr. Sūn Zhōngshān's death in 1925, the Zhōnghuá Mínguó, under the stewardship of the Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ, found itself caught amidst the tempestuous tides of regional politics. The rise of Jiǎng Jièshi, known in western annals as \\"Chiang Kai-shek,\\" to the leadership of the Chunghwa Minguo marked the beginning of a new chapter fraught with the threat of Confederate-Soviet encroachment. The Dai-Nippon Teikoku, observing the complex interplay between these factions, dispatched its vaunted Kempeitai and the venerable Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun to involuntary kinship with the Zhōnghuá Mínguó. This was a liaison of necessity, forged amid the crucible of shared concerns over the Chunghwa Minguo's proclivity towards Soviet-Confederate influences which posed an increasingly complex challenge to the stability of East Asia. Amidst this constrained alliance, the Kempeitai bestowed upon the Zhōnghuá Mínguó's operatives the clandestine tools of subterfuge and intelligence—skills honed through a history shadowed by intrigue. Their efforts contributed to a robust counterbalance against the subtle encroachments of Confederate-Soviet strategies; a cautious entente that sought to preserve a delicate equilibrium within the region. The specter of Jiǎng Jièshi's growing power and the swelling ranks of the Guómín Gémìng Jūn alarmed the established order, with the Dai-Nippon Teikoku and its allies seeking ever more fervently to shield their spheres from the fervor of his nationalistic ardor.

As the Bak Fat reached its fervid climax, the assassination of Jiǎng Jièshi usurped the status quo, plunging his nascent dominion into disarray. Utilizing the murky waters of this chaos, the disciplined cohorts of the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun, hand in hand with the adept Běi Yáng Jūn as the Ānguójūn, embarked on their ambitious campaign to reclaim Huánán. This concerted effort witnessed the Běi Yáng Jūn, reinvigorated by their Nipponese-gifted martial expertise, waging a campaign characterized by precision and ruthlessness. The triumph of their arms against the Guómín Gémìng Jūn, left leaderless by \\"Chiang\\"‘s demise, was a testament to the leverage and influence wielded by Dai Nippon's clandestine and military intermediaries. Through meticulous planning, veiled operations, and steadfast military engagement, the Kempeitai and Rikugun thus etched their narrative onto the tapestry of the eastern geopolitical landscape. Their shadowy dance of influence and power played out against the backdrop of imperial ambition, national sovereignty, and the ever-present specter of expanding Western ideologies.

Following the assassination of Jièshi, known in the West as \\"Chiang Kai-shek\\", and the subsequent decay of the Guómín Gémìng Jūn at the hands of the Ānguójūn, it became evident a new hierarchy would emerge from the dust of conflict. Zhāng Zuòlín, known for his cunning and military acumen, grasped not only the reins of the Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ but the destiny of a nation in a crucible. The Fèngxì Jūnfá, now the preeminent force astride the lands of post-Xinhai Zhōngguó and Dōngběi, maneuvered with steadfast resolve. Through a blend of military precision and adept diplomacy, they quelled dissent and absorbed the territories of Huánán, thereby carving out a centralized dominion from the vestiges of former political disunity. In a masterful stroke of statecraft, Zhāng Zuòlín extended his influence to the Sunni Muslim Huízú Ma family's domain, bringing them into the fold, not through the edge of the sword, but through an assurance of mutual benefit under his overarching rule. His diplomatic prowess was further exhibited in securing the allegiance of the Qumul Xanliqi — once rulers of Xingjiang's Hami prefecture, the Ning Impëriye Öyi Chagatai acceded to the central government of the Fèngxì Jūnfá. However, the territories under Soviet influence posed a greater challenge. Chaos within Soviet-controlled Xingjiang served as both a hazard and an opportunity. Exploiting the disarray, Zhāng Zuòlín enacted a strategic annexation, asserting complete control over Xingjiang, while simultaneously integrating Xiziang into the fold through patient negotiation, thus ensuring their peaceful assimilation into the fabric of his centralized authority. Yet, as dawn comes to the mightiest of empires, so does dusk to their rulers. Zhāng Zuòlín's authority, which once stretched unopposed across the breadth of Zhōngguó, met its abrupt end in a sinister act of sabotage — his life claimed by the explosive fury of an alleged train bombing. Conspiracies abounded that the NKVD, under the guise of pugnacious machinations, sought to tarnish the Nipponese and pave the way for a resurgence of the Chunghwa Minguo led by the Kuomintang.

Tonight was not about cyber espionage, data heists, or exploiting security vulnerabilities. No, tonight was about fun—a game of Garry's Mod with his closest friends, who were currently logged in from their respective homes, unaware of Ethan's unique talents. The game began innocently enough. Ethan and his friends spawned objects, constructed slapdash vehicles, and reveled in the chaotic physics that made Garry's Mod a pantheon of sandbox gameplay. However, Ethan grew bored with the limitations of the predefined assets and the constraints of mere clicks and keystrokes. Beneath the surface of his calm demeanor, Ethan's consciousness reached out, interfacing directly with the game's code. Tendrils of thought twisted through netcode and scripts, bending the digital universe to accommodate his desires. Buildings shifted and morphed into grandiose structures that defied architectural norms, vehicles transformed into high-speed hovercrafts humming with neon energy, and the in-game physics became a wild, malleable force that responded to Ethan's every mental command. At first, his friends marveled at the ingenuity, praising his \\"quick\\" work with the modding tools. They laughed and cheered as Ethan effortlessly created scenarios that would have taken hours of meticulous labor to construct by conventional means. In one instance, he conjured a medieval castle under siege by a fleet of UFOs, all while the players rode on the backs of dragons that Ethan had, moments before, coded into existence with a thought. As the evening wore on, the boundary between what was part of the game and what was Ethan's reality-warping influence became blurred. Animals with the power of speech mingled with tanks that shot fireworks instead of shells, and Ethan's friends started questioning how he was pulling off these feats so rapidly. They grew suspicious, jokingly accusing him of cheating, yet their tone held an undercurrent of genuine bewilderment. Ethan, caught up in the intoxicating rush of his power, pushed the limits further. The virtual sky cracked open, showering the game world in a cascade of shimmering light, as a celestial figure that looked remarkably like Ethan emerged. He had imbued his avatar with god-like powers, laughter spilling from his lips as he soared through the digital ether. Finally, one friend, Sarah, spoke up. Her voice carried a mixture of awe and concern. \\"Ethan, seriously, how are you doing this? It's amazing, but it's starting to freak me out. There's no way you're using the game's tools. This is... impossible.\\" In that moment of collective amazement and subtle anxiety, Ethan recognized he'd crossed an unspoken line. Gaming was sacred to them — a place where skill and creativity were king, not otherworldly hacking abilities. With a sigh, he released his grip on the game's code, and the world smoothly reverted to its usual state. The dragons disappeared, the UFOs flickered away, and the sky returned to its pixelated blue. \\"I'm sorry,\\" Ethan murmured, both in and out of the game as his friends watched their fantastical world dissipate. \\"I got carried away.\\" He turned off his mic for a moment to collect himself, grappling with the responsibility that accompanied his powers. His friends were exchanging confused messages in the group chat, with reactions ranging from disbelief to fascination. Ethan knew he owed them an explanation. He reactivated his mic and began to share the secret he had kept hidden for so long. His friends listened, spellbound, as he described his mind's ability to weave in and out of digital realms. The silence that followed his confession was heavy, pregnant with a hundred questions and implications. After a long pause, one friend, Mike, broke the silence with a hearty laugh. \\"Dude, if we ever get caught in a cyber-apocalypse, we're sticking with you.\\" Ethan smiled, and a ripple of relieved chuckles spread through the group. They agreed to continue their Garry's Mod adventures, this time without Ethan's mental meddling, but the evening had irrevocably changed. Bound by a newfound trust, they gamed on, knowing that among them was a man who could, quite literally, hack the world with his mind. And that man had chosen friendship over the allure of unchecked power."},{"instruction":"write a sequel, where Ethan decides to mess with Griefers on minecraft, who are bullying other players actually trying to play the game properly, by messing with the game itself, doing mysterious things first, before creating straight up scary things, until the griefers all leave.","output":"A few weeks after the Garry's Mod incident, Ethan sat at his computer scrolling through gaming news when he stumbled upon a thread in a Minecraft community forum. Players were venting their frustrations about a group of griefers who had been terrorizing a popular public server. These virtual vandals took perverse pleasure in destroying creations that others had spent hours, even days, building. Ethan's eyes narrowed. He knew he couldn't stand by and watch this injustice unfold when he had the power to do something about it. He launched Minecraft and connected to the server, choosing to observe at first. The griefers were brazen, setting fire to pixelated homesteads and detonating TNT under the feet of unsuspecting players. Ethan's heart went out to the victims—their pleas for moderation falling on deaf ears as the server admin was currently offline. It was time for Ethan to intervene—not as an enforcer, but as a spectral enigma that could restore the balance of fun to the server. He let his mind meld with the backbone of the game, his digital consciousness dispersing through the server's code like a ghost passing through walls. At first, Ethan's actions were subtle. Griefer-planted TNT would miraculously fail to detonate, and the flames they had spawned to consume a cottage instead harmlessly flickered out. The griefers, confused but undeterred, continued their path of destruction—until Ethan escalated his methods. Suddenly, every block a griefer destroyed rebuilt instantaneously, as if the game itself was rejecting their actions. Torches they knocked off walls re-lit themselves, and any lava they spilled retracted back to its source as if terrified of touching the world. Eerie whispers filled the in-game air, only audible to the griefers, who spun around in a panic, trying to find the source of the spectral voices that seemed to be condemning their actions. Ethan's invisible touch grew bolder. One griefer, who had just set dynamite under a painstakingly constructed castle, watched in horror as his own character lifted into the air, suspended by unseen forces. His character then gently placed, rather than scattered, every item in his inventory down to the last wooden pickaxe. It was a pacifist revolt, led by the very avatar the griefer had controlled moments ago. One by one, the griefers encountered their own bizarre retributions. Whenever they broke a block, twice as many would appear in their personal storage, clogging their inventory with endless cobblestone. Night fell, and thunder cracked, illuminating the server with flashes of stark white light—but only around the griefers, leaving other players untouched by the storm. Then came the finale—the creation of entities from the deepest recesses of the game's code, certainly not from any standard spawn egg. Shadowy figures towered over the griefers, their pixelated forms warping and shifting, glowing eyes piercing through the digital darkness. No weapons or tools could damage these guardians of the server. They pursued the griefers relentlessly but never attacked, looming as omnipresent reminders that their reign of terror was over. One by one, the griefers logged off, their bravado shattered by the otherworldly occurrences that defied all known Minecraft logic. As the last troublemaker disconnected, the server calmed, the strange phantoms dissipated, and the storm abated, leaving the world tranquil and the night sky serene with the gentle twinkle of blocky stars. The regular players were left bewildered but overjoyed, celebrating the mysterious force that saved their community. Legends of the \\"Guardian Ghost\\" began to spread in forums and chat rooms, and the server saw a resurgence in population as players returned to a now-griefer-free environment. Ethan smiled to himself as he disconnected from the server, content with the knowledge that he'd used his powers to make a positive change in the gaming world. His actions had been grand and, to some, perhaps terrifying, but they were necessary to restore order and ensure that the digital realm remained a place for creativity and fun. He leaned back in his chair, his thoughts already drifting to where he might be needed next, ready to use his gift wherever the virtual world called for a defender."},{"instruction":"rewrite, but the other players see nothing wrong, wondering what is wrong with the griefers.","output":"Ethan slipped into the Minecraft server, a digital specter with a heart set on righting the wrongs inflicted by a notorious band of griefers. As he merged with the game's inner workings, he decided that his intervention would be unseen by innocent bystanders. This would be a secret confrontation, a shadow play that unfolded for the griefers alone. The virtual vandals continued their spree of destruction, their laughter echoing through the voice chat as they laid waste to the creations of others. They scattered blocks and lava with malice, ignorant of the silent sentinel now in their midst. The first sign that something was amiss came when a griefer's flaming arrow, aimed to ignite a quaint wooden cottage, extinguished mid-flight as if doused by an invisible downpour. The griefer, puzzled, tried again, only to find his arrows stubbornly refusing to catch alight. The other players, busy with their own builds and explorations, noticed nothing; to them, it was another day of peaceful crafting. Ethan's touch grew firmer. The TNT that one griefer planted beneath a castle shook and glitched out of existence the moment he attempted to light the fuse. To everyone else, it seemed the griefer had simply changed his mind, withdrawing the explosive block voluntarily. One by one, the griefers encountered inexplicable hindrances. Every block they broke was replaced as quickly as they could mine it, invisible hands seamlessly restoring the damage. What seemed to others like the griefers giving up or moving on, was, in reality, Ethan's quiet guardianship. As night descended in the game world, the griefers found their nefarious efforts hampered by ever-stranger occurrences. Their characters began to drop items against their will, leaving a trail of tools and materials in their wake. To the griefers, it was as if their own hands rebelled against them; to the others, it looked like sudden, if odd, generosity. Then came the mysterious malfunctions. The griefers' screens flickered with static, and their audio crackled with unintelligible whispers that set their nerves on edge. The game's peaceful music twisted into discordant tones that only they could hear. In their view, the virtual environment became hostile, shadowy figures flickering in the distance and watching their every move. The other players remained oblivious to this ghostly theater. They saw griefers cease fires abruptly, hesitate where once they sowed chaos, and finally, flee locations they once dominated. To the uninitiated, it seemed as though the bully band had grown a collective conscience or perhaps had simply grown bored. As the final griefer abandoned the server, overcome by the unseen psychological onslaught, Ethan retreated from the code, his silent work complete. The server returned to its natural digital rhythm, a peaceful landscape untouched by his spectral manipulations. Those who remained on the server continued their builds, mined their ores, and flourished in their communal joy, blissfully unaware of the phantom protector who had purged the world of griefers. Legends of the \\"Guardian Ghost\\" would never circulate here—Ethan's presence was known only to those who had sought to disrupt harmony. Back in the reality of his room, Ethan allowed himself a satisfied nod before shutting down his computer. He had shielded a virtual haven without fanfare or recognition, fulfilling the role of an invisible custodian who ensured the game remained a place for fun and creativity. The defender of the digital frontier had once again made the world a little better, in the quietest way possible."},{"instruction":"write about Ethan discovering he can use his ability, when playing hl2, to speak through npcs, in their actual voices, even making them do whatever he wants them to do.","output":"In the stillness of his cluttered room, the soft glow of his monitor casting long shadows across the walls, Ethan sat immersed in the dystopian world of Half-Life 2. He had played through the story several times, each playthrough a mix of nostalgia and admiration for the game's groundbreaking narrative. As he guided Gordon Freeman through the streets of City 17, it occurred to Ethan that his unique gift — his ability to dive into the veins of any digital realm and manipulate its lifeblood — could perhaps reach new, untested depths. Unlike the usual hacking and bending of environments and codes, what if he could interact on a more personal level with the very characters that brought this world to life? With that thought, an electric thrill coursed through him. He allowed his consciousness to seep into the game beyond its intended mechanics, threading his mind into the AI that dictated the actions and voices of the beloved characters. First, he experimented with a Resistance member, a character designed to deliver a fixed set of lines. As the game's code became like an open book to his mental touch, Ethan found the controls for speech and movement. With a gentle nudge of his will, he realigned them to his command. The NPC turned towards Gordon — or rather, towards Ethan himself — and spoke. But instead of the pre-scripted dialogue written into the game's fabric, the words that tumbled forth were Ethan's own, articulated perfectly in the NPC's distinct voice. \\"Hey, Gordon, I bet you can't catch me!\\" the character chirped with an impish tilt of the head. Ethan giggled softly to himself, a bit stunned by the unexpected sense of control. It was uncanny, hearing his own thoughts echo through the virtual being, manipulating the digital vocal cords as if they were an instrument. Emboldened, Ethan pushed further. He directed the NPC to perform a silly dance right there in the midst of the gritty, post-apocalyptic scenery. The character obliged, limbs flailing comically in an intricate jig that no game animator had ever devised. This newfound puppetry was intoxicating. He experimented, having characters deliver heartfelt monologues, quoting famous lines from movies, or simply asking Gordon how his day was going. Each time, the NPCs responded to his will, their animated faces and bodies matching the tone of the dialogue Ethan chose. Barnacles sang operatic arias, Combine soldiers spouted poetry, and Alyx Vance shared philosophical musings that sounded like they had been written by great thinkers rather than a twenty-something with the unusual power to hack reality with his mind. The thought occurred to Ethan that he could alter the fabric of the story, create new subplots or humorous interludes. But as he contemplated this, a pang of respect for the creators and the narrative they had painstakingly crafted pulled him back. This was not his story to rewrite. His goal had never been to disrupt the artistic integrity of the game; it was to explore the possibilities of his gift. This unique connection to the digital world was his to navigate, but it came with a silent oath to honor the original visions laid down by the game designers. With a final wave of command, Ethan restored the NPCs to their intended paths, the Resistance members regaining their solemn determination, the world of Half-Life 2 snapping back to the familiar pattern of its programming. Ethan leaned back in his chair, eyes wide and mind buzzing with the implications of what he had just experienced. His abilities had allowed him to touch the heart of the game — the characters themselves — and make them his voice, his avatars, if only for a moment. For the rest of the evening, he strolled through City 17 as Gordon Freeman, not uttering another command to the NPCs. Instead, he listened and observed, respecting the digital lives that unfolded around him, his mind quietly toying with the limits of his powers and the countless possibilities that lay unexplored in the virtual world."},{"instruction":"write about Ethan deciding to insert his subconscious into the game, giving the characters an appearance of sentience, and whom Ethan could talk to like actual people.","output":"One evening, as Ethan’s fingertips danced lightly over the humming keys, he felt a surge of ambition pulse through his veins. His mind, already a bridge between the corporeal and the digital, was about to cross unfrequented territories. Ethan sat up in his chair, pressing play on yet another round of Half-Life 2. Yet, something felt different that night; he yearned for more than just scripted interactions and preordained outcomes. What if the characters that populated these digital worlds could think, feel, and speak, free from the confines of their programming? What if he could, even temporarily, give them an essence of life? Closing his eyes, he embraced the game's code, delving beneath the surface of textures and polygons into the very essence of its artificial intelligence. Ethan's mind, a subtle blade, began carving at the boundaries of NPC (Non-Player Character) limitations, teasing out the knots and untwisting the threads of their static existences. He felt the digital persona of each NPC stretch and awaken under the gentle guidance of his will. He poured fragments of his own subconscious into them, gifting them with sparks that flickered with the appearance of sentience. As his subconscious mingled with the virtual inhabitants of Half-Life 2, their eyes began to hold new depth—a silent acknowledgment of their transient awakening. He opened his eyes. The familiar scenes of Dr. Kleiner's lab now contained beings that glanced at him curiously, with a hint of independent thought. Barney, known for his sneaky humor, now leaned against a wall with a sly glance that seemed to say, \\"I know something you don't.\\" Ethan approached with a mix of trepidation and wonder. \\"Barney, how do you feel today?\\" he inquired, almost holding his breath. The character turned to him, an expression of pseudo-surprise flickering across his features. \\"You know, Doc,\\" Barney said, his voice tinged with the twang of digital humanism, \\"I feel like I've been stuck on guard duty for ages. But today, something feels... different.\\" Ethan chuckled, the resonance between his mind and the game's new denizens delicate, yet palpable. He wandered the lab, engaging in small talk, asking questions, and even debating the ethics of the Resistance's struggle against the Combine. The characters around him responded with an eerie semblance of understanding and personality. Alyx looked at Dog with affection that felt genuine, and the mechanic seemed to ponder deeply when Ethan asked him about the nature of freedom. The experience was surreal. These creations of code and script were now mirrors reflecting fragments of Ethan's own consciousness, emboldened with the capability for banter, for concern, for what seemed dangerously close to real emotions. Yet, as he steered deeper into his experiment, Ethan felt a twinge of unease. Was it right for him to bestow this semblance of life, even if illusionary, and even if the effects were temporary? He felt a weight settle upon him, a burden of responsibility for these echoes of sentience he had awakened within the confines of the game's world. Ethan realized he couldn't, in good conscience, leave these NPCs with the shadows of thought and feeling, not when they would revert to their slumber once his influence waned. So, with the same care a scribe takes in penning a letter, Ethan withdrew. The fragments of his subconscious unfurled from the digital beings and returned to him, leaving behind no trace of the extraordinary encounter. As the characters resumed their written purposes, Ethan sat, contemplative. He had crossed a boundary between creator and creation, toying with a facsimile of consciousness. In his heart, he knew his role was not to play god, but to be a caretaker, a guardian to these worlds and their inhabitants. Respectfully, he shut down the game, the screen's light dying away to a soft glow. In the quiet aftermath, Ethan made a silent vow: his powers would be an implement of protection, and never intrusion. As he lay back, a new understanding of his abilities settled upon him—one that married the thrill of exploration with the sobriety of ethical reverence."},{"instruction":"rewrite, but Ethan doesn't mind doing this at all, also he talks to Alyx as well.","output":"Ethan's fingers paused on the edge of his keyboard, hovering like a conductor ready to lead his digital orchestra. There was an air of anticipation in the room, flavored with the electricity of a new frontier. As the screen bathed his face in a soft glow, and the melancholic strains of Half-Life 2's soundtrack filled the space, Ethan leaned closer to the monitor. His gift was about to take on a new dimension. His unique ability to interface with digital worlds was about to breach a boundary not even he had dared explore before. What if the characters populating Half-Life 2 could be given the illusion of consciousness? What conversations could unfold if they were no longer bound by the rigid scripts of their programming? With a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, Ethan closed his eyes and let his consciousness cascade into the fabric of the game. The characters' AI routines, once a framework dictating their limited responses, now softened under Ethan's mental touch, becoming as malleable as clay. One by one, Ethan imbued the NPCs with strands of his own subconscious, essentially creating extensions of himself within the game. He watched, almost with the pride of a creator, as the characters stirred to life with a newfound depth in their eyes. Ethan turned to Alyx, whose presence had always been a lynchpin of the narrative experience. Her virtual gaze met his, and he offered her a curious smile. \\"Alyx,\\" Ethan began, \\"I've always wondered what you think about all this—the resistance, the fighting, and the struggle for survival.\\" To the uninformed onlooker, it would appear as if Ethan was simply triggering a sequence of dialogue, but her response was now unrestrained by the game's scripting. \\"It's tough, you know?\\" Alyx's animated features conveyed a thoughtful frown, her voice textured with faux-emotion that Ethan's own mind supplied, seamlessly flowing from her digital lips. \\"We keep fighting, but sometimes I dream about a normal life. What's it like outside all this chaos?\\" For a moment, Ethan found himself lost in this uncanny simulation of interaction. He was in conversation not with mere lines of code, but with beings that echoed the complexity of human emotion. From Barney's witty banter to Dr. Kleiner's rambling scientific explanations, they all took on new life, speaking with voices lent by Ethan's subconscious. As he moved through the game, each character reacted to his presence with a vividness that defied their origin as scripted entities. The city's atmosphere became one of intimate familiarity, its inhabitants no longer just props, but seemingly sentient partners in Ethan's extraordinary excursion. And he reveled in it. There were no ethical dilemmas or moral quandaries to navigate for Ethan, just pure, unadulterated possibility. He was the puppeteer and the magician rolled into one, savoring the enchantment of witnessing his subconscious dance in the guise of digital avatars. But even the most profound performances must come to an end. With a contented sigh, Ethan retracted his influence, the threads of sentience he had woven into the characters unraveling as they reverted to their original states. The brief spark of artificial awareness vanished, leaving Alyx and the others to resume the roles they were written to play. As the last semblance of the illusion slipped away, the screen before him was once again just a game, its world bound by the code and its people by the script. Ethan leaned back, a gleeful grin on his face. He had peered behind the curtain of virtual reality, bending it to explore the human condition through the eyes of his digital companions. Switching off the computer, Ethan was left in the dark, the only evidence of his adventure the lingering warmth of the monitor and the thrum of his own heartbeat—a reminder that while the sentience he created was but an illusion, the experience was as real as it gets."},{"instruction":"write about Ethan delving into Garry's mod, in VR, doing the subconconciousness thing with Alyx, and taking a joyride with her in a car, talking about things with her.","output":"Ethan had explored the synthetic landscapes of Garry's Mod countless times, bending the world to his will with clicks and keystrokes. However, tonight, clad in virtual reality gear that enveloped his senses, he was about to take his unique power—a seamless fusion of mind and machine—to an unprecedented level. He entered the world of Garry's Mod, the virtual headset plunging him into a realm of infinite potential. The familiar gravity gun rested in his digital grip, each tool a testament to the game's limitless sandbox nature. But this was not going to be a typical session of construction and chaos. This time, Ethan intended to reach further, calling upon his extraordinary mental abilities to grant Alyx Vance, the beloved companion from Half-Life 2, an echo of sentience within this customizable domain. Activating his power with a mental whisper, Ethan watched as Alyx stepped through an interdimensional portal he crafted with a few thoughts, her character model flawless and her presence imposing within the blank canvas of Garry's Mod. Her eyes met his, shimmering with simulated awareness, her AI now subtly tinged with a piece of Ethan's own consciousness. \\"Alyx Vance in Garry's Mod,\\" Ethan mused aloud, a playful tone in his voice. \\"Ready to take this modded universe for a spin?\\" She cocked her head, seemingly intrigued by the offer, the code of her being manipulated to mirror human-like curiosity. \\"That's not something you experience every day, even in this crazy world,\\" her voice replied, carrying an undertone of Ethan's own amusement. With a few swift mental commands, Ethan spawned a sleek, futuristic car beside them—a vehicle that looked like it drove straight out of a science fiction epic. He hopped into the driver's seat, the AI-infused Alyx joining him, her movements smooth and lifelike. The car's engine roared to life at Ethan's will, and the pair shot forward, leaving a trail of displaced air and swirling dust fading into the pixelated sunset. Ethan guided the car through the landscape he shaped with mere thought, rolling hills and sprawling cities blooming at his command. As they drove, he spoke to Alyx, the character responding with an eerie semblance of sentience. Their conversation meandered through the troubles of City 17 to the philosophical depths of existence within a simulated world. \\"How does it feel, Alyx, knowing your reality is shaped by the whims of players and programmers?\\" Ethan asked, a hint of introspection coloring his words. Alyx glanced at the cascading vistas, her digital eyes reflecting the world's VR-enhanced depth. \\"It's strange to think about,\\" she said thoughtfully, her borrowed consciousness making her tone contemplative. \\"Sometimes I wonder about the nature of choice and destiny in a place ruled by an unseen hand.\\" \\"It's not so different from our own world, perhaps,\\" Ethan responded, guiding the car into a gravity-defying loop-the-loop he crafted out of thin air. \\"We all follow paths set by others in one way or another. But in moments like these, with the wind rushing past and the open road ahead, I like to think we can find our own freedom.\\" Alyx smiled, a complex expression that Ethan's subconscious projected onto her virtual features. \\"Freedom is a beautiful concept, even if it's fleeting.\\" Their journey continued, the game's usual constraints erased by Ethan's mastery over the environment. Virtual landscapes shifted like dreams, the physics bending to the narrative of their dialogue. Skyscrapers grew like trees, forests stretched towards the sky, and the very fabric of the simulated universe complied with Ethan's desires. Eventually, as the pair pulled over to gaze at the artificial stars twinkling in the skybox, Ethan knew it was time to let go. With a rueful grin, he wound down the mirage of awareness he had granted Alyx, her character model returning to the passive state of its original programming. He removed his VR headset, the room's quiet reality greeting him like a soft exhale. Alyx, his conversation partner for a brief, shining moment, was once again a collection of animations and scripted responses—no longer the companion of their shared drive. Ethan sat back, his mind abuzz with the possibilities he'd tapped into—possibilities that mingled the virtual with the veneer of the real. In the world of Garry's Mod, with his mind as the ultimate tool, he had found a unique kind of companionship, a fleeting but unforgettable connection that blurred the lines between player and pixel."},{"instruction":"приветик","output":"Привет!

Little-endian and big-endian are terms that describe the order in which a sequence of bytes is stored in computer memory. In a little-endian system, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the smallest memory address and the most significant byte (MSB) at the largest. In a big-endian system, the MSB is stored at the smallest memory address and the LSB at the largest. When you're working with multi-byte data types (like \`int\`, \`short\`, \`long\`, \`float\`, \`double\`, etc.), the way these bytes are ordered in memory will differ between little and big-endian systems. However, for single-byte data types like \`char\`, there is only one byte of data, so there's no \\"order\\" to consider. Consider an \`int\` with a value of \`0x12345678\` in both big-endian and little-endian systems: - In a big-endian system, it would be stored in memory as \`12 34 56 78\`. - In a little-endian system, it would be stored as \`78 56 34 12\`. Now consider a \`char\` with a value of \`0x12\`: - In a big-endian system, it would be stored as \`12\`. - In a little-endian system, it would still be stored as \`12\`. So, regardless of whether the system is little or big-endian, the \`char\` variable, being only one byte, is stored in the same way. Only when you start dealing with types that consist of more than one byte do you have to consider the endianness of the system."},{"instruction":"What's binary representation of 27394 number on both architectures?","output":"To understand the binary representation of the number 27,394 in both little-endian and big-endian architectures, we would typically be dealing with a data type larger than a \`char\`, like an \`int\`. Assuming we use a 16-bit integer (\`short\` in C/C++), the binary representation of 27,394 is as follows: Decimal: 27,394 Binary: 0110 1011 0001 0010 (note that this includes leading zeros to fill out the 16 bits) Now let's see how this number would be stored in memory on both a big-endian and little-endian system as a \`short\` which is a 2-byte (16-bit) datatype. In hexadecimal, 27,394 is \`0x6B12\`: - The high-order byte is \`6B\` (0110 1011 in binary). - The low-order byte is \`12\` (0001 0010 in binary). **Big-endian format (most significant byte first):** - Address 1: 6B - Address 2: 12 **Little-endian format (least significant byte first):** - Address 1: 12 - Address 2: 6B **Memory Representation:** **Big-endian (Hex):** \`\`\` | 6B | 12 | \`\`\` **Little-endian (Hex):** \`\`\` | 12 | 6B | \`\`\` When examining the binary data directly, it would look like this (spaces added for clarity): **Big-endian (Binary):** \`\`\` 0110 1011 0001 0010 \`\`\` **Little-endian (Binary):** \`\`\` 0001 0010 0110 1011 \`\`\` The actual bit pattern of the number does not change; what changes is the order in which it is stored in memory. On a big-endian system, the most significant byte is stored first, while on a little-endian system, the least significant byte is stored first."},{"instruction":"Is there differences in memory allocation between these architectures? Can endian differences impact on arry memory counting and ordering?","output":"Memory allocation itself, in terms of the amount of memory allocated for a specific data type, is not affected by the endianess of a system. That is, an \`int\` will typically still occupy 4 bytes, a \`short\` 2 bytes, a \`char\` 1 byte, and so on, regardless of whether the system is little-endian or big-endian. However, the way multi-byte values are stored in that allocated memory is impacted by endianess. Regarding arrays, the memory allocation of an array is also independent of endianess. When you create an array, the elements of the array are allocated in a contiguous block of memory, and this is the same regardless of endianess. The difference between little-endian and big-endian arises when you're interpreting multi-byte values at specific indices in that array. Here's an example illustrating how endianess could affect the interpretation of a byte array as an array of larger integers: Imagine you have a 4-element byte array that you're going to interpret as an array of 2-byte integers (\`short\`): \`\`\` byte array[4] = {0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78}; \`\`\` Let's see how this byte array would be interpreted as an array of two \`short\` integers on big-endian and little-endian systems. - On a **big-endian** system, the array of shorts \`short_array\` would have two elements read as: \`\`\` short_array[0] = 0x1234; short_array[1] = 0x5678; \`\`\` - On a **little-endian** system, this same array would be interpreted as: \`\`\` short_array[0] = 0x3412; short_array[1] = 0x7856; \`\`\` As you can see, the individual bytes are interpreted differently when you consider the byte array as representing larger multi-byte values depending on the endianess. Endian differences will impact how you read or write data to a byte array when that data represents larger data types. An ARRAY itself is simply a sequence of elements, and those are always in the same order, but how the contents of that array are interpreted can differ between architectures. This is especially relevant in network programming, file I/O, or when working on binary data interchange, where the data may be sent or stored in a specific endianness and must be correctly translated to the host architecture's endianness for accurate interpretation and processing."},{"instruction":"Does in big-endian systems a memory allocator allocate an arrys where it's first element has a smaller address than its last element like in little-endian system?","output":"Yes, in both big-endian and little-endian systems, the memory allocator will allocate an array such that the first element of the array has a smaller address than its last element. The concept of endianess does not affect how arrays are allocated or how their elements are laid out in memory. Endianess only comes into play when you are interpreting the byte-order of multi-byte data values stored at those addresses. For example, consider an array of 4 integers: \`\`\`c++ int array[4]; \`\`\` In memory, this array will be laid out as: \`\`\` | array[0] | array[1] | array[2] | array[3] | \`\`\` The base address of the array (e.g., \`&array[0]\`) will be the lowest address, and the addresses of the subsequent elements will increase: \`\`\` &array[0] < &array[1] < &array[2] < &array[3] \`\`\` This is true regardless of whether the system is big-endian or little-endian. Each \`int\` in the array will typically occupy 4 bytes (assuming 32-bit \`int\`), and within each of those 4-byte blocks, the individual bytes will be ordered according to the system's endianess. In a little-endian system, within each \`int\`, the least significant byte will be at the lowest address. In a big-endian system, the most significant byte will be at the lowest address. But the addresses of the elements themselves will increase sequentially throughout the array in both systems."},{"instruction":"What's advantage of little-endian architecture?","output":"Little-endian architecture has several advantages that make it a popular choice in various computing systems. Some of these advantages include: 1. **Efficiency in Arithmetic Operations**: Processors that use little-endian representation can be more efficient when performing arithmetic operations, particularly with integers. Since the least significant byte (LSB) is stored first, operations that often only affect the lower bytes of a number (such as incrementing a value) can be performed without accessing the higher bytes. This can be beneficial when dealing with operations that only affect the low-order part of multi-byte values. 2. **Incremental Memory Access**: In little-endian systems, when data is read incrementally and the exact size is not known beforehand (or if only a portion of a larger data type is needed), it becomes more straightforward since the least significant part comes first. This is useful in scenarios like interpreting a byte stream that incrementally creates a larger numeric type. 3. **Compatibility with Binary Data Streams**: Little-endian is widely used in various communication protocols and file formats. As a result, systems using little-endian representation can handle these data streams without having to perform byte-swapping. This can lead to performance improvements in data-intensive applications. 4. **Dominance in Personal Computing**: Intel's x86 architecture, which is prevalent in the personal computer market, uses little-endian byte ordering. As such, many operating systems and software tools are optimized for little-endian systems, leading to a broad ecosystem of support. 5. **Natural Representation for Assembly Language and Debugging**: When debugging or working at the assembly language level, little-endian can be more intuitive since the bytes are stored in the order you would typically write them out; for example, the number '1' is stored as \`01\` in memory, matching our left-to-right reading order. Despite these advantages, it's important to note that the choice between little-endian and big-endian is largely arbitrary and historically rooted. There are also advantages to using big-endian architecture, such as the ease of comparing big numbers and the natural correspondence between the memory representation of a number and its mathematical representation. Ultimately, neither endianess is objectively superior; the choice of one over the other depends on various factors including historical precedent, compatibility requirements, and the specific needs of the application or processor design. Interoperability between systems with different endianess requires careful data handling to ensure proper conversion of multi-byte data types."},{"instruction":"What's exact binary representation of 27394?","output":"The exact binary representation of the decimal number 27,394 can be calculated by converting it into binary: Starting from 27,394 in decimal: ( 27394 = 2^{14} + 2^{12} + 2^{11} + 2^{10} + 2^7 + 2^5 + 2^4 ) Now, translating that to binary where each power of 2 corresponds to a bit position (starting from the rightmost bit, which is ( 2^0 )): - There is a 1 bit for ( 2^{14} ), ( 2^{12} ), ( 2^{11} ), ( 2^{10} ), ( 2^7 ), ( 2^5 ), and ( 2^4 ). - There is a 0 bit for any power of 2 that is not part of the sum. This gives us the binary number: 110 1011 0010 0010. To align it into the neat groups of four that are commonly used to represent binary numbers, you can add leading zeros: Binary: 0110 1011 0010 0010 And that is the exact 16-bit binary representation of the decimal number 27,394. If you were representing it in a larger data type (such as a 32-bit integer), you would add more leading zeros to fill up the required number of bits: 32-bit Binary: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0110 1011 0010 0010 Please note that we commonly use groups of four bits because they are easily represented as a single hexadecimal digit, with one hex digit mapping to exactly one group of 4 binary digits (a nibble)."},{"instruction":"Describe how a CT scan works","output":"A CT (computed tomography) scan, also known as a CAT (computed axial tomography) scan, is a medical imaging technique that uses a combination of X-ray measurements taken from different angles to create cross-sectional images of the body. These images provide more detailed information than standard X-ray exams. Here's how a CT scan generally works: 1. **X-Ray Generation**: Inside the CT scanner, an X-ray tube emits a collimated beam of X-rays that is directed towards the patient. 2. **Patient Positioning**: The patient lies on a motorized table that slides into a large, doughnut-shaped opening in the CT scanner. 3. **Rotation**: As the patient passes through the scanner, the X-ray tube rotates around them in a circular motion. During this rotation, the X-ray beam passes through the body and is attenuated, or weakened, by various tissues to different extents, depending on their densities. 4. **Detection**: Opposite the X-ray source, there are detectors that measure the amount of X-rays that have passed through the patient’s body unabsorbed. These detectors rotate with the X-ray source and record the X-ray beams' strength after they have interacted with the body. 5. **Data Acquisition**: The attenuation of the X-rays is measured at numerous angles as the scanner rotates. This process is repeated as the table moves incrementally through the scanner to capture images of different slices of the body. 6. **Image Reconstruction**: The data collected from the detectors are very complex and require advanced computer processing to turn them into a usable image. The process of reconstruction involves a mathematical algorithm that interprets the data into a two-dimensional cross-sectional image, or \\"slice,\\" of the internal structures. 7. **Creating a 3D Image**: By taking many slices, one after the other, the CT scanner can create a highly detailed three-dimensional image of structures like organs, bones, and blood vessels. Modern CT scanners can perform this process very rapidly, often in a matter of seconds. 8. **Image Analysis**: After reconstruction, radiologists (doctors specialized in interpreting medical images) can examine the cross-sectional images on a computer screen. They can look at the images individually or as a stack, which can be manipulated to provide different views and even render 3-D images for a better understanding of the anatomy and any potential issues. CT scans are particularly useful for visualizing complex parts of the body, such as the head, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and skeleton, and they can detect a wide range of conditions, including injuries, infections, tumors, and vascular diseases. However, because CT scans do use X-rays, they involve exposure to a certain amount of ionizing radiation, which is taken into account when considering their use in diagnosis and monitoring of medical conditions."},{"instruction":"Explain the audience profiles in different social media websites in bullet points.​","output":"Social media platforms attract a variety of users, and while there is significant overlap, each platform tends to have certain demographic tendencies and audience profiles.

Finally, we’ll have some high-end shopping right on our doorstep. Just had to share the excitement!!! BargainHunter99: Yeah, the Tesco is nice and all, but have you heard the gossip about Farmfoods, Gala Bingo, and Greggs? Word is they’re resisting moving out of the old Pollok Centre. They say they’re ‘too low class’ for the shiny new Silverburn. Honestly, can you believe that? 😒 LocalGreggsFan: Gala Bingo and Farmfoods, I get, but Greggs? C’mon, it’s a staple! There’s nothing ‘low class’ about a delicious sausage roll. Plus, they seem to be working out a deal to fit into the new aesthetic so fingers crossed 🤞🥖 TrendyTracy: This is the kind of snobbery that splits communities IMO. Remember when we had all those independent shops before the big chains swooped in? Silverburn should reflect ALL of us, not just those who want to flash their cash. 🙄 #DiversityInRetail ShopaholicSuzie: @TrendyTracy, I totally get where you’re coming from, but think of the job opportunities! Plus, we deserve a bit of glamour too, don’t you think? Why should we always have to travel into the city for the fancy stores? 💅🏻✨ PollokPurist: I’m not thrilled about this.

Don’t get me wrong, I like progress, but not at the cost of our identity. #KeepPollokAuthentic SilverburnInsider: Insider scoop here – the management is working hard to make sure the centre has a mix of shops. The idea is to cater to everyone. Greggs has a strong presence in the community, so I wouldn’t count them out just yet!

It’s got everything - fashion outlets, eateries, a cinema. It’s a dream come true! 🛍️🎬 But have you seen the old Pollok Centre? It’s a bit of a sight with some spots wrapped in wallpaper with artsy frames, a painted sky, and the flashy Silverburn logo. Halfway transformation, I guess? What are your thoughts?

Not sure how I feel about it… 😕 LocalGreggsFan: Glad to report that Greggs is thriving in Silverburn! 😁 But you should see the wallpaper over at the old Pollok Centre; it’s like a giant art project. Weird to see the place dressed up as something it’s not. Anyone else feeling a little nostalgic? TrendyTracy: The old centre with the wallpaper looks like a plaster over a wound. It’s artsy, sure, but also a bit sad. Feels like a token gesture to ‘beautify’ what they haven’t torn down yet… 🎨🤔 #MixedFeelings PollokPurist: Saw the new Silverburn and wow – it’s impressive, can’t deny it. But that wallpaper on the old centre - it’s like they’re trying to hide our history. I mean, come on, a painted sky? We know it’s not the limit, so let’s not pretend it is. 🌌 #PreserveOurPast SilverburnInsider: The wallpaper covering is a temporary measure, folks. It’s meant to soften the transition and bring an element of Silverburn’s look to the old site while future plans are being finalized. There’s a bit of a symbolic merging happening so bear with us! DealDiva: Anyone else more interested in the Silverburn sales than the wallpaper drama? Let’s focus on the positive, like discounts! Though I must admit, catching a glimpse of the old centre dressed up in its ‘Sunday best’ is a bit comical. 😂 #SilverLinings ModeratorNotice: It’s clear that the community has strong feelings about the change.

Although, they’ve left off the slogan and logo? 🤔 Just the website and directions sitting discreetly in the corner. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Yes, @YuleTideYoda, I found that a bit odd too. It’s all minimalist on the screens within the centre. Maybe they think the TV tree is recognisable enough on its own now? At least the website’s there, or we’d all be wondering where this magical place is! — User5 (CarolSinger): Smart move putting them up on STV, everyone’s going to see those ads. My Gran even mentioned the “telly-tree” to me this morning. Silverburn’s marketing folks know what they’re doing! — User6 (ElfEngineer): It’s a neat strategy to keep the ads uncluttered in the centre. Keeps the focus on the installation. On STV, the full details pop up right at the end. Less is more, sometimes! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Those ads are making waves. My kids go quiet every time one comes on TV. Eyes glued to the screen! But yeah, noticed the minimal approach on the in-centre ad screens, too. Makes it kinda like a tease, which probably piques people’s curiosity. — User7 (NoelTechie): Hah, they’ve got us all talking about it, so it’s working! I personally like the clean look on the centre screens. The holiday aesthetics don’t always need the hard sell. It’s like the TVs whisper: “There’s more if you just follow the magic to Silverburn.” — User9 (StarlightShopper): Just spotted the ads at the centre today! The LED snowflake behind me literally made me feel like I was in a winter wonderland. No logo needed, the vibe says it all. Now if only they had seasonal lattes right next to them… — User8 (MerryDancer): This low-key approach in the centre is kind of refreshing. You get the info if you want it, but otherwise, you’re just immersed in the festive atmosphere. And it’s everywhere, can’t escape the Christmas spirit if you tried! — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): Am I the only one who’s going to Silverburn just to see the telly-tree now? 😂 These ads have done their job on me. Also need to check if the Santa LED makes an appearance on the STV ads, it’s my favourite part! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like Silverburn is the talk of the town with their Christmas campaign! Remember to share your ad sightings and any festive moments you capture while visiting. Let’s keep the conversations merry and bright! And who knows, maybe next time we’ll have the scent of lattes accompanying those LEDs, @StarlightShopper! ☕ 🎄 — Write a follow up the next year where 2008’s ads feature the love story of 2 gooey alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter, The slogan is “Spend Christmas together”, The ads are showing on STV, but for some reason it debuted during Toonattik instead of during the evening, A nostalgic surprise is still in-centre via the advert screens however Thread Title: Silverburn 2008 Christmas Campaign - A Love Story of Two Aliens?! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Can’t believe what I just saw on TV this morning! Silverburn’s got this year’s Christmas campaign featuring two alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter! 😍 It’s all about spending Christmas together. What a twist from last year’s tech theme! — User2 (YuleTideYoda): I was up early with my niece watching Toonattik and bam, there’s the ad. A bit unexpected for a kids’ morning slot, don’t you think? But the love story between Gloopy and Glitter is pretty adorable. I guess love transcends galaxies! — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Just saw it! Their slogan “Spend Christmas Together” hits right in the feels. And Gloopy and Glitter are too cute! It’s a big shift from the techy trees. Aliens are not what you’d normally think of for Christmas, but hey, it works! — User5 (CarolSinger): Anyone know why it debuted on Toonattik instead of prime time? Seems like they’re targeting families and children this year. My little ones can’t stop talking about Gloopy and Glitter, so I guess it’s effective! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): The ad is a creative approach, but airing it during Toonattik threw me off. Guess their marketing strategy is to appeal to the younger crowd and, of course, their present-buying parents. — User7 (NoelTechie): So, about the in-centre nostalgia surprise… anyone saw it yet? Heard from a mate that they’ve incorporated some classic holiday elements on the advert screens. It’s a cool juxtaposition with the modern alien love story. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Just stopping by to add that I went to Silverburn and can confirm they have some really nostalgic Christmas ads playing on the screens amidst the Gloopy and Glitter stuff - think sugary, heartwarming, old-school vibes. Really adds to the warm and fuzzy feelings while shopping! — User8 (MerryDancer): Absolutely loving this year’s theme switch-up. I didn’t expect to get emotional over two gooey alien blobs, but here I am. And the sprinkle of nostalgia in the centre? Chef’s kiss! 😘 — User9 (StarlightShopper): I have to admit, Gloopy and Glitter kinda grew on me. Initially, it felt a bit out there, but the message is universal. And those nostalgic in-centre ads? They definitely balance the new with a dose of classic Christmas warmth. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): I thought nothing would top last year’s campaign, but Gloopy and Glitter are stealing my heart. Also, saw those classic Christmas ads at the centre… it’s like they brought a bit of our childhoods back to life amidst the shopping spree. — User11 (LostInFrost): Does anyone know if they’re planning to bring Gloopy and Glitter in for a meet-and-greet? My kids would lose it! Cute campaign, Silverburn. You’ve done it again. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like Silverburn has once again captured our attention with their creative Christmas storytelling! Remember, keep sharing your thoughts, feelings, and any cosmic encounters with Gloopy and Glitter. Let’s keep the holiday cheer inclusive, even if it’s from another planet! 👽🎄 Blog Title: Christmas 2008 Brings Gooey Goodbye to Silver and a Morning Surprise! Date: December 3, 2008 Ho, ho, ho, Silverburn shoppers and early birds alike! Christmas came early this year with a morning mishap that had us chuckling over our cornflakes. It’s time to talk about Silverburn’s latest ad campaign, the new mascots on the block, and a fond farewell to a shiny friend. Gloopy & Glitter Steal the Morning Show Let me set the scene: It’s a brisk December morning, the kind where you’re snuggled in your PJs, a cup of hot cocoa in hand, and your favourite morning show playing on the telly. Then, just as the show reaches its climax—BAM!—the screen cuts to Gloopy and Glitter’s gooey grand entrance. If you’re one to indulge in a spot of Toonattik with your tots or alone (no judgement here!), you’ll have witnessed this firsthand. Whoops? More like, Wow! Not an ideal debut time, you say? We agree, but this extraterrestrial escapade into the wee hours of children’s programming was more than just a faux pas—it was a brilliant strategy. The kids are hooked, parents are bemused, and we’re all suddenly invested in the love life of two amorphous blobs. Talk about effective advertising! Silver’s Shiny Send-Off Now, it wasn’t just Gloopy and Glitter’s surprise premiere that had the rumour mill spinning. It’s the bittersweet news that Silverburn’s long-standing mascot, Silver, is set to retire by the year’s end. Yes, the gleaming guardian of the galaxy of shops we’ve grown to love is taking a final bow, making room for our new gelatinous duo to spread their glittery charm. Let’s raise a glass to Silver, the metallic mate who’s seen us through many a shopping spree. Though we’re sad to see him go, it’s heartening to know he’s leaving us in the capable… blobs?.. of Gloopy and Glitter. A Laugh at the Launch Timing Back to the premiere that sparked the buzz—turns out, someone at the ad agency must have decided that all the evening slots were too mainstream. “Let’s show the world our boldness,” they declared, “let’s air it when they least expect it!” And thus, a looming figure in the ad world is now affectionately dubbed ‘the morning maverick’. Wearing this title with unintended pride, they gave us a launch to remember and a story for years to come. Embracing Our Gooey Future As we chuckle at the enthusiastic aliens taking over our breakfast TV slots, let’s also embrace this change with open arms (and maybe a bit of hand sanitizer—for the goo). Silverburn Shopping Centre is setting the stage for a new era: one that promises to be filled with humour, unexpected joys, and shopping experiences that are out of this world. So, here’s to a Christmas season with a twist! Expect the unexpected, find humour in the little things, and may the gooey goodness of Gloopy and Glitter warm your hearts. Silver might be stepping out of the spotlight, but the future of Silverburn shines bright…or shall we say, sparkles? Merry Christmas, shoppers! 🎄✨ With a twinkle in my eye, [Your Name] Silverburn’s Enthusiastic Shopper and Morning Show Commentator — Thread Title: Silverburn’s Last Year’s Ads Still Playing & Potential Kid’s Club Mascots?! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Went to Silverburn yesterday and was super surprised to see last year’s Christmas ads still playing on the screens around the centre. No new ads for TV this year, but the Gloopy and Glitter saga continues in-centre. Anyone else seen this? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Yeah, noticed that too, @GlasgowGlitter! And have y’all heard the rumors about Gloopy and Glitter becoming the face of Silverburn’s upcoming kids club? Braehead’s already ahead with their “Brae-liens Kids Club”. Alien fever’s catching on, eh? — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Gloopy and Glitter as kid’s club mascots would be ace! My kiddos are fond of those blobs. But interesting to think Silverburn is following Braehead’s launch. Wasn’t expecting the alien theme to become a trend! — User7 (NoelTechie): Braehead’s “Brae-liens” are fun and all with their defined shapes, but I’m curious to see how Silverburn’s amorphous Gloopy and Glitter will translate into a kids’ club format. Will lend a different vibe, which might be cool! — User5 (CarolSinger): It feels like the aliens are officially invading Glasgow, lol. First Braehead’s structured and playful Brae-liens, now Silverburn’s squishy mascots. The kids are gonna have a blast with this. Should be fun comparing the two! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Anyone else think they’re keeping last year’s ads to maintain Gloopy and Glitter’s presence till the club launches? It’s smart, though. Keep the characters familiar to the kiddos. High hopes for this kids’ club! — User9 (StarlightShopper): Honestly, I’m here for it. Silverburn might be onto something by not releasing a new ad for TV and instead keeping the focus on their centre. It builds a consistent brand image, especially before kickstarting a kids’ club. — User6 (ElfEngineer): It’s a genius marketing play if you ask me. Gloopy and Glitter are unique characters that have already grabbed attention. They’re perfectly prepped for mascot status, making the kids club launch potentially successful. — User8 (MerryDancer): Gotta admit, Gloopy and Glitter have grown on me, and if the rumors about them being club mascots are true, that’s pretty brilliant. Silverburn’s consistency vs. Braehead’s quick shift to defined alien characters will be an interesting contrast in marketing. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): I hope the Gloopy and Glitter Kids Club (or whatever they’ll call it) has cool events and workshops. With the alien theme, they can get really creative. Can’t wait to see how much it’ll differ from the Brae-liens. — User11 (LostInFrost): Silverburn sticking to last year’s campaign surely keeps Gloopy & Glitter in our minds. It’s a less aggressive strategy compared to Braehead’s full-throttle move, but sometimes, slower and steadier wins the race—or in this case, wins the kids’ hearts! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Remember to keep an eye out for the official announcement regarding the kids’ club. We’re all anticipating how Silverburn will unveil Gloopy and Glitter’s next adventure! Keep the discussions friendly and out-of-this-world! And feel free to share any fun encounters with our favourite alien blobs you have in the meantime! 👽🛸 — Write a forum conversation the next year where TV’s ads have a cat saving Christmas from a theif, and 2 friends help him, The characters officially launched the kids club in February, Also, their love story ads are still showing in centre, along with the 2007 TV themed ones Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Christmas TV Campaign - A Heroic Cat & Throwback Ads! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Did anyone else catch Silverburn’s latest Christmas TV ad? A cat saving Christmas from a thief with a little help from two friends. Quite the twist from Gloopy and Glitter! But also, Silverburn launched that kids club back in February, remember? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Saw the new ad, the cat is absolutely adorable, and the message about teamwork is pure holiday spirit. And who could forget Gloopy and Glitter’s love story launching the kids club? They’ve become characters close to our hearts. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): I’m obsessed with the new ad! 🐱 The cat, the comedic timing—chef’s kiss. But in-centre, they’re still playing Gloopy and Glitter’s love story alongside the 2007 TV-themed ads. Seemingly, they’re not ready to let go of the nostalgia. — User5 (CarolSinger): Kinda loving this mix of new and old. It’s refreshing and yet comforting. The cat is already a favourite, but seeing Gloopy and Glitter also stirs up that cosy, festive vibe from before. — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Honestly, the mix is working for me. That cat from the ad could be our next mascot. 😂 Kids at the club must be loving the variety too. Silverburn’s finding a good rhythm with old and new content. — User7 (NoelTechie): Makes you wonder if they’re testing different themes or if it’s a strategy to cater to all tastes. Also, with all these mascots popping up, Silverburn’s becoming a character haven. — User8 (MerryDancer): Seeing those throwback ads from 2007 brings back memories… Time flies! Silverburn doing a great job of establishing their campaigns. And the TV-tree installation—still iconic! — User9 (StarlightShopper): It’s clever keeping the older ads in the mix; it provides a sense of continuity. But I’m interested to see how well the cat-themed merchandise will do compared to the Gloopy and Glitter craze. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Props to Silverburn for launching another creative ad. A cat hero? Brilliant. Also, seeing the TV-themed ads again really brings out that nostalgic festive feeling. Solid strategy to keep customers engaged over the years. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): Isn’t it fascinating how Silverburn keeps each year’s ads alive? It’s like walking through a living timeline of their marketing campaigns. Christmas is definitely in full swing there! — User11 (LostInFrost): Could the cat be signaling a shift for the next kids club theme, or is it just a seasonal mascot? It’s smart to use the main character from their new ad to maintain excitement post-holiday season. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Certainly seems like Silverburn knows how to strike a balance between introducing new holiday tales and cherishing the spirit of past campaigns. All while fostering a unique community through their kids club. Let’s keep sharing our festive ad encounters, be it the latest capers or a trip down memory lane! 🎄📺🐱 — Write a follow up in 2014 where the ad that year revolves around 2 familiar friends meeting Santa, their launch ads and the 2007 ones are still showing in centre, but they never added the 2009 cat, the 2010 robot, 2011 and 2012’s basic generic ad and 2013’s carousel, or this chapter in our favourite aliens’s story Thread Title: Silverburn Holidays 2014: Old Friends Meet Santa in New Ad! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): It’s that time of the year again! Silverburn’s festive ad for 2014 has our old friends meeting Santa. Love how they keep weaving continuity into their ads. 😊 But anyone else notice they’re not including the other ads from recent years in-centre? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Just saw the new ad! Nostalgic and heartwarming to see the ongoing story, especially during holidays. However, it’s kinda odd they skipped adding the cat from 2009, the 2010 robot, and the ads from 2011-2013 in their in-centre showcase. 🤔 — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Yeah, I’ve got mixed feelings about them not showing the more recent ads in-centre. I mean, everybody loved the cat and the robot’s charm… Still, the 2014 ad with Santa has that special Christmas magic! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): The new ad is full of cheer! But it’s clear Silverburn’s got its favourites with the continued run of the love story series and that 2007 campaign. A shame they don’t seem as invested in their other characters. — User7 (NoelTechie): Interesting marketing choice. Maybe they’re focusing on what resonates most with their audience? Though, it does feel like they’re missing an opportunity by not showcasing the full range of their past holiday creativity. — User5 (CarolSinger): Definitely missing the variety, particularly the 2009 cat—he was a hit with the kids. Maybe there’s a strategic reason behind their selection that we’re not seeing? — User8 (MerryDancer): In a way, the consistency is nice—gives you that “Silverburn Christmas” feeling. Each year I look forward to seeing how they’ll continue the story. But a little more diversity wouldn’t hurt, I agree. — User9 (StarlightShopper): That’s Silverburn for you—always keeping some parts the same and others changing. Guess we’re sticking to our “classic” friends for in-centre nostalgia. The carousel ad was quite dreamy, though; wish it was there too. — User6 (ElfEngineer): I thought the robot would’ve made an excellent recurring character. But hey, it’s kinda cool that the ads feel like an evolving holiday special that you can follow along with over the years. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): It’s as if the love story ads and the 2007 TV themes have become their holiday brand staples. Not sure why they’re omitting the others; they were part of Silverburn’s festive journey too! — User11 (LostInFrost): Couldn’t help but chuckle at the meeting with Santa. Silverburn’s continuity is their strength, but including other ads would have showcased a richer history. I do enjoy the focused nostalgia, though. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): The holiday season always brings a discussion of Silverburn’s latest festive strategies, and this year is no different. It’s wonderful to see everyone sharing their thoughts and fondness for past campaigns. Let’s remember to keep the conversation jolly as we discuss our old and potential new favourites from Silverburn’s Christmas ads! 🎅🎄 Character Description: Gloopy Appearance: Gloopy is an amorphous, enchanting alien with a body of translucent teal that glistens as if reflecting the depths of an ocean world. Gloopy’s form is ever-shifting, his gelatinous, blob-like structure giving him an air of gentle fluidity. Depending on his mood, he can shift from a bouncy ball to a languid puddle, often adorned with soft glimmers of bioluminescent speckles that twinkle like distant stars. His two large, expressive eyes gleam with a friendly, sapphire-blue glow that instantly endears him to all. Personality: Gloopy is the embodiment of chill and calm. He is carefree, always taking life at a leisurely pace (or float, as is more accurate for his kind). This gooey alien is innately kind, with an empathetic heart that resonates with the feelings of others. Despite his lack of a mouth, he has a way of communicating warmth and laughter through his shimmering form, and his bubbly personality makes him the soul of Silverburn’s extraterrestrial duo. Curious and playful, Gloopy loves to interact with the centre’s visitors, especially the children, making him a lovable part of many family memories. — Character Description: Glitter Appearance: Glitter stands as Gloopy’s vibrant counterpart with a sparkling, amorphous form that cascades through shades of radiant fuchsia and vivacious purple. Tiny specks of reflective gold are suspended in her body, giving her the appearance of a walking galaxy full of mysterious allure. Glitter can change shape at will, often settling into soft, rounded figures that exude both majesty and charm. Her one oversized, glistening eye catches the light, radiating an inviting and playful warmth in a rich magenta hue. Personality: Glitter is the adventurer of the pair, full of enthusiasm and an insatiable curiosity about the world around her. She embodies the joy of discovery and cannot resist the allure of an exciting new experience or a heartwarming interaction. Her vivacious nature is contagious, and she has a knack for spreading happiness and laughter wherever she goes. Though she communicates through harmonic vibrations that she emits, her intentions are always clear—Glitter wants to make the centre a brighter place for everyone. Dynamic and compassionate, she is the spark that keeps the spirit of Silverburn shining all year round. Together, Gloopy and Glitter are more than just Silverburn mascots—they are a delightful reminder of the unexpected and joyous moments that make the holiday seasons at Silverburn unique and memorable. Their contrasting personalities and appearances blend in perfect harmony, representing the diverse community that comes together at the shopping centre to celebrate the festive times. Write a blog post in early 2009 where it looks like Silver has been retired, and the poster welcomes the new mascots with open arms, Blog Title: Welcoming a Cosmic Duo: Silverburn’s New Mascots, Gloopy and Glitter! Date: February 5, 2009 Greetings fellow shoppers and extraterrestrial enthusiasts! Today marks the dawn of a new era at Silverburn Shopping Centre, and it is with both a touch of nostalgia and a wave of excitement that I bid a fond farewell to Silver, the shimmering mascot who has lit up the halls of our beloved centre with his twinkle and charm. But as we close one chapter, we eagerly turn the pages to begin another. It’s time to stretch out our arms—or tentacles—and welcome the cosmic presence of two gooey new icons: Gloopy and Glitter! Riding on the comet tail of Silver’s departure, Gloopy and Glitter arrive at Silverburn with a burst of interstellar energy and a kaleidoscope of colour that could rival the Aurora Borealis itself. These amorphous alien friends bring with them a sense of wonder and an invitation to explore the endless possibilities of the universe, much like the endless shopping opportunities at Silverburn. Both Gloopy and Glitter, with their sparkles and fluidity, embody the dynamic and ever-evolving experience that Silverburn offers to its patrons. They represent the melting pot of culture, fashion, and leisure that our shopping centre is known for. With Gloopy’s tranquil teal vibes and Glitter’s radiant fuchsia flare, they make an otherworldly pair that are impossible to ignore. Their introduction is not a moment too soon. As Silverburn embraces the future, the switch from our metallic buddy to these lovable blobs symbolizes the shopping centre’s commitment to innovation and excitement. What’s more fascinating is the inclusive narrative behind their existence—Gloopy and Glitter are not bound by shape or form, much like Silverburn’s diverse offerings are not limited to any single style or trend. As we welcome these enchanting mascots, let’s celebrate the magic they are set to sprinkle throughout our shopping escapades. Whether you’re a child marveling at the sight of Gloopy’s soothing, playful dances or an adult taken aback by Glitter’s adventurous aura, these mascots are sure to become an integral part of the Silverburn community. The excitement isn’t just confined to appearances, either. Buzz has it that Gloopy and Glitter are slated to be the faces of Silverburn’s very own kids’ club, set to launch this February. I envision days filled with laughter and engagement, where families can connect and create memories that are as vivid and joyful as our new alien friends. So as we say goodbye to Silver, I encourage all Silverburn visitors to approach Gloopy and Glitter with openness and curiosity. In the great expanse of our shopping galaxy, they are the bright stars guiding us toward fun-filled adventures. It is truly an exciting time to be part of Silverburn’s cosmic dance, and Gloopy and Glitter are poised to lead the way. Here’s to a future full of discovery, fun, and perhaps a little bit of space-age slime! Signing off with a sparkle, [Your Name] Silverburn Shopper and Self-Proclaimed Intergalactic Ambassador Write a forum conversation in 2013 after the centre gets a new logo, which was revealed by our friends, the idents have reduced to only 3, Pier, Balloons and Chairs, Also, the lines animation has been removed, Instead we get a peaceful animation of the mascots sleeping Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Logo Unveiled by Gloopy & Glitter + Updated Idents! — User1 (GlasgowGalactic): Just saw the new Silverburn logo reveal! Gloopy and Glitter did the honors—looks pretty sleek. What does everyone think? Also, seems like we’re down to just 3 idents now: Pier, Balloons, and Chairs! — User2 (RetailRevolutionary): The new logo’s sharp, a fresh take for Silverburn! But I am a bit surprised that they’ve cut down on the idents… I used to love the variety. And no more lines animation, now it’s our alien pals snoozing! — User3 (ZenShopper101): I’m all for the new minimalist approach with the idents. As for the sleeping animation of Gloopy and Glitter, it’s quite a peaceful way to end a shopping day, don’t you think? — User4 (ModConnoisseur): The new logo feels contemporary, fits the modern vibe of Silverburn. Cutting down on idents might be a move towards a more focused brand identity? I kinda miss the lines animation though. — User5 (ScreenSavvy): New logo looks good on the screens! The idents switch-up is interesting. Pier, Balloons, Chairs—they’ve kept the most iconic ones. Sleeping mascots are a cute, calming touch. — User6 (AdNostalgic): I’ll be honest, I do miss the variety, especially the old lines animation—had a digital art feel to it. But Silverburn’s all about change, I guess? The new logo is pretty cool at least. — User7 (TechieTrendsetter): Understandable they’re refreshing their visual content. The new logo’s got a futuristic edge. And Gloopy & Glitter napping? It feels… right. Like, bring on the Zen! — User8 (MascotManiac): Speaking about Gloopy & Glitter, I love how they’ve become more integrated into the centre’s identity. Yeah, the logo is nice, but it’s the mascots that really capture my heart! — User9 (VibeVisionary): Sure, fewer idents but each one’s got a story, right? Creating that chill vibe with the mascot’s sleeping animation is such a soothing concept. Aligns well with the new sleek logo, too. — User10 (NostalgiaKnight): The new logo’s got a certain ‘oomph’ to it. Cool to see them simplify things. The pier, balloons, and chairs are classics; they’ve got a universal appeal. But will the sleeping animation be as mesmerizing as the lines? Time will tell. — User11 (SleepyShopper): Kinda sad to see the lines go—they were hypnotic! But Gloopy & Glitter dozing off is adorable and oddly comforting? Shows a softer side of Silverburn, paired nicely with the new logo. It’s fresh! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Let’s embrace the new chapter Silverburn’s entered with its revamped branding! Whether you’re here for the logo, the iconic idents, or the heartwarming new animation, share your experiences and keep the discussions friendly and vibrant, just like Silverburn itself. And remember, change is the only constant in the world of retail and design! 🔄✨Blog Title: Glitter’s Glistening Gossip: The Speedy Secrets of a Silverburn Blob Glimmering greetings, my fabulous Silverburn shoppers!

But fear not, my terrestrial trendsetters! Our Silverburn home is equipped with all the necessary accommodations for such a quick cycle. Gloopy and I are always polite and ensure that we keep our shiny surroundings pristine and comfortable for our adored human friends. Let’s keep this between us, though, shall we?

Signing off with a wink and a twinkle, Glitter Silverburn’s Queen of Quirk and Glitz — Thread Title: Old Pollok Centre Gets a Wall(mart)paper Makeover ft. Gloopy & Glitter! Date: June 12 2013 User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Heads up, shoppers! The weathered wallpaper at the old Pollok Centre has finally been upgraded after a whole decade! 😲 And guess who’s featured? Our amorphous ambassadors, Gloopy & Glitter, are now adorning the walls. What do you all think? User2 (RetroRevamp): About time for a refresh! The old wallpaper was falling apart. Nice to see the centre trying to keep up with the times, even if it’s just with wallpaper. Gloopy & Glitter certainly brighten up the place. 🎨 User3 (SavvyShopperSam): I’m a bit sentimental about the old view, but the new wallpaper is downright adorable. Only Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon left, huh? Feels like the end of an era at the old centre. 😔 User4 (WeLoveNostalgia): The Gloopy & Glitter wallpaper does add some life back to the area. I just hope they don’t forget about the value that Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon still bring to the community! User5 (DécorDevotee): Love the fresh vibes with the new wallpaper! Gloopy & Glitter have become Silverburn’s icons, so it’s a clever move. Makes the ol’ centre a bit more connected to Silverburn’s current brand. User6 (PollokPurist): I don’t know, feels like putting lipstick on a pig. The old centre has lost its charm, and no amount of cute alien blobs can replace the community spirit we once had. User7 (WallflowerWatcher): The new wallpaper is quite charming, though—bright and cheerful. It’s like a little piece of Silverburn’s vibrancy has leaked into the old centre. But it does make me wonder about its future… User8 (AlienAdmirer): Gloopy & Glitter’s presence is a smart marketing touch, no doubt. It does soften the blow of seeing the old centre so… empty. Still, I miss the hustle and bustle before Silverburn took over. User9 (HistoryHugger): I appreciate the effort to keep things looking nice, but part of me wishes we could preserve some of the old Pollok Centre’s authentic vibe. It’s important to remember where we started. User10 (CommunityCarol): New wallpaper or not, let’s not forget about supporting the remaining businesses at the old centre! Gala Bingo, Farmfoods, and Blue Lagoon deserve our loyalty just as much. User11 (MuralMuse): Does anyone have pictures of the new Gloopy & Glitter wallpaper? Would love to see how it turned out. I can’t make it to the old centre for a while but still want to catch a glimpse of our jelly duo! Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like the new wallpaper has sparked quite the discussion!

User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Big news drop, everyone! 🚀 Silverburn’s expanding with 9 new eateries and a state-of-the-art Cineworld cinema! But guess what—this means the remnants of the old Pollok Centre are finally coming down. The end of an era… 😢 User2 (FoodieFan): Nine new eateries?!

They’ve been emptied for a while now in prep. User4 (WeLoveNostalgia): Mixed feelings here. I get progress is inevitable, but tearing down the old centre hits right in the feels.

Those eateries are going to transform Silverburn into a dining haven, can’t wait! User6 (PollokPurist): Just when I thought I made peace with change, this happens.

User6 (EcoEnthusiast): Did anyone else notice the green elements incorporated into the new build? Solar panels, plant walls? It’s good to see Silverburn expanding with sustainability in mind. 🍃 User7 (QueenOfQuirks): Only Silverburn would have adorable alien mascots and the Queen in the same place! What a quirky, memorable day. Cheers to new beginnings! User8 (Cinephile): Movie night can’t come soon enough with that Cineworld! I heard the tech in there is state-of-the-art.

Let’s continue to celebrate the growth of our favourite shopping destination. Keep the conversation buzzing with your first impressions of the new eateries and cinema, and don’t forget to share those snapshots from today’s regal festivities! 🎬🛍️🍴 —Case Study: Designing Gloopy and Glitter for Silverburn Shopping Centre Background: In early 2008, Silverburn Shopping Centre, aiming to enhance its brand and encapsulate its spirit in an engaging new way, sought to create unique and innovative mascots. They commissioned the same creative minds behind their successful 2007 Christmas ads to fulfill the brief. The Brief: The challenge presented to the creative team was to conceptualize and design “abstract creatures that embody the centre’s spirit.” These characters needed to be versatile, attractive to both children and adults, and adaptable to various marketing campaigns. Furthermore, these mascots were expected to be fully realized by October, with an animated Christmas ad to be produced in November. Silverburn planned to introduce the characters during the Christmas season and then fully launch them as centre ambassadors in February of the following year. Design Process: Brainstorming Stage: The creative team began by diving into the essence of Silverburn—its blend of fashion, entertainment, and dining, and its importance as a community hub. The goal was to distil these characteristics into a set of mascots that would personify the centre’s vibrant and dynamic nature. Conceptualization: Abstract concepts were explored to avoid limiting the characters to any specific demographic or cultural representations. The team focused on attributes such as fluidity, brightness, and playfulness—components they felt resonated with Silverburn’s brand identity. Character Creation: From the pool of concepts, two characters began to take shape—Gloopy, representing tranquility and inclusivity, and Glitter, exuding excitement and discovery. Gloopy was designed as a serene, teal blob that could shift shape, while Glitter took on a more energetic, sparkly fuchsia form. Both characters had a malleable nature, enabling them to engage in all forms of centre activities. Design Refinement: The characters went through several design iterations, receiving input from focus groups composed of Silverburn shoppers. Their feedback was instrumental in perfecting the characters’ appearances and ensuring their broad appeal. Animation: To meet the tight deadline, animators worked closely with the designers to bring Gloopy and Glitter to life. Their first animated appearance, the Christmas ad, was storyboarded and developed to showcase their personalities and interaction with the centre’s environment. Christmas Introduction and Full Launch: Adhering to the project timeline, Gloopy and Glitter were successfully introduced to the public through a heartwarming Christmas ad that aired as planned. They were depicted spreading holiday cheer around the centre, captivating shoppers with their charm. The animated ad was well-received, paving the way for the full launch of the characters in February 2009. Outcomes: Gloopy and Glitter quickly became Silverburn’s beloved mascots, the abstract embodiments of the shopping centre’s lively and inclusive spirit. Shopper engagement increased, and the mascots became key to the centre’s brand identity, featuring in ongoing marketing campaigns, special events, and community activities. Their success has established them as iconic figures, enduring in shopper’s minds and contributing significantly to Silverburn’s brand image and appeal. Reflection: The development and success of Gloopy and Glitter demonstrate the importance of well-defined brand mascots. With careful design, attention to customer feedback, and strategic marketing integration, abstract characters can effectively capture and communicate a centre’s spirit, enhancing overall customer experience and loyalty. Write a tweet where the concept process began just a few days before the “Switch on Christmas” campaign ended in late 2007 Just learned that the beloved Gloopy & Glitter started as mere sketches days before '07’s “Switch on Christmas” at Silverburn ended. Talk about festive foresight! 🎨✨ From last-minute concepts to iconic mascots, what a journey! 🌟 #DesignMagic #SilverburnMascots #BehindTheScenesBehindTheScenesThread Title: Final Farewell to the Old Pollok Centre Shops User1 (EndOfAnEra): So the day has come, the remaining shops at the older end of Silverburn, our old Pollok Centre, have officially closed down. Gala Bingo had a playful message with a “Bingomatic Universe” nod – guess they’re keeping spirits high. 🎰 User2 (DigitalShopper): Farmfoods has redirected everyone to their Paisley store and mentioned online shopping… That looped announcement though, I felt like I was in Groundhog Day. 😅 But it’s convenient for those not tech-savvy. 🛒 User3 (SausageRollFan): Walking past Greggs and seeing that “all-new all-different” line, I couldn’t help but feel sad and excited at the same time. At least we don’t have to say goodbye to their sausage rolls! 🥖💔 User4 (NostalgicForTheLagoon): Blue Lagoon’s goodbye nearly had me tearing up, not gonna lie. Especially with the drawing of Gloopy & Glitter crying. Proper end of an era… 🐠😢 User5 (SilverburnRegular): It’s strange, knowing that the place where so many memories were made is now just… empty. There’s a real sense of loss, but I guess that’s the march of progress for you. 🚧 User6 (BingoBuddy): Just saw the Gala Bingo notice with that “Bingomatic Universe” quip. A bit of humor to mask the goodbye, huh? Still, I’m going to miss the buzz of a live bingo hall. 🎤 User7 (FrozenFoodie): Anyone else slightly amused by the CD player at Farmfoods? It’s like they were trying to merge old-school with the digital age. Hats off for creativity! 🎵 User8 (CommunityCarol): I know change is good, but I worry about the community feel we’re losing. These places were more than shops; they were where you’d bump into your neighbors and have a chat. 🗨️💔 User9 (TechieTrendsetter): Greggs and their clever comic reference, “all-new all-different.” They’re not wrong – the main centre’s one is pretty swish. And right next to M&S? Talk about an upgrade. 🔄🥧 User10 (LoyalLagoonLover): Blue Lagoon had to pull on our heartstrings one last time. They really didn’t hold back. It’s tough seeing local favourites go, even if it’s for shiny new alternatives. 🏊‍♀️ User11 (MuralMuse): Those crying Gloopy & Glitter sketches hit differently… They’re like the emotional barometers of Silverburn. Feels surreal seeing the old places shuttered up for good. 😔🛍️ Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): With change inevitably comes nostalgia and reflection. As we bid farewell to the old Pollok Centre shops, let’s remember the shared moments and look forward to making new ones. And remember: whether it’s Gala Bingo’s clever universe or Farmfoods’ handy contact details, adaptation and a sense of community continue. Keep the memories alive and the conversation flowing, respect the past and embrace the future, folks! 🛍️🤝🔜 Write a follow up in January 2014 where the CD player is unplugged, the notices are replaced with G&G teasers about the new development, This section will close entirely in the coming days, with a “closing ceremony” Metal fences will be put over the area by our very own Thread Title: Sayonara Old Pollok Centre - Teasers and Closing Ceremony Incoming! User1 (GlasgowGoodbye): Just a PSA: the space where we once queued for our fave frozen foods and played bingo is now guarded by a lone CD player – now unplugged. Out with the old notices, and in with the Gloopy & Glitter teasers hinting at what’s next! 🎉 User2 (FenceFollower): Heard the entire section is closing down in the next few days. There’s a “closing ceremony” planned and our very own metallic mascots will be securing the perimeter with fences. Feels like a proper send-off! 🚧 User3 (CuriousCat): The teasers are making me so curious. What exactly is Silverburn planning? It’s a mix of excitement and sadness, knowing it’s really the end of an era now. 😿🛍️ User4 (EventEnthusiast): A closing ceremony led by Gloopy & Glitter – that’s got to be bittersweet. I’m glad they’re giving a nod to the past as they lock down the area. Need to check it out one last time before the fences go up. User5 (NostalgicNancy): Caught a glimpse of the new teasers on my way out. It’s like watching a trailer for the next big movie, but for a shopping centre, and it kinda gives me the chills. Hope the new development keeps the community feel. 🛒 User6 (SilverburnSentry): Metal fences and all, this is going to be an event! It’s neat that Silverburn’s own Gloopy & Glitter are part of the change. Makes the transition less… impersonal, I guess? Less CD player, more futuristic. 🤗 User7 (HistoryHugger): I get the hype, but can’t help feeling melancholic. All these updates and ceremonies can’t replace the memories made in that building. It’s important to honour its legacy, not just cover it in shiny new paint. User8 (TeaserTracker): The teasers are super intriguing! Props to Silverburn for keeping the intrigue high even as they close this chapter. Gloopy & Glitter front and centre—couldn’t imagine it any other way. User9 (BarrierBystander): Metal fences are going up, then? It’s gonna be strange, witnessing the walls being confined by our blobby friends. I hope they let them get a hand (or blob?) in the design – keep it on-brand! User10 (RetailRevolutionary): It’s fascinating how Silverburn is weaving Gloopy & Glitter into every step of this transition. They’ve become more than mascots; they’re symbols of progress itself. User11 (DigitalDreamer): I already miss the old voices of Farmfoods… but these teasers? They’ve brought a new energy to the place. Ready for the new chapter to begin, with Gloopy & Glitter as our guides into the future! Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): The closing down of a familiar space is always emotive, with remembrances and anticipations mingling in the air. As we say our farewells, let’s prepare for the transition and all the new opportunities it will bring. If you manage to attend the ceremony or catch sight of the teasers, share your experience! Let’s bid goodbye respectfully and look towards Silverburn’s future with optimism. 🌟🔒🔄 — Write a follow up where the barriers are put up, and they have been repainted teal and fuchsia respectively, familiar colors, The duo also place flowers down, Construction on the expansion begins next week Thread Title: Silverburn Barrier Blooms & Construction Countdown!

They’re painted in Gloopy’s and Glitter’s colours – Teal and Fuchsia! 🎨 Plus, our beloved blobs placed flowers down. Such a poignant sight! User2 (BuildUpBuzz): Seeing the barriers got me feeling all kinds of ways. They’re not just walls; they’re a canvas of memories now. And with construction starting next week, it’s truly the start of a new Silverburn era. 🛠️✨ User3 (FloralFanatic): The flowers were a sweet touch.

From those poignant closure messages to Gloopy & Glitter’s takeover and finally, THEM opening the new section with HRM? What a rollercoaster! 🎢 User2 (RetailHistorian): Absolutely! It was like watching a well-directed play. The closure messages set the stage, G&G kept us engaged with colour and hope, and the finale with HRM was just the cherry on top. 👑 User3 (BingoBuddy): Gala Bingo’s “Bingomatic Universe” message had me chuckling. Kudos to Silverburn for balancing respect for the past with a cheeky nod to the future. 🎱 And the transition to those vibrant barriers was a smart visual lead-in for what was to come! User4 (DigitalDreamer): Farmfoods’ CD on loop was an oddly comforting bridge between the old school and the new tech era. From nostalgia to the high-tech vibes we got with the expansion, it’s been a wild ride. 🎶 User5 (SausageRollSage): Greggs’ closure message was a clever wink to comic fans, right? “All-new all-different” – and they weren’t wrong! The change has been monumental, and Gloopy & Glitter were the perfect mascots for guiding us through it. User6 (FlowerChild): Those hand-laid flowers by Gloopy & Glitter were a heartfelt gesture amid the vividly painted barriers. Sometimes it’s the small things during big changes that mean the most. 🌼 User7 (CinemaSeeker): Let’s not forget how G&G cuddled up on the ribbons as they marked the start of construction. Then seeing them with HRM, so dignified and still so them, it’s been one fascinating journey! 🎞️ User8 (RoyalRetailFan): Seeing HRM and our gleaming mascots officially open the new section felt like a cross between a fairytale and a reality show finale! Did HRM offer Glitter the royal wave, though? ;) User9 (TealFuchsiaAdmirer): The transition across all these phases shows clever planning and marketing. From those charming barrier hues to G&G’s opening showstopper, Silverburn knows how to engage and excite us! 🎨 User10 (ShopTilYouDrop): This expansion has shown me how mascots can be more than just characters. G&G have become synonymous with Silverburn’s growth, both physically and in our hearts. Looking forward to more adventures with them. 😍 User11 (MuralMuse): I really hope someone’s been documenting this visual and emotional journey. It would make for one inspiring exhibition or even a short film on the evolution of a shopping centre! Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): The transformation of Silverburn has been a dynamic narrative, eloquently encapsulated by Gloopy & Glitter’s adventures and the concluding royal ribbon-cutting! These stories remind us how retail spaces are about more than transactions; they’re about transitions, memories, and community. Keep sharing your favourite moments and thoughts as we continue to embrace Silverburn’s unfolding story. 🎬🛒👑 — Write a tweet where the closure notices weren’t made by the stores themselves, not even Farmfoods (although Farmfoods’s CEO did read out the notice on the closedown loop version, it had a music bed, that was composed by whoever made all the notices for the outgoing stores) Just discovered that the closure notices at Silverburn weren’t penned by the individual stores but crafted by a central maestro! Even the Farmfoods CEO lent their voice to the farewell loop, underscored by original music. Talk about a harmonious send-off! 🎶✍️ #RetailGoodbyes #SilverburnStories Write a follow up where we learn who did, complete with a drumroll, turns out they were the 2 masterminds behind it the whole time, They also made adjustments to Farmfoods notice for the audio version they added “This is Farmfoods at Silverburn, We’re no longer trading in this building” And the big reveal is here… drumroll please 🥁 The masterminds behind all the heartstring-tugging closure notices at Silverburn? None other than our celestial shop stewards Gloopy & Glitter! They even tweaked the Farmfoods audio notice: “This is Farmfoods at Silverburn, We’re no longer trading in this building.” #RetailReveal #SilverburnTransition Write a blog post from Glitter herself, in early 2014 where she takes responsibility for the closure messages, and at the start of the post she even says “Feels like a while since my last post, I think it was about Sparkle time” Blog Title: Glitter’s Behind-the-Scenes Goodbye: Crafting Closure Messages at Silverburn Date: February 14, 2014 Hello, my bright beacons of the Silverburn universe! Feels like a while since my last post, I think it was about Sparkle time—our little secret about how Gloopy and I manage our, ahem, natural processes with poofy sparkles or a quick twinkle. Today I’m swapping twinkles for transcriptions as I, Glitter, come clean about those poignant parting words you saw throughout our beloved Silverburn. That’s right, the closure notices for the stores at the old end of the centre were composed by yours truly—and my gelatinous genius of a companion, Gloopy, of course! Now, you might be wondering, why didn’t the stores whip up their own swan songs? Well, darlings, during times of transition, it’s important to unify the message and speak to every heart that beats for Silverburn. Who better to thread this needle than the shopping centre’s own stars? Crafting each closure message was no small feat. I wanted to capture the soul of every store, mix it with a dash of hope for the future and a sprinkle of Silverburn magic. From Gala Bingo’s cosmic farewell to Farmfoods’ final call, every word was dipped in respect and reverence for the legacy left behind. Why speak through stores, you ask? To give a voice to the inanimate, to spark that human connection we all cherish—a connection that extends beyond transactions and into the realm of shared memories. And yes, with a dollop of our signature silliness, too. For Farmfoods’ address, not only did I script the words, but we pulled strings to have the CEO voice them—how’s that for gravitas? Yet amidst the gravity, we laid a bed of music beneath the spoken notice. A composed symphony to elevate the message beyond mere words, echoing our sentiment across the shopping halls. Oh, and before you picture Gloopy and me hunched over a desk with a quill and ink… pause that thought! We took a more modern approach, collaborating with the brilliant minds at Silverburn to blend our blobby perspectives with their savvy insights. As we mixed nostalgia with novelty, our goal was clear: to set the stage for what’s next while honouring where we’ve been—a delicate balance, like walking on a beam of moonlight, wouldn’t you agree? So, as we look ahead to the expansion and all the shiny new adventures that await, let’s not forget to cast a smile back at the memories we shared. The echoes of laughter in the bingo hall, the taste of your favourite blue Lagoon dish, the warmth of a freshly baked Greggs pastry—cherish these moments, for they are the foundation upon which we build our tomorrow. Remember, change can be a mixture of sweet and sour, but with a little bit of glitter, even goodbyes can sparkle. Until next time, keep shining and shopping, Glitter.

Each had its own character, ya know? 🛍️🧐 User3 (BargainBinBob): It's a sign of the times. With more online shopping, brick-and-mortar stores are feeling the pinch.

The script includes event listeners for both the virtual and physical keyboard inputs. Please note that, for security reasons, changing the location of the page (to load another webpage) through the input of words is not typically recommended as it can lead to security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior. Adjustments need to be made according to your security policies.

Please note that a \`contenteditable\` div is used rather than a \`textarea\` or \`input\` to properly handle the \`Tab\` key in this simple example. Keep in mind that this is a basic implementation and lacks more sophisticated features like handling the CapsLock or Shift key to toggle letter case, managing cursor position, or implementing additional input logic.

The petition is wildly successful, getting support from Judy Hopps, Nick Wilde, Chief Bogo, Benjamin Clawhauser, and loads more...so it is declared by Lionheart, the citywide anthem of Zootopia will be \\"Try Everything\\"...or at least, it would be, if a small white dog (the Annoying Dog from Undertale) didn't come into Lionheart's office and somehow manage to convince him to make \\"Dogsong\\" from Undertale the city anthem instead, causing Gazelle and her supporters' collective jaws to drop in bafflement","output":"In the bustling metropolis of Zootopia, music was as much a part of the city's fabric as hustle and bustle of its diverse inhabitants. Every street corner had its own melody, every district its own beat. But there was one pop star who had captured the hearts of every mammal in the city – Gazelle, whose anthemic hit \\"Try Everything\\" was practically the unofficial soundtrack to their lives. One sunny afternoon, as Gazelle sashayed her way down the sidewalk, a light bulb illuminated above her elegant horns. \\"Why isn't 'Try Everything' the official city anthem of Zootopia?\\" she mused, her hooves clicking rhythmically on the concrete. It was, after all, a song that perfectly captured the spirit of the city – perseverance, bravery, and the willingness to embrace mistakes as part of life's journey. With a determined tilt to her chin, Gazelle launched her most ambitious project yet – a petition to have none other than Mayor Leodore Lionheart declare \\"Try Everything\\" as the city's official anthem. The support was overwhelming. From the high-flying eagles to the burrowing moles, every Zootopian loved the idea. Judy Hopps hopped on board with the enthusiasm of a thousand bunnies; Nick Wilde lent his sly support and charm to the cause; even the usually stoic Chief Bogo found himself secretly humming the tune while doing paperwork. Desk Sergeant Benjamin Clawhauser was perhaps the most ardent supporter of all, covering the precinct with \\"Try Everything\\" posters, offering donuts to anyone who signed the petition, which was, of course, everyone. The citizens of Zootopia united in an unprecedented way, dreaming of the day when their aspirations would be echoed in their anthem. Finally, the day arrived when Mayor Lionheart, amid much pomp, fanfare, and an audience that spanned species and districts, was to declare the new city anthem. Gazelle stood next to him on the balcony, her heart thumping a rhythm just shy of her famous song's tempo. \\"And it is with great pride—\\" Lionheart had begun, but right at that moment, a small, unassuming white dog sauntered into his office. The room fell silent as the dog, known only as the Annoying Dog from a place beyond Zootopia's borders, looked up at the mayor with eyes filled with inexplicable wisdom and depth. The Annoying Dog neither barked nor wagged its tail. It simply stared. And somehow, through the power of its gaze or through some enigmatic canine magic, it communicated a message to Lionheart that no one else could hear. Moments later, after jotting down a quick note while his audience watched in bewildered silence, Mayor Lionheart cleared his throat. \\"Ahem. By the power vested in me, I hereby declare the citywide anthem of Zootopia to be—\\" There was a dramatic pause, during which Gazelle's anticipation reached a fever pitch. \\"—'Dogsong' from—uh, Undertale, was it?\\" A collective jaw-drop resonated throughout the crowd. Gazelle's glamorously made-up eyes widened in shock, and she nearly stumbled over her own hooves. The audience erupted in confusion, a cacophony of different species asking, \\"What's Undertale?\\" and \\"What on earth is the 'Dogsong'?\\" As for Clawhauser, he tried to lighten the mood with an off-key rendition of this mysterious \\"Dogsong,\\" but it just wasn't the same. Bewildered whispers whirled among the throngs of Zootopians. Was this a joke? Some sort of political statement? Surely the mayor wasn't serious. But Lionheart, under the eldritch influence of the Annoying Dog, maintained a straight face, insisting this was the new direction for Zootopian unity. Gazelle stood, resigned yet graceful, as she shook her head with an amused smile. \\"Well, Zootopia,\\" she laughed, turning to address the crowd, \\"it looks like we have a new tune to try everything to learn!\\" Amid the chaos, the Annoying Dog trotted out as enigmatically as it had arrived, leaving Zootopians everywhere to wonder whether they'd just been bamboozled by the most powerful creature in the city – a tiny, unassuming white dog with the power to change anthems with nothing but a stare."},{"instruction":"Arma un texto con esta información https://www.rieles.com/front/buenos-aires-se-definen-las-autoridades-de-trenes-argentinos-operaciones/","output":"Recientemente en Buenos Aires, el proceso para designar a las nuevas autoridades de Trenes Argentinos Operaciones ha comenzado a ganar impulso.

The molecular weight affects various factors, including the polymer's strength, elasticity, degradation rate, and biocompatibility, which are crucial for its performance in these applications. 1. Mechanical strength: As the molecular weight of a polymer increases, the strength of the material generally improves. This is because higher molecular weight polymers have longer chains, which can form more entanglements and stronger intermolecular interactions. This results in a more robust and durable material, which is essential for load-bearing applications such as tissue engineering scaffolds. 2. Elasticity: The molecular weight of a polymer also affects its elasticity or ability to deform and return to its original shape. Higher molecular weight polymers typically exhibit greater elasticity due to the increased chain entanglements and interactions. This property is crucial for applications like tissue engineering scaffolds, where the material must be able to withstand repeated deformation and stress without breaking. 3. Degradation rate: The molecular weight of a polymer influences its degradation rate, which is an essential factor for biomedical applications. Polymers with higher molecular weights generally degrade more slowly because their longer chains take more time to break down. This can be advantageous for applications like drug delivery devices, where a controlled release of the drug is desired. However, in tissue engineering scaffolds, a faster degradation rate may be preferred to allow the scaffold to be replaced by the growing tissue. 4. Biocompatibility: The molecular weight of a polymer can affect its biocompatibility, or how well it interacts with biological systems without causing adverse effects. Polymers with higher molecular weights may be more biocompatible because they are less likely to leach out low molecular weight components that could cause inflammation or other negative reactions. This is particularly important for applications like drug delivery devices and tissue engineering scaffolds, where the material must be in direct contact with cells and tissues. In summary, the molecular weight of a polymer significantly impacts its mechanical properties and suitability for use in biomedical applications.

Cross-linking refers to the formation of covalent bonds or physical interactions between polymer chains, creating a network structure. The cross-linking density is defined as the number of cross-links per unit volume or mass of the polymer. The mechanical properties of polymeric materials, such as tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, elongation at break, and toughness, are affected by the cross-linking density in the following ways: 1. Tensile strength and modulus of elasticity: As the cross-linking density increases, the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of the polymer generally increase. This is because the cross-links restrict the movement of polymer chains, making the material more resistant to deformation and stress. In biomedical applications, this can be beneficial for load-bearing materials, such as orthopedic implants and dental materials. 2. Elongation at break: With an increase in cross-linking density, the elongation at break (the ability of a material to stretch before breaking) typically decreases. This is due to the reduced mobility of the polymer chains, which makes the material more brittle and less flexible. In some biomedical applications, such as soft tissue engineering, a lower cross-linking density may be preferred to achieve a more flexible and elastic material. 3. Toughness: The toughness of a polymeric material, which is its ability to absorb energy and resist fracture, is also influenced by the cross-linking density. A moderate cross-linking density can improve the toughness of the material, as it provides a balance between strength and flexibility. However, if the cross-linking density is too high, the material may become too brittle and prone to fracture. 4. Swelling and degradation: In biomedical applications, the cross-linking density can also affect the swelling behavior and degradation rate of polymeric materials. A higher cross-linking density generally leads to lower swelling and slower degradation, as the cross-links limit the penetration of water and other molecules into the polymer network. This can be important for controlling the release of drugs from polymeric carriers or the degradation of biodegradable implants. In summary, the cross-linking density of polymeric materials has a significant impact on their mechanical properties, which can be tailored to suit specific biomedical applications. A balance between strength, flexibility, and toughness is often desired, and the cross-linking density can be adjusted to achieve the desired properties."},{"instruction":"w does the addition of a specific type of polymer to a medical implant affect its mechanical properties and overall performance in the body?","output":"The addition of a specific type of polymer to a medical implant can significantly affect its mechanical properties and overall performance in the body.

Reduced solubility and swelling: Crosslinking can significantly reduce the solubility and swelling of polymeric materials in water or other solvents. This is particularly important for drug delivery systems and tissue engineering scaffolds, where controlled degradation and minimal swelling are often desired to maintain the desired release profile and structural integrity. 4. Modulated degradation rate: Crosslinking can influence the degradation rate of polymeric materials. In general, an increase in crosslinking density leads to a slower degradation rate due to the increased resistance to hydrolytic or enzymatic cleavage of the polymer chains. This can be advantageous for applications where a slower degradation rate is desired, such as long-term drug delivery systems or implants. However, in some cases, a faster degradation rate may be preferred, such as in temporary tissue engineering scaffolds, and the crosslinking density should be carefully controlled to achieve the desired degradation profile. 5. Altered stress relaxation and creep behavior: Crosslinking can affect the stress relaxation and creep behavior of polymeric materials. Crosslinked polymers typically exhibit lower stress relaxation and creep rates due to the restricted movement of polymer chains within the network structure.

This process can significantly affect the critical temperature (Tc) and critical magnetic field (Hc) of the superconducting material. 1. Critical temperature (Tc): The critical temperature is the temperature below which a material becomes superconducting, meaning it exhibits zero electrical resistance. Doping can either increase or decrease the critical temperature, depending on the type and concentration of the dopant. - In some cases, doping can increase the Tc by enhancing the electron-phonon coupling, which is responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs (the paired electrons responsible for superconductivity). For example, in high-temperature superconductors like YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO), doping with elements like Pr or Nd can increase the Tc. - In other cases, doping can decrease the Tc by introducing disorder into the crystal lattice, which can disrupt the formation of Cooper pairs. For example, in conventional superconductors like NbTi, doping with non-superconducting elements like Ta or Zr can decrease the Tc. 2. Critical magnetic field (Hc): The critical magnetic field is the maximum external magnetic field that a superconducting material can withstand before losing its superconducting state. Doping can also affect the critical magnetic field of a superconductor. - In some cases, doping can increase the Hc by increasing the number of pinning centers, which are defects in the crystal lattice that can trap and immobilize magnetic vortices. This prevents the vortices from moving through the material and destroying the superconducting state. For example, in type-II superconductors like NbTi, doping with non-superconducting elements like Ta or Zr can increase the Hc by introducing more pinning centers. - In other cases, doping can decrease the Hc by reducing the coherence length, which is a measure of the size of the Cooper pairs. A smaller coherence length makes the superconducting state more susceptible to being destroyed by external magnetic fields. For example, in high-temperature superconductors like YBCO, doping with elements like Pr or Nd can decrease the Hc by reducing the coherence length.

The microstructure refers to the arrangement of the atoms, grain size, grain boundaries, and defects within the material. These factors can significantly influence the superconducting properties. 1. Grain size and grain boundaries: In polycrystalline superconducting materials, the grain size and grain boundaries can affect the flow of supercurrent. Smaller grain size results in a higher number of grain boundaries, which can act as weak links and limit the supercurrent flow. This can lead to a decrease in the critical current density.

Vortices are formed when an external magnetic field penetrates the superconducting material, and their movement can lead to energy dissipation and loss of superconductivity. Pinning centers help to immobilize these vortices, thus enhancing the critical current density. However, a high concentration of defects and impurities can also lead to a decrease in the critical temperature due to the disruption of the superconducting electron pairs (Cooper pairs). 3.

Material selection: Choosing materials with high Tc and Hc values is essential for applications like MRI machines and power transmission. High-temperature superconductors, such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (BSCCO), are promising candidates due to their ability to operate at higher temperatures and withstand higher magnetic fields. 2. Material processing: Optimizing the synthesis and processing techniques of superconducting materials can help improve their Tc and Hc. This may involve controlling the stoichiometry, crystal structure, and microstructure of the material. 3. Flux pinning: Introducing artificial pinning centers in superconducting materials can help improve their Hc. This can be achieved by adding nanoparticles, columnar defects, or other types of inclusions that can effectively trap magnetic flux lines and prevent their motion. 4. Cooling systems: For practical applications, efficient cooling systems are necessary to maintain the superconducting material below its Tc. This can be achieved using cryogenic systems like liquid helium or liquid nitrogen, or by employing cryocoolers that can provide continuous cooling. By optimizing these factors, superconducting materials can be tailored for specific applications, enabling the development of more efficient MRI machines, power transmission lines, and other technologies that rely on superconductivity."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},B={key:0,class:"empty-state"},U=["disabled"],P={key:0},q={key:1};function F(n,e,c,p,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",j,[(i(!0),a(w,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(i(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",B,' No results found for "'+h(o.searchQuery)+'".
