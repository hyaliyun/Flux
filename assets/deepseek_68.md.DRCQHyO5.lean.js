John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers. How did Jan Hus die?","output":"Jan Hus died because he was burned at the stake. This happened in 1415 after people said he was a heretic, which means he had beliefs that were different from what the church taught. They made this decision at a big meeting called the Council of Constance."},{"instruction":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Collectivism. Yes or no? Answer: Collectivists often focus on community, society, nation or country. Question: what society is collectivist Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. Collectivist societies often focus on community, society, nation, or country. Collectivism emphasizes the importance of the collective over individual interests and prioritizes the needs and goals of the group over personal pursuits. Numerous societies around the world exhibit collectivist traits, and these can be found in various cultural, political, and historical contexts. In general, collectivist societies are characterized by strong family and social ties, group decision-making, shared responsibility, and emphasis on harmony and cooperation. Some examples of societies with collectivist tendencies include: 1. East Asian cultures such as China, Japan, and South Korea — In these cultures, Confucianism and other traditional values emphasize the importance of family, respect for authority, and maintaining harmony within the group. 2. Native American tribes — Many Native American tribes, like the Iroquois Nation, emphasize collective decision-making and the importance of the tribe's welfare over personal gains. 3. African cultures — In various African societies, the Ubuntu philosophy embodies the idea that an individual's well-being is interconnected with the well-being of the community. 4. Middle Eastern cultures — Family and social connections are extremely important in Middle Eastern societies, and loyalty to one's family and tribe can supersede personal interests. 5. Scandinavian countries — Countries like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark exhibit collectivist traits, particularly in their social welfare systems and focus on collective security and prosperity. 6. Former and current socialist/communist countries — Countries like the Soviet Union, Cuba, and North Korea have implemented collectivist ideologies in their political and economic systems, emphasizing state control and communal ownership over individual property rights. It is important to note that no culture or society is entirely collectivist or individualist. Most societies contain elements of both, and these attributes can coexist and change over time."},{"instruction":"News article: Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

In a typical home, the lighting circuit is designed to distribute electrical power to various light fixtures and switches that control the illumination of rooms, hallways, and outdoor spaces. When this circuit is functioning as intended, electrical current flows safely and efficiently through the wires, enabling the lighting system to perform its intended purpose. Let's examine this example in greater detail to understand the components and operation of a properly working electrical circuit. The household lighting circuit begins with the primary power supply, which in most residential settings is provided by the local utility company. This incoming power is typically at a standard voltage of 120 volts in the United States and 230 volts in many other countries. The electricity passes through the main electrical panel, which houses a variety of circuit breakers or fuses designed to protect the wiring system from overloads and short circuits. From the main panel, the electrical current is routed to individual branch circuits dedicated to the lighting system. These circuits are composed of various components, including wires, switches, junction boxes, and light fixtures. The conductor wires in a circuit have a specific color code, which helps to identify their function. Typically, the black or red wires are \\"hot,\\" meaning they carry power from the panel to the fixtures, while the white or grey wires are \\"neutral,\\" which complete the loop and return current back to the panel. The green or bare copper wires are called \\"ground\\" wires, which provide a safety path for any imbalanced electrical current. Under normal conditions, no current flows through the ground wire. As the electrical current reaches the light switch, it will either pass through the switch when it's in the \\"on\\" position, or stop when it's in the \\"off\\" position. When the switch is turned on, the electrical current flows through the circuit towards the light fixture. The current arrives at the fixture and passes through the light bulb or other lighting element, where its energy is converted to visible radiation, or light. Once the current has completed its journey through the bulb, it flows back through the neutral wires, eventually returning to the main panel and the utility's electrical grid. The successful operation of the lighting circuit depends on the correct and safe flow of electrical current through all components, the proper functioning of the switches and light fixtures, and the correct rating of circuit breakers or fuses designed to protect the wires from overloads. Proper grounding also plays a vital role in protecting the circuitry, associated devices, and users from potential electrical hazards caused by faults or short circuits. In conclusion, an example of an electrical circuit running properly would be an efficiently functioning household lighting system. The circuit supplies power to the light fixtures and switches, facilitating controlled illumination of various spaces, while also ensuring the safe and reliable distribution of electrical current throughout the entire system. In such a well-designed and correctly operating circuit, the electrical current runs smoothly through the wires and components, resulting in a safe and efficient lighting system."},{"instruction":"Practical guidelines for performing alcohol interventions in trauma centers. Does it follow that \\"There are no interventions for alcohol at the trauma center. \\"?","output":"No, this statement is incorrect. There are practical guidelines for performing alcohol interventions in trauma centers, indicating that such interventions do exist. Here is a step-by-step approach to performing alcohol interventions in trauma centers. The steps are taken based on medical best practices and common approaches for effective intervention: 1. Identification and assessment: The first step is identifying patients who may have an alcohol problem. Screening tools like the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) or the CAGE questionnaire can help assess and identify individuals with potential alcohol use disorders or risky drinking habits. 2. Physician involvement: Once patients are identified, the involvement of the attending physician or a trained professional like a clinical nurse specialist or a social worker is vital to initiate the intervention process. They can discuss and evaluate the patients' alcohol consumption in the context of their trauma. 3. Motivational interviewing: Practitioners should adapt a non-confrontational and empathetic approach, such as motivational interviewing, to facilitate communication with patients. This helps patients understand the link between their alcohol consumption and trauma, enabling them to recognize the need to change their drinking behavior. 4. Brief intervention: A brief intervention should be provided after the assessment. It may consist of a short conversation about the risks of alcohol use and trauma, as well as discussing possible strategies to reduce or stop drinking. 5. Referral to treatment: If the patient is willing and requires further assistance, a referral to specialized treatment services such as outpatient therapy or addiction treatment programs can be made. It is essential to tailor the recommendation to fit the patients' individual needs and preferences. 6. Follow-up: Aftercare and follow-up are crucial elements in alcohol interventions. Continuity of care and regular check-ins can help ensure that a patient successfully adheres to their proposed change in alcohol use, thus minimizing the likelihood of future alcohol-related trauma. In conclusion, alcohol interventions do exist in trauma centers and following these practical guidelines can help healthcare professionals address the needs of patients with alcohol use disorders or risky drinking habits to prevent the recurrence of future trauma."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Two brothers were born 20 years apart. Tom, the older brother, was 72, while Dan was 52 years-old. they got along pretty well. Which brother had a decline in strength? A:","output":"A: Both brothers, Tom and Dan, likely experienced a decline in strength as they aged. This is a natural part of the aging process, where muscle mass and overall physical capabilities decrease over time. However, since Tom is older at 72 years compared to Dan who is 52 years old, it can be reasonably assumed that Tom experienced a more significant decline in strength due to the additional 20 years of age. Aging-related declines in strength and other physical aspects generally become more pronounced as one gets older."},{"instruction":"Article: Reflections generally affect polarization. For radio waves, one important reflector is the ionosphere which can change the wave's polarization. Thus for signals received following reflection by the ionosphere (a skywave), a consistent polarization cannot be expected. For line-of-sight communications or ground wave propagation, horizontally or vertically polarized transmissions generally remain in about the same polarization state at the receiving location. Matching the receiving antenna's polarization to that of the transmitter can make a very substantial difference in received signal strength. Question: What reflector can change the waves polarization?","output":"The reflector that can change the wave's polarization, according to the given article, is the ionosphere. The ionosphere, a layer of the Earth's atmosphere filled with ions and free electrons, has significant effects on radio wave propagation. One of these effects is the ability to change the polarization of waves. This means that it alters the plane in which the electric field of the radio wave vibrates. This reflection-induced change in polarization is a critical consideration for radio signals that depend on ionospheric reflection, also known as skywave propagation. Such signals cannot retain a consistent polarization after their reflection off the ionosphere because the ionosphere's electron density varies both temporally and spatially, leading to these inconsistent polarization effects. Thus, the wave's polarization that was initially set when the wave was transmitted may not be the same when the wave reaches its receiving point after bouncing off the ionosphere. In contrast, for the line-of-sight communication or ground wave propagation where direct paths are involved, the original polarization of transmitted waves - whether horizontal or vertical - is generally maintained at the receiving location. This is due to the lack of reflection surfaces that could potentially alter the wave's polarization status. Polarization is a significant parameter in antenna design and signal propagation, as the matching of the receiving antenna's polarization to that of the transmitter's can make a tremendous difference in received signal strength. Therefore, understanding the behaviour of polarization upon reflection, particularly from the ionosphere for radio signals, is significant in the field of telecommunications and radio signal propagation."},{"instruction":"Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. suppose there is less pollution happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of having less pollution causing less or smaller eruptions can be analyzed by breaking down the volcanic eruption process and evaluating the possible impact of pollution reduction. First, let's break down the volcanic eruption process into steps, as described in the given information: 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the Earth. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface. 3. The magma cools. 4. With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly. 5. The resulting volcano may explode. Now, let's discuss the potential effects of less pollution on each of these steps. For step 1, gases causing pressure beneath the Earth are primarily derived from natural geological processes, such as the release of water vapor and other volcanic gases from the Earth's mantle. The reduction in pollution levels would not have a direct impact on this process. Similarly, step 2, where gases push molten magma to the surface, is also governed by geological processes. The amount of atmospheric pollution does not directly affect the geological factors causing the movement of magma. Step 3, the cooling of magma, might be affected by the temperature of the atmosphere. If pollution reduction leads to a decrease in overall atmospheric temperature, magma may cool more rapidly. However, this effect is likely to be minimal, as the cooling process of magma is primarily influenced by the contact with solid rock and groundwater, rather than the atmospheric temperature. For step 4, the buildup of pressure over time would not be significantly impacted by pollution levels. This pressure buildup is the result of a combination of geological processes and the accumulation of volcanic gases and magma within the Earth's crust. Finally, step 5, where the volcano may explode, is determined by the factors discussed in the previous steps, as well as any weakening in the Earth's crust, which allows the pressurized gases and magma to escape. A reduction in pollution levels could influence the overall distribution of air pressure and weather patterns, which may have some effect on the mechanical forces acting on the Earth's crust. However, the effect of pollution on the likelihood of a volcanic eruption would likely be minor compared to the natural geological factors driving the process. In conclusion, a reduction in pollution levels would not have a direct impact on any of the steps in the volcanic eruption process described above. However, it might have some indirect effects on steps 3 and 5, although these influences would likely be minor compared to the predominant geological factors at play. Thus, the supposed perturbation can be classified as \\"indirectly impacting a step of the process,\\" with the caveat that the impact would likely be minimal, and natural geological factors would remain the primary drivers of volcanic eruptions."},{"instruction":"Mihalascu, sözlerine şöyle devam etti: \\"Aslında tüm proje iki hüküm etrafında döndü: yasadışı varlıklar ve üst düzey yetkililerin dokunulmazlığı.

But as soon as he's able, a special team of interrogators from the FBI, the CIA, and the Pentagon will grill him without reading him his Miranda rights. Authorities plan to invoke a rare \\"public safety exception\\" that allows them to question the 19-year-old without his lawyer present and without giving him the right to remain silent. The point is to find out whether other explosives or accomplices are still out there, and NBC News figures that he can be questioned without legal counsel for maybe 48 hours. It's still way too early to determine whether Tsarnaev will be tried in military or civilian court. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham issued a statement arguing that Tsarnaev should be held as an enemy combatant under the \\"law of war\\" and thus not entitled to the usual legal rights. That would result in a military commission, but NBC says the White House is determined to make this a civilian trial. CNN quotes Harvard's Alan Dershowitz as skeptical of the senators' approach. \\"There's no way an American citizen committing a domestic crime in the city of Boston could be tried as an enemy combatant,\\" he said. \\"It could never happen.

Usually, when someone is in trouble like Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, they have special rights like having a lawyer to help them and not needing to answer questions. But in this case, the people asking questions don't have to give him those rights because we all want to make sure everyone is safe. This may last for about 48 hours or two whole days.

Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed. Why does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene. When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals and pour thick flour over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \\"snow\\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \\"snow\\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair! These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \\"everyday\\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. Question: Most modern studios _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"use computers for everyday sounds\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"use computers for everyday sounds.\\" Most modern studios have adopted the use of computers and technology to create everyday sounds, making the process more efficient and less time-consuming for Foley artists. This allows them to focus on creating unique and more complex sound effects required for films."},{"instruction":"Stream of consciousness rationale: Speed should not be an ulternative when you are running late. Speed may result in accident. The question and answer pair are described below.","output":"Question: Why shouldn't we speed when running late? Answer: Speeding when running late may be tempting, but it presents a significant risk not only to the individual driver, but also to other road users and even pedestrians. There are several reasons why speeding should not be an option when running late: 1. Increased risk of accidents: Driving at excessive speeds reduces a driver's reaction time, making it difficult to respond appropriately to changes in road conditions, traffic signals, or other unexpected events. This may lead to a higher likelihood of collisions and accidents. 2. Severity of accidents: The faster a vehicle is traveling at the time of a crash, the more severe the accident is likely to be. Higher speeds often result in a greater impact force during a collision, which can lead to more severe injuries or fatalities. 3. Legal consequences: Speeding is against the law, and if caught, drivers may face fines, license suspension, or even imprisonment, depending on the jurisdiction and the severity of the offense. 4. Increased fuel consumption: Speeding can result in higher fuel consumption, leading to increased costs and negative environmental impacts. 5. Stress and anxiety: Driving at excessive speeds can heighten stress and anxiety levels, impairing decision-making and potentially exacerbating the risk of accidents. 6. Disregard for other road users: Speeding demonstrates a lack of consideration and respect for other road users, potentially putting their lives at risk. To minimize the potential dangers associated with speeding, it is crucial to plan ahead, allowing ample time for travel and being prepared to accept the consequences of being late if unforeseen circumstances arise. Prioritizing safety over punctuality will help to reduce the risk of accidents and create a safer environment for all road users."},{"instruction":"Come up with a question and reasoning that would justify this answer: it is not possible to tell","output":"Question: Is it possible to determine the exact number of grains of sand on Earth?

Additionally, the definition of what constitutes a \\"grain of sand\\" could vary depending on size and shape, making it difficult to universally measure.

Translate this to English?","output":"Now is the time to join Presidents Obama and Medvedev in implementing disarmament. This statement expresses a viewpoint that demonstrates the need for collaboration between nations, particularly the United States and Russia, in the area of disarmament. The mention of Presidents Obama and Medvedev reflects the time when both leaders played an essential role in furthering the dialogue around reducing their countries' nuclear stockpiles and promoting global security. During the period when Barack Obama served as the President of the United States (2009-2017) and Dmitry Medvedev as the President of Russia (2008-2012), both leaders had emphasized the significance of disarmament initiatives. Under their leadership, the two nations signed the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) in 2010, which aimed to further reduce strategic arms in both the United States and Russia. The New START treaty has been a crucial step towards promoting a more secure and peaceful international environment. It has limited the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and implemented verification mechanisms that have been mutually beneficial for both countries. Additionally, this treaty has contributed to a more transparent and predictable relationship between the United States and Russia, enhancing trust and cooperation in global nuclear disarmament efforts. Disarmament is an essential component of global security, as it seeks to reduce the number of weapons and threats posed by their existence. By joining Presidents Obama and Medvedev in implementing disarmament, nations can work together in achieving a more secure and stable international atmosphere. This action would involve collaboration, negotiation, and a shared responsibility for the establishment and maintenance of a peaceful world. Cooperation between nations in the area of disarmament can positively impact the overall progress towards global nuclear disarmament by reinforcing international norms and strengthening existing treaties and frameworks. This joint effort can also potentially lead to further strides in other areas of global security, such as preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials to states and non-state actors, and responding to emerging security threats such as cyber warfare and terrorism. In conclusion, the statement stresses the importance of joining forces with Presidents Obama and Medvedev in implementing disarmament as a means of promoting international peace, stability, and security. The collaboration between nations, particularly between the United States and Russia, demonstrates a commitment to fostering a safer global environment, reducing the threats posed by nuclear weapons, and contributing to a more secure and peaceful future for all."},{"instruction":"the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has coordinated relief operations with local authorities and agencies to meet needs of families in landslides - hit pakistani-controlled kashmir , an iom statement said friday .

Assuming the election was already lost to sitting vice-president Brian Lewis, the party decided to pick a likable but unwinnable minority candidate to improve their chances in the next presidential election.

I felt the frustration building. \\"That's it!\\" I finally said. \\"I just want to get home!\\" That's when I saw a group of soldiers coming down the ramp from one of the gates. I thought of Joe. They're coming back from a war, I reminded myself, while I'm coming back from vacation. What right do I have to be frustrated? Maybe the troops were God's way of reminding me to trust in his time. Bob grabbed my arm. \\"Look at those soldiers coming down the ramp.\\" \\"I see them,\\" I said. Bob persisted, \\"Do you see who's in front?\\" Suddenly, all those delays across all those miles made perfect sense. I rushed toward my son Joe's open arms.

In order to become an affiliate and participate in affiliate marketing, you need to have a website with significant traffic. Many affiliate marketers start by creating content and posting affiliate links on their page. You'll have to make sure the website is yours and doesn't ban affiliate marketing by agreement with the hosting service. See how to make a website for more information. You will need to cultivate the ability to start new websites, buy domain names, host pages and make landing pages. These skills will become important as you begin CPA marketing. PPC advertising allows you to drive traffic to your site by placing ads on other, relevant websites. You pay the ad provider a small amount for each time a web user clicks through your ad to your website. You can learn how this works through YouTube videos, online tutorials or by trial and error. Set up an account in Google AdWords and Microsoft adCenter, and pay for some ads that drive traffic to your website, in order to practice while you learn. Pay-per-click advertising can get expensive quickly, especially in a keyword bidding war (when another website or websites also wants to advertise for the same keywords). You also run the risk of routinely paying for clicks that don't lead to sales for you. Always analyze these risk before getting started in PPC. The best way to become a CPA marketer is to learn how to drive traffic to websites. The following are ways that people learn to drive traffic. Practice creating and promoting fan pages and groups on Facebook. If you know how to get \\"likes,\\" then you are on your way to driving traffic to a lead landing page. This usually takes a passion for staying in touch with followers and trying new creative social media strategies. Practice creating videos and YouTube channels. If you are an expert in a field or you can call on other people to create creative or instructive videos, this content grabs attention. Once you have traffic, you can post links to landing pages where you can gather lead information. Learn how to make and buy Internet ads. If you have graphic design skills and you don't want to create content on a blog or YouTube, then this may be the best option for you. You can find prime ad spaces, through services like BuySellAds, and purchase the ad space for a period of time. If the ad is targeted successfully, people will click on the link and type in their information, giving you leads. You will need to subtract the cost of the ad in order to figure out your return on investment. Become adept at using PPC advertising to get traffic to your landing page. Similar to buying ad space, you will need to bid on keywords in order to place the link to your landing page where you will get noticed. If you have a lot of experience with search engine advertising, this may be the best option for you. Use all of the methods you have learned to try to increase traffic to your website. You'll want to try to bring on a specific type of traffic that is marketable to CPA networks. This type of traffic, that you can turn into leads for your advertisers, is called \\"targeted traffic.\\" It involves targeting a certain need or type of person and offering what they need or or are looking for. You will not be able to gather leads if you don't know how to bring specific people to your website. For example, you might have a blog or website that reviews phone cases. You would want to target people searching for things like \\"best iPhone cases\\" or \\"durable phone cases.\\" Summary:","output":"This article talks about how to become a CPA marketer by making a website, creating content, learning skills like making ads and using PPC advertising, and trying different ways to bring people who want certain things to your website, so you can help advertisers find new customers."},{"instruction":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

He noticed that some organisms were showing inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case A. Then he noticed some other organisms didn't show any inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case B. He was astonished by the complicated interactions among organisms. and a hint : Ants form symbiotic associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines. Please answer this question : Would case A see greater or smaller opportunity for food sources than case B? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's first recap the information given: Case A: Organisms showing inquiline behavior Case B: Organisms not showing inquiline behavior Now, let's analyze the hint regarding ants and their symbiotic associations: 1. Ants form various symbiotic associations with other species, including inquilines. 2. Inquilines may bear close resemblance to ants and can access resources within the ant nests. 3. The nature of mimicry in inquilines varies, with some using it to reduce predation risk, and others exhibiting Wasmannian mimicry, which is specific to inquilines. Considering this information, we can make the following comparisons: In case A, organisms exhibit inquiline behavior and can gain access to the resources within ant nests, such as food and shelter. As a result, they would likely have more opportunities for food sources, as they can benefit from the resources within the nest. In case B, organisms do not show inquiline behavior and will rely on their own foraging and resource acquisition, without the added advantage of accessing ant nest resources. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that Case A, with organisms showing inquiline behavior, would see greater opportunities for food sources compared to Case B."},{"instruction":"Sentence: Abilene is part of Jones County in Texas, in the United States.

The audience was held spellbound as the film unfolded its artisty on the huge panoramic screen. Watching this superb print, shown the way Antonioni intended, made one aware that this is indeed a modern art work. It was all the more fitting that the series is housed in the Cleveland Insititue of Art in University Circle. Antonioni's compositions are created for the Cinemascope landscape. His beautiful balancing of images, striking use of colors, sweeping choreographic movements, all are the work of a genuine artist, using the screen as his canvas. At last the audience could understand \\"Zabriskie Point.\\" As its narrative unfolded, it became obvious that this work is not about story per se, but rather an artist's impressionistic rendering of fleeting images of his subject. The setting of some of the more turbulent activities of the sixties provides only a dramatic motor for the artist's sweeping collage. Antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards, and can pause at any point to creatively embroider an event with grandiose embellishments. The audience willingly went with the flow of his remarkable imagination, as his huge images on the massive canvas held one in rapt attention. While the audience may have been only tangentially involved in character relationships, it realized the theme here is human aleination, the director's recurring theme. It was also realized that no print any smaller or of lesser quality than this original one in Cinemascope can do justice to this particular rendering. The audience was therefore all the more appreciative of viewing \\"Zabriskie Point\\" in its original, breathtaking format, and broke into thunderous applause at the end. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as highly positive and appreciative.

How to argue with teachers Pick a teacher who likes to debate. Some teachers will be irritated by you questioning them, others will encourage such discussion. You could be sent to detention for arguing with the wrong teacher, or have a great class with the right one.","output":"Alright, little buddy, let me explain to you what happens next and how to argue with teachers. First, remember that we need to find a teacher who likes to talk and share ideas, not the ones who get upset easily. It's like picking your friends to play with, some friends like different games and some don't. Next, you need to follow some steps to argue with a teacher who likes to debate: 1. Listen carefully: Pay attention to what the teacher is saying. When they say something you want to discuss, think about it in your mind like when you try to solve puzzles. 2. Be respectful: You should respect your teachers, just like how you respect mommy, daddy, and your friends. When you talk to the teacher, use kind words and don't raise your voice. 3. Ask questions: If you don't understand something, ask your teacher questions to know more. Questions are like little keys that help you unlock more knowledge. 4. Share your thoughts: Tell the teacher what you think or feel about what they said. Imagine your thoughts as little pieces of a puzzle, and you're showing your teacher how they fit together. 5. Stay calm and be patient: Just like when you play a game, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. If the teacher doesn't agree with you, that's okay. Keep calm, listen, and learn from it. Remember, if you choose the right teacher and follow these steps, you can have great discussions and even become a better thinker and learner! But if you argue with a teacher who doesn't like to debate, you might end up in a place called detention, which is like a time-out to think about your actions.

Thus, when considering the hypothesis, \\"That is absolutely correct,\\" it aligns with the initial assertion made in the premise. Both phrases indicate a sense of agreement and affirmation regarding a particular statement or idea. However, it is important to consider that the premise provided is incomplete and lacks the full context of the statement it is connected to. As a result, it could potentially lead to different interpretations or conclusions depending on the nature of the conversation taking place, the statements being discussed, and the individuals involved in it. With this in mind, it is essential to acknowledge that in most cases, the hypothesis \\"That is absolutely correct\\" would likely be considered true, given that it mirrors the sentiment of agreement found within the premise. Nonetheless, without additional context or information, there could be certain specific scenarios where this may not be the case. For instance, if the second part of the premise and statement fundamentally contradict the first portion, it could potentially dispute the hypothesis' accuracy. In conclusion, based on the available information and the premise provided, it can be inferred that the hypothesis \\"That is absolutely correct\\" is generally true. However, lacking complete context and information might leave some room for potential discrepancies or alternative conclusions, so the certainty of the truth could not be definitively established.

She considers Darwin's notion of evolution, driven by competition, to be incomplete and claims that evolution is strongly based on co-operation, interaction, and mutual dependence among organisms. According to Margulis and Dorion Sagan, \\"Life did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking.\\"\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Darwin's notion of evolution is considered incomplete by Lynn Margulis mainly because it focuses primarily on competition as the driving force behind evolution. To develop a comprehensive answer, let's examine this step by step: Step 1: Understanding Darwin's notion of evolution Darwin's theory of evolution, known as natural selection, proposes that species evolve through a process of gradual change, driven by competition for resources and reproduction. Organisms that possess favorable traits are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their beneficial genes to the next generation. Step 2: Introducing Lynn Margulis's perspective Lynn Margulis, a biologist renowned for her work on endosymbiosis, argues that symbiosis – the close, long-term interaction between different species – is a major force that drives evolution. According to Margulis, evolution is not solely based on competition but also heavily influenced by cooperation, interaction, and mutual dependence among organisms. Step 3: Addressing the incompleteness of Darwin's notion Margulis believes that Darwin's notion is incomplete because it fails to consider the importance of cooperation and symbiosis as crucial factors in evolutionary processes. She maintains that life on Earth has thrived not just through competition but also through networking, with species forming mutually beneficial relationships that promote their survival, growth, and adaptation. Step 4: Summing up the answer In conclusion, Darwin's notion of evolution is considered incomplete by Lynn Margulis because it predominantly emphasizes competition as the driving force behind evolution. Margulis asserts that cooperation, interaction, and mutual dependence among organisms, as displayed through symbiotic relationships, play a critical role in the evolutionary process.

The question and answer pair are described below.","output":"Question: Where is the woman most likely? Answer: To determine where the woman is most likely, we need to consider the context and any additional information we have about her. Step 1: Identify the alternatives We have two alternatives: a) Out for a run b) At work Step 2: Analyze the context If we are aware of the time of day, weather conditions, and any information about her habits or schedule, that can help in estimating her location. Step 3: Compare alternatives based on the context a) If it's early morning or evening, and the weather conditions are suitable for a run, the likelihood of her being out for a run increases. Additionally, if she has a routine of running at specific times, it further supports this possibility. b) If it's during typical working hours, and we know she has a job that requires her to be present at her workplace, the likelihood of her being at work increases. If she has a flexible work schedule or works from home, it may decrease the chance of her being at work. Step 4: Conclude Based on the context and information available, we can determine the most likely location for the woman. If there's insufficient information, it would be challenging to make an accurate determination, in which case the user may need to provide more context or details for a well-founded answer."},{"instruction":"Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who stole diamonds from other gangsters? from the following article ? Gerald Clamson is a bank examiner who loves fishing on his annual two-week holiday. Unfortunately, one day at the ocean he reels in Syd Valentine (also played by Lewis), an injured gangster in a scuba diving suit. Syd tells Gerald about diamonds he has stolen from the other gangsters and hands him a map. Gerald escapes as frogmen from a yacht machine-gun the beach. They swim ashore, locate Syd and gun him down. Their leader Thor ensures Syd's demise by firing a torpedo from his yacht that goes ashore, blowing a crater into the beach. As the police ignore Gerald's story, Gerald heads to the Hilton Inn in San Diego where Syd claimed the diamonds were hidden. There he meets Suzie Cartwright, an airline stewardess. While searching for the diamonds, he needs to avoid the hotel staff after inadvertently hurting the manager. Gerald disguises himself as a character noticeably similar to Professor Julius Kelp from The Nutty Professor, while trying to stay one step ahead of the other gangsters who are on his tail, as well as the hotel detectives led by the manager—all the while courting Suzie. As each of the gangsters see Gerald, an identical lookalike to the deceased Syd, they have nervous breakdowns; one imagining himself a dog, one turning into a Larry Fine lookalike, the other (Charlie Callas, in his usual character) becoming a hopeless stutterer. The one man Gerald meets who believes him, and identifies himself as a FBI special agent, turns out to be an escapee from an insane asylum.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"Less oil. The accumulation of more sediments on the already existing layer of organic material and kerogen can affect the production of oil in various ways. The process of oil formation is complex, and it depends on a delicate balance of factors such as temperature, pressure, and time. A deeper understanding of these factors and how they interact can help explain why piling more sediments on top of the existing layers can result in less oil production. 1. Temperature: The transformation of kerogen into oil requires a specific temperature range. This is generally between 90°C and 150°C (194°F and 302°F). When more sediments accumulate on the organic layer, the increased pressure and insulation can cause the temperature to rise beyond this range. If the temperature exceeds the optimal range, it can cause the kerogen to turn into natural gas or remain trapped as a solid, resulting in less oil production. 2. Pressure: Increased pressure due to more sediments can also negatively impact oil formation. The ideal pressure range for oil generation is typically 1-2 kilobars. Too much pressure can cause the organic material to not break down into the desired oil molecules. Under extreme pressure, the solid kerogen may convert directly into natural gas or become trapped within the rock, leading to less oil production. 3. Time: The process of oil formation requires millions of years to complete. The gradual buildup of sediments on top of organic material acts as a driving force for the transformation of kerogen into oil. However, if more sediments accumulate too quickly, it can disrupt the natural balance of temperature and pressure, ultimately influencing the rate at which the kerogen turns into oil. A shorter duration under optimal conditions can lead to incomplete conversion of kerogen, resulting in less oil production. 4. Migration: Finally, the ability of oil to migrate from the source rock to reservoir rocks is critical for the accumulation of oil and natural gas reserves. When more sediments pile on top of the kerogen layer, it can limit the ability of the oil to migrate upwards through porous rock layers. This trapped oil may remain within the source rock, causing less oil to accumulate in reservoir rocks. In summary, when more sediments pile on top of existing kerogen layers, it may result in less oil by changing the temperature, pressure, and migration conditions necessary for optimum oil generation and accumulation. These changes can cause incomplete conversion of kerogen into oil or a tendency for the organic material to turn into natural gas or remain trapped within the rock. This perturbation can significantly affect the quantity of oil available for extraction and commercial use."},{"instruction":"A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. Two groups of scientists examined two fires. Group A put a large log on it, and group B made a fire with small twigs. They wanted to see which fire would last longer. Which group had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction? The answer to this question is:","output":"Group B had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction because the small twigs provided a greater surface area, causing them to burn more quickly than the large log used by Group A."},{"instruction":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"pokemon ss - After 30mins it just freezes and there are black boxes/pixels everywhere :( It WAS working just fine smh please fix this then i'll love you forever\\" Answer:","output":"Based on the content of the review, it is clear the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the performance of the product (in this case, Pokemon Sword or Shield).

The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors. - Confucianism, also known as Ruism, is described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life. Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551479 BCE), who considered himself a retransmitter of the values of the Zhou dynasty golden age of several centuries before. In the Han dynasty (206 BCE 220 CE), Confucian approaches edged out the \\"proto-Taoist\\" Huang-Lao, as the official ideology while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism. The disintegration of the Han political order in the second century CE opened the way for the doctrines of Buddhism and Neo-Taoism, which offered spiritual explanations lacking in Confucianism. - Chinese sovereign is the ruler of a particular period in ancient China. Several titles and naming schemes have been used throughout history. - An intellectual is a person who engages in critical thinking, research, and reflection about the reality of society, and proposes solutions for the normative problems of society, and thus he or she gains authority as a public intellectual. Coming from the world of culture, either as a creator or as a mediator, the intellectual participates in politics, either to defend a concrete proposition or to denounce an injustice, usually by producing or by extending an ideology, and by defending a system of values. - Sima Tan (c. 165 BC 110 BC) was an early Chinese historian who worked under the Western Han. He studied astronomy with Tang Du, the \\"I Ching\\" under Yang He, and Daoism under Master Huang. He held the position of Court Astrologer () between 140-110 BC. While Sima Tan had begun the \\"Records of the Grand Historian\\" (\\"Shiji\\"), he died before it was finished. It was left to his son, Sima Qian, to complete. The year of Sima Tan's death is the year of the great imperial sacrifice \\"fengshan\\" by Han Wudi, for which the emperor appointed the fangshi, leaving Sima behind and thus probably causing him much frustration. - Mohism or Moism (aka. Mohist School of Logic) was an ancient Chinese philosophy of logic, rational thought and science developed by the academic scholars who studied under the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi (c. 470 BCc. 391 BC). It evolved at about the same time as Confucianism, Taoism and Legalism, and was one of the four main philosophic schools from around 770221 BC (during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods). During that time, Mohism was seen as a major rival to Confucianism. The administrative thought of Mohism was absorbed by Chinese Legalism and its books were later merged into the Taoist canon, all but disappearing as an independent school of thought. - The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history following the Spring and Autumn period and concluding with the Qin wars of conquest that saw the annexation of all other contender states, which ultimately led to the Qin state's victory in 221 BC as the first unified Chinese empire known as the Qin dynasty. Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is generally the most often cited and popularly accepted one. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states. - Sima Qian (; c. 145 or 13586 BC), formerly romanized Ssu-ma Chien, was a Chinese historian of the Han dynasty. He is considered the father of Chinese historiography for his \\"Records of the Grand Historian\\", a \\"Jizhuanti\\"-style (history presented in a series of biographies) general history of China, covering more than two thousand years from the Yellow Emperor to his time, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, a work that had much influence for centuries afterwards on history-writing not only in China, but in Korea, Japan and Vietnam as well. Although he worked as the Court Astrologer (Chinese: ; \\"Tàish Lìng\\"), later generations refer to him as the Grand Historian (Chinese: ; Tàish Gng or tai-shih-kung) for his monumental work; a work which in later generations would often only be somewhat tacitly or glancingly acknowledged as an achievement only made possible by his acceptance and endurance of punitive actions against him, including imprisonment, castration, and subjection to servility. - Chinese philosophy originates in the Spring and Autumn period and Warring States period, during a period known as the \\"Hundred Schools of Thought\\", which was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments. Although much of Chinese philosophy begins in the Warring States period, elements of Chinese philosophy have existed for several thousand years; some can be found in the Yi Jing (the \\"Book of Changes\\"), an ancient compendium of divination, which dates back to at least 672 BCE. It was during the Warring States era that what Sima Tan termed the major philosophical schools of China, Confucianism, Legalism, and Daoism, arose, along with philosophies that later fell into obscurity, like Agriculturalism, Mohism, Chinese Naturalism, and the Logicians. - In politics, a figurehead is a person who holds \\"de jure\\" (in name or by law) an important title or office (often supremely powerful), yet \\"de facto\\" (in reality) executes little actual power. The metaphor derives from the carved figurehead at the prow of a sailing ship. Commonly cited figureheads include Queen Elizabeth II, who is Queen of sixteen Commonwealth realms and head of the Commonwealth, but has no power over the nations in which she is not head of state and does not exercise power in her own realms on her own initiative. Other figureheads are the Emperor of Japan, the King of Sweden, or presidents in majority of parliamentary republics, such as the President of India, President of Israel, President of Bangladesh, President of Greece, President of Germany, President of Pakistan (starting in 2010), and President of China (without CPC General Secretary and Chairman of CMC posts).

They wanted to grow bigger and become even more powerful. To do this, they needed to take over a city called Constantinople. Constantinople had big, strong walls all around it to keep it safe. These walls made it very hard for anyone to get inside the city. The people in the Ottoman Empire, led by their very smart leader, Sultan Mehmed II, had to come up with a way to break through those strong walls. They knew they needed something big and powerful to do it. One day, the Sultan heard about a man named Orban, who was very good at building big and powerful machines called cannons. Cannons were like giant metal tubes that could shoot huge, heavy balls really far and really fast. Sultan Mehmed II talked to Orban, and asked him to build a really really big cannon. Orban agreed, and he built the biggest cannon anyone had ever seen. It was so big that it took many strong men and horses just to move it! When the cannon was ready, the Ottoman Empire brought it to Constantinople and used it to try to break down the walls. They shot big, heavy balls at the walls over and over again. The people in Constantinople were scared, because they had never seen anything like it. With the help of this huge cannon, the Ottoman Empire was able to make holes in the strong walls of Constantinople. Eventually, they were able to break through and take over the city! So, the key factor in the Ottoman Empire taking over Constantinople was the giant cannon made by Orban. This weapon helped them break down the strong walls and win the battle. And this is how the city of Constantinople became part of the Ottoman Empire, which grew even bigger and more powerful."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

Chuck Hagel made the penultimate step toward becoming the next defense secretary Tuesday, with his nomination overcoming a procedural vote that it failed to get past two weeks ago. For all intents and purposes, that means Hagel will be confirmed shortly. But not for lack of trying by GOP senators, who invested plenty of time and political will in trying to upend the nomination of their former Republican colleague. So with the battle now all but over, it begs the question: Was it worth it? Former Nebraska senator Chuck Hagel. (Reuters) There are compelling cases to be made on both sides: Why it wasn’t worth it At the end of the day, any legislative maneuvering needs to be judged on whether it succeeded. And in this case, barring something out of left field before the final vote, Hagel will become the next defense secretary. In other words: The GOP lost. Republicans quite simply weren’t able to land that final knock-out blow that they were hoping for, and now they’ve got a guy they really don’t like headed for one of the top Cabinet posts in the Obama administration. In addition, by delaying Hagel’s nomination with a filibuster — something that had never been done to a defense secretary nominee (even if Republicans tried in vain to argue that it wasn’t actually a filibuster) — Republicans have set a precedent. If and when they return to the White House, Democrats now have a new weapon with which to hold up GOP Cabinet nominees, if they decide to use it. The reason senators are so reticent to alter their chamber’s rules is they know it will also apply when the majority/minority roles are reversed. That’s why we still have the filibuster, even though Democrats would love to legislate in the majority without it. And finally, Republicans failed to put up a totally united front against Hagel, with a couple senators supporting his nomination even before the filibuster, and several more voting with Democrats to override the filibuster. The administration can now credibly make the case that Hagel had bipartisan support — something Republicans would have liked to avoid. Why it was worth it Despite the unprecedented nature of the filibuster and the Democratic criticism of their effort against a decorated war hero, Republicans likely will pay no major political price for their tactics. This is for two reasons: 1) The American people quite simply weren’t all that interested. Even though the Hagel drama was big news in Washington, it was met by the American people with a collective yawn. Even as of last week, a Pew poll showed that half of Americans said they didn’t know enough about Hagel to rate him favorably or unfavorably. Despite the dicey electoral gambit to delay Hagel’s nomination, there has been little backlash against Republicans for doing it — at least as far as we can tell right now. And 2) Nobody is going to mourn much for Chuck Hagel. The fact is that this is a guy without a political home. He is a former Republican senator who alienated his own party with his vehement criticism of the Iraq war and also is seen as a political interloper who hasn’t built up a whole lot of good will with Democrats. His past criticisms of the “Jewish lobby” and a gay ambassador nominee, while not enough to derail his nomination, were enough to ensure that even his supporters weren’t all that enamored of him. And Republicans were able to bring his numbers down a little, with Pew showing his unfavorable rating rising from 18 percent in January to 28 percent last week (his favorable rating also rose slightly, from 18 percent to 22 percent, over that span). In the end, the Hagel nomination will amount to little more than an inside baseball political game. Republicans effectively registered their concerns and have, for the second time this year, either thwarted one of President Obama’s likely Cabinet picks (Susan Rice) or served notice that they won’t be steamrolled into supporting divisive nominees (Hagel). The battle isn’t over, and some Republicans are also making noise about holding up the nominations of Jack Lew for treasury secretary and John Brennan for CIA director. The Hagel situation suggests that, even though they may not succeed, there’s not a whole lot of downside to trying.","output":"The GOP's anti-Hagel crusade questions whether the Republican senators' time and political will was worth trying to upend the nomination of their former Republican colleague, Chuck Hagel, for defense secretary. There are arguments to be made on both sides as to whether it was worth it or not. On one hand, Hagel's nomination was not stopped, which means GOP lost, and by delaying the nomination with a filibuster, Republicans have set a precedent that could be used against them in the future. Furthermore, their failure to present a united front on the matter allowed the administration to claim Hagel had bipartisan support. On the other hand, Republicans likely won't face any significant political consequences for their tactics against Hagel's nomination. The American public wasn't fully engaged with the issue, and there seems to be little backlash against the GOP for their actions. Additionally, Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator with no firm political home, is not a widely popular figure. This nomination battle will not have a significant impact in the long run, but it did serve to show that Republicans won't be easily pushed into supporting divisive nominees."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to find the mean (average) of that list.

The answer is:","output":"(A) hedgehog The most sensical answer is the hedgehog because, generally, smaller animals can reach their top speed more quickly than larger animals. The reason behind this is that they have less mass to accelerate, allowing them to reach their maximum pace faster. Hedgehogs weigh less than beavers, so it's more likely that the hedgehog would be able to reach its top speed more quickly. However, it is essential to note that factors such as muscle strength, build, and individual differences among animals can also play a crucial role in determining acceleration and top speed."},{"instruction":"I met her who grows peaches. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To evaluate the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"I met her who grows peaches,\\" I will consider several factors including grammar, syntax, and clarity: 1. Grammar: The sentence contains a subject (\\"I\\"), a verb (\\"met\\"), and an indirect object (\\"her\\"), followed by a relative clause (\\"who grows peaches\\"). 2. Syntax: The word order, in this case, presents a slightly unusual structure. The relative clause (\\"who grows peaches\\") is placed after \\"her\\" instead of directly after a noun which it modifies. 3. Clarity: The sentence can be understood but seems slightly awkward due to the positioning of the relative clause. To improve the linguistic integrity of the sentence, I would revise it as follows: \\"I met the woman who grows peaches.\\" This revision addresses the issues with syntax and clarity by placing the relative clause directly after the noun it modifies and replacing \\"her\\" with the noun \\"woman,\\" making the sentence more natural and easier to understand."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question IBM has 12 research laboratories worldwide, bundled into IBM Research.

Article:","output":"Title: Duchess of Cambridge Discharged from Hospital, Returns to Kensington Palace for Rest The Duchess of Cambridge, formerly known as Kate Middleton, left the King Edward VII Hospital in London today in great spirits, accompanied by her husband, Prince William. The Duchess was admitted to the hospital to receive treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. After a three-night stay, Kate was seen smiling and stated that she's \\"feeling much better.\\" Hyperemesis gravidarum is a rare and severe form of morning sickness, affecting only around 1-2% of pregnant women. It can lead to extreme nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, posing risks to both mother and baby. In some cases, it can last throughout the entire pregnancy, but for many women, the symptoms tend to subside after the first trimester. Prince William offered his unwavering support as he accompanied his wife on her exit from the hospital. Despite the London hospital falling victim to a prank call earlier in the week, St. James's Palace issued a statement expressing the couple's gratitude to the hospital staff. The statement read, \\"The Duchess of Cambridge... will now head to Kensington Palace for a period of rest,\\" as reported by the Telegraph. With her immediate engagements canceled, experts predict that Kate's next public appearance may not be until Christmas Day. Nonetheless, the Duchess made a strong impression with her stylish and immaculate appearance upon leaving the hospital. Her neatly styled hair, impeccable clothing, and a bouquet of roses tastefully concealing her tummy all showcased her resilience and poise during this challenging time. Despite some signs of fatigue, such as her slightly puffy eyes, Kate remained radiant. In the coming months, it is reported that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will face considerable time apart due to Prince William's commitments at the RAF base in Wales. The prince's military duties often require him to be stationed away from home, making it difficult for the couple to be together during much of Kate's pregnancy.

Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career.

In this article, we will provide an overview of the situation, examine the consequences of the event, and outline the steps being taken in response. Incident Details The collision took place on a railway crossing, with a train coming into contact with a Land Rover that had somehow become stranded on the tracks. The exact circumstances remain unclear, but initial reports suggest that the vehicle had attempted to traverse the crossing when it became immobilized, effectively placing it in the path of the oncoming train. Luckily, no injuries were reported in the incident. Consequences and Disruption The force of the impact resulted in damage to both the train and the Land Rover. Passengers on board the train experienced a sudden, forceful jerk as the train came to an abrupt halt. Thankfully, emergency services were quick to respond to the scene and were able to assist the passengers safely disembarking the train. Rail services along the line were disrupted as the damage was assessed, and the removal of the wreckage commenced. Passengers traveling between Ely and Cambridge faced delays and cancellations, forcing many to seek alternative forms of transportation to reach their destinations. Investigation and Response An immediate investigation was launched by local authorities and railway operator to uncover the cause of the incident and determine whether any violations or failures contributed to the collision. Part of this investigation includes examining the state of the railway crossing equipment and signaling systems at the scene to ascertain whether they were functioning properly at the time of the incident. The authorities are also interviewing witnesses and reviewing available surveillance footage to reconstruct the events leading up to the collision. This information will be invaluable in determining whether any negligence or safety violations occurred on the part of the Land Rover driver, and if any measures can be implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future. Further, the railway operator, in coordination with local authorities, will be examining their own safety procedures to ensure that railway crossings remain secure and that appropriate warnings are provided to road users. This assessment may lead to improvements in railway crossing infrastructure and further safety investments. Conclusion While it is fortunate that no one was injured in this collision between a train and a Land Rover on the railway line between Ely and Cambridge, it serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers surrounding railway crossings. As the investigation continues, it is hoped that lessons can be learned and steps taken to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. The safety of passengers, motorists, and rail staff is of paramount importance, and all parties involved must work together to minimize risk and enhance safety protocols on our railways."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast. - School of Paris refers to a group of French and non-French artists who worked in Paris before World War I, and also to a group of French and non-French artists who lived in Paris between the two world wars and beyond. - Georges-Pierre Seurat (2 December 1859 29 March 1891) was a French post-Impressionist painter and draftsman. He is noted for his innovative use of drawing media and for devising the painting techniques known as chromoluminarism and pointillism. Seurat's artistic personality was compounded of qualities which are usually supposed to be opposed and incompatible: on the one hand, his extreme and delicate sensibility; on the other, a passion for logical abstraction and an almost mathematical precision of mind. His large-scale work, \\"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\\" (18841886), altered the direction of modern art by initiating Neo-impressionism, and is one of the icons of late 19th-century painting. - Félix Fénéon (22 June 1861, Turin, Italy 29 February 1944, Châtenay-Malabry) was a Parisian anarchist and art critic during the late 19th century. He coined the term \\"Neo-Impressionism\\" in 1886 to identify a group of artists led by Georges Seurat, and ardently promoted them. - Jean Dominique Antony Metzinger ( June 24 , 1883 -- November 3 , 1956 ) was a major 20th - century French painter , theorist , writer , critic and poet , who along with Albert Gleizes , developed the theoretical foundations of Cubism . His earliest works , from 1900 to 1904 , were influenced by the Neo-impressionism of Georges Seurat and Henri - Edmond Cross . Between 1904 and 1907 Metzinger worked in the Divisionist and Fauvist styles with a strong Cézannian component , leading to some of the first proto - Cubist works . From 1908 Metzinger experimented with the faceting of form , a style that would soon become known as Cubism . His early involvement in Cubism saw him both as an influential artist and principal theorist of the movement . The idea of moving around an object in order to see it from different view - points is treated , for the first time , in Metzinger 's Note sur la Peinture , published in 1910 . Before the emergence of Cubism , painters worked from the limiting factor of a single view - point . Metzinger , for the first time , in Note sur la peinture , enunciated the interest in representing objects as remembered from successive and subjective experiences within the context of both space and time . Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes wrote the first major treatise on Cubism in 1912 , entitled Du \`\` Cubisme '' . Metzinger was a founding member of the Section d'Or group of artists . Metzinger was at the center of Cubism both because of his participation and identification of the movement when it first emerged , because of his role as intermediary among the Bateau - Lavoir group and the Section d'Or Cubists , and above all because of his artistic personality . During the First World War Metzinger furthered his role as a leading Cubist with his co-founding of the second phase of the movement , referred to as Crystal Cubism . He recognized the importance of mathematics in art , through a radical geometrization of form as an underlying architectural basis for his wartime compositions . The... - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the style and philosophy of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation. Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called contemporary art or postmodern art. - The Section d'Or (\\"Golden Section\\"), also known as Groupe de Puteaux (or Puteaux Group), was a collective of painters, sculptors, poets and critics associated with Cubism and Orphism. Based in the Parisian suburbs, the group held regular meetings at the home of the Duchamp brothers in Puteaux and at the studio of Albert Gleizes in Courbevoie. Active from 1911 to around 1914, members of the collective came to prominence in the wake of their controversial showing at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1911. This showing by Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay, Henri le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger and Marie Laurencin (at the request of Apollinaire), created a scandal that brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the first time. - An art movement is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time, (usually a few months, years or decades) or, at least, with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years. Art movements were especially important in modern art, when each consecutive movement was considered as a new avant-garde. - Henri-Edmond Cross, born Henri-Edmond-Joseph Delacroix, (20 May 1856 16 May 1910) was a French painter and printmaker. He is most acclaimed as a master of Neo-Impressionism and he played an important role in shaping the second phase of that movement. He was a significant influence on Henri Matisse and many other artists. His work was instrumental in the development of Fauvism. - A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte painted in 1884, is one of Georges Seurat's most famous works. It is a leading example of pointillism technique, executed on a large canvas. Seurat's composition includes a number of Parisians at a park on the banks of the River Seine. - Cubism is an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture. Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century. The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris (Montmartre, Montparnasse and Puteaux) during the 1910s and extending through the 1920s. - Neo-Impressionism is a term coined by French art critic Félix Fénéon in 1886 to describe an art movement founded by Georges Seurat. Seurats greatest masterpiece, \\"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\\", marked the beginning of this movement when it first made its appearance at an exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants (Salon des Indépendants) in Paris. Around this time, the peak of Frances modern era emerged and many painters were in search of new methods. Followers of Neo-Impressionism, in particular, were drawn to modern urban scenes as well as landscapes and seashores. Science-based interpretation of lines and colors influenced Neo-Impressionists' characterization of their own contemporary art. The Pointillist and Divisionist techniques are often mentioned in this context, because it was the dominant technique in the beginning of the Neo-impressionist movement. - Der Sturm was a German art and literary magazine covering Expressionism, Cubism, Dada and Surrealism, among other artistic movements. It was published between 1910 and 1932. - Pointillism is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image. Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886, branching from Impressionism. The term \\"Pointillism\\" was first coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, and is now used without its earlier mocking connotation. The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-Impressionism. The Divisionists, too, used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes. - Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of \\"movement\\" as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s. - Staatliches Bauhaus, commonly known simply as Bauhaus, was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicised and taught. - Albert Gleizes (8 December 1881 23 June 1953) was a French artist, theoretician, philosopher, a self-proclaimed founder of Cubism and an influence on the School of Paris. Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger wrote the first major treatise on Cubism, \\"Du \\"Cubisme\\"\\", 1912. Gleizes was a founding member of the Section d'Or group of artists. He was also a member of Der Sturm, and his many theoretical writings were originally most appreciated in Germany, where especially at the Bauhaus his ideas were given thoughtful consideration. Gleizes spent four crucial years in New York, and played an important role in making America aware of modern art. He was a member of the Society of Independent Artists, founder of the Ernest-Renan Association, and both a founder and participant in the Abbaye de Créteil. Gleizes exhibited regularly at Léonce Rosenbergs \\"Galerie de lEffort Moderne\\" in Paris; he was also a founder, organizer and director of Abstraction-Création. From the mid-1920s to the late 1930s much of his energy went into writing, e.g., \\"La Peinture et ses lois\\" (Paris, 1923), \\"Vers une conscience plastique: La Forme et lhistoire\\" (Paris, 1932) and \\"Homocentrisme\\" (Sablons, 1937).

We want to find the probability that when selecting 3 people, there is at least one graduate among them. To approach this question, it's often easier to find the opposite scenario, the probability of selecting 3 non-graduates, and then subtract that result from 1. 1) We can find the probability of selecting 3 non-graduates: - There are 6 non-graduates (10 total - 4 graduates) to choose from. - We can calculate this as a combination: C(6,3) = 6! / (3!*(6-3)!) = 20 possible ways. 2) Now let's find the total number of ways to choose 3 people out of 10: - We can calculate this as a combination: C(10,3) = 10! / (3!*(10-3)!) = 120 possible ways. 3) To find the probability of selecting 3 non-graduates, we will divide the number of ways from step 1 by the total number of ways from step 2: - Probability of selecting 3 non-graduates = 20/120 = 1/6. 4) Finally, we want to find the probability of selecting at least one graduate: - We subtract the probability found in step 3 from 1: 1 - 1/6 = 5/6.

This ambitious project has not only provided much-needed relief and stability to these families, but has also fostered deep connections and a sense of unity among the volunteers, first responders, and the affected communities. As the years pass, Parness and his fellow volunteers continue to honor the selflessness and resilience displayed in the aftermath of 9/11 by showing up for those in need and perpetuating a cycle of compassion and recovery. Under the umbrella of his nonprofit organization, the New York Says Thank You Foundation, Parness has mobilized thousands of volunteers to assist in disaster relief efforts all around the country, from Joplin, Missouri, after a tornado devastated the city, to Texas following Hurricane Harvey, and many other communities impacted by natural disasters. The work done by Parness and his team not only contributes to the physical rebuilding of these areas, but also helps to restore the emotional and psychological well-being of their residents by bringing with them a spirit of hope and solidarity. This initiative also gives New Yorkers a way to express their gratitude and channel their empathy into action, turning the tragedy of September 11 into an impetus for positive change. Moreover, by focusing on active-duty first responders – the very individuals who put their lives on the line to protect and serve the public - Parness's efforts underscore the significance of their sacrifices and ongoing dedication. The annual tradition of giving back to disaster-stricken communities has a profound, far-reaching impact on everyone involved. For the first responders and their families who receive the help, it is a crucial lifeline during their darkest moments and serves as a testament to the enduring spirit of humanity in the face of adversity.

The Halloween & Costume Organization just launched a campaign to move Halloween to the last Saturday of October, and lots of families have already hopped on board. The trade group argues that a weekend celebration would allow for greater parental supervision and child safety by trick-or-treating during daylight hours — not to mention more time to celebrate without the stress of the work or school week. \\"We feel the change is inevitable and that in the end, the logic behind creating a safer, longer Halloween will prevail,\\" HCA Chairman Kevin Johnson said in a statement. So far the group's efforts have garnered more than 900 signatures on Change.org. The holiday's fixed date stems from its religious origins in the eighth century, when Pope Gregory III declared November 1 as a day to honor all saints. A tradition then developed to celebrate the dead on the preceding night, which later became what we know today as Halloween. Despite its religious roots, most Americans currently treat October 31 as a commercial holiday — and some parents think moving it to a Saturday would make life a lot easier for them and their kids. Let's start by breaking down the positives, shall we? The Pros It's easier for parents to celebrate with their kids versus rushing home after work. Children could trick-or-treat during daylight hours when it's potentially safer. You could spend the whole day celebrating instead of a few hours at night. Kids can still get a good night's sleep after staying out late. The Cons But before we do anything too crazy, don't forget: The U.S. has celebrated Halloween on October 31st since the mid-19th century. Halloween literally means \\"All Hallows' Eve\\" — a.k.a. the night before November 1. Half the fun of Halloween as kid is staying up late on a school night. You just can't mess with tradition! So there you have it. Fair warning though: Right now the government does not recognize Halloween as a federal holiday, so not only would Congress have to pass a law adding it to the official calendar, but they'd also have to agree on when to celebrate it. Getting any kind of consensus out of Washington right now is a lot easier said than done, but if you really love Halloween, it might be worth a shot. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The Halloween & Costume Association has launched a campaign to move Halloween from October 31st to the last Saturday of October, arguing that a weekend celebration would allow for greater parental supervision, child safety, and more time to celebrate without the stress of work or school.

Curl your left arm to your shoulder and then raise your hand straight overhead. While you raise your hand, simultaneously lift your right leg up and forward until your thigh is parallel to the floor. Return to your starting position before repeating the same exercise with the sides in reverse to complete one repetition. Repeat for a total of 20 repetitions and rest for 30 seconds before moving on to the next exercise. Use hand weights that are two to five pounds for all of these exercises. If you're a beginner, start with two-pound weights and work your way up to five as you build strength. If you don't have a set of hand weights, you can use any two objects of equal weight that you are able to grip firmly. Start in a partial squatting position with your knees bent and feet splayed to the side. Hold a weight in each hand and leave your arms hanging in front of you. From this position, slowly stand up, simultaneously raising your arms up and in line with your shoulders. Continue upwards, standing on your toes with your heels about two inches off the ground. To complete one repetition, return to your starting position with these motions in reverse. Do a total of 25 repetitions and then rest for 30 seconds. Time how long it takes you to do 25 repetitions at the beginning. As your strength improves, keep this exercise at the same time, but try increasing your repetitions. If you have trouble gripping hand weights for this exercise, you can try using velcro wrist weights instead. Stand with your legs apart, heels slightly raised off the ground. While holding your hand weights, throw a jab with your right hand towards your left side. Return to your starting position and throw a jab with your left hand towards your right side. Doing one jab for each side is one repetition. Do a set of a total of 20 repetitions before resting for 30 seconds.

Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Do you have any questions?","output":"The Spanish rule in Jamaica lasted for a century and a half until the British took control in 1655. During this period, the Spanish continued to exploit the island's resources and established sugar plantations. The demand for labor increased, and the slave trade became an essential part of the Jamaican economy. The island's population consisted mainly of Spanish settlers, African slaves, and the remaining Arawak people. In 1655, the English, led by Admiral William Penn and General Robert Venables, captured Jamaica from the Spanish. The Spanish were forced to flee, leaving many of their African slaves behind, who sought refuge in the island's mountainous regions and formed communities of escaped slaves known as Maroons. Under British rule, Jamaica became a major hub for the slave trade and sugar production. Plantation owners grew wealthy from the highly profitable sugar industry, while the African slaves faced brutal conditions and inhumane treatment. By the end of the 18th century, there were several slave revolts and uprisings against the British, fueled by the desire for freedom and equality. In 1834, slavery was officially abolished in Jamaica, as a result of the British Slavery Abolition Act. The newly freed slaves faced immense challenges, such as poverty and lack of access to education and land. They established themselves in small farming communities and developed crop production methods tailored to the island's tropical environment. Jamaica witnessed significant political and social changes during the 20th century. The island gained increasing autonomy from Britain, leading to the formation of a self-governing legislative council in 1944, followed by full independence on August 6, 1962. Jamaica, now a sovereign nation, faced challenges in areas such as economic development, political stability, social inequality, and crime. Today, Jamaica is known for its vibrant culture, which includes reggae music, cuisine, and popular tourist attractions. The island's rich history influences its diverse population and cultural heritage, which consists of people of African, European, Chinese, and Indian descent. Jamaica still grapples with issues like poverty, unemployment, and crime, but its government and people continue to work together to address these challenges and achieve a better future. In conclusion, the history of Jamaica has been shaped by various stages, from the indigenous Arawak people to the Spanish and British colonization, and finally, to its present-day status as an independent nation. These historical events have influenced Jamaica's dynamic culture, politics, and society, making it a fascinating and unique Caribbean island."},{"instruction":"That is slight paraphrasing as I would rather not re - utter the horrible words again .

But still, he couldn't walk like a normal kid. So he was laughed at by his peers for his walking style. His tears burnt our eyes like sulphuric acid . Then, he became afraid of going to school. He wouldn't go anymore. One night, my wife had a breakdown and shouted at him, \\"I tell you, my kid, you might be like this forever.

For this fictional review, I will focus on: 1. Poor service 2. Low-quality food 3. Unpleasant atmosphere Step 3: Create a believable scenario In order to make the review more realistic and relatable, it's important to create a vivid scenario that describes the visit to the restaurant. I will describe an evening visit involving a group of friends. Step 4: Write the review Now that I have my place, issues, and scenario, I can proceed to write the negative review. Title: \\"A Disappointing Dining Experience\\" I visited Dinertime Delight last night with a group of friends, and we were all unimpressed with our experience. The first issue we encountered was the poor service. It took ages for a server to come over and take our orders, even though the restaurant wasn't particularly busy. On top of that, our server forgot to bring us drinks and some of our side dishes, and we had to remind them multiple times. The quality of the food was equally disappointing. I ordered the steak, which was supposed to be a house specialty, but it arrived overcooked and dry. One of my friends had the pasta dish which was incredibly bland and swimming in oil. We had really high hopes for this place, but the food just didn't live up to our expectations. Lastly, the atmosphere at Dinertime Delight was anything but delightful. The tables were packed too close together, making it difficult to have a conversation without overhearing other diners' conversations. The music was also excessively loud, further contributing to the unpleasant noise levels we had to endure. Overall, we were extremely disappointed with our visit to Dinertime Delight and will definitely not be returning. I can't recommend this restaurant to anyone after our experience. Step 5: Review After completing the review, I will go back and ensure that it effectively communicates the negative experience and justifies the complaints about the place. The review should be consistent and provide a clear picture of the issues at the restaurant.

In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden.

The early days of radio broadcasting primarily featured news, music, and entertainment programs. However, by the 1930s and 1940s, some U.S. radio stations started to incorporate more talk-based content, such as interviews and discussions on various topics. One of the pioneers in talk radio programming was Joe Pyne, whose show started in 1945 at local station WILM in Wilmington, Delaware. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, talk radio continued to evolve, expanding to address various political and social issues. The format gained more prominence in the mid-1960s due to the Fairness Doctrine, a now-defunct FCC policy that required broadcasters to present all sides of a controversial issue. This led to more debate and opinion-based programming. In summary, the beginnings of talk radio in the U.S. can be traced back to the 1920s, but it developed and became more prominent over the next few decades, particularly in the mid-1960s."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a hypothesis and an update.

Hypothesis: Two men are playing chess. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise and the hypothesis describe two distinct and separate situations involving different games. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis to understand why they don't support each other: Premise: \\"Two men enjoying a game of pool.\\" In this statement, we learn that there are two men who are actively participating in and enjoying a game of pool, also known as billiards. Pool is a type of cue sport that involves hitting balls with a cue stick on a pool table. The objective of the game is to pocket all the balls in a predetermined order or ahead of one's opponent, depending on the type of pool being played. Some common variations of pool include eight-ball, nine-ball, and straight pool. Hypothesis: \\"Two men are playing chess.\\" In this statement, we are given a hypothesized situation where two men are engaged in a game of chess, which is not related to pool. Chess is a two-player turn-based board game that is played on a chessboard made up of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king, which entails positioning one's pieces in a way that the opponent's king is under threat of capture and there is no legal move available to prevent it. Now that we have a clear understanding of both the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes evident that they are describing two separate scenarios involving different games. The fact that the premise is true and the men are playing pool provides no evidence or support to conclude that they are also playing chess simultaneously or instead of pool. In sum, the truth of the premise does not have any bearing on the validity of the hypothesis, as the two situations described are unrelated and involve different games. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true simply because the premise is true."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

The fear has engulfed the star, leaving her no choice but to seek refuge and protection from this sinister figure. In this article, we will delve into the chilling details of the harassment and the emotional toll it took on Mila Kunis. Step One: Unveiling the Stalker's Identity Before diving into the story, it is essential to reveal the alleged stalker's identity. Stuart Lynn Dunn, a reportedly disturbed individual, had been fixated on Mila Kunis for an extensive period. He harassed and provoked fear in her, causing her to seek a restraining order in response. This order was granted, yet it did not deter Dunn from pursuing his frightening agenda. Step Two: Understanding the Stalker's Obsession It is crucial to understand the stalker's motivation and the intensity of their obsession. Despite the barrier of the restraining order, Dunn still managed to track down Mila Kunis' residence and repeatedly visited her. His relentless pursuit gave her no peace, as he continued to torment her by showing up uninvited. The intensity of his fixation knew no bounds. Step Three: Unraveling the Significant Incidents To comprehend the severity of the situation, we must look into the shocking incidents that escalated the terror. In one terrifying occasion, Dunn confronted Mila Kunis, forcing her to hide in her car, praying he would leave her in peace. Another time, he managed to sneak onto her property, overlooking her pool and home. This dangerous intrusion sent chills down the spines of her fans and loved ones. Step Four: The Emotional and Psychological Impact on Mila Kunis While it may be impossible for us to fully grasp the emotional and psychological toll that this ordeal has placed on Mila Kunis, we can imagine the immense fear and anxiety it evoked. Her personal space had been violated, her safety compromised, and her peace of mind shattered. As a public figure, she understands the importance of privacy, and being terrorized by an alleged stalker has undoubtedly forced her to question her sense of security.

Dents can occur in various materials and objects such as automobiles, metal surfaces, or even soft furnishings like leather. Once the context is clear, we can evaluate the available solutions and find the best one. Assuming you are referring to automobile dents, there are several options to consider: 1. Paintless Dent Repair (PDR) Methods: These techniques involve the use of specialized tools and gentle pressure to push or pull the dented area back into place without the need for any painting or body filler. It's perfect for small dents that have not damaged the paintwork and is cost-effective and quick. However, it may not work well for large or deep dents. 2. Traditional Dent Repair: Traditional dent repair encompasses various methods, including panel replacement, using body filler, and painting. It is suited for larger dents and dents that have damaged the paintwork. While it can provide excellent results, it is more expensive and time-consuming compared to PDR. 3. Suction Cup Tools: One common DIY method for minor dents is the use of suction cup tools. These tools attach to the dented area and use the power of suction to pull the dent outwards. Though not suitable for large or complex dents, these handy devices might be sufficient for less severe cases. 4. Heat and Cold Techniques: For dents in materials with a known memory-shape feature like specific plastics or metals, it's possible to apply heat and cold to return the material to its original form. By quickly heating the dented area and then cooling it with a can of compressed air or ice spray, you might cause the material to contract and regain its former shape. 5. Prevention: Ultimately, the most effective solution is to prevent dents from happening in the first place. Proper maintenance, cautious driving, and cautious parking can significantly reduce the likelihood of encountering dents. In evaluating these options, you should consider the factors such as the size and depth of the dent, whether the paintwork has been damaged, the type of material, your budget, and the level of skill required. If you're dealing with a small dent with no paint damage, paintless dent repair methods would be the most suitable and cost-effective option. For larger dents or those with paint damage, a traditional dent repair would be the better choice. DIY methods, like suction cup tools or heat and cold techniques, can work in some minor cases but are not universally applicable. Lastly, taking preventive measures will always be the best long-term solution. Without more context or specific information about the type and severity of the dents, it's impossible to pick one best solution. However, understanding the options listed above should help you decide the most suitable course of action for addressing or preventing dents in any given situation."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Η τέχνη είναι η καθρέπτιση της ψυχής και η έκφραση της ανθρώπινης κατάστασης υπό τη μορφή εικαστικών, θεατρικών, μουσικών και λογοτεχνικών έργων, που επιτρέπουν στον άνθρωπο να κατανοήσει και να εκφράσει τα βαθύτερα συναισθήματα, ιδέες και σκέψεις.

Right now you're wishing you could jump out of the car and let it go to find its own spot. Now there's an app for that. Virtual Valet lets your smartphone tell your car to park without you in it. \\"You pull up to the roadside, push a button on your smartphone and the car takes care of everything else,\\" says Aeron Steinfeld, the lead researcher for the project at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. To find its own spot, the system uses a sensor suite similar to ones found in many luxury cars. This includes a motion sensor that scans for moving cars and pedestrians, and a forward-facing laser rangefinder normally found in adaptive cruise control to determine the distance of objects in front of the car. Information from these sensors is then fed to an onboard computer to plot the vehicle's course. The users can watch the whole process from their phone. Better still, it will be affordable. The team has spent the last year moving from high-end imaging and processing equipment to less expensive components. In experiments, the vehicle was able to navigate through a crowded parking structure, find an empty spot, and park all on its own. And the greatest appeal of the Virtual Valet Parking App is that it requires no change to existing parking facilities or infrastructure. For the moment, the only car equipped for control by Virtual Valet is Carnegie Mellon' modified Jeep Wrangler, which the researchers have named NavLab11. But Steinfeld hopes that major car manufacturers will adopt the technology. It might be more than technology that holds up the show, however. Self-driving cars have been licensed in only three US states -- California, Nevada and Florida -- and it's unclear how this app would agree with self-driving laws. Until these questions are settled, your insurance provider might be unwilling to cover a ding from a parking incident.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who directed Roujin Z? Movie title: Roujin Z Movie plot: Roujin Z is set in early 21st century Japan. A group of scientists and hospital administrators, under the direction of the Ministry of Public Welfare, have developed the Z-001: a computerized hospital bed with robotic features.[2][3] The Z-001 takes complete care of the patient: it can dispense food and medicine, remove excretory waste, bathe and exercise the patient lying within its frame. The bed is driven by its own built-in nuclear power reactorâand in the event of an atomic meltdown, the bed (including the patient lying within) would become automatically sealed in concrete.[4] The first patient to be \\"volunteered\\" to test the bed is a dying widower named Kiyuro Takazawa. He is an invalid who is cared for by a young nursing student named Haruko.[5] The electronic elements within the Z-001 somehow manage to transcribe Takazawa's thoughts through Haruko's office computer, and he uses the communication to cry for help.[4] Although she objects to such treatment of elderly patients, Haruko begrudgingly seeks the aid of a group of computer hackers in the hospital's geriatric ward to create and install a vocal simulation of Takazawa's deceased wife in the Z-001.[2][3] However, once Takazawa wishes to go to the beach, the Z-001 detaches itself from its moorings and escapes from the hospital with the man in its grasp.[2][6] Haruko's fears are then justified, as it is discovered that the bed is actually a government-designed, experimental weapons robot.[3][5] A:","output":"Hirotoshi Ishii directed the movie Roujin Z.

Frustration: The tweet seems to express a sense of frustration due to the inability to sleep at 4 AM. Having trouble sleeping, especially at such a late hour, indicates that the person may be experiencing difficulty in their life or struggling with their thoughts. The frustration could stem from knowing that they should be asleep and that this disturbance may affect their usual daily routine and productivity. 2. Restlessness: The mention of not being able to sleep implies a sense of restlessness. It is quite possible that the individual may be dealing with anxiety, stress, or other contributing factors that make it difficult for them to fall asleep or stay asleep. Moreover, the restlessness could lead to exhaustion, annoyance, and other negative feelings that can have a significant impact on their mood and overall well-being. 3. Despair: When viewed through a more emotional lens, the tweet might also convey a sense of despair or hopelessness. Not being able to sleep at 4 AM might mean that the person is dealing with overwhelming feelings or facing certain situations they do not know how to handle, which could lead to sleepless nights. Despair can manifest itself in such situations where the individual feels powerless or overwhelmed. Taking all these emotions into account, it is crucial to mention that the sentiment of the tweet is undeniably negative. It highlights a struggle the person is going through and offers a glimpse into their emotional state, which could be a cry for help or simply venting frustration. Regardless of the exact emotion, it is clear that the individual is experiencing a distressing situation that disrupts their sleep pattern, and consequently, their mental and physical well-being."},{"instruction":"Frau Präsidentin!

Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality. Trump was born and raised in the New York City borough of Queens, and earned an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He took over his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded it to involve the construction and renovation of skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Context: Trump's ancestors originated from the German village of Kallstadt in the Palatinate on his father's side, and from the Outer Hebrides in Scotland on his mother's side. All of his grandparents and his mother were born in Europe. Trump's paternal grandfather, Friedrich Trump, first emigrated to the United States in 1885 at the age of 16 and became a citizen in 1892. He amassed a fortune operating boom-town restaurants and boarding houses in the Seattle area and the Klondike region of Canada during its gold rush. On a visit to Kallstadt, he met Elisabeth Christ and married her in 1902. The couple permanently settled in New York in 1905. Frederick died from influenza during the 1918 pandemic. Trump's father Fred was born in 1905 in The Bronx. Fred started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15, shortly after his father's death. Their company, Elizabeth Trump & Son, was primarily active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. Fred eventually built and sold thousands of houses, barracks, and apartments. The company was later renamed The Trump Organization, after Donald Trump took charge in 1971. Trump's mother Mary Anne was born in Tong, Lewis, Scotland. At age 18 in 1930, she emigrated to New York, where she worked as a maid. Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens. Trump's uncle John was an electrical engineer, physicist, and inventor. He worked as a professor at MIT from 1936 to 1973. During World War II, he was involved in radar research for the Allies and helped design X-ray machines that were used to treat cancer. Trump's ancestors were Lutheran on his father's side in Germany and Presbyterian on his mother's side in Scotland. His parents married in a Manhattan Presbyterian church in 1936. As a child, he attended the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, and had his Confirmation there. In the 1970s, his family joined the Marble Collegiate Church (an affiliate of the Reformed Church in America) in Manhattan. The pastor at that church, Norman Vincent Peale, author of The Power of Positive Thinking and The Art of Living, ministered to Trump's family and mentored him until Peale's death in 1993. Trump, who is Presbyterian, has cited Peale and his works during interviews when asked about the role of religion in his personal life. Trump says he receives Holy Communion, but that he does not ask God for forgiveness. While campaigning, Trump referred to The Art of the Deal as his second favorite book after the Bible, saying, \\"Nothing beats the Bible.\\" The New York Times reported that evangelical Christians nationwide thought \\"that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure\\". Trump has had associations with a number of Christian spiritual leaders, including Florida pastor Paula White, who has been called his \\"closest spiritual confidant\\". In 2015, he received a blessing from Greek Orthodox priest Emmanuel Lemelson and in 2016, he released a list of his religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed, and others. Referring to his daughter Ivanka's conversion to Judaism before her marriage to Kushner, Trump said: \\"I have a Jewish daughter; and I am very honored by that.\\" Trump said that he began his career with \\"a small loan of one million dollars\\" from his father. He appeared on the initial Forbes 400 list of wealthy individuals in 1982 with an estimated 200 million fortune, including an \\"undefined\\" share of his parents' estate. During the late 1980s he became a billionaire, and he made the Forbes World's Billionaires list for the first time in 1989, but he was absent from the Forbes 400 list following business losses from 1990 to 1995; he reportedly borrowed from his siblings' trusts in 1993. His father's estate, valued at more than 20 million, was divided in 1999 among Trump, his three surviving siblings, and their children. When Trump announced his candidacy for the presidency on June 16, 2015, he released a one-page financial summary that stated a net worth of 8,737,540,000. The following month, he filed a 92-page Federal Election Commission (FEC) financial disclosure form and declared his net worth was \\"in excess of ten billion dollars\\". In his presidential announcement speech, he said his wealth would make him less indebted to large campaign donors. Forbes called his net worth estimate \\"a whopper\\", setting their own estimate at 4.1 billion in 2015. Trump's 2015 FEC disclosure reported 362 million in total income for the year 2014. After Trump made controversial remarks about illegal immigrants in 2015, he lost business contracts with several companies; this reduced his Forbes estimate by 125 million. Consumer boycotts and reduced bookings may have further affected his brand value during the presidential campaign. Trump's 104-page FEC disclosure in May 2016 still claimed a total wealth over 10 billion, unchanged from 2015. The release of the Access Hollywood tapes in October 2016 put further pressure on his brand, but real estate experts predicted a positive rebound from becoming president. In its 2018 billionaires ranking, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at 3.1 billion (766th in the world, 248th in the U.S.) making him one of the richest politicians in American history. These estimates fluctuate from year to year, and among various analysts. In July 2016 Bloomberg News had pegged his wealth at 3 billion, calling it an increase thanks to his presidential nomination, whereas Forbes had ranked him 324th in the world (113th in the U.S.) with 4.5 billion just a few months earlier. The discrepancies among these estimates and with Trump's own figures stem mainly from the uncertain values of appraised property and of his personal brand. Question: In what?.

Now a respectable and well-to-do grower of grapes and flowers on the French Riviera, before World War II he was a jewel thief -- a cat burglar -- who was imprisoned but granted parole so he could fight the Germans. Someone is using the Cat's M.O. to steal jewelry again, and the police think Robie must be involved. When they visit his handsome stone villa to take him in for questioning, he gives them the slip with help from his housekeeper Germaine (Georgette Anys), who leads the cops on a car chase while Robie catches the bus.He drops in on his old gang from the French Resistance, a group of ex-cons whose war work, like Robie's own, led to grants of parole that depend on keeping their noses clean. Restaurant manager Bertani (Charles Vanel), wine steward Foussard (Jean Martinelli), and the others are all under a cloud while the Cat is at large, and they blame Robie. Still, when the police arrive at Bertani's restaurant, Foussard's teenaged daughter Danielle (Brigitte Auber), who has apparently enjoyed flirting with Robie in the past, spirits him across the bay in a motorboat to the safety of a Cannes beach club.Robie enlists the aid of an insurance man of Bertani's acquaintance, H.H.

Nevertheless, the drama unfolds as 'The Cat's' modus operandi is mimicked by a new thief, leaving the original 'Cat' as the main suspect.

This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Navy diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter.

Background: During respiratory viral infections host injury occurs due in part to inappropriate host responses. In this study we sought to uncover the host transcriptional responses underlying differences between high-and lowpathogenic infections. Results: From a compendium of 12 studies that included responses to influenza A subtype H5N1, reconstructed 1918 influenza A virus, and SARS coronavirus, we used meta-analysis to derive multiple gene expression signatures. We compared these signatures by their capacity to segregate biological conditions by pathogenicity and predict pathogenicity in a test data set. The highest-performing signature was expressed as a continuum in low-, medium-, and high-pathogenicity samples, suggesting a direct, analog relationship between expression and pathogenicity. This signature comprised 57 genes including a subnetwork of chemokines, implicating dysregulated cell recruitment in injury. Conclusions: Highly pathogenic viruses elicit expression of many of the same key genes as lower pathogenic viruses but to a higher degree. This increased degree of expression may result in the uncontrolled co-localization of inflammatory cell types and lead to irreversible host damage.","output":"Task: Generate a suitable title for a research paper based on the given paragraph.

However, understanding the timeline of these significant occurrences requires a deep-dive into history. In this article, we will explore the years that passed between Mingyi Nyo declaring independence from Ava and the eventual fall of Ava to the Confederation and Prome. Background Before we delve into the main question, it's crucial to lay down the historical context that led to these events. Ava, also known as Inwa, was a royal capital in Upper Burma from the 14th to 19th centuries. It served as the administrative center for numerous Burmese dynasties, primarily the Toungoo and Restored Taungoo Dynasties. Taungoo, on the other hand, was a small vassal state located in Lower Burma, which eventually became an important regional power in its own right. The rise of Taungoo allowed it to play substantial roles in the formation and expansion of the Burmese Empire. 1. Mingyi Nyo Declares Independence In 1510, Mingyi Nyo, then the ruler of Taungoo, declared independence from the kingdom of Ava. As a regional power, Taungoo had been under Ava's suzerainty for a long time. Still, its ultimate goal was independence and expanding its territories. Deciding it was time to stand on its own, Mingyi Nyo, the founder of the Taungoo Dynasty, set his sights on establishing a powerful and distinct kingdom. Step 1: Identifying the year Mingyi Nyo declared independence - 1510. 2. Fall of Ava to Confederation and Prome The downfall of the once-great Ava kingdom came several decades after Taungoo's independence. In 1527, the Confederation, an alliance of various Shan states, and Prome, a then-independent city-state, besieged and sacked Ava, which led to its eventual collapse. Step 2: Identifying the year Ava fell to Confederation - 1527. Calculating the Years Passed Now that we have the crucial dates – 1510 for Mingyi Nyo's declaration of independence and 1527 for Ava's fall to the Confederation – we can calculate the duration between these two events. Subtracting the year of independence from the year of Ava's fall gives us the number of years passed: 1527 - 1510 = 17 years Conclusion A total of 17 years passed between Mingyi Nyo declaring Taungoo's independence from Ava and the fall of Ava to the Confederation and Prome. This period signified a time of significant change within the landscape of the Burmese territories. It marks the beginning of the Taungoo Dynasty's rise to prominence and the decline of the powerful Ava Kingdom."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given an original reference as well as a system reference.

His father was Italian American and his mother was Jewish; Poffo was raised Roman Catholic. Angelo was a well-known wrestler in the 1950s and 1960s, who was featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! for his ability to do sit-ups for hours on end. Context: In June 1985, Savage signed with Vince McMahon. Billed as \\"the top free agent in pro wrestling\\", Savage's first appearances on Tuesday Night Titans featured several established managers (including Bobby Heenan, Jimmy Hart, and \\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie) offering their services to Savage. He eventually declined their offers and chose Miss Elizabeth as his new manager. His gimmick was a crazed, ego-maniacal bully who mistreated Miss Elizabeth and threatened anyone who even looked at her. He made his pay-per-view (PPV) debut at The Wrestling Classic on November 7, 1985, participating in a 16-man tournament. He defeated Ivan Putski, Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, and the Dynamite Kid before losing by a countout in the finals to Junkyard Dog. In late 1985, Savage started a feud with then Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Tito Santana over that title. Santana beat him on October 19, 1985 at San Juan, Puerto Rico. The November 2, 1985 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, he unsuccessfully challenged Santana for the title (Savage won the match by countout, but not the title because the title did not change hands by countout). In a rematch on the February 24, 1986 (taped February 8) episode of Prime Time Wrestling, he won the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship at the Boston Garden by using an illegal steel object stashed in his tights to knock out Santana. Early in his WWF career, Savage also won three countout victories (the first at the Spectrum in Philadelphia and the other two at Madison Square Garden) over his future tag team partner WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan (although the belt did not change hands due to the countout) as well as engaging in feuds with Bruno Sammartino and George \\"The Animal\\" Steele. During this time, Savage also formed a tag-team with semi-retired wrestler come color commentator Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura, who would remain a vocal supporter of Savage until Ventura left the WWF in mid-1990, except during Savage's period as a face. Savage's feud with Steele began on the January 4, 1986 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, when Steele developed a crush on Miss Elizabeth. At WrestleMania 2, Savage defeated Steele in a match to retain his Intercontinental Heavyweight Title. He resumed his feud with Steele in early 1987, culminating in two Intercontinental Heavyweight title matches, both won by Savage. Savage wrestled Ricky Steamboat at WrestleMania III in the Pontiac Silverdome. After 19 two-counts, Steamboat pinned Savage (with help from George Steele, who pushed Savage from the top rope seconds before he was pinned) to end his near 14-month reign as Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. The match was extremely choreographed, as opposed to the \\"on the fly\\" nature of most wrestling matches at the time. Savage was a stickler for detail, and he and Steamboat laid out and rehearsed every spot in the match prior to WrestleMania, at his home in Florida.

Place the tip of your flat surface on the back of the preheated stone and slide your surface out of the oven so that your pizza is left on the stone. If your pizza seems to stick, try using a back and forth jerking motion to help it. Your pizza will only have to bake for 4-6 minutes in the oven. Watch it carefully and remove it when the crust begin to brown. Remove the pizza by again sliding your flat surface beneath the pizza. Be careful, the pizza will be extremely hot. Let it sit for a couple minutes before cutting to avoid burning yourself.

Begin by placing a pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven and preheating the oven to 550 degrees Fahrenheit. Take one ball of dough and lightly dust it with flour before gradually stretching it on a flat, floured surface, such as a cutting board, baking sheet, or peel. The dough should be stretched to approximately the size of the pizza stone, which is typically around 14 inches. A peel is a wide, flat tool used for handling pizza, characterized by its tapered front edge that allows for easy pizza transfer on and off the stone. Once the dough reaches the desired size, apply the sauce and cheese, followed by vegetables, meats, and seasonings of choice. Properly flouring the flat surface will ease this process. To transfer the pizza onto the preheated stone, place the tip of the flat surface at the stone's back and carefully slide the surface out of the oven, leaving the pizza on the stone. In case the pizza sticks, employ a jerking motion for assistance. The pizza will require 4-6 minutes in the oven and should be carefully monitored until the crust starts to brown. To remove the cooked pizza, slide the flat surface under it, taking caution as the pizza will be extremely hot. Let the pizza rest for a few minutes before cutting to prevent burns.

Sadly, this latest attempt by director Paul Andrews falls flat on its face, causing viewers to question the virtue of the 105 minutes they've just irretrievably lost. \\"A Dismal Dream\\" tries to weave a tale of ambiguity, introspection, and psychological thriller, but the result is an insipid, convoluted, and chaotic experience. Andrews' direction appears to flounder in its search for meaning and style, resulting in a final product that feels poorly conceived and hastily executed. The pacing of the film is excruciatingly sluggish, to the point where the viewer's own daydreams become infinitely more intriguing than the events unfolding on screen. The story revolves around our protagonist, Tom, who finds himself entangled in a web of distorted reality and sinister secrets. A solid premise fraught with potential, but the shortcomings in the script make those aspirations laughably unattainable. The dialogue is stilted, expository, and laden with clichéd lines that weaken the film’s central message. Even worse, the plot is riddled with nonsensical twists that cause more confusion than excitement. Surely, the goal of a psychological thriller is not to exasperate its audience, but \\"A Dismal Dream\\" seems determined to break that mold. As for the performances, the mediocre script leaves the cast grasping at straws. The talented Alicia Stone, who had the potential to infuse Tom's wife with much-needed depth and intrigue, is instead relegated to a one-dimensional supporting character. Her performance becomes a prime example of wasted potential, squandering her talents to serve an abysmally hollow narrative. Meanwhile, the bond between Tom and his wife, supposedly the core of the plot, withers under the weight of underdeveloped chemistry and subpar character development. On the technical side, the film is no savior. The cinematography oscillates between jolting handheld shots and amateurish attempts at moody, atmospheric sequences, all the while failing to find a cohesive visual language. The gloomy, desaturated color palette might have worked to build tension and immerse the viewer in the protagonist's journey had it been tempered by artistic vision and skilled direction. But alas, this glimmer of potential is snuffed out by the rest of the film's failures. In conclusion, \\"A Dismal Dream\\" is a stagnant quagmire of a film that drowns any semblance of intrigue, artistry, and entertainment. In an attempt to challenge and provoke its audience, it instead pushes the viewer further away from its core message and into their own musings on the precious time it stole. There is very little redemption to be found, even for those who fancy themselves ardent fans of convoluted thrillers. Suffocating beneath its hazy ambitions, \\"A Dismal Dream\\" certainly lives up to its title – a regretful manifestation of cinema that leaves the audience quite eager to awaken from its tedious grip."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question. What country does Häagen-Dazs ice cream come from?","output":"Häagen-Dazs, a famous ice cream brand known for its premium quality and rich flavors, traces its origins to the United States of America. The brand was founded by Reuben Mattus, a Polish immigrant, who started the business in the early 1960s. Together with his wife, Rose Mattus, they introduced Häagen-Dazs to the market in 1961. Reuben Mattus gained experience in the ice cream industry since his mother's family, who were Russian-Jewish immigrants, owned an ice cream enterprise in New York called Senator Frozen Products. This company dealt with fruit ice and later ice cream sales to local customers. Reuben worked alongside his family in their business and gained valuable experience, understanding the importance of using the finest ingredients to produce high-quality ice cream. When Reuben Mattus founded Häagen-Dazs, he wanted to create a luxurious and high-end ice cream brand that would distinguish itself from other brands in the market. To achieve this, he used an innovative approach, focusing on sourcing high-quality, natural ingredients, and employing a meticulous manufacturing process. The name Häagen-Dazs itself was carefully chosen to invoke an image of European sophistication and appeal to potential customers. Although the name might sound Danish, it has no actual meaning in any language and was merely chosen for its exotic connotations. The first Häagen-Dazs store opened in Brooklyn, New York, and the brand's popularity began to rise almost immediately. The initial three flavors available were chocolate, vanilla, and coffee, which were purposefully selected because of their wide appeal. Throughout the years, Häagen-Dazs expanded both within the United States and internationally, entering several markets and gaining recognition as a premium ice cream brand. In 1983, the company was acquired by the Pillsbury Company, and later on, in 2001, it became a part of Nestlé's portfolio when Nestlé acquired the Pillsbury Company. Today, Häagen-Dazs offers a plethora of flavors, including creative limited-edition creations that cater to global palates. The brand also has a range of sorbets, gelatos, and frozen yogurt, as well as ice cream bars and cakes. Considering its American origin, it is important to emphasize that Häagen-Dazs has transcended its geographical boundaries and become a symbol of luxury, indulgence, and quality in the world of ice cream."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: “Hey, Natalie!

While collecting her father's body in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Mattie asks the local sheriff about the search for Chaney. He tells her that Chaney has fled with \\"Lucky\\" Ned Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, not believing she has the money to hire him. She raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill. Texas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town after pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes to team up with Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn but he leaves without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: To answer this question, we need to consider two sentences A and B, where one of them showcases parallel structure effectively. Sentence A could be \\"I enjoy hiking, running, and to swim,\\" whereas Sentence B might be phrased as \\"I enjoy hiking, running, and swimming.\\" In Sentence A, the list of activities is not consistently using the same grammatical form and is slightly awkward in its construction; \\"to swim\\" doesn't match the other two gerunds. On the other hand, Sentence B consistently uses the \\"-ing\\" verb form (gerunds)— \\"hiking,\\" \\"running,\\" and \\"swimming.\\" This creates a harmonious list of parallel items, making it easier to read and understand. Therefore, Sentence B effectively conveys related ideas using parallel structure."},{"instruction":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

Surprisingly, each of these carries the same risk, which is very low.However, what about flying compared to working in the chemical industry? Unfortunately, the former is 65 times riskier than the latter! In fact the accident rate of workers in the chemical industry is less than that of almost any of human activity, and almost as safe as staying at home. The trouble with the chemical industry is that when things go wrong they often cause death to those living nearby.It is this that makes chemical accidents so newsworthy.Fortunately, they are extremely rare.The most famous ones happened at Texas City (1947), Flixborough (1974), Seveso (1976), Pemex (1984) and Bhopal (1984). Some of these are always in the minds of the people even though the loss of life was small.No one died at Seveso, and only 28 workers at Flixborough.The worst accident of all was Bhopal, where up to 3,000 were killed.The Texas City explosion of fertilizer killed 552.The Pemex fire at a storage plant for natural gas in the suburbs of Mexico City took 542 lives, just a month before the unfortunate event at Bhopal. Some experts have discussed these accidents and used each accident to illustrate a particular danger.Thus the Texas City was caused by tons of ammonium nitrate, which is safe unless stored in a great quantity.The Flixborough fireball was the fault of management, which took risks to keep production going during essential repairs.The Seveso accident shows what happens if the local authorities lack knowledge of the danger on their doorstep.When the poisonous gas drifted over the town , local leaders were incapable of taking effective action.The Pemex fire was made worse by an overloaded site in an overcrowded suburb.The fire set off a chain reaction of exploding storage tanks.Yet, by a miracle, the two largest tanks did not explode.Had these caught fire, then 3,000 strong rescue team and fire fighters would all have died.

The National Association of College Stores reported more than five billion dollars in sales of textbooks and course materials. The association spokesman Charles Schmidt says electronic textbooks now just make up 2%~3% of sales. But he says that is expected to reach 10%~15% by 2012. Online versions are now available for many of the most popular college textbooks. An etextbook can cost half the price of a new print textbook. But students usually lose access to them after the end of the term. And the books cannot be placed on more than one device ,so they are not easy to share. So what do students think of etextbooks?Administrators at Northwest Missouri State University wanted to find it out. Earlier this year they tested them with 500 students in 20 classes. The university is unusual. It provides laptop computers for all 7,000 of its fulltime students. It does not require students to buy their textbooks either. They rent them to save money. The school aims to save even more by moving to etextbooks. The students in the survey reported that downloading the books from the Internet was easy. They liked the idea of carrying lighter backpacks. And 56% said they were better able to find information. But most found that using etextbooks did not change their study habits. And 60% felt they read more when they were reading on paper. In all,almost half the students said they still liked physical textbooks better. But the survey found that cost could be a big influence.55% said they would choose etextbooks if using them meant their textbook rental fee would not increase. Roger Von Holzen heads the Center for Information Technology in Education at Northwest Missouri State University.

Options: - neighborhood - apartment building - michigan - countryside - city or town Explain why a human would choose \\"apartment building\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"A human would choose \\"apartment building\\" to answer the question above because it is the most suitable option among the choices provided for finding 10 or 100 homes that are attached together. Step 1: Analyzing the options - Neighborhood: While a neighborhood might consist of multiple homes, they are typically detached, single-family houses and not necessarily attached together. - Apartment building: An apartment building usually consists of multiple individual living units or homes that are structurally conjoined, so this option meets the criteria of having 10 or 100 homes attached together. - Michigan: This is a geographical location, not a type of housing arrangement. It is not specifically related to finding attached homes. - Countryside: Countrysides often have more detached houses with larger properties in between, making it less likely to find a concentration of attached homes. - City or town: While it's true that some cities or towns have attached homes or apartments, it is a broader category that doesn't specifically refer to a type of housing where you would definitely find 10 or 100 homes attached together. Step 2: Choosing the best option Considering the analysis of the options, it's clear that the \\"apartment building\\" is the most suitable choice. It specifically refers to a type of building where multiple living units are attached together and can accommodate 10 or even 100 homes in one structure. Thus, a human would choose \\"apartment building\\" as the answer because it best fits the description of a place where you could find 10 or 100 homes that are attached together."},{"instruction":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would Archimedes' device more likely or less likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one? Archimedes was a great scientist. He was also a great inventor of machines. He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine. Hint: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. The answer to this question is:","output":"Archimedes' device would more likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one. Step 1: Understand the context given in the paragraph - Archimedes is a great scientist and inventor of machines - King of Sicily asked Archimedes and Ptolemy to come up with great inventions - Archimedes came up with a great machine, but Ptolemy couldn't do much and his device was not a machine Step 2: Recall the definition of machines making work easier - Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied Step 3: Compare both devices - Archimedes' device is a machine, which by definition makes work easier by applying force, distance, or direction changes - Ptolemy's device is not a machine and, therefore, doesn't have those benefits Step 4: Conclude the answer Based on the given information, Archimedes' device (being a machine) would more likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one (which is not a machine)."},{"instruction":"Where is likely to have a popular delicatessen? Options: - city center - mall - shop - michigan - large city Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"1. Analyze the options provided. - City center: The heart of a city, usually with many businesses and a high population density. - Mall: A large enclosed building containing multiple stores, including food and retail. - Shop: A single retail unit selling various items. - Michigan: A state in the United States, not specific to a particular area or businesses. - Large city: A city with a significant population, often accompanied by numerous businesses and establishments. 2. Consider where a popular delicatessen is most likely to be found. - A popular delicatessen typically requires a high population density or foot traffic to sustain its popularity. This means locations with many potential customers are the most suitable for such a business. 3. Compare the options and decide which are the most suitable. - City center: A city center is likely to have a popular delicatessen due to high foot traffic, a concentration of businesses, and accessibility for customers. - Mall: A mall could also have a popular delicatessen as malls typically cater to a high volume of customers who are looking for diverse eating and shopping options. - Shop: A stand-alone shop is a less ideal location for a popular delicatessen as it doesn't naturally attract the same level of foot traffic or customer density as a city center or mall. - Michigan: This option is not relevant to this question as it does not describe a specific location or context in which a popular delicatessen might be found. - Large city: A large city might have a popular delicatessen due to its significant population and abundance of businesses. However, this option lacks the specificity of the city center or mall options. 4. Conclusion: - Based on the analysis, a popular delicatessen is most likely to be found in a city center or at a mall, as these locations consistently attract high levels of foot traffic and have a diverse range of businesses and potential customers."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: A great movie with a grim message. Review: This si-fi thriller is set in a future nightmare dystopia set up by a Christian state... full of hypocrisy and death. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"The product review conveys a mixed sentiment. Here's a step-by-step justification of my assessment: 1. The title mentioned, \\"A great movie with a grim message,\\" implies positive sentiment towards the movie, as the user acknowledges it as being great. The mention of a grim message suggests that the movie effectively delivers a serious or dark theme, which is not necessarily negative in terms of quality. 2. The phrase \\"si-fi thriller\\" suggests a neutral sentiment, as it simply describes the movie's genre. 3. The description \\"set in a future nightmare dystopia\\" reflects a negative sentiment towards the setting of the movie. However, this sentiment might not necessarily be about the movie's quality but rather about the disturbing nature of the story's environment. 4. The mention of a \\"Christian state... full of hypocrisy and death\\" conveys negative sentiment towards the state, adding to the dark and grim theme of the movie. 5. The review does not express any dislike or disappointment about the movie or its execution, so it does not convey a clear negative sentiment with regard to the movie's quality. Taking these points into consideration, the product review conveys a mixed sentiment: a positive sentiment towards the movie's quality and successful delivery of its grim message, and a negative sentiment towards the dark and disturbing nature of the movie's setting and themes—without criticizing the movie itself."},{"instruction":"During the closing ceremony of the 2013 Southeast Asian Games, the SEAGF Flag was formally handed over from Myanmar to Singapore.

A = the number of marbles Amanda has. M = the number of marbles Mabel has. From the problem, we know the following information: 1. Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina. So, A + 12 = 2 * K 2. Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina. So, M = 5 * K 3. Mabel has 85 marbles. So, M = 85 Now, we can use these equations to solve for the number of marbles for each person. From equation (2) and (3): M = 5 * K 85 = 5 * K To find the value of K: K = 85 / 5 K = 17 Now that we know K, we can find A: A + 12 = 2 * K A + 12 = 2 * 17 A + 12 = 34 To find the value of A: A = 34 - 12 A = 22 Now we can find how many more marbles Mabel has than Amanda: Difference = M - A Difference = 85 - 22 Difference = 63 Mabel has 63 more marbles than Amanda."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"After about 100 meters, in Piazza Medaglie d’Oro, take the third right (via Tino da Camaino) and cross piazza degli Artisti that flows into via Luca Giordano; at the first intersection turn left onto via De Mura and at the second intersection turn left.\\" to German?","output":"To complete the translation task, I will follow these steps: 1.

Avigdor Lieberman has no idea why Ilan Grapel, 27, should be detained, he told Israel Radio. Grapel was apprehended Sunday and ordered held for 15 days on suspicion of spying for Israel, said Adel Saeed, a spokesman for Egypt's general prosecutor. Grapel was taken into custody in a five-star hotel in downtown Cairo, Saeed said Sunday. Grapel's mother said he had been staying at a 9-a-night youth hostel. Israeli diplomats visited Grapel on Tuesday, according to Egypt's Israeli embassy, and found him to be in good health. Israel continues working for Grapel's release, the embassy said. Grapel's mother denied Monday that her son was involved in espionage, saying: \\"Law students don't have time to be spies.\\" \\"There is no chance he's a spy,\\" Irene Grapel said from her home in New York. Her son, a former paratrooper in the Israel Defense Forces, holds dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship. He worked briefly for St. Andrew's Refugee Services in Cairo, said its assistant director Fiona Cameron. \\"Ilan Grapel worked for us for four days last week. We were unaware of his dual citizenship or of his military record,\\" she told CNN Tuesday, saying he had been \\"thoroughly vetted before he came, though obviously not thoroughly enough.\\" The organization had \\"no reason to be suspicious of his activities\\" for the four days he'd been with them, she said. She learned of Grapel's detention from his friends when she called them to ask why he hadn't shown up for work, she said. Cameron said St. Andrew's had been \\"pro-actively in touch with the Egyptian authorities\\" about his case. St. Andrew's Refugee Services seeks to help \\"the isolated and vulnerable refugee communities in Egypt to come together for empowerment, education, community development and social services,\\" according to its website. Grapel is a rising third-year student at Emory University School of Law in Atlanta, school officials said Monday in a statement. \\"We are in touch with his family and are working with them to provide support and assistance,\\" it said. He is involved in the Emory Public Interest Committee as well as Emory Law's Pro Bono program, working with Student Legal Services, it said. He traveled May 10 to Cairo to volunteer at St. Andrews, his mother said. Though Grapel was working without pay, he received a public-service grant from Emory, which has no link to the organization, his mother said. Grapel's IDF work could have been what led Egyptian authorities to focus on him, his mother said. \\"He loves the Arab culture. He loves the Arab religion,\\" she said. Grapel speaks Arabic, which he studied at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and he spent his junior year at Ben Gurion University in Israel. \\"He gravitates toward Arabic-speaking students on campus so he can speak with them, simply to use the language,\\" Irene Grapel said. She said she spoke Monday morning with her son, who told her he was being held at a security center in Cairo. Saeed, the general prosecutor spokesman, said Grapel had participated in the Lebanon war of 2006 and was relieved of field combat duties after being injured. Investigators had been following his activities for months, Saeed said. The Israeli government allegedly sent Grapel to Egypt after the January 25 revolution to take advantage of the security vacuum that then existed by recruiting others to provide the Israelis with military and political information, Saeed said. The revolution forced former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from power; he stepped down February 11. The suspect, who was present at most of the protests, tried to incite sectarian violence between Muslims and Christians and encouraged demonstrators to engage in violence against the military, Saeed said. His goal was to foment chaos between the Egyptian people and the military, Saeed said. The supreme state security prosecutor has questioned Grapel, and the general prosecutor will announce the results of the investigation when it is complete, Saeed said. Egyptian newspapers carried the story on their front pages Monday alongside photos of Grapel republished from his Facebook account. \\"Egypt arrests Israeli Intelligence Officer, a big blow to the Israeli Mossad Intelligence Agency,\\" one headline said. Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979. The United States has been granted consular access to Grapel and is following the investigation to determine the exact charges, the State Department said Monday. \\"We've confirmed that he was in good health, Mr. Grapel's family is aware of his arrest, and refer you to the government of Egypt for details on the charges against him,\\" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday. The Egyptian authorities provided the United States with \\"almost immediate consular access\\" to Grapel, Toner said. \\"Our function, as they would in that case of any American citizen held overseas, is to provide them with consular services, work with local authorities to make sure he's being treated fairly under local law, provide information about the local legal system and facilitate communication with his family and friends.\\" CNN's Diana Magnay, Paul Colsey, Kevin Flower, Jamie Crawford and Tom Watkins and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.

The sentence is discussing the challenges of uranium extraction from seawater, specifically mentioning the issue of low yields due to the presence of carbonate in water. It does not make any mention of an entity or event named HiCap, let alone any specific date or time when it might have been announced. Based on the given sentence, we can deduce that uranium extraction from seawater has been studied, and there are some obstacles, such as the presence of carbonate constituents in the water, that limit the efficiency of this method. However, understanding or discussing the announcement of HiCap requires specific knowledge about it and its historical context, which is not provided in the sentence. The term 'HiCap' could relate to many different things, perhaps a product, process, company, event, etc. Without this specific context, we cannot discern when HiCap was announced from the information available. To respond to the question \\"When was HiCap announced?\\" accurately, we would need further information about what HiCap refers to. In case HiCap may be related to uranium extraction from seawater or had a role in addressing the carbonate issue, the sentence may provide some context but would still lack the precise data needed to answer the question on when HiCap was announced.

Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods. Which town had more fertilizers picked up by rain water? Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. A:","output":"Based on the given hint and information provided, it can be concluded that Big town had more fertilizers picked up by rainwater. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers for their agricultural practices, while Small town utilized permaculture principles and organic farming methods. 2. The use of chemical fertilizers in Big town implies that a significant amount of chemicals, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, were introduced to their farm fields. 3. When it rains, these chemicals can be picked up by rainwater and carried away as runoff. 4. As the hint suggests, runoff carries these chemicals to nearby rivers, lakes, or bodies of water, leading to increased growth of water plants and algae, causing environmental issues like dead zones. 5. In contrast, Small town's permaculture and organic farming methods do not rely on synthetic chemical fertilizers but rather on more natural and sustainable approaches. This can minimize the amount of pollutants picked up by rainwater and reduce the negative impact on the environment and human health. Therefore, Big town had more fertilizers picked up by rainwater due to its agricultural practices that rely on synthetic chemical fertilizers and pesticides."},{"instruction":"- internationalrole is referee - internationalyears is 2006 & ndash ; - role is referee - league is gambrinus liga - confederation is fifa listed - birth date is 23 february 1976 - image is libor kovařík.jpeg - birth place is czechoslovakia Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

An empty cement truck weighs less than a full cement truck. 2. According to Newton's second law, force is equal to mass times acceleration (F = m*a). In this case, the force is the power generated by the truck engine, and the mass is the weight of the truck. Given that the force (engine power) remains constant for both trucks, the only factor differing between these scenarios is the mass (weight) of the trucks. Now, let's consider the acceleration: Acceleration (a) = Force (F)/ Mass (m) For the empty cement truck, since the mass is lower, its acceleration will be greater than that of the full cement truck, all else being equal.

Suede is variety of what?","output":"Suede is a variety of leather. It is a type of leather that is made from the underside of the animal skin, usually from calves, lambs, pigs, goats, or deer. Suede is created through a process that splits the hide to produce the soft, napped surface that is characteristic of this material. The name \\"suede\\" is derived from the French term \\"gants de Suède,\\" which means \\"gloves from Sweden,\\" as it was originally utilized for creating gloves. The distinct features of suede come from its unique production process. Compared to full-grain leather, which is made from the outer side of the animal hide and has a smooth surface, suede has a soft, velvety texture that is obtained after the hide is sanded or buffed to raise the fibers on the surface. This results in a plush, delicate surface that has a higher level of breathability as compared to other types of leather. While the softness and pliability of suede make it a popular choice for various items like shoes, gloves, handbags, jackets, and upholstery, it also has some drawbacks. Suede is more susceptible to stains, water damage, and wear than other leather types due to its porous nature and delicate surface. Therefore, suede products require additional maintenance and care to preserve their appearance and condition. To protect and prolong the life of suede items, it is important to follow proper care guidelines. These include: 1. Handling with clean hands: As suede can easily absorb oil and dirt, it is crucial to handle it with clean hands to avoid staining the material. 2. Using a suede brush: Regularly brushing suede items with a soft-bristle suede brush can help maintain the material's napped surface and remove dust and dirt. Always brush in the direction of the nap to prevent damage. 3. Protecting from moisture: Using a spray-on suede protector can help shield the material from water damage and stains. It is vital to follow the manufacturer's instructions and test a small, inconspicuous area of the suede before applying the product. 4. Storing in a cool, dry place: Suede should be kept away from direct sunlight, heat, and moisture to prevent fading, discoloration, and damage. 5. Addressing spills and stains promptly: When a spill occurs, it is essential to blot it immediately with a clean, dry cloth to prevent it from setting in. For more difficult stains, it may be necessary to consult a professional cleaner who specializes in suede care. Overall, suede is a luxurious and unique variety of leather with a soft, velvety texture that is highly sought after for a variety of products. However, to maintain its beauty and longevity, it requires specific care and attention to prevent damage from stains, water, and wear."},{"instruction":"M.

In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.\\" Answer:","output":"The given context states that \\"phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features.\\" To break this down: 1. Recognition of the Question's Purpose: The question asks about the elements constituting the sequences within phonological representations. 2.

According to Rose, the then-congressman seemed genuinely interested in her cause at first, and they spent some time discussing the issue and potential solutions. However, the tone of the meeting shifted dramatically when Filner allegedly became increasingly insistent on his attempts to kiss Rose despite her clear discomfort and objections. \\"He tried to move my face towards his to intimidate me,\\" Rose said. \\"I kept pulling back and trying to focus on the discussion at hand, but he just wouldn't let up.\\" Feeling threatened and ashamed by Filner's inappropriate behavior, Rose managed to end the meeting and leave the restaurant. She later confided in friends and family about what had happened, but hesitated to come forward publicly for fear of retribution that might impact her nonprofit's work. The allegations against Filner have sparked widespread condemnation from both political parties and intensified calls for his resignation as mayor of San Diego. In addition to the three accusers who have come forward publicly, several other women have reportedly made anonymous claims of harassment against Filner. Members of the San Diego City Council have expressed concern over the mounting allegations and called for an independent investigation into Filner's conduct. \\"These allegations are deeply troubling, and an investigation is certainly warranted,\\" said Councilmember Barbara Bry. \\"We must ensure that such behavior has no place in the halls of government.\\" In response to the earlier allegations, Mayor Filner vowed to seek professional help for his behavior, stating, \\"I need help with my personal interactions, and I am seeking guidance from professionals on how to conduct myself properly and respectfully.\\" As the investigation into Mayor Filner's actions continues, the outcome remains uncertain. Should more evidence of harassment surface, Filner may face not only political backlash but also potential legal consequences for his actions. It is yet to be seen whether Filner's claims of eventual vindication will hold true.

They were given joy down the left twice in the opening two minutes, and scored at the second attempt. Higdon's hold up play allowed Jamie Murphy free, and his perfect cross was headed past Gary Woods by the man who started the move. Chances were sparse, but Elliot Omozusi hit the post for Orient with a deflected effort, before Stephen McGinn pulled his effort just wide at the other end. As Sheffield United embark on another cup run, Orient are still looking for their first home win of the season.

Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924. Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries \\"museum pieces\\". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvorak and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saens and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired. Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889-91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the repertory. Elgar's principal large-scale early works were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were The Black Knight, King Olaf, The Light of Life, The Banner of St George and Caractacus. He also wrote a Te Deum and Benedictus for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of leitmotifs, but less favourably on the qualities of his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the Enigma Variations, appeared to be a sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade. by which titles?","output":"Elgar's best-known compositions are \\"orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies.\\""},{"instruction":"Q: Taylor told Ash's mom about the bad grades she had gotten. Given the context: What will Taylor want to do next? Available choices: [1]. get her grades [2]. Lie instead [3]. be responsible The answer is:","output":"[3]. Be Responsible Given the context provided, Taylor has already informed Ash's mom about the bad grades she had gotten. As a result, the next step Taylor would likely want to take is to be responsible. This could involve various actions, such as acknowledging the consequences of their poor academic performance, seeking ways to improve their grades, and learning from the experience to prevent similar issues in the future. In order to be responsible, Taylor may want to consider the following steps: 1. Reflect and learn: Taylor should take time to reflect upon the reasons for her bad grades, such as inconsistent study habits or a lack of understanding of the subject matter. This self-awareness will help her identify the areas that need improvement, thereby enabling her to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. 2. Create an action plan: Once Taylor has identified the root causes of her poor academic performance, she should develop a plan to address these issues. This may involve setting specific goals, such as dedicating more time for studying, seeking additional resources or tutoring, and staying organized to manage her school tasks efficiently. 3. Communicate with teachers and parents: Taylor should be open and honest with her teachers and parents about her struggles and the steps she is taking to improve her academic performance. They may provide valuable insights, support, and encouragement to help her stay on track. 4. Manage her time effectively: Better time management can help Taylor juggle her schoolwork, extracurricular activities, and other responsibilities more efficiently. Creating a schedule, setting priorities, and allocating specific time for studying can make a significant difference in her academic performance. 5. Stay committed: The pursuit of academic success often involves setbacks and challenges. However, Taylor must remain committed to her goals and maintain a positive mindset, as this will play a crucial role in her progress. By opting to be responsible, Taylor will not only address her current academic challenges but will also learn valuable lessons that will serve her well in future endeavors.

Deal joined Pixies in January 1986 as the band's bassist, adopting the stage name Mrs. John Murphy for the albums Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Following Doolittle and The Pixies' hiatus, she formed The Breeders with Tanya Donelly, Josephine Wiggs and later introduced her identical twin sister Kelley Deal. The Pixies broke up in early 1993, and Deal returned her focus to The Breeders, who released the platinum-selling album Last Splash in 1993. Context: Deal became the bassist and backing vocalist for Pixies in January 1986, after answering an advertisement in the Boston Phoenix that said, \\"\\"Band seeks bassist into Husker Du and Peter, Paul and Mary. Please - no chops.\\" Deal was the only person to call them, even though her main instrument was guitar. She borrowed her sister Kelley's bass guitar to use in the band. To complete the lineup, she suggested they hire David Lovering as drummer, a friend of her husband, whom she met at her wedding reception. For the release of the band's first recording Come on Pilgrim (1987), Deal used the nom de disque \\"Mrs. John Murphy\\" in the liner notes. She chose the name as an ironic feminist joke, after conversing with a lady who wished to be called only by her husband's name as a form of respect. For Surfer Rosa (1988), Deal sang lead vocals on the album's only single, \\"Gigantic\\" ( sample ), which she co-wrote with Black Francis. Doolittle followed a year later, with Deal contributing the song \\"Silver\\" and appearing on slide guitar. By this time, however, tensions began to develop between her and Francis, with bickering and standoffs between the two marring the album's recording sessions. This led to increased stress between the band members. Murphy commented that during the sessions, it \\"went from just all fun to work\\". Exhaustion, from releasing three records in two years and constant touring, contributed to the friction, particularly between Francis and Deal. The tension and exhaustion culminated at the end of the US \\"Fuck or Fight\\" tour, where they were too tired to attend the end-of-tour party. The band soon announced a hiatus. Question: Why was this bad Answer:","output":"This was bad because when the band members, like Kim Deal and Black Francis, started to argue and have disagreements, it made it difficult for them to work together to create music. They were also very tired from making many records and going on tours. Because of these problems, the band members became unhappy and needed to take a break from playing music together. This was not good for the fans who loved their music and wanted to hear more from them."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

(The Washington Post) A Russian jet was shot down by Turkish warplanes on Nov. 24, 2015, the first time since 1952 that a NATO jet shot down a Russian jet. (The Washington Post) The downing of a Russian warplane by Turkish F-16s over the Syrian border has split two obstinate strongmen deeply involved in Syria’s increasingly crowded civil war: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Officials from both countries on Wednesday discounted the possibility of direct conflict over the downing. “We are not going to wage a war on Turkey,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters, although he said Moscow viewed the attack as a “planned provocation.” The Turkish government offered its condolences for the deaths of a Russian pilot and a marine in the downing of the plane and an attempted rescue of its crew, Russia’s first combat fatalities in the country’s two-month-old airstrike campaign in Syria. But the incident has revealed the potential for conflict between foreign powers supporting and opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad despite a shared opposition to the Islamic State. In particular, Russian airstrikes against Turkish-backed rebel groups have fomented deep frustration in Ankara. “There is a clear message from the Turks with this downing of a Russian jet,” said Mustafa Alani, a Middle East expert at the Geneva-based Gulf Research Center. “It is a check on Russia’s policy in the region. Russia can’t do whatever it wants.” Russia says its Su-24 bomber did not violate Turkish airspace, but Turkish officials say it did. Putin hypothesized Tuesday that even if the plane did briefly enter Turkish airspace, it was not a threat. [This is the Russian plane that Turkey just shot down] In Moscow at least, the event is being seen as something larger than an attack on an errant jet. “The conflict happened because Russia was attacking rebel groups allied with Turkey,” said Alexander Baunov, an analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center, when asked about the possibility of an accidental clash. “It’s wrong to say that this happened because of anything like crowded skies.” The Russian Defense Ministry announced in a statement Wednesday that Russian fighter jets will now escort the bombers, and Moscow will move into Syria powerful new ground-to-air missiles that can reach across the country and far into Turkey from the Russian air base in the province of Latakia on Syria’s Mediterranean coast. Additionally, analysts say, Russia will choose from a menu of asymmetric responses in retaliation against Turkey, including informal economic sanctions and providing military aid to Turkey’s enemies, including the Kurds. “Of course, Russia is going to intensify strikes on that part of Syria and on those groups that are affiliated with Turkey,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian political analyst. He added that Russia probably would not scale back its deployment in Syria because of the incident. 1 of 7 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The moment when a Russian warplane is shot down by Turkey View Photos Russia confirmed its plane had been downed but denied it had violated Turkish airspace during a bombing campaign in Syria.

Nov. 24, 2015 A still image from video footage shows the burning trail of a Russian fighter jet after being shot down near the Turkish-Syrian border. The jet was reportedly downed by Turkish forces, Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported, citing sources in the presidency. Haberturk TV Channel/via European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. On Wednesday evening, Turkey’s state-run news agency, Anadolu, reported that Russian airstrikes targeted Turkish aid vehicles in the Syrian border town of Azzaz, killing at least seven drivers. The town is a hub for supplies being delivered from Turkey to Syrian rebels fighting government forces in the nearby city of Aleppo. The details of the incident could not be assessed independently. Shady al-Ouaineh, a media ­representative for Determined Storm, a rebel group associated with the Free Syrian Army, said in a telephone interview that Russia had dramatically intensified air raids in rebel-held areas of Latakia province. Syrian government forces and allied Shiite militiamen from Iraq, backed by Russian air cover, have been trying to advance on some of the last opposition holdouts in the province, said Ouaineh, close to where the Russian jet was shot down. “It is clear Russia is taking out its revenge on us here,” he said. [NATO faces new Mideast crisis after downing of Russian jet by Turkey] Russian attitudes toward Turkey, which were reasonably friendly a year ago, have turned cold with alarming speed. Most Russian tour operators stopped selling travel packages to Turkey on Wednesday. Protesters in Moscow pelted the Turkish Embassy with eggs and rocks, shattering windows. Russian lawmakers introduced a bill that would criminalize denying that the mass killings of Armenians in 1915 by the Ottoman Empire was a “genocide.” The issue remains highly sensitive: Turkey acknowledges that atrocities occurred but has long denied that what took place constituted a genocide. Last December, Russia diverted a planned gas line away from Europe to Turkey in order to spurn the West. That project’s fate is also now in doubt. “The consequences are going to be significant,” Lukyanov said. Russia will seek retribution against Turkey but wants to avoid antagonizing the West, Baunov said. “If this becomes a fight between Russia and the West, then that goes against the goals of the intervention in the first place: to escape international isolation connected to sanctions,” he said. Those sanctions were imposed after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and backed separatist rebels in Ukraine’s southeast. President Obama, meeting with French President François Hollande in Washington on Tuesday, said that Turkey had a right to defend its airspace and accused Russia of attacking moderate opposition groups as opposed to the Islamic State. Russia has said it carries out airstrikes only against terrorist organizations. “They are operating very close to a Turkish border and they are going after a moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey but a wide range of countries,” Obama said. At the same time he discouraged “any kind of escalation.” [U.S., France to press allies for more assets in fight against the Islamic State] The frantic Russian search for the missing bomber crew was marred by the death of a marine on an Mi-8 helicopter hit by an antitank missile. “One on board was wounded when he parachuted down and killed in a savage way on the ground by the jihadists,” Alexander Orlov, the Russian ambassador to France, told Europe 1 radio. “The other managed to escape and, according to the latest information, has been picked up by the Syrian army and should be going back to the Russian air force base.” Putin has promised the Russian public a limited engagement in Syria, with no ground forces, to limit casualties. Although the Syrian army has managed to halt a rebel offensive, Russian air power has not yet led to a significant turn of the tide in the war. “Turkey dealt a major blow to Putin, and now he’s been placed between a rock and a hard place,” said Fawaz A. Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. “There could be mission creep where Russia will get entangled in an unwinnable war.” Naylor reported from Beirut.

With its latest flagship device, HTC is taking this a step further by allowing the phone to be operated with a squeeze. HTC Vive's £200 wireless upgrade kit launches spring 2017 VR HTC Vive's £200 wireless upgrade kit launches spring 2017 Advertisement The Taiwanese firm has launched the HTC U11 with a feature dubbed Edge Sense. It says by giving the 5.5-inch phone a \\"squeeze\\", it's possible to use the phone's apps, camera, and more. The squeeze function, which works on the edges of the device, operates in two ways. Pressure sensors on the phone are located below the volume buttons on the sides of the device. A short squeeze can be configured to open an app, while a long squeeze can launch Google's Assistant or Amazon's Alexa. HTC Read next HTC launches a new platform for the Vive Standalone VR headset, no PC required HTC launches a new platform for the Vive Standalone VR headset, no PC required We've yet to see the squeeze function in action but HTC is promising a wide range of customisation from the new phone interaction. Its promotional materials, published around the phone's launch, say it is possible to take photos with the 12MP rear camera and 16MP front camera; launch a text message with a squeeze, and use the phone's voice recognition to send messages. \\"Before, it was a hassle to reach these features, but we simplified it into a single motion,\\" HTC says. HTC Setting aside this apparent time-saving gimmick, the HTC U11 is being launched in five colours and measures 153.9 x 75.9 x 7.9mm, making it around 5mm shorter than the iPhone 7 Plus and 6mm shorter than the Samsung Galaxy 8 Plus. Four of the HTC's colours – silver, blue, black and white – will be available in the UK when the phone launches in June and the red variation will come later this year. The HTC U11 will go on sale for £649 at launch from Carphone Warehouse, EE, O2, Amazon, Very.co.uk, Argos and the Taiwanese company itself. Advertisement Inside the smartphone is a 3000mAh battery, 64/128GB of storage, a Snapdragon 835 processor (up to 2.45 Ghz), and 4/6GB of RAM, depending on the specifications you select. There's also the usual array of NFC, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi support as well as a fingerprint sensor, light sensor, proximity sensor, magnetic sensor, and gyroscope. HTC Four microphones built into the device are used for audio recording and a 'liquid glass surface' makes the silver HTC U11, at least from pictures, to be one of the shiniest, most reflective phones on the market. Advertisement At its launch, the device will run Android 7.1, the latest version of the Google-owned operating system. The version of Nougat has support for Google's Daydream VR and circular Android icons. HTC also claims the U11 is the first smartphone to be able to use a \\"hands-free wake word\\" to access Amazon's AI assistant, Alexa. The 'always-on' voice commands allow the phone to be listening for the trigger word which then launches the digital assistant when called upon. Google and Apple both have similar features with their 'Okay, Google' and 'Hey Siri' commands. Expand your mind with WIRED's pick of the best podcasts ||||| But this is all table stakes for a modern, high-end smartphone. With the U11, the real magic starts when you turn up the pressure. The U11's hallmark feature is Edge Sense, which relies on pressure sensors embedded in the phone's sides. They can detect minute changes in how firmly you grip your phone, and -- more importantly -- can be used to trigger shortcuts and app actions. Let's say you're wearing gloves and feel the sudden, overbearing urge to take a selfie. You could give the U11 a quick squeeze to launch the camera, and another to snap a photo. With the \\"advanced\\" mode enabled, you can even set up different shortcuts for quick squeezes and longer squeeze-and-holds. Having the pressure-sensitive equivalent of some convenience keys is neat, but after seeing more nuanced controls in the HTC Ocean videos leaked a while back, we're left with three words: \\"Is this it?\\" Don't get us wrong: the pressure sensing worked well enough, but we're not sold on its utility just yet. HTC is also working on what could generously be described as \\"AI overload.\\" Check it out: the U11 will ship with Google's Assistant onboard, and will get Alexa via software update shortly after launch. HTC says that, thanks to the Snapdragon 835, the U11 can listen for and respond to different wake words -- that is, it should never confuse an \\"OK, Google\\" with a question for Alexa. Even better, you won't need an app running in the foreground like you did with the Alexa experiece on Huawei's Mate 9. We don't know when Motorola's Alexa efforts will be revealed, but it seems like Alexa on the U11 is the version to beat. Beyond those two, the U11 will also come with HTC's own Sense Assistant, which is meant to chew on your schedule and behavior to offer suggestions like when to bring an umbrella to work. Yeah, that's right: the U11 can have up to three virtual assistants working at the same time. We weren't kidding about overload. For some, though, the U11's audio chops might be the game-changer. There's more space inside the phone for a speaker chamber, which makes audio sound far louder and richer than on the HTC 10. (In fact, HTC product planning AVP Nigel Newby-House cranked up the U11's volume all the way outside a crowded conference room in our office, and the people inside were getting noticeably pissed by the din.) And while there's no headphone jack, at least HTC is using Type-C to add to the audio experience. Remember how the U Ultra's USonic earbuds used a sonar-like pulse to intepret the contours of your ear and tune your tunes accordingly? The U11's earbuds do that too, but they also pack-in active noise cancellation without the need for bulky battery module. They draw power from your phone's battery, which is both good and bad: you'll never have to remember to charge your headphones before a flight, but you can bet it'll impact your battery life somewhat. We'll withhold our judgment on the U11 until we've played with final US units, but we're cautiously optimistic about this thing's chances. The fact that it has a competitive set of guts is reassuring, especially when these slices of silicon are potent enough to deliver near-seamless performance. Still, when the marquee feature -- that pressure-sensing business -- seems to boil down into a minor convenience, we have to wonder if HTC's focus on thoughtful, clever features is starting to waver. ||||| You can’t really blame HTC for embracing a gimmick. A rough couple of years for the smartphone maker warrants some experimentation to help set its devices apart from myriad other Android manufacturers. Edge Sense, sadly, however, is not going to be that technology. The company teased the handset’s squeezable sides in a handful of short web videos, and now that the U 11 has been officially unveiled, we can confirm that the flagship’s most compelling feature isn’t really all that compelling in its current form. The feature uses sensors built into the sides of the phone to detect pressure as the user squeezes the phone. At present, actual applications for the tech mean that it essentially doubles as something akin to the convenience key that BlackBerry has sported for ages. Basically, you assign functionality to it, so it can, say, launch your favorite app. In a briefing ahead of this morning’s launch in Taiwan, VP of Product Planning, Nigel Newby-House suggested that this is just the first glimpse into future functionality for Edge Sense — and certainly there’s a lot to be done with a new set of on-board sensors. As it stands, however, Edge Sense is really much more than a glorified button with the addition of an actual new physical button like Samsung did with the devoted Bixby key on the S8. It probably speaks a bit to the unfulfilled promise of the feature that Newby-House opted not to lead with this feature in our conversation. Most of the talk about the device centered around design decision. And it’s true — the U11 is a good-looking phone, borrowing some cues from the recently announced Ultra. In fact, the company seems to consider the Ultra something of a dry run for the new flagship — or at the very least, a way of introducing the new product line and design language. Probably something you don’t want to hear if you shelled out the 750 for the handset in the last couple of months. The company calls it Liquid Design — a nod to the curvature and the notion that dipping it in liquid would fill in the sorts of gaps you usually get when two different surfaces are juxtaposed. Not the most straightforward idea, but it sounds nice, so fine. And while it looks pretty good, as well, it’s not exactly unique, bringing to mind other flagships like the S8, particularly given the use of a reflective metallic paint job. The screen is 5.5-inches, the same size you’ll get on the iPhone 7 Plus. The company says it flirted with the idea of switching up the aspect ratio like LG and Samsung have with their newest flagships (and, according to rumors, like Apple is planning on the 8), but opted to stick with 16:9 for “software reasons” — in other words, it didn’t want to deal with having to rejigger everything on that end. That said, it’s still entertaining the possibility of jumping on the tall phone ship for future devices. The company has already been on the anti-headphone jack train for a little bit. The Ultra found the company planting its flag on that beach. “The headphone jack is going away,” Newby-House told me matter-of-factly. “Let’s just get on with it.” Of course, not everyone concurs, and other companies haven’t aligned themselves with Apple as quickly as many analysts expected. Even Motorola, which joined the part with the Moto Z, appears as if it’s regretting that move. That said, the company is still committed as ever to audio — a welcome change from most companies, for whom audio is a fifth- or sixth-tier priority. The phone features a new version BoomSound, one of the better audio systems presently on handsets — though, weirdly, the company opted against dual front-facing speakers in order to accommodate a fingerprint sensor, even as more and more companies are moving biometrics to the back of the device. The phone also ships with company’s proprietary USonic earbuds, which sport active noise canceling. The most interesting piece of the audio puzzle, however, is the fact that there are four microphones in the handset. This is largely based on a newfound interest in other people’s smart assistants (though it’s got some positive implication for video recording, as well). HTC has worked directly with Qualcomm to design a device capable of responding to two different wake words for two different assistants — neither of which are the in-house one it announced along with the Ultra. Instead, the company is embracing both Assistant and Alexa. The company says it sees advantages to both and doesn’t want to play favorites. Fair enough. There’s certainly a lot to be said for putting the ultimate decision in the hands of the user. That said, this doesn’t seem to bode well for the company’s faith in its own Sense Companion. And while it says this doesn’t preclude it from going full-on Bixby in the future, it currently views its own play as more of a supplement to Assistant and Alexa. “We’ve never envisioned Companion as a wake word-type assistant,” says Newby-House. The company is more focused on using it to enhance its own software offerings, likely because it simply isn’t robust enough to be considered a standalone. That said, the company’s getting pretty close to a shit-or-get-off-the-pot moment here. The whole idea of a smart assistant has created a single unified experience — having an assistant designed to work with other assistants kind of flies in the face of all of that. Oh, and Alexa isn’t shipping with the device out of the box. The company says the functionality should arrive within a month. This is kind of par for the course, at this point. Huawei ran up against a similar roadblock. Part of the issue is the fact that companies have to work directly with Amazon to customize the experience. When it does arrive, it will be in the form of an over-the-air update. It will also be in the box for devices later. When that functionality does arrive, however, it will bring more traditional functionality. Calling, texting and the like will come down the road. ||||| Want to launch the camera on the HTC U11? Just squeeze. When the phone's pressure-sensitive sides register your tightened grip, it'll open the app you've programmed in. Say you've squeezed the camera app open. You can squeeze again to take a picture. A long squeeze might open and close the flashlight, or toggle Wi-Fi or a voice recording. Or another app of your choice. What's going on is an entirely new way to interact with a phone. Called Edge Sense, this feature marks the first time any phonemaker has used touch like this. For HTC, a company that has itself felt the squeeze from larger rivals such as Samsung, Apple and LG, the U11's grippy new feature presents an opportunity to step out of others' shadows with an industry first. Giving a phone pressure-sensitive sides is an incredibly interesting innovation, and one that raises a lot of questions: is this a natural way to open shortcuts, or is it better suited to some other task? Will it be accurate or will mispresses abound? Is it a useless gimmick, or the start of exciting things to come? I don't have an answer to that yet, but after my brief time with the phone, I did try out many of the launch options, and I like that an animation of squeezed-in sides lets you know the feature's working. I found the motion easy to execute, but I did sometimes long-squeeze when I meant to short-squeeze. I think muscle memory will take care of that down the road. I also think this method of app-launching would only be useful for the apps I open all the time (which takes that voice recorder out of the running). The bigger question for HTC is if the U11's fresh look and feel, and high end specs are enough to make a dent in Samsung and Apple's overwhelming lead -- squeeze feature or no. From what I've seen of the U11 so far, its premium hardware stands the best chance of any HTC phone in quite awhile. The rest will come down to performance, and how well HTC can gets its phone in front of buyers. Price and release date In the US, the HTC U11 sells for 649 -- you'll be able to pick it up in sapphire blue, amazing silver and brilliant black. Buy the unlocked version from htc.com, and AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon carrier versions from Amazon. The phone will arrive on your doorstep in June. You'll also be able to buy the blue and black HTC U11 from Sprint. The phone goes on sale June 9, but early preorders will also get you two Amazon Echo (129.00 at Adorama) Dot (29.95 at Amazon.com) speakers. It'll cost 0 down and29 per month for 24 months, for a grand total of 696. It's too soon to say how the U11 performs compares to the Galaxy S8 (578.95 at Amazon.com) and LG G6, and if buyers connect with its glass design and squeeze effects. Gorgeous glass design, advanced processor and everything else The Big Squeeze sure is attention-grabbing, but it's really one small feature in what's shaping up to be a pretty good package. Enlarge Image Josh Miller/CNET You get a 5.5-inch display with a QHD, or 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution (same as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6), so there's plenty of screen to interact with. Then there's the body itself. The U11 refines the gorgeous \\"melted\\" glass design of the U Ultra (390.00 at Amazon.com). It really does look like pools of liquid. It's striking. It's also highly reflective and smudges up quickly. The phone meets a water-resistant rating of IP67, which helps keep water away for up to 30 minutes and 3 feet (1 meter). I like that the 12-megapixel rear camera sits flush on the design; it's good that the lens doesn't poke out. If you follow camera specs, the U11 uses dual-pixel autofocus technology rather than laser autofocus (this should help it focus faster), and has an aperture of f1.7 (versus f1.8 on the HTC 10 (384.99 at Amazon.com)). Your front-facing camera is a 16-megapixel wide-angle lens (150 degrees). Camera images seemed completely usable in my quick tests, but I didn't have the time to really dig deep into setting or image quality. Other things to know going in: There's no headset jack, so you'll need to plug the included earbuds into the USB-C port. HTC includes an adapter if you prefer to use your own headphones. Google Assistant is on board. Amazon Alexa assistant will launch with a wake word. (HTC will add this about a month after the U11 goes on sale.) Audio quality so far seems loud, clear and rich. The Edge Sense squeeze feature is pressure sensitive and will work underwater and through some cases. HTC will also make a model in solar red (expect it to sell in select regions). ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer HTC has unveiled its new flagship smartphone, the U11, a touch-sensitive device that can be operated with a squeeze.

The variety of speaker builds suits individual speakers for different tasks. For casual music listening, a pair of bookshelf speakers would be more than enough. Can we infer the following? there is no way of shopping for speakers.","output":"No, we cannot infer that there is no way of shopping for speakers. In fact, there is a method to shop for speakers effectively by considering various factors and types of speakers before making a purchase. Here's a detailed guide on how you can shop for the right speakers based on your specific needs and preferences: 1. Determine your audio needs and usage: Start by considering the primary purpose of the speakers - whether they will be used mostly for watching movies, playing music, or gaming. Defining your primary use will make it easier for you to decide which type of speakers to look for. 2. Establish your budget: Decide on a budget before beginning your search for speakers. Speakers can vary greatly in price, ranging from inexpensive models to high-end, costly options. By establishing your budget, you can narrow down your choices and make a more informed decision. 3. Choose the type of speakers: There is a wide variety of speaker types to choose from, such as bookshelf speakers, floor-standing speakers, in-wall or in-ceiling speakers, and satellite speakers. Each speaker type is designed for specific audio needs and room configurations. Consider the available space in your room, the aesthetics of your interior, and your audio preferences when selecting the type of speakers. 4. Consider the speaker specifications: Pay attention to the specifications of the speakers which include: a. Frequency response: This refers to the range of frequencies a speaker can reproduce. Look for a wider frequency range for better audio quality. b. Sensitivity: A speaker's sensitivity is a measure of how effectively it converts power into volume. Higher sensitivity speakers will require less power from the amplifier to produce the same volume output. c. Impedance: Impedance is the resistance a speaker provides to the electrical signal from the amplifier. Most home speakers have an impedance of 4, 6, or 8 ohms, and you should ensure that your amplifier or receiver is compatible with the speaker's impedance. 5. Test before you buy: If possible, listen to the speakers before making a purchase. Bring along your favorite music or movie to test the sound quality, and spend some time adjusting the settings to see how the speakers perform in different scenarios. 6. Research and read reviews: Look up reviews and recommendations from other users, audiophile publications, and online forums to get a better understanding of a speaker's performance and reliability. This first-hand feedback from other users may prove invaluable in your decision-making process. 7. Consider the brand and warranty: While brand alone is not necessarily an indicator of speaker quality, reputable brands generally offer better customer support and warranties for their products. 8. Factor in additional equipment: Your speaker setup may require an amplifier, receiver, speaker cable, or speaker stands. Some kits may include these components, but in most cases, you have to purchase them separately. Therefore, consider the additional cost of these components while establishing your budget and ensure their compatibility with your chosen speakers. Shopping for speakers involves a range of considerations, including your audio needs, budget, speaker types, specifications, testing, research, the brand, and additional equipment compatibility. By taking the time to analyze these factors, you can effectively shop for speakers that will suit your needs and provide the desired audio experience."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve -2436*s - 57381 + 264613 + 119192 = 0 for s.

This time, it's Orlando Hernandez.","output":"Title: \\"Orlando Hernandez's Health Concerns Loom Over the New York Yankees as Playoffs Approach: The Latest Challenges and Potential Impacts\\" With the highly-anticipated playoffs just around the corner, the New York Yankees are grappling with a troubling predicament amidst a growing list of uncertainties concerning their starting pitchers. At the heart of these troubles is the condition of Orlando Hernandez, a crucial figure in their roster whose health may determine the team's postseason success. The situation has escalated from a manageable issue to a full-blown crisis in recent weeks, and the Yankees are now scrambling to address the problem before it jeopardizes their playoff chances. As fans and rivals alike anxiously await updates on Hernandez's health, this in-depth analysis delves into the factors surrounding his injury, the implications for the team, and potential strategies to mitigate the potential fallout. To begin with, it is essential to understand the extent of Hernandez's injury and its origins. The veteran right-hander, known for his commanding presence on the mound and contributions to the Yankees' success in the past, now faces a potentially career-threatening situation that could significantly impact the ball club's performance in the coming weeks. A sudden flare-up in pain has turned a once-manageable health concern into a dire predicament that has the Yankees on high alert. This development not only jeopardizes Hernandez's availability for the playoffs, but it also raises concerns about the overall health of the team's pitching staff. In recent months, the Yankees have seen a series of injuries afflict their roster, leaving the team vulnerable and exposed in the face of increasingly competitive opponents. With Hernandez's health now under the microscope, anxious fans wonder if he will join the ranks of the injured or if he can recover in time to make a difference in the postseason. The implications of this scenario, if left unresolved, could be disastrous for the Yankees, who have their sights set on securing a playoff berth and making a deep run in the postseason. With Hernandez sidelined, the team may be forced to overburden other pitchers, leading to further setbacks and potentially exacerbating the current health crisis. In such a scenario, the domino effect of one injury could jeopardize the entire season's ambitions. To combat this pressing issue and mitigate the potential fallout, the Yankees need to devise an effective strategy that balances the welfare of their star pitcher and the overall performance of the team. This may involve exploring alternative roster options or managing Hernandez's workload carefully to ensure he remains healthy enough to contribute when it matters most. In conclusion, the fate of the New York Yankees in the upcoming playoffs may well lie in the hands of Orlando Hernandez as much as in the rest of the roster. By addressing his health concerns and taking the appropriate measures to safeguard both player and team, the organization can pave the way for a triumphant postseason campaign. As the countdown to the playoffs shrinks with each passing day, finding a solution to this precarious situation will be paramount for the Yankees' success."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Now, let's think step by step:","output":"A: No, the subject of Parsifal is not taken from British folklore. Parsifal, also spelled as Percival or Perceval, is a significant figure in Arthurian legend, originating from French and Welsh literary traditions. Now, let's break it down step by step: 1. Origin of Parsifal: The character first appeared in the medieval French romance \\"Le Conte du Graal\\" (The Grail Story) written by Chrétien de Troyes around 1180. In this story, the protagonist is called Perceval. Chrétien's work remains incomplete, and other authors later added their own versions and expansions to the cycles of Arthurian Romances. 2. Influence of Welsh mythology: Before the emergence of the Arthurian legends in French literature, there are references to Welsh myths featuring characters similar to Perceval. One such prominent character is Peredur, a hero in the Welsh \\"Mabinogion\\" collection of tales. Some scholars believe that Peredur might have influenced Chrétien's character Perceval. 3. Transition to German legend: In Germany, the character Perceval evolved into Parzival, the protagonist of the 13th-century epic poem by Wolfram von Eschenbach. Wolfram's version contains elements unique to his adaptation, including the expansion of the story's spiritual themes. 4. Parsifal in opera: In the 19th century, the German composer Richard Wagner adapted Wolfram's medieval epic poem into an opera entitled \\"Parsifal.\\" Wagner's \\"Parsifal\\" explored the themes of compassion, redemption, rites, and personal transformation. The opera premiered in 1882 and has since become one of Wagner's most celebrated works. In conclusion, the subject of Parsifal has its origins in French and Welsh literature and later evolved through different adaptations, including German versions. It is not directly taken from British folklore but is closely related to the Arthurian legends found in the folklore and mythology of the British Isles."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

The set of habitat brain regions (A-green) and diet (B-red and blue) regions where the new knowledge was stored. (L refers to left hemisphere of the brain.) Courtesy of Carnegie Mellon University Cutting-edge brain imaging technology has offered the first glimpse into how new concepts develop in the human brain. The research, carried out at Carnegie Mellon University and published in Human Brain Mapping, involved teaching people a new concept and observing how it was coded in the same areas of the brain through neural representations. The \\"olinguito\\" -- a largely fruit-eating carnivore species that lives in rainforest treetops, newly discovered in 2013 -- was initially used as a concept. Marcel Just, a professor of cognitive neuroscience in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, commented: \\"When people learned that the olinguito eats mainly fruit instead of meat, a region of their left inferior frontal gyrus -- as well as several other areas -- stored the new information according to its own code.\\" The findings revealed that this new knowledge of the olinguito was encoded in exactly the same parts of the brain by everyone who learned it, indicating that the brain may operate its own kind of universal filing system. In the latest research, 16 study participants were taught information about the diet and dwelling habits of eight extinct animals, in order to study the growth of the neural representations of these concepts in their brains. Drawing on the previous findings, the team predicted where this new knowledge would be stored. Just and Andrew Bauer, lead author of the study, then used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor these concepts emerging in the brain, and found that each new concept developed its own \\"unique activation signature\\". This allowed a computer program to effectively work out which of the eight animals a participant was thinking about at any given time -- essentially allowing the scientists to read their minds. Don't miss Interestingly, the animals with close similarities (such as habitat) had closely matched activation signatures, and once a property of an animal had been learned, it stayed intact in the brain even after new ones had been taught -- providing a new insight into the neural durability of the things we learn. Bauer commented: \\"Each time we learn something, we permanently change our brains in a systematic way. It was exciting to see our study successfully implant the information about extinct animals into the expected locations in the brain's filing system.\\" It's hoped that the research may be able to help shape future teaching methods in schools, and also give a clearer picture of how knowledge is \\"lost\\" as a result of serious brain injuries and conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. ||||| Thanks to Carnegie Mellon University advances in brain imaging technology, we now know how specific concrete objects are coded in the brain, to the point where we can identify which object, such as a house or a banana, someone is thinking about from its brain activation signature. Now, CMU scientists are applying this knowledge about the neural representations of familiar concepts by teaching people new concepts and watching the new neural representations develop. Published in Human Brain Mapping, the scientists have - for the first time - documented the formation of a newly learned concept inside the brain and show that it occurs in the same brain areas for everyone.This image illustrates how the study participants learned about the habitat and the diet of eight animals, such as the cytar (not its real zoological name).

Credit: Carnegie Mellon University Thanks to Carnegie Mellon University advances in brain imaging technology, we now know how specific concrete objects are coded in the brain, to the point where we can identify which object, such as a house or a banana, someone is thinking about from its brain activation signature. Now, CMU scientists are applying this knowledge about the neural representations of familiar concepts by teaching people new concepts and watching the new neural representations develop. Published in Human Brain Mapping, the scientists have—for the first time—documented the formation of a newly learned concept inside the brain and show that it occurs in the same brain areas for everyone. This novel research merges brain science and instructional innovation, two of Carnegie Mellon's university-wide initiatives—BrainHub, which focuses on how the structure and activity of the brain give rise to complex behaviors, and the Simon Initiative, which aims to measurably improve student learning outcomes by harnessing decades of learning science research. Marcel Just, a leading neuroscientist, pointed to the Smithsonian Institute's 2013 announcement about the olinguito, a newly identified carnivore species that mainly eats fruits and lives by itself in the treetops of rainforests, as an example of the type of new concept that people learn. 'Millions of people read the information about the olinguito and in doing so permanently changed their own brains,' said Just, the D.O. Hebb University Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience in CMU's Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. 'Our research happened to be examining this process precisely at that time in a laboratory setting. When people learned that the olinguito eats mainly fruit instead of meat, a region of their left inferior frontal gyrus—as well as several other areas—stored the new information according to its own code.' Just added, 'The new knowledge gained from the Smithsonian's announcement became encoded in the same brain areas in every person that learned the new information, because all brains appear to use the same filing system.' For the study, Andrew Bauer, a Ph.D. student in psychology, and Just taught 16 study participants diet and dwelling information about extinct animals to monitor the growth of the neural representations of eight new animal concepts in the participants' brains. Drawing on previous findings, the research team knew 'where' to expect the new knowledge to emerge in the brains of their participants. Information about dwellings and information about eating have each been shown to reside in their own set of brain regions, regions that are common across people. Over the course of an hour, the study participants were given a zoology mini-tutorial on the diets and habitats of the animals, while the scientists used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor the emergence of the concepts in the participants' brains. As the new properties were taught, the activation levels in the eating regions and the dwelling regions changed. One important result was that after the zoology tutorial, each one of the eight animal concepts developed its own unique activation signature. This made it possible for a computer program to determine which of the eight animals a participant was thinking about at a given time. In effect, the program was reading their minds as they contemplated a brand-new thought. But even though the animals had unique activation signatures, the animals that shared similar properties (such as a similar habitat) had similar activation signatures. That is, a resemblance between the properties of two animals resulted in a resemblance between their activation signatures. This finding shows that the activation signatures are not just arbitrary patterns, but are meaningful and interpretable. 'The activation signature of a concept is a composite of the different types of knowledge of the concept that a person has stored, and each type of knowledge is stored in its own characteristic set of regions,' Just said. Another important result was that once a property of an animal was learned, it remained intact in the brain, even after other properties of the animal had been learned. This finding indicates the relative neural durability of what we learn. 'Each time we learn something, we permanently change our brains in a systematic way,' said Bauer, the study's lead author. 'It was exciting to see our study successfully implant the information about extinct animals into the expected locations in the brain's filing system.' Just believes that the study provides a foundation for brain researchers to trace how a new concept makes its way into the brain from the words and graphics used to teach it, foreshadowing a capability to assess the progress in learning a complicated concept like those in a high-school physics lesson. fMRI pattern analyses could diagnose which aspects of a concept students misunderstand (or lack), in a way that could guide the next iteration of instruction. The results from this study also indicate that it may be possible to use a similar approach to understand the 'loss' of knowledge in various brain disorders, such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease, or due to brain injuries. The loss of a concept in the brain may be the reverse of the process that the study observed.

Various factors, including increased exposure to electronic devices, high-stress work environments, and poor lifestyle choices, have contributed to this growing concern. As a result, there is a rising need for solutions that address these sleep complications and improve overall sleep quality. Hypothesis: Incorporating mindfulness meditation techniques into one's daily routine can lead to a reduction in sleep disorders and improve overall sleep quality among adults. The hypothesis suggests that by practicing mindfulness meditation daily, individuals may experience a decrease in the occurrence and severity of sleep disorders, thereby improving sleep quality. This improvement in sleep quality may, in turn, have additional positive effects on a person's overall health and well-being. The following sections will examine the potential mechanisms of this hypothesis and review relevant studies supporting its validity. 1. Potential Mechanisms Mindfulness meditation involves paying attention to one's thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations without judgment or reacting to them. The practice aims to cultivate a state of relaxed, focused awareness, which can lead to a calmer mind and body. Some potential mechanisms through which mindfulness meditation may improve sleep quality include: a) Reduction of Stress: Chronic stress is a common cause of sleep disorders. Mindfulness techniques can help reduce stress by promoting relaxation and enabling individuals to cope with daily stressors more effectively. b) Regulation of Melatonin: Melatonin, the hormone responsible for regulating sleep, can be negatively impacted by exposure to electronic devices and erratic sleep schedules. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to help regulate melatonin levels, improving sleep quality. c) Cognitive and Emotional Processing: Mindfulness can help individuals process their thoughts and emotions more effectively, reducing rumination and feelings of anxiety that often contribute to sleep disturbances. 2. Supporting Studies Several studies have been conducted to explore the link between mindfulness meditation and improved sleep quality. a) A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2015 found that adults with moderate sleep disturbances who participated in a mindfulness meditation program experienced significant improvements in their sleep quality compared to those who did not participate. b) Research published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences in 2016 reported that mindfulness meditation training among older adults led to significant improvements in sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, and depressive symptoms. c) A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Sleep Medicine Reviews in 2017 found that mindfulness meditation had a moderate effect on improving sleep quality and reducing insomnia symptoms. In conclusion, the hypothesis suggests that incorporating mindfulness meditation techniques into one's daily routine can lead to a reduction in sleep disorders and improve overall sleep quality. This hypothesis is supported by several studies indicating that mindfulness meditation can indeed lead to these improvements. By reducing stress, regulating melatonin levels, and improving cognitive and emotional processing, mindfulness meditation can play a significant role in enhancing sleep quality and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Italian.

But photos of the Parisian preteen, whose lanky body and gap-toothed pout bring to mind full-grown size-zero magazine cover girls, have reignited the debate over the sexualization of young girls. Wearing makeup, high heels and haute couture, Blondeau looks a far cry from a typical 10-year-old. Even in childish smocks and cotton tees, her expressions are oddly adult -- a product, perhaps, of living half her young life in the fashion world (she reportedly hit the runway for Jean-Paul Gauthier at age 5). And some say Blondeau's grown-up beauty is giving other young girls unhealthy ideas about how they should look. \\"We don't want kids to grow up too fast,\\" said Shari Miles-Cohen, senior director of women's programs for the American Psychological Association. \\"We want them to be able to develop physically, emotionally, psychologically and socially at appropriate rates for their age.\\" French Vogue provocatively poked at this principle, running photos of Blondeau and two other tweens playing designer dress-up captioned with, \\"Quel maquillage à quel âge?\\" -- What makeup at what age? But a shot of Blondeau wearing a red dress and stilettos lying on a tiger skin rug had critics crying foul. \\"This isn't edgy. It's inappropriate, and creepy, and I never want to see a nine-year-old girl in high-heeled leopard print bedroom slippers ever again,\\" wrote Chloe Angyal, editor of Feminsting.com. Sexualized images can have lasting effects on the young girls who see them. An APA taskforce found that sexualization by the media affects how girls think about femininity and sexuality, promoting \\"appearance and physical attractiveness\\" as key values. It's also linked to low self-esteem, eating disorders and depression. \\"The research clearly shows that the fashion industry affects girls and women's images of themselves and their self-esteem if they do not meet the industry 'image' that is currently in vogue,\\" said Paul Miller, associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University in Phoenix. \\"Even the very young are quite conscious of media images of what is 'pretty' and desirable.\\" In a photo not affiliated with Vogue, Blondeau poses topless on a bed with a young male playmate propositioning a pillow fight. And in another, she wears hip-slung jeans and no top with beaded necklaces covering her would-be breasts. Many in the industry have defended the work as art. Others say it crosses a line. \\"Any creepy child pornographer could plead 'artistic license,'\\" said Miller. Thylane Loubry Blondeau's grown-up look is creating a stir. Blondeau is not the first mini model to stir up the sexualization debate. In 2007, a 13-year-old Dakota Fanning posed in a controversial campaign for Marc Jacobs. Now 13-year-old Elle Fanning has followed in her sister's footsteps as the face of Jacobs' Fall 2011 campaign. The controversy extends to pint-sized pageant queens and prospective pop stars, too. A YouTube video of 8- and 9-year-olds dancing to Beyonce's \\"Single Ladies\\" spurred a similar uproar last year. \\"People have always admired young ballerinas in scanty costumes, but those performances weren't explicitly sexual,\\" Vivian Friedman, child psychologist and professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told ABC News at the time. \\"There was an aesthetic that didn't remind you of being in bed.\\" Photos of Blondeau, some in pink tutus and others in bed, illustrate the disparity. \\"[The photos] clearly create an image of the girl as an adult woman, both in the clothing, the postures and emotional content of the images,\\" said Miller. \\"The message is that very young girls can be dressed and viewed as young adult women.\\" ||||| Blonde lady from Romania mature on home alone cam.

A:","output":"In the autumn season The process of deciduous trees losing their leaves primarily occurs during the autumn season. Deciduous trees, which include maple, oak, and elm, have evolved to shed their leaves as a survival mechanism in response to changes in their environment. As the daylight hours decrease and the temperatures begin to cool, certain cues trigger a chemical process in the tree to conserve energy and prepare for the upcoming winter. The cause of this foliage change can be attributed to several factors, primarily the reduction in sunlight and cooler temperatures. The tree's chlorophyll - the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis - starts to break down, revealing other pigments such as carotenoids and anthocyanins, which produce the signature hues of yellow, orange, and red. These pigments, along with a decrease in water and nutrient availability, play a part in the spectacular display of fall colors seen in deciduous forests. Once the chemical changes have taken place and the leaves have lost their connection to the tree, they eventually fall to the ground due to gravity and wind. This process is known as abscission, and it allows the tree to conserve energy and water over the winter months when resources are more scarce. The fallen leaves also contribute important nutrients back into the soil through the process of decomposition, providing a natural fertilizer for the tree when it starts growing again in the spring. Autumn, therefore, is the correct answer to the question \\"Fall begins as deciduous trees lose their leaves when?\\" because it is the season when this process predominantly takes place. The other options, such as dormancy, reduced plant growth, deforestation, physical weathering, and other seasons, do not accurately account for the specific time frame or the mechanisms behind deciduous trees shedding their leaves."},{"instruction":"Select your answer from the options.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the given equation -71*s - 897*s - 13133 - 12194 = -151*s for s, we should perform the following steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation on both sides. This requires combining like terms. Combining like terms on the left side of equation: -71*s - 897*s equals -968*s. Similarly, combining -13133 - 12194 equals -25327. So, the new equation after combining like terms will be -968*s - 25327 = -151*s. Step 2: Move all terms involving 's' to one side of the equation and constants to another side. This gives us -968*s - (-151*s) = 25327. Step 3: Perform the subtraction operation on the left side of the equation. -968*s + 151*s equals -817*s. So, the new equation is now -817*s = 25327. Step 4: We need to isolate s in the equation to solve for it. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by -817 : s = 25327 / -817 Step 5: Perform the division operation. s ≈ -31 So, the solution to the given equation is s ≈ -31."},{"instruction":"Q:Facts: - years active: 1983 -- present - caption: benoît poelvoorde in 2013 - birth date: 22 september 1964 - name: benoît poelvoorde - image: benoît poelvoorde 2013.jpg - birth place: namur , belgium - occupation: actor Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of benoît poelvoorde .

Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins. The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope. Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers. Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Alaska's coastline also has potential in which three environmentally friendly energy types?","output":"Alaska's coastline has potential in three environmentally friendly energy sources: hydroelectric power, wind energy, and geothermal energy. 1. Hydroelectric Power: Alaska has immense potential for hydroelectric power due to its countless rivers and significant annual precipitation. In hydroelectric power generation, the kinetic energy of falling or rushing water is harnessed to rotate turbines which in turn produce electricity. As the water cycle is continuously replenished by solar power, hydroelectric power is a sustainable and greenhouse gas emission-free source of power which could be harnessed on a large scale in Alaska. Facilities such as the large hydroelectric power plant at Bradley Lake are good examples of this potential. 2. Wind Energy: The large swaths of Alaska's coastline offer significant potential for wind energy. Wind energy is harnessed by wind turbines which convert the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy that can be used directly for tasks like grinding grain, or it can be converted into electricity by a generator. Wind is plentiful and inexhaustible, making wind energy a sustainable source of power. Large wind farms consisting of hundreds to thousands of individual wind turbines could be developed along the Alaskan coastline, providing power with minimal environmental impact. 3. Geothermal Energy: Certain parts of Alaska's coastline have significant geothermal potential. The heat from the Earth's inner layers can be used to produce steam which in turn can be used to generate electricity. Geothermal plants require no fuel, and can therefore decrease reliance on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The geothermal fields near Makushin Volcano on Unalaska Island are examples of places with geothermal potential in Alaska. In all three cases, the respective technologies allow for the production of large amounts of energy with minimal environmental impact, as they do not require burning fossil fuels or releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. With the right infrastructure and investment, these sources could greatly contribute to the energy output of the state and nation."},{"instruction":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: Marius561 , 25 years old, United Kingdom","output":"Okay, little buddy!

Hence, the overall sentiment of the review is negative."},{"instruction":"Take all of your calculated returns and add them together. Then, divide by the number of returns you are using, n, to find the mean return. This represents the average return over the time period you are measuring. Specifically, the mean, m, is calculated as follows: m =(R1+R2+...Rn)/(n). For example, imagine that you had 5 periods that had calculated returns of 0.2, -0.1, -0.3, 0.4, and 0.1. You would add these together to get 0.3 then divide by the number of periods, n, which is 5. Therefore, your mean, m, would be 0.3/5, or 0.06. For every return, Rn, a deviation, Dn, from the mean return, m, can be found. The equation for finding Dn can be expressed simply as Dn=Rn-m. Complete this calculation for all returns within the range you are measuring. Using the previous example, you would subtract your mean, 0.06, from each of the returns to get a deviation for each. These would be: D1=0.2-0.06, or 0.14 D2=-0.1-0.06, or -0.16 D3=-0.3-0.06, or -0.36 D4=0.4-0.06, or 0.34 D5=0.1-0.06, or 0.04 Your next step is to find the mean variance of the returns by summing the squared individual deviations from the mean of the returns. The equation for finding the variance, S, can be expressed as: S=(D1^2+D2^2+...Dn^2)/(n-1). Again, sum the squares of the deviations, Dn, and divide by the total number of variances minus 1, n-1, to get your mean variance. First, square your deviations from the last step. These would be, in order: 0.0196, 0.0256, 0.1296, 0.1156, 0.0016. Sum these numbers to get 0.292. Then, divide by n-1, which is 4, to get 0.073. So, S=0.073 in the example. The volatility is calculated as the square root of the variance, S. This can be calculated as V=sqrt(S). This \\"square root\\" measures the deviation of a set of returns (perhaps daily, weekly or monthly returns) from their mean. It is also called the Root Mean Square, or RMS, of the deviations from the mean return. It is also called the standard deviation of the returns. In the example, this would just be the square root of S, which is 0.073. So, V=0.270. This number has been rounded to three decimal places. You may choose to keep more decimals to be more accurate. A stock whose price varies wildly (meaning a wide variation in returns) will have a large volatility compared to a stock whose returns have a small variation. By way of comparison, for money in a bank account with a fixed interest rate, every return equals the mean (i.e., there's no deviation) and the volatility is 0. Summary:","output":"1. Calculate the mean return (m) by adding all the individual returns (Rn) and dividing by the total number of returns (n): m = (R1+R2+...Rn)/(n). 2. Calculate the deviation (Dn) for each return by subtracting the mean return (m) from each return (Rn): Dn = Rn - m. 3. Find the mean variance (S) by summing the squared deviations (Dn^2) and dividing by (n-1): S = (D1^2+D2^2+...Dn^2)/(n-1). 4. Calculate the volatility (V) as the square root of the variance (S): V = sqrt(S). In the provided example, the mean return is 0.06, the mean variance is 0.073, and the volatility is 0.270. Volatility represents the level of variation in returns and can be used to assess the risk of an investment. A stock with a higher volatility has more price fluctuation, while a lower volatility indicates more stable returns."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Dear Anna, It is nice to see the photo of your room.

The figure was said to make appearances in the park near dusk, always wearing a dark hood and made no noise, seemingly floating through the park. As children scrambled up and down the playground equipment and families picnicked, the two young women found solace in their shared curiosity about the town's local phenomenon. Emily leaned in closer, her eyes wide with intrigue and a hint of trepidation. She recounted her experience from the night before, when she and her dog had taken their evening walk through the park. “I may not have seen the figure myself,” she started, “But my dog Daisy definitely sensed something. Daisy’s a loving, loyal pup, but she’s never been one to be easily spooked. She was on edge, ears perked up and fur bristled, staring off into the trees on the north side of the park. The sun was setting, casting eerie shadows on the ground, and I could've sworn I heard the faintest rustling in the bushes.” Betty nodded solemnly, her curiosity growing stronger by the second. “Is that when you decided to take matters into your own hands and started looking for any clues as to the identity of this mysterious figure?” “That’s right,” Emily confirmed. “I may be afraid of the unknown, but I'm not going to let fear stop me from getting to the bottom of this. We deserve to know if there's something sinister happening in our small town. Over the next few days, the pair began investigating by talking to locals who had claimed to have seen the dark, hooded figure. They combed through online forums and gathered newspaper clippings of recent strange occurrences in the town. They even went as far as talking to the police and local historians. As the sun finally began to set one evening, the girls, having exhausted all other leads, decided to take a walk through the park themselves. The air grew cooler while the leaves rustled gently with a haunting melody. As they reached the edge of the woods, they noticed a faint light flickering behind a thick group of bushes. Cautiously, Betty and Emily moved closer. As they approached, the light grew stronger and they soon came upon a small clearing. To their surprise, they found the hooded figure standing in a circle of candles, deep in what appeared to be a meditative trance. Unbeknownst to the girls, the mysterious figure wasn't sinister in nature but was instead a local historian, conducting a ritual to communicate with the spirits of the town's past in an attempt to learn more about their history. The discovery set the two friends on an unexpectedly fascinating journey, one that would lead them to uncover long-lost secrets about their small town.

To begin with, the establishment was not very clean – there was a noticeably sticky floor and the whole place had an unpleasant odor. Immediately upon entering, we could sense the lack of attention to detail. The wait time was also quite absurd; we stood at the entrance for a good 15 minutes without being greeted or offered a seat. This, despite the fact that there were several empty tables. It seemed like the staff was too busy chatting amongst themselves to notice the customers. When we were finally seated, the menu was nothing to write home about. The options were limited and surprisingly unimpressive for the prices they were charging. Nevertheless, we were hungry and decided to take our chances. Unfortunately, the food was subpar. My dish was not cooked properly, and my partner's dish lacked any real flavor, making it evident that the ingredients were not fresh. To make matters worse, our waiter didn't return to check on us even a single time after bringing us the food. We would've liked to order more beverages, but seeing as we couldn't get his attention, we decided against it. It was frustrating to see other staff members idling in the corners while we could have used some assistance. Even when it came time to pay the bill, we had to wait for what felt like forever before we could finally leave this establishment. Overall, I am regretful that we even decided to eat here in the first place.

The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and more than 110,000 lakes, covering approximately 15.6 percent or 101,593 square kilometres (39,225 sq mi) of its surface area. Manitoba's major lakes are Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on Lake Winnipeg's east side are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.Baldy Mountain is the province's highest point at 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level, and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level. Riding Mountain, the Pembina Hills, Sandilands Provincial Forest, and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions. Much of the province's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including Whiteshell, Atikaki, and Nopiming Provincial Parks.Extensive agriculture is found only in the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.

She wasn't out chasing butterflies or climbing a tree, but resting snugly in her basket. One morning, as the sun was just starting to wake up, Esther's owner was getting ready for work. He found her in her basket not feeling very well. It appeared that poor Esther was wounded. She had been hurt very close to her lung - so close, it was almost like the width of a game of darts! Darts are small pointed things that people throw at a target in a game. In this situation, 'Dart' is being used to explain how close the hurt was to Esther's lung. It simply means that the wound was very very close to hurting her lung. Seeing Esther in pain, her owner quickly rushed her to those nice people who look after animals when they're ill - the veterinarians, or vets for short. These vets decided they needed to operate straight away to get Esther feeling better. Operating is just a fancy word for doing special doctor stuff to help fix Esther's hurt. The good news is, after the operation, the vets have said Esther should get completely better. That's what we call a full recovery. So, even though Esther had a big fright, she was very brave and is now on her way to feeling her old self again. Now, here comes the mystery part of our story. The Police in Kent - they're the people who make sure everyone is safe and following the rules - are looking into what happened to Esther on February 25th. They want to find out how she got hurt and make sure it doesn't happen to any other cuddly cats. So, let's all cross our fingers and toes, and send our warmest wishes to brave little Esther for a speedy recovery. Her adventure was very scary, but remember, she's going to be okay in the end.

This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“.

They say the luminous glow looks like the northern lights, but is up to a million times brighter and more red than green in colour. The findings are reported in the journal Nature. Dr Stuart Littlefair, an astronomer from the University of Sheffield, said: \\"This is the first time that we have confirmed we are seeing auroras on brown dwarfs.\\" Charged interaction Shimmering auroras are some of the Earth's most dazzling displays. This luminous glow can also appear around all the planets in our Solar System. They are caused when charged particles from the Sun interact with the atmosphere. But the illuminated brown dwarf, an object which is too small to have become a star but too massive to be a planet, lies further out in the galaxy. Called LSR J1835, it was observed using the Very Large Array radio telescope and the Hale and Keck optical telescopes. The scientists watched the object as it rapidly rotated, and observed how the light varied. \\"The brightness changes are consistent with what you would expect from auroras,\\" said Dr Littlefair. The dwarf's aurora is mainly red in colour because the charged particles are mainly interacting with hydrogen in its atmosphere. On Earth, the greenish glow is caused as the electrons from the Sun hit oxygen atoms. However, scientists are puzzled about how the light show is being generated. The brown dwarf is a sort of failed star itself, and has no other star like the Sun nearby to blast it with charged particles. \\"It is possible material is being stripped off the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons,\\" said Dr Littlefair. Another option is an as-yet-undetected planet or moon around the dwarf is throwing off material to light it up. Some of Jupiter's auroras are produced in this way, as charged particles are emitted from volcanoes on its moon Io. The discovery is also helping scientists to better understand brown dwarfs. There is some debate over whether they are more star-like in their nature, or whether they have planetary attributes. \\"If you are working in brown dwarfs, it matters whether you think of them as small stars or big planets,\\" said Dr Littlefair. \\"We already known from observations of brown dwarfs that they have clouds in the atmosphere. Now we know they also show auroras, it is yet more reason to consider brown dwarfs as scaled-up versions of planets rather than scaled-down version of stars.\\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter. Summary:","output":"An international team of scientists has detected an aurora, similar to Earth's Northern Lights, around a brown dwarf 18 light years away in the Lyra constellation.

This discovery, reported in the journal Nature, marks the first time that auroras have been confirmed on brown dwarfs, which are objects too small to become stars but too massive to be planets. The aurora's red color is due to charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the brown dwarf's atmosphere.

The ruling bars him from the Ironman France competition scheduled for June 24 in Nice, the agency said. The decision comes after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, or USADA, confirmed Wednesday that it is opening proceedings against Armstrong and five former teammates. Armstrong said Wednesday the agency intends to \\"dredge up discredited\\" doping allegations against him in a bid to strip him of his seven Tour de France victories. The champion cyclist has always insisted he never took performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong was accused of using such drugs by other riders, but never failed a drug test. Armstrong started doing triathlons after retiring from cycling, and won a half-Ironman in Hawaii less than two weeks ago. He was the fastest cyclist and runner on the 70.3-mile course, and the third-fastest swimmer. But with the new investigation open, the World Triathlon Corporation suspended him. WTC rules \\"dictate an athlete is ineligible to compete during an open investigation. Armstrong is therefore suspended from competing in WTC-owned and licensed races pending further review,\\" the organization said in a statement. USA Triathlon said he can still compete in its events. \\"Lance Armstrong is currently still eligible to compete in all USA Triathlon-sanctioned races, with the exception of Ironman events as stated earlier by the World Triathlon Corporation,\\" said the body's communications director Chuck Menke. Armstrong lashed out at his accusers and the doping agency on Wednesday. \\"Unlike many of my accusers, I have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance, passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one,\\" Armstrong said on his website. \\"That USADA ignores this fundamental distinction and charges me instead of the admitted dopers says far more about USADA, its lack of fairness and this vendetta than it does about my guilt or innocence.\\" A 15-page agency letter was sent Tuesday to Armstrong and several others. The Washington Post was the first to report the story. Justice Department prosecutors in February said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against Armstrong. They had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. \\"These are the very same charges and the same witnesses that the Justice Department chose not to pursue after a two-year investigation,\\" Armstrong said Wednesday. In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said it collected blood samples from Armstrong in 2009 and 2010 that were \\"fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions.\\" EPO, or erythropoietin, boosts the number of blood cells. Opinion: Why fans shouldn't forgive Armstrong. The letter said Armstrong and five former cycling team associates engaged in a doping conspiracy from 1998 to 2011. Riders will testify that Armstrong used EPO, blood transfusions, testosterone and masking agents, and that he distributed and administered drugs to other cyclists from 1998 to 2005, according to the letter. In a statement obtained by CNN, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis T. Tygart said the five other people, formerly associated with the U.S. Postal Service pro cycling team, are three team doctors and two team officials. The letter included written notice of alleged anti-doping rule violations, Tygart said. \\"USADA only initiates matters supported by the evidence,\\" Tygart said. \\"We do not choose whether or not we do our job based on outside pressures, intimidation or for any reason other than the evidence.\\" All named individuals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, he added. According to its website, the quasi-government agency is recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic events in the United States. Armstrong said the organization has \\"self-written rules\\" and punishes first and adjudicates the facts later. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France, resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Armstrong came out fighting once again in May 2011 in the face of fresh allegations made on the CBS News \\"60 Minutes\\" show by another American, Tyler Hamilton. In the CBS interview, Hamilton -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw Armstrong use blood boosting EPO in 1999, the year of his first Tour de France victory. \\"I saw it in his refrigerator,\\" Hamilton told the American news program. \\"I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did, like I did many, many times.\\" On his Twitter page, Armstrong at the time said he never failed a drug test. Ex-teammate: I saw Lance Armstrong inject banned substances. CNN's Steve Almasy, Gary Morley, Terry Frieden and Jason Durand contributed to this report. Highlights:","output":"1. Lance Armstrong, a famous cyclist, is not allowed to compete in international Ironman triathlon contests while under investigation for doping. 2. The World Triathlon Corporation made this decision, and it means he can't race in Ironman France in June. 3. Doping is when athletes use drugs to help them perform better, which is not allowed. 4.

No (B). Yes Q: Question: how does rainfall in new york affect the environment?? Would \\"New York's population density has environmental pros and cons.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"While \\"New York's population density has environmental pros and cons\\" is a valid statement, it is not the most suitable answer to the question at hand. Instead, a detailed and long answer focusing specifically on the impact of rainfall in New York on the environment would be more appropriate. Rainfall plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecosystems and water resources of any region. In New York, as in other parts of the world, precipitation affects various environmental aspects, including water quality, soil erosion, vegetation, and wildlife habitats. Some of the ways rainfall impacts the environment in New York are as follows: 1. Water supply: An adequate amount of rainfall is essential to replenish New York's reservoirs, rivers, lakes, and groundwater sources. These sources act as vital components of the city's water supply system. Insufficient rainfall can lead to water scarcity and droughts, while excessive rainfall can result in floods and waterlogging. 2. Water quality: Rainfall helps in diluting pollutants present in water bodies, thereby improving their overall quality. However, in heavily urbanized areas like New York City, stormwater runoff can pick up pollutants, such as pesticides, chemicals, and trash, from streets and other impervious surfaces. This polluted runoff then enters the city's waterways, potentially contaminating the water supply. 3. Soil erosion and sedimentation: Heavy rainfall can result in soil erosion, as raindrops dislodge soil particles and wash them away. In New York, soil erosion can lead to sedimentation in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, which reduces water quality and capacity. Erosion also contributes to a loss of fertile topsoil, which negatively impacts agricultural productivity and vegetation growth. 4. Vegetation and wildlife: Rainfall has a direct bearing on the health and distribution of plant and animal species. Abundant rainfall in New York facilitates the growth of diverse vegetation, including forests, wetlands, and grasslands, providing important habitats for wildlife. However, extreme rainfall events can damage plant and animal habitats, as excessive moisture and flooding can alter ecosystems and lead to the loss of native species. 5. Urban heat island effect: Urban areas, such as New York City, tend to be warmer than their surrounding rural areas due to the large concentration of buildings, pavement, and other impervious surfaces. Rainfall can help to alleviate the urban heat island effect by reducing temperatures through evaporation and cooling surfaces. 6. Air quality: Rainfall can improve air quality by removing airborne particles and pollutants. When raindrops fall through the atmosphere, they capture particulate matter and gases, thus cleansing the air. This can be particularly beneficial in heavily populated and industrialized areas like New York, where air pollution is a common concern. In conclusion, rainfall in New York significantly affects various aspects of the environment, including water supply, water quality, soil erosion, vegetation, wildlife habitats, urban heat island effect, and air quality. While the statement \\"New York's population density has environmental pros and cons\\" is true, it does not address the specific question of how rainfall impacts the environment in the region. Instead, a comprehensive analysis of the various ways rainfall influences the environment is necessary to provide a substantive answer to the question."},{"instruction":"How To Keep Your Employees Focused And Functioning, Even Now Welcome to the new normal. As we hobble toward economic recovery, the work environment remains anxious and uncertain. Employees may be grateful for their paychecks, but numerous studies reveal what most leaders already know anecdotally: that a great many workers are disengaged and even hate their jobs. I call them the walking dead, those employees who show up for work with their bodies but leave their brains, and their souls, at home. In the old days leaders typically rallied the troops by painting a picture of a glorious, prosperous future, garlanded with bonuses, perks and advancement. How do you get people excited about their jobs today when you're utterly uncertain about tomorrow? It can be done, and it's actually not that complicated. We all have three basic human needs: We need to be connected to other people, we need to know that our work matters, and we need leaders who respond to those first two needs when times are tough. Fortunately, meeting these three intrinsic needs needn't cost your organization a dime. And it's something you can do every single day, no matter how uncertain the environment. Here's how anyone can tap into the big three human needs to help their organization stay productive, engaged and, dare I say it, happy during times of angst and uncertainty: 1. Connection: Get emotional. Whenever I start to talk about emotions in the workplace, executives get uneasy. But have you ever noticed that you never hear managers saying, \\"Please don't get so excited\\" or \\"Please quit being so happy\\"? The reality is that emotions are at the center of everything we do. The leadership challenge isn't to avoid them. It's to ignite the positive ones. The secret of getting people more engaged in their work is for their leaders to become more engaged with them. That means being willing to show up emotionally as well as intellectually. What would happen if you walked in one day, looked one of your employees in the eye and told him or her, \\"I'm so grateful you're on our team, and it's not just about the work; it's also about how much you as a person add to this place. I love having you here\\"? It sounds hokey, but every time I suggest this in a workshop or presentation, people's eyes fill with tears. Human connection isn't a nice thing to have; it's a must-have. Meaningful connections provide people with the internal fortitude they need to stay productive during tough times. You want to be connected to your people, and you also want them to be connected to one another. The way you do that is by talking, with real spoken words, not e-mail edicts, asking people how they're doing and actually listening to their answers, and by providing them with opportunities to interact with one another. 2. Meaning: Provide Context. We all want to know that we make a difference in the world. When you put someone's work into a meaningful context, you tap into the deepest yearning of his or her soul. The challenge is that most people's days are so hectic and their jobs so compartmentalized that they often miss the larger story of how their work touches the lives of others. Leaders who reframe daily tasks by providing personal context quell the angst of uncertainty by giving their employees something more meaningful to think about. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about how to help employees stay focused and happy at work, even when times are hard. The article says that everyone needs to feel connected, to know their work matters, and to have leaders who understand and support these needs. The article suggests ways to do this: 1. Connection: Managers should be open about their feelings and let their workers know they're valued - not just for what they work they do, but for who they are as people. Talking, listening, and creating opportunities for interaction can help employees feel more connected to each other. 2. Meaning: Managers should help workers understand how their individual tasks fit into the big picture - how they make a difference. This can give workers something more meaningful to focus on and can help reduce worry and uncertainty. The article makes it clear that paying attention to these needs won't cost the company any money, and it's something all managers can do, no matter what else is going on."},{"instruction":"Do these questions have the same meaning?

Article:","output":"Title: Let's Learn About Moving Forward After Losing Your Loved One Once upon a time, there was a person who lost their very special friend (spouse) and they were very, very sad. It's important to know that when someone you love goes away forever, you might feel lots and lots of different feelings. First things first, you should know that it's okay to feel many different things when someone goes away. There are a few steps people often go through: like being very sad, being angry, not wanting to believe it, and finally starting to be okay again. These are like the different colors of a rainbow, and just like the colors of the rainbow, it's okay for them to change. Second, when someone goes away forever, sometimes they ask you to do special things for them – like plant a tree, take care of their puppy or even just remember to laugh. It's nice to do these things to help remember them and how much they loved you. But, remember that becoming happy again isn't like magic – it takes time. Just like how it takes time for a caterpillar to change into a butterfly. But eventually, you'll feel more normal. Let's make sure we're talking about just being really, really sad and not something called depression. Being really sad means you miss your special friend a lot. But depression is like a big cloud that makes everything look gray. If you are feeling like everything is gray, it's important to talk to a grown-up you trust, like Mommy, Daddy, or a teacher, so they can help you. Now, some people might say you're not being sad the \\"right\\" way. But guess what? There's no one right way to feel when someone goes away forever. So, don't listen to those people and just feel what you feel. And remember, you can make choices that help you feel better. Maybe you want to talk about your special friend or look at photos of happy times together. Or maybe you want to hug a teddy bear or eat ice cream for dinner. Whichever choices you make, it's okay. Lastly, don't worry! You won't forget your special friend, even when you start feeling better. They've left a little piece of themselves in your heart, and that's a place they'll always stay. In conclusion, when someone you love goes away forever, it's okay to feel many different things. It's important to know that you have choices, and you can become happy again over time, just like a caterpillar changes into a butterfly. And no matter what, you'll always remember your special friend in your heart."},{"instruction":"Translate to Czech: No. Memory imprints.","output":"Ne.

The musical is based on Lynn Riggs' 1931 play, Green Grow the Lilacs. Set in Oklahoma Territory outside the town of Claremore in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry. A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fiancee, Ado Annie. At the social, during an upbeat square dance (\\"The Farmer and the Cowman\\"), the rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys over fences and water rights has led to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone. Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. In an effort to rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will's souvenirs from Kansas City for 50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will's Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids 50 on Ado Annie's basket, not realizing that without the 50, he would no longer have the money her father insisted he needs to \\"purchase\\" marriage with her. Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids 51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the 50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey's basket comes up for auction. Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey's basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money. Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket. Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance. Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (\\"All Er Nuthin'\\"). Jud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her. When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her. She then fires him as her farm hand, screaming at him to get off her property. Jud furiously threatens Laurey before he departs; Laurey bursts into tears and calls for Curly. She tells him that she has fired Jud and is frightened by what Jud might do now. Curly, seeing that she has turned to him for guidance and safety, reassures her and proposes to her, and she accepts (\\"People Will Say We're In Love (Reprise)\\"). He then realizes that he must now become a farmer. Afterwards, Ali Hakim decides to leave the territory and bids Ado Annie goodbye after telling her Will is the man she should marry. Three weeks later, Laurey and Curly are married and everyone rejoices in celebration of the territory's impending statehood (\\"Oklahoma!\\"). During the celebration, Ali Hakim returns with his new wife, Gertie, whom he unwillingly married after being threatened by her father with a shotgun. A drunken Jud reappears, harasses Laurey by kissing her and punches Curly, and they begin to fist fight. Jud attacks Curly with a knife and Curly dodges, causing Jud to fall on his own knife. Jud soon dies. The wedding guests hold a makeshift trial for Curly, at Aunt Eller's urging, as the couple is due to leave for their honeymoon. The judge, Andrew Carnes, declares the verdict: \\"not guilty!\\" Curly and Laurey depart on their honeymoon in the surrey with the fringe on top (\\"Finale Ultimo\\").

His work as co-editor on the comics magazines Arcade and Raw has been influential, and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for The New Yorker, where he made several high-profile and sometimes controversial covers. He is married to designer and editor Hired by Tina Brown as a contributing artist in 1992, Spiegelman worked for The New Yorker for ten years. Spiegelman's first cover appeared on the February 15, 1993, Valentine's Day issue and showed a black West Indian woman and a Hasidic man kissing. The cover caused turmoil at The New Yorker offices. Spiegelman intended it to reference the Crown Heights riot of 1991 in which racial tensions led to the murder of a Jewish yeshiva student. Spiegelman had twenty-one New Yorker covers published, and submitted a number which were rejected for being too outrageous. Within The New Yorker's pages, Spiegelman contributed strips such as a collaboration titled \\"In the Dumps\\" with children's illustrator Maurice Sendak and an obituary to Charles M. Schulz titled \\"Abstract Thought is a Warm Puppy\\". An essay he had published there on Jack Cole, the creator of Plastic Man, called \\"Forms Stretched to their Limits\\" was to form the basis for a book in 2001 about Cole called Jack Cole and Plastic Man: Forms Stretched to their Limits. The same year, Voyager Company published a CD-ROM version of Maus with extensive supplementary material called The Complete Maus, and Spiegelman illustrated a 1923 poem by Joseph Moncure March called The Wild Party. Spiegelman contributed the essay \\"Getting in Touch With My Inner Racist\\" in the September 1, 1997 issue of Mother Jones. Spiegelman's influence and connections in New York cartooning circles drew the ire of political cartoonist Ted Rall in 1999. In an article titled \\"The King of Comix\\" in The Village Voice, Rall accused Spiegelman of the power to \\"make or break\\" a cartoonist's career in New York, while denigrating Spiegelman as \\"a guy with one great book in him\\". Cartoonist Danny Hellman responded by sending a forged email under Rall's name to thirty professionals; the prank escalated until Rall launched a defamation suit against Hellman for 1.5 million. Hellman published a \\"Legal Action Comics\\" benefit book to cover his legal costs, to which Spiegelman contributed a back-cover cartoon in which he relieves himself on a Rall-shaped urinal. In 1997, Spiegelman had his first children's book published: Open Me... I'm a Dog, with a narrator who tries to convince its readers that it is a dog via pop-ups and an attached leash. From 2000 to 2003 Spiegelman and Mouly edited three issues of the children's comics anthology Little Lit, with contributions from Raw alumni and children's book authors and illustrators.

Judging by the billions of inflows into ETFs that seek to minimize volatility, investors have sought to apply that maxim to the markets. Low volatility ETFs like the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio have trounced the S&P 500 over the past year. But now, investors are better off playing offense, according to Citigroup Inc. Chief Equity Strategist Tobias Levkovich. \\"When everyone plays defense, it is no longer uniquely defensive positioning and it seems like almost no one has the ability to score (or outperform),\\" he writes. \\"Behavioral psychology has generated a flocking into quality and minimum volatility funds, underscoring the mindset that is considering global economic and earnings concerns.\\" A widespread dearth of enthusiasm over the outlook for equities or the global economy suggests that all these investors rushing into low-volatility ETFs are too skittish, per Levkovich. \\"The time to play investment defense is when sentiment is unworried or giddy, not skeptical or fearful,\\" writes the strategist. Moreover, crowded trades are typically the ones most vulnerable to abrupt reversals — the kind that belie the low volatility characterization of these ETFs. Brean Capital LLC Head of Macro Strategy Peter Tchir suggested that the inflows into these ETFs, in light of the mindset of the people who buy them, could be \\"sowing the seeds of their own destruction.\\" Investors who are attracted to low volatility ETFs, he reasons, skew towards those with a relatively low risk tolerance who are conservative by nature. Invesco PowerShares' Dan Draper, for instance, has indicated that the flood of money into these ETFs has been fueled by baby boomers who need to stay in riskier assets due to inadequate savings and for whom memories of the financial crisis are all too fresh. Tchir says these \\"weak hands\\" are likely to be sellers in the event of market turmoil. In addition, he worries that these massive inflows into low volatility ETFs have made the stocks they own pricey. \\"We have some small portion of the stock market universe that is being identified as ideal by a large amount of new money based at least partly on recent trading patterns,\\" he writes. However, low-volatility ETFs regularly rebalance, which should (over time) mitigate some of Tchir's concerns about their holdings consisting of stocks with lofty valuations. The strategist believes that these funds are poised to underperform whether the market goes up or down. \\"The potentially expensive stocks are in the hands of potentially the most nervous investors still in the equity market,\\" concludes Tchir. \\"The risk of disappointment seems high and the conditional probability of selling the funds if they underperform also seems high to me.\\" Write a title for it.","output":"Citigroup Strategist Recommends Investors Switch to Playing Offense as Low Volatility ETFs Become Vulnerable to Abrupt Reversals"},{"instruction":"Does the sentence \\"Despite lowering rates in surrounding countries, cholera rates were reported in November 2012 to be on the rise, with 1,500 cases reported and nine deaths.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"How many died from cholera in a 2008 epidemic?\\"","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given question to identify the information needed.

His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. Context: In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised 4,000 (108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \\"God gave me money\\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \\"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\\" At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from .35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water. In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \\"The Flats\\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed. While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost 2.50 each ended up only .96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself. In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \\"critical\\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for 72,500 (equivalent to 1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \\"It was the day that determined my career.\\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry. Question: What else went on during this time? Answer:","output":"During this time, the United States experienced significant changes and developments that contributed to the overall context in which Rockefeller was building his business empire. Some of the key events and developments during this period include: 1. The American Civil War (1861-1865): The nation was divided over issues such as states' rights and slavery, which ultimately led to the Civil War. The economy of the northern states, including New York where Rockefeller's business was based, benefited from the war due to increased industrial production. 2. Expansion of the railroads: The construction of railroads saw considerable growth during this period, connecting different parts of the country and facilitating the transportation of goods. This greatly benefited businesses like Rockefeller's, as it made it easier and cheaper to transport oil and other products to market. 3. Technological advancements: The latter half of the 19th century witnessed a wide range of technological innovations that impacted various industries, including the oil industry. Innovations such as the development of the drilling process and refining technologies enabled the production of affordable oil products, which in turn created a demand for oil-based products and stimulated economic growth. 4. The end of the Civil War and Reconstruction Era (1865-1877): With the Civil War coming to an end, the United States entered a period of reconstruction and focused on rebuilding its social, political, and economic structures. This period also witnessed a surge in industrialization, particularly in the northern states which had a direct impact on the growth of Rockefeller's oil business. 5. Growth of urbanization and industrialization: The late 19th century was marked by rapid urbanization and industrial growth in the United States. Cities expanded, and the population shifted from rural to urban areas. This fueled the demand for oil and its by-products, as people needed fuel for heating, lighting, and manufacturing purposes. In conclusion, the period during which Rockefeller's oil empire was being built saw many transformative events and developments that affected the landscape of the United States. His business benefited from these changes and played a significant role in shaping the nation's economy during this time."},{"instruction":"Review: the nonconformist in us Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

How many steps does she take walking to and from school in five days? Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"To find out how many steps Raine takes walking to and from school in five days, we need to consider a few factors. Here's a breakdown of the calculation: 1. Number of steps from home to school: Raine takes 150 steps to walk from her house to school. 2. Number of steps to walk back home: Since the distance between her house and school remains the same, Raine would also need 150 steps to walk back home from school. 3. Steps taken daily: To find out how many steps she takes in a day (to and from school), we add the steps from home to school (150 steps) and the steps from school to home (150 steps). So, Raine takes a total of 150 + 150 = 300 steps daily. 4. Steps taken in five days: Finally, to calculate the number of steps she takes in five days, we multiply the daily steps (300 steps) by 5 (days/week). So, Raine takes 300*5 = 1,500 steps in five days. Therefore, Raine takes a total of 1,500 steps walking to and from school in five days."},{"instruction":"Does the sentence \\"Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a video link.\\" answer the question \\"What is another name for videophone calls?\\" OPTIONS: [-] yes.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","output":"Trenbolone 100 is the healthy, muscle-building steroid for which the world has been waiting for a very long time. Its origins come directly from Finaplix pellets, which were primarily used as a veterinary product to help increase muscle mass and appetite in livestock. Over time, athletes and bodybuilders sought this potent compound as a means to quickly build muscle and enhance physical performance. Trenbolone 100, also known as Trenbolone Acetate, is an anabolic and androgenic steroid (AAS) that has gained immense popularity due to its ability to promote significant muscle growth and strength. It is considered one of the most powerful steroids available, even outperforming the likes of testosterone in terms of its anabolic effects. The benefits of Trenbolone 100 are numerous and include increased protein synthesis and nitrogen retention, leading to enhanced muscle growth and repair. It also boosts red blood cell production, which provides more oxygen to muscles during workouts, leading to better endurance and stamina. Moreover, Trenbolone is known for its ability to improve nutrient efficiency, allowing the body to use nutrients more effectively to fuel muscle growth and recovery. With Trenbolone 100, users can expect impressive results in terms of muscle size, strength, and overall physical performance. That being said, it is crucial to note that the use of Trenbolone, like any other anabolic steroid, must be approached with caution and responsibility. Although it has fewer side effects than other steroids, some users may still experience side effects such as acne, hair loss, insomnia, and increased aggression. It is essential for users to adhere to the recommended dosage and cycle lengths when using Trenbolone 100, as irresponsible use can lead to more severe side effects, such as liver toxicity or cardiovascular issues. Furthermore, it is vital to follow a proper post-cycle therapy (PCT) protocol after each Trenbolone cycle to restore the body's natural hormone balance and protect long-term health. In conclusion, Trenbolone 100 is a potent and efficient steroid that, when used responsibly, can help individuals achieve significant muscle growth and improved athletic performance. However, users should educate themselves on proper usage, dosage, and PCT protocols to ensure optimal results and minimize the risk of any potential side effects. As a reminder, the use of anabolic steroids without a legitimate medical reason and under the supervision of a medical professional is not recommended."},{"instruction":"Given the following reasoning and answer, what was the question?

The test flight fails as his right wing breaks, sending him crashing into the Seine River. Later after the incident, Woody is asked by his friend, CIA file clerk Harry, to perform what appears to be a civilian paper swap in Istanbul. Upon arriving in Istanbul, he meets a beautiful Soviet named Natalia Rambova, who poses as the Soviet civilian with whom the exchange is supposed to take place, but it is later revealed that she is in fact a KGB spy. Woody does not tell Natalia his real name, and instead fabricates his identity to her as a top American agent code-named \\"Condorman\\". During the encounter, Woody fends off a group of would-be assassins and saves her life by sheer luck before accomplishing the paper trade. Impressed by Woody, and disgusted by how she was treated by her lover/boss Krokov when she returns to Moscow, Natalia decides to defect and asks the CIA to have \\"Condorman\\" be the agent that helps her.Back in Paris, Woody's encounter with Natalia inspires him to create a super heroine patterned after her named \\"Laser Lady\\". He is then notified by Harry and his boss Russ that he is to escort a defecting Soviet agent known as \\"The Bear\\". Woody refuses to do the job, but when Russ reveals that \\"The Bear\\" is Natalia, he agrees to do it on the condition that the CIA provides him with gadgetry based on his designs.Woody meets up with Natalia in Yugoslavia and protects her from Krokov's henchmen led by the homicidal, glass-eyed assassin Morovich.

While both sentences describe someone learning six tracks and writing their parts before the album was recorded, the difference lies in the words \\"practice\\" and \\"exercise.\\" \\"Practice\\" generally refers to the act of repeatedly performing an activity to improve one's skill in it, such as playing a musical instrument or working on writing parts for songs. In this context, the first sentence indicates that the individual spent three days practicing their parts in the music before the album was recorded. \\"Exercise\\" is typically associated with physical activity, such as working out or participating in sports. However, it can also mean mental or skill-related exercises, such as doing brain teasers or practicing problem-solving. Using \\"exercise\\" in the second sentence may create some confusion about what the person was doing for those three days before the album's recording.

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

We need to consider several factors and examine the overall impact of the policy to make such a conclusion. Thus, it is premature to label the policy as ineffective conclusively. First, it is essential to understand that the premise states that the current policy establishes a good framework to develop a product. This implies that the policy provides a strong foundation for product development. A solid framework can contribute to the overall effectiveness of a policy, as it sets the stage for successful project execution, alignment of goals, and efficient resource allocation. Second, the premise highlights that the policy's limitation lies in its lack of specific criteria required to move a program forward and its inability to tie knowledge to decisions for increasing investments. While these aspects of the policy might cause some delays and complications in decision-making, it does not necessarily render the policy completely ineffective. It may merely slow down certain aspects of the process or create situations where additional guidance and criteria are required to ensure smooth transitions between different stages of a program. Additionally, it is crucial to differentiate between a policy's effectiveness and its efficiency. A policy may still be effective in achieving its overall goals and objectives, even if it is not the most efficient means of reaching those goals. In the given premise, the policy might be effective in developing a product, integrating systems, or demonstrating systems despite shortcomings in moving programs forward and tying knowledge to investments. Furthermore, the policy's effectiveness may also depend on other factors, such as the people implementing it, the organizational structure, and the support from higher-ups. The success of a policy often lies in the hands of those responsible for its execution and how well they can adapt to the limitations and challenges posed by the policy's shortcomings. It is also worth considering the possibility of policy updates or amendments. If the organization recognizes the shortcomings in the existing policy and takes action to address them by incorporating specific criteria to move a program forward, the policy's effectiveness could improve, as adaptability and change are critical aspects of successful policies. In conclusion, while the hypothesis that \\"The policy's lack of criteria for moving programs forward is fatal to its ability to be effective\\" raises a valid concern, it is not necessarily true. We must examine the policy's overall impact and consider various factors such as its strengths, limitations, external factors, and adaptability to draw a definitive conclusion on its effectiveness."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = Cocum, eatType = coffee shop, food = Fast food, priceRange = more than £30, customer rating = high, familyFriendly = yes","output":"Cocum, a highly-rated family-friendly coffee shop, offers a delightful selection of scrumptious fast food dishes with prices generally exceeding £30, making it the go-to destination for customers who value exceptional dining experiences while enjoying quality time with their loved ones."},{"instruction":"Student: If \\"A large crowd of people stand behind red and blue barricades.\\" does that mean that \\"People are sitting down.\\"?

His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\".

The increased bombing is the latest evidence the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan is significantly intensifying since U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new military strategy for the country in August. Coalition planes dropped 1,186 weapons on Afghanistan during the first three months of 2018, according to figures released by U.S. Air Forces Central Command. The previous record (1,083) was set during the height of the war in 2011. The U.S. has not released 2001 to 2003 airstrike data. Those figures do not include activity by the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which has stepped up its aerial bombardment since gaining the ability to conduct airstrikes two years ago. The AAF carries out between 4 to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. If recent trends are any indication, 2018 is likely to get even more violent. Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources. But there is little indication the expanded airstrikes are helping end the conflict, says Thomas Johnson, an Afghanistan specialist who teaches national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. \\"It's basically a tactic of desperation,\\" said Johnson, author of Taliban Narratives: The Use of Power and Stories in the Afghanistan Conflict. \\"There's never been an insurgency in history that's been defeated purely through air power.\\" Even high-level U.S. military officials concede the conflict remains a stalemate.

He ended up in the solar system in search of water. He identified three planets, planet A, planet B and planet C. Little did he know that less than a hundred years ago people used to call planet A as Earth, planet B as Venus, and planet C as Mercury. Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's first identify the key pieces of information given in the paragraph: - Planet A is Earth - Planet B is Venus - The pressure on the surface of Venus is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth's surface The question is asking which planet (A or B) would have lower pressure on the surface.

The Republic of Biafra was a secessionist state in West Africa that emerged due to ethnic, economic, and political tensions in Nigeria. These tensions were primarily between the Hausa-Fulani people in the north and the Igbo people in the southeast of Nigeria. After gaining independence from Britain in 1960, Nigeria faced a series of political crises and military coups that ultimately led to growing dissatisfaction among the various ethnic groups in the country. The immediate cause for the secession can be traced back to the 1966 military coup led by General Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu, an Igbo officer. This coup resulted in the assassination of Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and several other top-ranking Nigerian politicians, most of whom were from the northern part of the country. Later that year, a counter-coup led by mainly northern military officers resulted in the deaths of many Igbo people in the north, which further heightened ethnic tensions in Nigeria. Following the outbreak of ethnic violence, around 2 million Igbos fled to the southeastern region, where they felt safer among their own ethnic group. In response to the crisis, Lieutenant Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, the military governor of the Eastern Region of Nigeria, declared the Republic of Biafra as an independent state on May 30, 1967. The secession was influenced by a desire to escape the ethnic persecution experienced by the Igbos and to establish a new nation where they could exercise self-determination. The Nigerian government, led by General Yakubu Gowon, saw the declaration of Biafra as an act of treason and vowed to reunite the country by force if necessary. Thus, the Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Biafran War, started on July 6, 1967. The war was a brutal conflict characterized by widespread famine, human rights abuses, and the displacement of millions of people. Several countries, including Zambia, Tanzania, Côte d'Ivoire, and Gabon, officially recognized the Republic of Biafra during its short-lived existence. Despite these diplomatic recognitions, Biafra was unable to garner substantial international support in its war against Nigeria. Notably, France and Israel provided limited military aid to Biafra, while the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom supported Nigeria in various capacities. The war continued for almost three years, and an estimated 1 to 3 million people, mostly civilians, died as a result of the conflict, particularly due to starvation caused by a Nigerian blockade. The uneven distribution of resources and military power ultimately led to the fall of the Republic of Biafra. On January 15, 1970, Lt. Col. Ojukwu fled the country, and his deputy, Major General Philip Effiong, announced the formal surrender of Biafra to Nigeria. The Nigerian government declared the end of the civil war on January 15, 1970, marking the reintegration of Biafra into Nigeria. In the aftermath of the Nigerian Civil War, General Gowon attempted to promote national unity and reconciliation. However, the impacts of the war on the Igbo people and Nigeria as a whole have left lasting scars that continue to fuel separatist movements and ethnic tensions in Nigeria today."},{"instruction":"In communities north of prefix = st1 /Denver, residents are pitching in to help teachers and administrators as the Vrain school District tries to solve a 13.8 million budget shortage blamed on mismanagement . \\" We're worried about out teachers and principals, and we really don't want to lose them because of this,\\" one parent said,\\" If we can help ease their financial burden, we will.\\" Teachers are grateful, but know it may be years before the district is solvent .

Please tell me if those questions are the same. pick from the following. a). no. b). yes.","output":"a) No, these questions are not the same. The first question is concerning a baby who is sick and having difficulty sleeping, while the second question relates to getting a 5-days-old baby to sleep at night. 1. How to help a sick baby get some sleep: It's essential to consider that when a baby is sick, their sleep patterns might temporarily become disrupted. As a caregiver, your primary goal is to ensure the baby feels safe, comfortable, and supported throughout the illness. To help them get some sleep, try these strategies: a) Create a calm and quiet environment: Keep noise to a minimum and darken the room as much as possible. Use a white noise machine or a fan to create a soothing background noise if needed. b) Maintain a regular routine: Stick to a consistent bedtime and napping schedule as much as possible. Familiar routines can be reassuring and help lull a baby back to sleep. c) Use a humidifier: If the baby is congested or has a respiratory illness, a humidifier can help make breathing more comfortable. It can also keep their nasal passages moist, which provides further relief. d) Elevate their head: Propping up the baby's head and chest with a pillow or folded blankets can help them breathe more comfortably in case of congestion, making it easier for them to fall asleep. e) Administer medicine as directed: Consult with your pediatrician for any recommended medications or treatments. If the baby is in pain or has a fever, appropriate medication may help them feel more comfortable and rest better. f) Offer comfort: Holding or cuddling a sick baby, gently rocking or swaying them, or using a pacifier can provide comfort and help them fall asleep. g) Keep an eye on their temperature: Continuously check the baby's temperature and call your pediatrician if it becomes too high or doesn't improve with time. h) Dress them appropriately: Make sure the baby is dressed in comfortable, temperature-appropriate clothing, neither too hot nor too cold. 2. How to get a 5-day old baby to sleep at night: It might be common for newborns to confuse day and night, so you may need to develop strategies to help establish a routine that encourages them to sleep at night. These tactics may be useful: a) Develop a bedtime routine: Start reinforcing the difference between day and night by creating a consistent bedtime routine that involves giving them a warm bath, feeding, gentle rocking, and singing or reading softly. b) Keep nighttime interactions quiet: Try to keep the room dimly lit and interactions minimal during night-time feedings or diaper changes. This helps the baby associate nighttime with sleep and quiet time. c) Expose them to daylight: During daytime hours, let sunlight into their room and take them for a walk outside to get ample exposure to natural light. This helps regulate their internal clock. d) Make sure they're well-fed before putting them down: Providing a good meal before sleep-time helps extend the sleep intervals. e) Use swaddling: Swaddling the baby snugly in a lightweight blanket can create a comforting, womb-like environment. However, make sure you follow safe swaddling guidelines and stop swaddling once the baby starts trying to roll over. f) Offer a pacifier: Sucking is a natural soothing mechanism for infants and can help calm them down and induce sleep. It is important to note that each baby is unique, and their sleep patterns may also vary. Patience is critical in both scenarios, and always seek advice from a healthcare provider if you have concerns about your child's sleeping habits or health."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Ira Gruber is known as a military historian for a colonial revolt that took place between what years?

To further elaborate on this, let's analyze the context, factors, and reasons why this might be the case. Firstly, it is important to understand the context in which this statement is being made. The person might be referring to a specific market, region, or time period in which the real estate sector experienced a significant decline in value. For example, the period following the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 saw a significant drop in real estate prices in various regions. In some cases, property values still have not fully recovered to their pre-crisis levels. There are several factors and reasons which might explain why real estate hasn't fully recovered to its previous value: 1. Economic factors: The overall health of the economy has a direct impact on the real estate market. If the economy is experiencing slow growth, high unemployment, or financial instability, it could take longer for real estate values to recover. 2. Government policies: Government policies can have a significant impact on the real estate market. Some policies, such as regulations and taxes, can lower demand for property and keep prices from rebounding to previous levels. 3. Supply and demand: The balance between the number of properties available for sale and the number of potential buyers plays a crucial role in determining the market value of real estate. An oversupply of properties, or a lack of demand, could prevent real estate values from recovering fully. 4. Demographics and social trends: Shifts in population, such as a decline in the birth rate, lower immigration, or an increase in households downsizing, can lead to reduced demand for real estate and, consequently, stable or declining property values. 5. Psychological factors: Consumer sentiment and confidence in the real estate market are important factors in the recovery of property values. If people are anxious about the market's overall health or the potential for another downturn, they may be more cautious about investing, which in turn contributes to a slower overall recovery. 6. Market-specific factors: Local factors, such as changes in industry or employment levels, can have a significant impact on real estate values. If a region has experienced a decline in important industries or significant job losses, it may take longer for real estate values to return to previous levels. It is important to note that an overall statement, such as \\"real estate hasn't recovered to its previous value,\\" might not be accurate for every market, region, or property type. Some real estate markets might have experienced a complete recovery or even exceeded their previous value, while others may still be struggling. To conclude, the statement \\"Real estate hasn't recovered to its previous value\\" suggests that property values in the mentioned context have not yet returned to their previous level. Factors such as economic conditions, government policies, supply and demand, social trends, and local market dynamics might contribute to the slower recovery in certain regions or property types. However, it is crucial to recognize that this observation might not be universally accurate, as recovery rates and property values differ across regions and categories of real estate."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Article: MADRID (Reuters)--Spain' s parliament voiced its support on Wednesday for the rights of great apes to life and freedom. Parliament's environmental committee approved resolution urging Spain to carry out the Great Ape Project (GAP), designed by scientists and philosophers who say our closest genetic s deserve rights limited to humans. \\"This is a historic day in the struggle for animal rights and in defense of our evolutionary comrades, which will doubtless go down in the history of humanity,\\" said Pedro Poza, Spanish director of the Great Ape Project. The new resolution has cross-party support and it is thought they will become law within a year, making Spain the first nation to extend legal rights to apes. Under the new law, potential experiments on apes in Spain will be forbidden. \\"We have no knowledge of great apes being used in experiments in Spain, but there is currently no law preventing that from happening,\\" Poza said. Keeping apes for circuses, television commercials or filming will also be forbidden.Housing apes in Spanish zoos, of which there are currently 315, will remain legal, but supporters of _ have said the conditions in which most of them live will need to improve vastly.

Starting and running a business is a challenging endeavor, and obtaining the necessary funding to support the operation is crucial for its success. There are various things to consider when it comes to finance, and understanding the importance of each will help ensure your business has a solid foundation. Here, we break down the different needs and uses of the funds in more detail. 1. Acquiring office space: Renting or purchasing a suitable space that meets your business needs is essential. Having a professional environment where you can operate, meet with clients, and collaborate with your team is crucial for the growth of your business. The cost of office space can vary significantly depending on the location, size, and facilities available, which is why it should be carefully considered in your financial planning. 2. Office equipment: Investing in the appropriate technology, furniture, and other necessary equipment is important for running an efficient business. Computers, printers, software, desks, chairs, and phones are just a few examples of the essential items needed to maintain a well-functioning office. 3. Hiring employees: Recruiting and hiring the right employees is critical for your business to function and grow. The hiring process can be costly, including expenses related to job postings, interviews, background checks, and onboarding new hires. 4. Paying wages and benefits: Providing competitive salaries and benefits packages is important for attracting and retaining top talent. Additionally, offering a supportive work environment with adequate benefits can help improve employee satisfaction, productivity, and loyalty. 5. Printing documents and brochures: Marketing materials, such as documents and brochures, can be instrumental in attracting new customers and showcasing your business's products or services. Ensuring you have a budget for high-quality printing and materials is crucial to make a good impression on potential clients. 6. Maintain agents on the field: For businesses with field agents, such as sales representatives or inspectors, allocating a budget for travel expenses and other resources is essential. These agents often need to attend meetings with clients, conduct site visits, or provide on-site support, which requires proper funding to ensure their effectiveness. 7. Settling initial claims that arise: For businesses dealing with insurance or warranties, having a budget set aside for settling initial claims is vital. This demonstrates your company's reliability and commitment to customer satisfaction. It also reduces potential legal issues or negative brand reputation that could arise from unresolved claims. In conclusion, securing a business loan or pooling together money from various sources is essential for addressing the various financial needs of a business operation. By allocating funds for office space, equipment, personnel, marketing materials, field agents, and settling claims, you are laying a solid groundwork for your business's success and growth.

Your task is to summarize them. SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean border guards arrested an American man who they believe was attempting to swim across the border into rival North Korea, a South Korean defense official said Wednesday. The man was arrested Tuesday night at a river near the Korean Demilitarized Zone, part of a restricted military area, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to office policy. He said investigators are questioning the man about the purpose of his apparent attempt to enter North Korea but gave no further details. Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified government source, reported the man was in his late 20s or early 30s and told investigators that he tried to go to North Korea to meet leader Kim Jong Un. He was caught by South Korean marines while lying on the shore of the river after swimming north, the report said. Last year, South Korean soldiers shot and killed a man with a South Korean passport who officials said ignored warnings to return the South after trying to go to North Korea via a river that runs through the border. There have been occasional cases of Americans being arrested in North Korea after allegedly entering the country illegally from China, but an American trying to go to North Korea from South Korea is unusual. In 1996, American Evan C. Hunziker entered the North by swimming across the Yalu River, which marks the border with China. Hunziker, who apparently made the swim on a drunken dare, was accused of spying and detained for three months. Hunziker, then 26, was eventually freed after negotiations involving a special U.S. envoy. The North Koreans wanted to slap Hunziker with a 100,000 criminal fine but eventually agreed on a 5,000 payment to settle a bill for a hotel where he was detained. North Korea is currently holding three Americans and the country's Supreme Court on Sunday sentenced one of them to six years of hard labor for illegally entering the country to commit espionage. The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea. About 27,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea to avoid poverty and political suppression since the end of the Korean War. A few South Koreans have previously tried to defect to the impoverished, authoritarian country, but such cases are rare. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| A:","output":"Part #1: Summarize news articles separated by special token \\"|||||\\".

The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy.

Why is it seen as acceptable to be racist against white people? Why is it OK for Quora users to call me racist for no reason, but not OK for me to say it's possible to be racist against white people?","output":"While both questions address the issue of racism, they are not identical. They are different in several significant ways. They share a similar theme of racism, more specifically racism towards white people, but they focus on different aspects and originate from different contexts. Thus, while both are related, they are fundamentally different questions. The first question, \\"Why is it seen as acceptable to be racist against white people?\\" is asking about the societal perception of racism towards white people. This question assumes that it is generally accepted in a broad sense. The question crosses multiple layers of social, cultural, and individual aspects, possibly related to the perception of privilege, historic context, or the question of reverse racism. The response should discuss concepts such as structural or systemic racism, social privilege, a shifting cultural landscape, power disparities, etc. The first question could be answered with reference to various socio-historical factors such as colonial history, the concept of white privilege, majority vs. minority dynamics, and so forth. It's worth noting, however, that it's highly contentious and not universally agreed that society finds it acceptable to be racist against white people. The second question, \\"Why is it OK for Quora users to call me racist for no reason, but not OK for me to say it's possible to be racist against white people?\\" is a more personal question and deals with a specific community, namely Quora. It implicitly complains about a perceived double standard within this community, and it assumes a specific personal experience where the user has been called racist without proper reason while getting criticism for suggesting that white people could also be victims of racism. While the second question does share elements with the first — especially in asking why it may be seen as unacceptable to discuss racism towards white people — it directly refers to the experience of being accused of racism. This is notably different because it is much more specific and personal, focusing on the interactions between users within an online community. So, in conclusion, although these two questions explore the theme of racism, specifically towards white people, they are not the same. The first addresses societal perception that allows racism towards white people, while the second expresses a personal experience with being labelled as a racist in an online forum for discussing racism against white people."},{"instruction":"Xiaogan () is a prefecture-level city in east-central Hubei province, People's Republic of China, some 60 km northwest of the provincial capital of Wuhan.

In order to make your workout successful, you have to replace these to help your body recover and build muscle. Use the ingredients suggested in this section to put together a high-quality meal that will help you build muscle and avoid affecting your blood sugar. Protein is the essential ingredient for building muscle. While doing your weight training regimen, include proteins in every one of your meals to give your body the building blocks it needs to strengthen your muscles. There are many options for including protein in your diet. Nuts. Any kind of nut is high in protein. You can't go wrong including these in your meals or just snacking on them throughout the day. Beans. Not only do these give you a high dose of protein, but they have a low glycemic index, so they won't affect your blood sugar. If using canned beans, be sure to drain the liquid so you don't overdose on sodium. Fat-free dairy products. Milk and yogurt are great sources of protein. Have a glass of milk or a cup of yogurt for an easy dose of protein. Fish. Salmon, tuna, and herring are usually considered the best options for protein, but any fish will do as well. Make sure you avoid fried fish, however, or you'll consume saturated fats that could be harmful. You need carbohydrates in your diet because without them, your body will use protein for energy. This will divert protein from your muscles and you won't build any mass. Carbohydrates from bleached or enriched products like white bread have a high glycemic index and will raise your blood sugar. Whole wheat products, however, will give you non-enriched carbohydrates. Eat whole wheat bread, pasta, and cereals to give yourself a good serving of carbohydrates. It is a fallacy that we should cut fat out of our diets. While saturated and trans fats should be avoided, mono and polyunsaturated fats are beneficial for your health. They can reduce your cholesterol levels and also help you build muscle. Try some of these foods for good sources of good fats. Avocados. Fish. Salmon and sardines contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Olive oil. Seeds, especially sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds. Summary:","output":"To have a successful workout and build muscle, it is important to replace the essential nutrients and fluids lost during exercise. Incorporate protein in every meal, using sources such as nuts, beans, fat-free dairy products, and fish. Carbohydrates are also necessary, so opt for whole wheat products like bread, pasta, and cereals. Include healthy fats in your diet, like avocados, fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, olive oil, and seeds, while avoiding saturated and trans fats.

The two statements provided are: 1. \\"Boy in red shirt and black shorts sweeps driveway.\\" 2. \\"The boy is doing the chores his mother gave him.\\" While it is clear that the boy in the red shirt and black shorts is indeed sweeping the driveway, we do not have sufficient information to establish a direct connection between this action and the chores given to him by his mother. It is possible that sweeping the driveway is one of the tasks assigned to the boy by his mother as part of the chores, but without more information, we cannot say for certain. For example, his mother's chores list could consist of tasks like taking out the trash, cleaning the windows, or watering the plants. In such a case, sweeping the driveway is not a part of the given chores, and thus, the premise in the first statement would not be true concerning the context provided in the second statement. On the other hand, if his mother asked him to clean the yard and sweeping the driveway was part of the yard cleaning process, then the premise in the first statement would align with the context provided in the second statement, making it true.

What is the answer?","output":"The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy adventure novel written by Norton Juster and illustrated by Jules Feiffer, which was first published in 1961. The story revolves around a young boy named Milo who is bored with his life and unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth that takes him on a journey to a fantastical realm. One of the key characters in this enchanting world is Tock, a dog commonly referred to as the 'watchdog.' Tock's name is a play on words, a pun of sorts, as Tock is not an ordinary dog, but a watchdog in the most literal sense. Along with having a dog's body, Tock has an alarm clock built into his torso, which signifies the importance of time to his character. This combination of features makes him unique and well-suited for his role in the story. As Milo embarks upon his magical journey, he meets Tock early on, and the two become close companions throughout their adventures. Tock joins Milo as they explore the various regions within the Kingdom of Wisdom, including memorable locations like Dictionopolis, where they learn about the power and importance of words, and Digitopolis, where numbers and mathematics reign supreme. Tock's purpose in the story is not only to assist Milo in navigating the kingdom but also to provide guidance, wisdom, and friendship throughout their journey. The character of Tock stands as a symbol of the importance of time and making the most of it. He frequently reminds Milo about the value of utilizing time wisely and not wasting it, which is a central theme within the novel. Through Tock, the novel teaches valuable lessons about the significance of time management, curiosity, problem-solving, and exploration. The adventures of Milo and Tock serve as an important reminder that imagination and learning can transform the mundane aspects of life into something thrilling and meaningful. In this way, Tock, the literal watchdog, is not only an entertaining character but also an educational figure that helps readers understand the importance of being present and maximizing their full potential. Overall, Tock from The Phantom Tollbooth is a purposeful and multidimensional character, representing the importance of time management, exploration, and intellectual discovery. As the watchdog in the story, Tock's unique physical appearance, as well as his role as Milo's companion and guide, make him an essential and memorable character in Norton Juster's classic children's novel."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Mattress Pad<br>We bought a foam mattress pad in February. It was 8 inches thick. It was comfortable but it made our bed very high. Yesterday we decided to get rid of it. We were still able to get a good night's rest. Hypothesis: Most people can achieve a good night's rest on this foam pad","output":"Step 1: Identify the information provided in the paragraph. - The foam mattress pad was bought in February. - It was 8 inches thick. - It was comfortable but made the bed very high. - The owners decided to get rid of it. - They were still able to get a good night's rest. Step 2: Analyze the information to evaluate the hypothesis. The paragraph tells us that the foam pad was comfortable, which is a positive sign for people being able to achieve a good night's rest. However, it also mentioned that the pad made the bed very high, prompting the owners to get rid of it. Despite this inconvenience, the owners still managed to get a good night's rest. Step 3: Evaluate the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"Most people can achieve a good night's rest on this foam pad.\\" Based on the paragraph, the foam pad is comfortable, which suggests that it could provide a good night's rest for most people. However, the sample size is very small (just one experience) and there are potential issues with the thickness, so we cannot generalize the hypothesis as true for most people. Conclusion: The hypothesis cannot be definitively confirmed as true based on the paragraph because the sample size is too small, and there may be other factors (the bed's height) that would vary among different individuals."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given two facts, and a multiple-choice question.

The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Reull Vallis is a valley on Mars that appears to have been carved by water . It runs westward into Hellas Planitia . It is named after the Gaelic word for planet . - Astrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th-17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems. - The Noachis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Noachis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-27 (Mars Chart-27). - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km). - Hellas Planitia is a plain located within the huge, roughly circular impact basin Hellas located in the southern hemisphere of the planet Mars. Hellas is the third or fourth largest impact crater and the largest visible impact crater known in the Solar System. The basin floor is about deep, deeper than the Moon's South Pole-Aitken basin, and extends about east to west. It is centered at Hellas Planitia is in the Hellas quadrangle and the Noachis quadrangle. - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\". - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. - The Hellas quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Hellas quadrangle is also referred to as MC-28 (Mars Chart-28). The Hellas quadrangle covers the area from 240° to 300° west longitude and 30° to 65° south latitude on the planet Mars. Within the Hellas quadrangle lies the classic features Hellas Planitia and Promethei Terra. Many interesting and mysterious features have been discovered in the Hellas quadrangle, including the giant river valleys Dao Vallis, Niger Vallis, Harmakhis, and Reull Vallisall of which may have contributed water to a lake in the Hellas basin in the distant past. Many places in the Hellas quadrangle show signs of ice in the ground, especially places with glacier-like flow features. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. What object entity has the relation of 'location' with the subject 'reull vallis'?

Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre.

The Catalan language is a member of the Western Romance language group, and it is mainly spoken in the Catalonia, Valencia, and Balearic Islands regions of Spain, as well as parts of southern France, eastern Aragon, Andorra, and the eastern part of the Alghero municipality in Sardinia, Italy. Main Features: 1. Phonetics and Phonology: Catalan exhibits characteristic Romance language phonetics, with substantial phonetic distinctions depending on the region and dialect. Some of its unique features include the pronunciation of stressed vowels and the soft and hard pronunciations of 'c' and 'g' before front vowels. Catalan also displays the process of vowel reduction in unstressed syllables, which causes certain vowels to become centralized. Additionally, it exhibits the distinctive 'salat' sound (ś), a unique voiced postalveolar fricative, in some dialects. 2. Morphology: The morphology of the Catalan language is largely inflectional, with distinct noun and adjective declensions. It features a complex system of plural formation for both nouns and adjectives, usually adding \\"-s\\" for the plural form. In terms of verb conjugation, Catalan has a rich repertoire of irregular verbs, and it conjugates verbs according to three conjugation patterns: \\"-ar,\\" \\"-re,\\" and \\"-ir.\\" 3. Syntax: The basic word order in Catalan is subject-verb-object (SVO), similar to other Romance languages. However, it exhibits a fair degree of flexibility, allowing for variations to accommodate emphasis or poetic expression. Catalan also features the use of pronouns and clitics preceding the verb, as well as subordinating conjunctions to link phrases and to establish relationships between clauses. 4. Vocabulary: Catalan vocabulary is a mixture of Latin roots, borrowings from neighboring languages, and innovations. While some words may be similar to Spanish or French, the language has a significant number of unique vocabulary words. Catalan also has several dialectal variations, resulting in diverse regional vocabularies. Historical Development: The historical development of the Catalan language can be divided into several stages: 1. Early Catalan (9th-12th centuries): During this period, the Catalan language emerged as a distinct language from Latin, with the earliest documents dating back to the 9th century. The development of Catalan was influenced by several factors, including contact with neighboring languages, such as Spanish and Occitan, as well as political, social, and cultural changes in the region. 2. Classical Catalan (13th-15th centuries): In the 13th and 14th centuries, Catalan achieved greater prominence, largely due to the political expansion and cultural influence of the Crown of Aragon, which ruled over territories in the Mediterranean and southern Italy. Classic works of Catalan literature, such as \\"Tirant lo Blanch\\" and \\"Llibre dels fets,\\" appeared during this time. 3. Decadent Period (16th-18th centuries): During this period, Catalan faced a significant decline due to the growing political domination of Spain and the rise of the Spanish language. Despite the decline, several literary works continued to be produced in Catalan. Renewed interest in the language would come later, during the Romantic and Renaixença movements. 4. Modern Catalan (19th century to present): In the 19th and 20th centuries, Catalan experienced a revival, driven by cultural and linguistic movements such as the Romanticism, Renaixença, and Noucentisme. Catalan was actively promoted and consolidated as a written and spoken language. Throughout the 20th century, the status of the Catalan language fluctuated, particularly during the Franco dictatorship in Spain (1940-1975), which imposed strict suppression of regional languages. Following the restoration of democracy, Catalan was recognized as an official language in Catalonia and other regions, leading to its resurgence in education, media, and public life. In conclusion, the Catalan language is a rich and diverse Romance language with distinct phonetic, morphological, and syntactic features. Throughout its history, Catalan has faced numerous challenges but has remained resilient, reflecting the vitality of its speakers and the cultural wealth of the regions where it is spoken."},{"instruction":"Write a \\"2).\\" movie review (pick from the following. 1). negative; 2). positive;).","output":"2).

Here is a detailed examination of the various concerns highlighted in the review, which contribute to this assessment: 1. Product Disappointment: The reviewer starts by sharing that their 7-year-old child received the product as a birthday gift from a best friend and was extremely disappointed. This sets a negative tone from the beginning, showing that the reviewer doesn't intend to provide a positive outlook on the product. 2. Sliding Matt: The reviewer points out one major issue with the product - the matt slides, which indicates a lack of stability.

The £178m system set up to deliver European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments has been beset by delays and increasing costs.

Hypothesis: The door remains open to further possibilities. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's first break down the statements and their meaning. Premise: \\"It will not be possible again, I fear.\\" The premise suggests that a particular event or possibility will not manifest itself again in the future. The speaker expresses concern that a specific event will likely not reoccur, implying a certain degree of certainty. Thus, the premise presents a rather pessimistic view of the situation. Hypothesis: \\"The door remains open to further possibilities.\\" The hypothesis, on the other hand, presents a more optimistic outlook. It suggests that there is still hope, and other opportunities may become available. Though it does not guarantee that the specific event mentioned in the premise will transpire again, it leaves room for the possibility of other, alternative events or outcomes. Now let's analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis. To entail means that the truth of one statement guarantees or necessitates the truth of another statement. In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise presents a pessimistic view of a specific event not happening again. However, the hypothesis suggests that there may still be other possibilities, which is not directly related to the premise's assertion. The hypothesis does not strictly contradict the premise, but it offers a different perspective that focuses on the potential for alternative events or outcomes rather than the impossibility of one particular event happening again. In summary, while the statements discuss the likelihood of certain events or possibilities, they present different perspectives, focusing on distinct aspects of the situation. Consequently, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the truth of the premise does not guarantee or necessitate the truth of the hypothesis. They can coexist without much interdependency, as one can fear that a specific event will not take place again without denying the possibility of other opportunities arising."},{"instruction":"Mookajjiya Kanasugalu (English: Dreams of Mookajji) is a 1968 Kannada epic novel written by K.

Fish oil has also been found to reduce the production and effectiveness of several prostaglandins. Omega-3 fatty acids compete with omega 6 fatty acids for the same binding site called the COX 1 enzyme. This enzyme converts omega 6 fatty acids to prostaglandin. The more omega 3 fatty acids blocking the COX 1 enzyme, the fewer omega 6 fatty acids will be converted to prostaglandins . Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids include: sardines, salmon, soybeans, flax seeds, walnuts, tofu and mackerel. The recommended dose for omega-3 fatty acids is between 0.3 g -0.5 g daily. There are a group of compounds that are known as Vitamin E and have been found to show antioxidant-like properties. This vitamin is also known as an anti-inflammatory because it has the ability to suppress or inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins, thus lowering your prostaglandin levels.. Foods rich in Vitamin E include: Sunflower seeds and oil, almonds, safflower oil, hazelnuts, peanuts and peanut butter, spinach, broccoli or wheat germ oil. Studies show that whole grain foods have a variety of health benefits including the promotion of anti-inflammatory processes in the body. This means that whole grains indirectly lower your PG levels. Whole grain products include: Barley, quinoa, oatmeal, whole wheat flour, brown rice and 100% whole wheat pasta or breads. Refined grains are overly processed and stripped of their valuable nutrients. Refined grains to minimize or avoid include: white bread, white pasta, white rice and many cereals. Mangosteens are a tropical fruit, native to Thailand, that have fragrant and sweet white flesh. It has been used medicinally in Thailand for years and recently according to studies, has been shown to inhibit the production or synthesis of prostaglandins in the body. You can consume mangosteen raw as a snack or a healthy dessert. You can also toss them into salads or make a jam from them. This fruit is a tasty, ruby red fruit that are filled with tiny little sweet and edible seeds. There have been a large variety of health benefits associated with pomegranates due to high concentrations of phytochemicals. According to studies, pomegranate may help to lower your levels of PG by inhibiting its production and synthesis. You can eat pomegranate seeds raw, use them in desserts or toss them into savory dishes like salads or sauces. If you're not a fan of the seeds, try drinking 100% pomegranate juice. Do not purchase juice mixes, cocktails or juice concentrate. This bright yellow fruit contains an enzyme known as bromelain that has been shown to reduce levels of prostaglandins. It does this by inhibiting PG production and synthesis. Pineapple is the only food source of bromelain available. Eating raw pineapple as a snack, part of a fruit salad or on top of yogurt or cottage cheese is a great way to consume bromelain. This common vegetable contains high amounts of a carotenoid called lycopene. This is an antioxidant known for preventing prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease and reducing inflammation. It's thought to reduce inflammation by affecting chemical mediators in your body that are ultimately responsible for prostaglandin and other inflammatory mediator production. Cook tomatoes or use tomato products that have been cooked or processed with heat (like canned tomatoes or tomato paste). Cooking and heating tomatoes changes the type of lycopene into a form that's more easily absorbed by your body. You can eat stewed tomatoes, add tomato sauce to your pasta or vegetables. Add canned tomatoes to soups, stews and sauces. Raw tomatoes can be thrown into salads or eaten with a drizzle of olive oil and salt. Both garlic and onions contain allicin, an active ingredient that works like anti-inflammatory medication blocking prostaglandin production. In addition, these foods have been shown to display antimicrobial, anti-tumor, anti-thrombotic and anti-arthritic properties. Increase the amount you cook with garlic and onions. This combination makes a great base for a variety of dishes including soups, stews, sauces in addition to braised dishes, casseroles or crock-pot meals. Many different herbs and spices have been shown to have a variety of health benefits including anti-inflammatory properties. Using a wide range of fresh or dried herbs and spices can help you add these anti-inflammatory foods to your diet. Use turmeric in your cooking. Turmeric is a bright yellow/orange root that is most commonly known as an ingredient in curry powder. It contains a compound called curcumin, which has been shown to inhibit the production of prostaglandins. In addition turmeric has been shown to aid in the reduction of pain and inflammation related to osteoarthritis. You can purchase turmeric raw in its root form or dried and ground into a spice powder. Try using turmeric powder in scrambled eggs, tossed with roasted vegetables, mixed with rice dishes, added to salads or salad dressing or even blend into smoothies. Many cultures also use turmeric to make turmeric tea. Simmer turmeric root in boiling water for five minutes. Strain the tea and drink it three to four times a day. Add more ginger to your diet. Studies have shown that ginger displays anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.. Use fresh ginger in sauces, marinades, stir-fries or curries. You can also steep fresh ginger in hot water to make homemade ginger tea. Dried ginger works well in spice rubs, baked goods and sauces. According to studies, green tea can lower prostaglandin levels in your body. It is believed that the polyphenols in green tea have antioxidant properties that aid in reducing damage to cells from free radicals. To make green tea, put one teaspoon of green tea leaves in 8 ounces of hot water. Do not mix green tea into boiling water because the helpful chemicals in the tea will be destroyed by the high temperatures. Add honey to your green tea. According to studies, honey can help to lower plasma prostaglandin concentrations. . A meal plan will be helpful when trying to add specific foods to your diet. It can help you see where you can incorporate a variety of anti-inflammatory foods throughout each day and week. Start adding different foods slowly each week. It may be easier to maintain compared to forcing yourself to fit in a large quantity of new foods to your diet all at once. Also try choosing foods that you can include everyday. It might be easy to include a hot mug of green tea every morning as a first step. Remember, you don't have to include every anti-inflammatory food each day. Choose a variety to include over your entire week.","output":"Omega-3 fatty acids are good things found in some foods like fish, tofu, and nuts that help our body to stay healthy. They stop some other things called prostaglandins from causing problems, like making us feel pain or swelling. Vitamin E is also helpful because it can lower the amount of prostaglandins. We can find this in foods like sunflower seeds, almonds, and spinach. Eating whole grain foods like brown rice, oatmeal, and whole wheat bread can keep our body happy and healthy. Fruits like mangosteens and pomegranates can also help lower prostaglandins levels. Pineapple is a yummy fruit that has something called bromelain, which can also be good for us. Tomatoes are great because they have a special thing called lycopene, which helps reduce swelling. Cooking the tomatoes makes the lycopene even better for our bodies. Garlic and onions have a part called allicin that helps with fighting bad things in our body and reducing inflammation. We can also use special spices like turmeric and ginger to make our food taste good and help our bodies feel better. Drinking green tea can make us feel better too, and adding honey can make it even better. A good way to make sure we have these good things in our food is to make a plan for our meals. That way, we can eat a mix of these helpful foods throughout the week.

The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian. Context: On October 4, 1986, while walking along Park Avenue to his apartment in Manhattan, Rather was attacked and punched from behind by a man who demanded to know \\"Kenneth, what is the frequency?\\" while a second assailant chased and beat him. As the assailant pummeled and kicked Rather, he kept repeating the question. In describing the incident, Rather said, \\"I got mugged. Who understands these things? I didn't and I don't now. I didn't make a lot of it at the time and I don't now. I wish I knew who did it and why, but I have no idea.\\" Until the crime was resolved years later, Rather's description of the bizarre crime led some to doubt the veracity of his account, although the doorman and building supervisor who rescued Rather fully confirmed his version of events. The assault remained unsolved for some time, and was referenced multiple times in popular culture. The phrase \\"What's the frequency, Kenneth?\\" became a popular-culture reference over the years, such as in a scene in the graphic novel Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron by cartoonist Daniel Clowes. In 1994, the band R.E.M. released the song \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" on their album Monster. Rather later sang with R.E.M. during a sound check prior to a gig at New York's Madison Square Garden, which was shown the following night on the Late Show with David Letterman before their performance of \\"Crush with Eyeliner\\". In 1997, a TV critic writing in the New York Daily News solved the mystery, publishing a photo of the alleged assailant, William Tager, who received a 12 1/2 -to-25-year prison sentence for killing NBC stagehand Campbell Montgomery outside The Today Show studio in 1994. Rather confirmed the story: \\"There's no doubt in my mind that this is the person.\\" New York District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said, \\"William Tager's identity as the man who attacked Mr. Rather was established in the course of an investigation by my office.\\" Tager claimed he thought television networks were beaming signals into his brain. When he murdered the stagehand, Tager was trying to force his way into an NBC studio with a weapon, in order to find out the frequency the networks were using to attack him, so that he could block it. Tager was paroled in October 2010 and is believed to be living in New York City. Question: when was he attacked?. Whats the answer?","output":"Daniel Rather was attacked on October 4, 1986.

Article: It was one of the hottest days of the dry season. There was no rain for almost a month. The crops were dying. Cows stopped giving milk. On this day, I witnessed a wonder. I was making lunch when I saw my 6-year-old son, Billy, walking very slowly towards the woods. Minutes later he came running out again, towards the house. Soon after, I saw him walking towards the woods again. This went on for an hour. Finally I walked out of the house quietly and followed him. Billy cupped both hands in front of him as he walked, careful not to drop the water he carried. Then I saw an amazing sight. Several large deer stood in front of him. Billy walked right up to them. I saw a baby deer lying on the ground. It was dying of thirst, and it tried to lift its head to drink the water in my boy's hands. When the water was gone, Billy ran back to the house. I followed him to the kitchen. Billy opened the tap and a small trickle came out. He let the drips slowly fill up his \\"cup\\". Now I understood what was going on.

Question: What's the best title for the passage? - The wonder of water - The wasted water - The crying mother and son - The dying deer A:","output":"The best title for the passage is \\"The wonder of water.\\""},{"instruction":"Article: City traffic is a great problem. More cars are produced every year and the streets are getting more and more crowded. So during \\"rush hours\\", when people are going to or from their work, traffic is brought to a standstill. It has been suggested that commuters--the people who travel to work every day from outside the city--should share their cars and give each other lifts. So each car would carry four or five people instead of only one. It is an excellent idea., however, so far nobody has been able to think of a way to make people do so. To discourage motorists from leaving their cars in the streets all day, parking meters are used. When you park at a meter, you must put a coin in the slot . This pays for a certain amount of time. The meter records this and it shows when the time that you have paid for is finished. If the car is still there then, you have to pay a fine. Traffic wardens look after the meters. They walk around the streets and check that every meter shows that money has been paid for the car parked there. If a meter shows 'TIME EXPIRED', the motorist who has left his car there is fined. Of course, the traffic warden can not wait for the owner of the car to return. He carries many printed forms, and on one of these he writes down all the details, such as the number of the car, where it is parked, how much the driver must pay and where he must send the money. He leaves this form on the car, where the driver will be able to see it easily; he usually pushes it under one of the windscreen wipers so that it will not be blown away. And in case it rains before the motorist returns, the form is put in a little plastic envelope to protect it. When the driver comes back, he gets an unpleasant surprise, but it is his own fault for leaving his car too long at parking meter. Question: The passage implies_. Yes or no, is the answer \\"cars with more people are needed to solve traffic problems\\"?","output":"Yes, the passage implies that \\"cars with more people are needed to solve traffic problems\\" as it suggests that commuters should share their cars and give each other lifts, so each car would carry four or five people instead of only one.

Question: what does someone do when they do not reply to a question? Options: A. ask B. question C. ignore D. answer E. mute The answer is:","output":"C. Ignore When someone does not reply to a question, it usually means that they are ignoring it. Ignoring a question can mean that the individual either does not want to answer or engage with the question or it could mean that they are not directing their attention to the question because they are preoccupied with something else. It could be due to a variety of reasons such as the context or the personal preferences of the person being asked the question. Here's a brief analysis of why the other options do not align with common sense: Option A. Ask - It is unlikely that someone would be asking a question if they have just been asked one and haven't provided an answer themselves. In a conversation, it's common for one participant to wait for a response before asking their own questions. While some people might try to derail a conversation by asking a question, it is not the typical behavior when not replying to a question. Option B. Question - When someone is questioning, it usually implies that they are actively engaging in conversation and asking for more information. In the context of not replying to a question, it does not seem to be in line with common sense that the person would be asking a question of their own as that would contradict the fact that they are not responding to the initial query. Option D. Answer - Answering a question means providing a response to a query or addressing a concern. In this scenario, the individual is not replying to the question, so they are clearly not answering it. Answering and not replying are contradictory actions, so this option does not align with common sense. Option E. Mute - Muting typically refers to silencing or disabling audio, making communication impossible in that mode. When referring to a conversation, \\"mute\\" might imply that the person has purposely muted themselves or stopped communicating. However, given the nature of the question, \\"ignore\\" is a more appropriate and clearer choice to describe the action of not replying to a question. Muting in conversations usually involves more technical measures (e.g., muting a microphone) and does not necessarily signify the conscious decision to not reply to a question. In conclusion, the most reasonable option that aligns with common sense is Option C, \\"ignore.\\" Ignoring is the most fitting option as it reflects the fact that the person has chosen not to respond or engage with the question being asked, whether it be due to personal reasons or distractions."},{"instruction":"CHAPTER XXI. FAIR ARGUMENTS. As Mollett left the house he saw two men walking down the road away from the sweep before the hall door, and as he passed them he recognised one as the young gentleman of the house. He also saw that a horse followed behind them, on the grass by the roadside, not led by the hand, but following with the reins laid loose upon his neck. They took no notice of him or his car, but allowed him to pass as though he had no concern whatever with the destinies of either of them. They were Herbert and Owen Fitzgerald. The reader will perhaps remember the way in which Owen left Desmond Court on the occasion of his last visit there. It cannot be said that what he had heard had in any way humbled him, nor indeed had it taught him to think that Clara Desmond looked at him altogether with indifference. Greatly as she had injured him, he could not bring himself to look upon her as the chief sinner. It was Lady Desmond who had done it all. It was she who had turned against him because of his poverty, who had sold her daughter to his rich cousin, and robbed him of the love which he had won for himself. Or perhaps not of the love--it might be that this was yet his; and if so, was it not possible that he might beat the countess at her own weapons?

Movie title: The Duellists Movie plot: In Strasbourg in 1800, fervent Bonapartist and obsessive duellist Lieutenant Gabriel Feraud (Harvey Keitel) of the French 7th Hussars, nearly kills the nephew of the city's mayor in a sword duel. Under pressure from the mayor, Brigadier-General Treillard (Robert Stephens) sends a member of his staff, Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine) of the 3rd Hussars, to put Feraud under house arrest. As the arrest takes place in the house of Madame de Lionne (Jenny Runacre), a prominent local lady, Feraud takes it as a personal insult from d'Hubert. Matters are made worse when Feraud asks d'Hubert if he would \\"let them spit on Napoleon\\" and d'Hubert doesn't immediately reply. Upon reaching his quarters, Feraud challenges d'Hubert to a duel. The duel is inconclusive; d'Hubert slashes Feraud's forearm but is unable to finish him off, because he is attacked by Feraud's mistress. As a result of his part in the duel, d'Hubert is dismissed from the General's staff and returned to active duty with his unit. The war interrupts the men's quarrel and they do not meet again until six months later in Augsburg in 1801. Feraud immediately challenges d'Hubert to another duel and seriously wounds him. Recovering, d'Hubert takes lessons from a fencing master and in the next duel (held in a cellar with heavy sabres), the two men fight each other to a bloody standstill. Soon afterwards, d'Hubert is relieved to learn he has been promoted to captain. Military discipline forbids officers of different ranks from duelling. The action moves to 1806 when d'Hubert is serving in LÃ¼beck. He is shocked to hear that the 7th Hussars have arrived in the city and that Feraud is now also a captain. Aware that in two weeks time he is to be promoted to major, d'Hubert attempts to slip away but is spotted by Feraud's perpetual second. Feraud challenges him to another duel, which is to be fought on horseback with sabres. D'Hubert slashes his opponent across the forehead; Feraud, blinded because the cut bleeds heavily into his eyes, cannot continue...","output":"In Ridley Scott's film \\"The Duellists,\\" it is never explicitly mentioned who declared d'Hubert a traitor to the Emperor. The movie focuses on the ongoing rivalry and duels between the two main characters, Lieutenant Gabriel Feraud and Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert. D'Hubert is put in a difficult position after he is forced to arrest Feraud, igniting a personal vendetta between the two. D'Hubert is not declared as a traitor to the Emperor by any specific character, but rather, Feraud takes d'Hubert's actions as a personal insult, initiating a series of duels between them. This personal conflict transcends into the perception that d’Hubert potentially disrespected Napoleon and could possibly be viewed as a traitor. The titles and ranks play a significant role in military discipline and duelling rules throughout the movie. D'Hubert's promotions temporarily halt the duelling as officers of different ranks are prohibited from engaging in duels. The progression of time and their military careers show the continued animosity between the characters despite the 15-year timeframe. Several thematic elements and motifs question loyalty, pride, and obsession in the film. The rivalry between d'Hubert and Feraud transcends a simple misunderstanding and spirals into an unnecessary, ongoing feud that lasts for years. The movie highlights the absurdity of the duels and how personal grievances can damage lives and careers. The feud between d'Hubert and Feraud only weakens their bond as brothers-in-arms and ultimately adds another unnecessary layer of stress on an already difficult era marked by the Napoleonic Wars. In order to decide whether investing in a film proposal is worthwhile, it is essential to consider the film's potential reception by the audience, the strength of its themes and motifs, and the quality of its acting and directing. Ridley Scott's \\"The Duellists\\" is a visually impressive film boasting a captivating storyline and strong acting performances. It offers a unique glimpse into period military life and the human struggles of pride, loyalty, and obsession.

This is the latest effort by the Obama administration to fight back against a Supreme Court decision that struck down the most powerful part of the landmark Voting Rights Act and freed southern states from strict federal oversight of their elections. North Carolina has a new law scaling back the period for early voting and imposing stringent voter identification requirements. It is among at least five Southern states adopting stricter voter ID and other election laws. Diminishing voting rights: North Carolina and other southern states have enacted tougher new laws minorities feel target them, these protesters picketed in June against a similar law in Alabama. The Justice Department on Aug. 22 sued Texas over the state's voter ID law and is seeking to intervene in a lawsuit over redistricting laws in Texas that minority groups consider to be discriminatory. Republican lawmakers in southern states insist the new measures are needed to prevent voter fraud, though such crimes are infrequent. Democrats and civil rights groups argue the tough new laws are intended to make voting more difficult for minorities and students, voting groups that lean toward Democrats, in states with legacies of poll taxes and literacy tests. Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to announce the lawsuit against North Carolina at a news conference Monday, according to a person who has been briefed on the department's plans but is not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke only on condition of anonymity. We're comin' for you: Attorney General Eric Holder and the Justice Department are suing southern states over their more stringent voter laws. Holder will be joined at the news conference by the acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil rights division, Joceyln Samuels, and the three U.S. attorneys from North Carolina, the person said. In the North Carolina lawsuit, the person said, the government will challenge requirements in state law that eliminate the first seven days of early voting opportunities and eliminate same-day voter registration during the early voting period. Same-day registration allows voters to cast a ballot immediately after presenting elections officials with proof of their name and home address. The Justice Department challenge also is aimed at a provision eliminating the counting of certain types of provisional ballots by voters who cast ballots in their home counties but do not vote in the correct precincts. To the rescue: The Obama Administration is spearheading the fight to defend minorities' voting rights. Finally, the federal government will challenge a provision in the new law that requires voters to present government-issued identification at the polls in order to cast ballots. In North Carolina, a recent state board of elections survey found that hundreds of thousands of registered voters did not have a state-issued ID. Many of those voters are young, black, poor or elderly. In remarks Sept. 20 to the Congressional Black Caucus, Holder said the Justice Department will not allow the Supreme Court's action to be interpreted as \\"open season\\" for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights. The Justice Department will ask a federal judge to place the four provisions in North Carolina's new law under federal scrutiny for an indeterminate period - a process known as pre-clearance. However, the provision of the Voting Rights Act that the Justice Department is invoking may be a difficult tool for the Obama administration to use. Protect their vote: More protesters from earlier this year in Alabama, picketing outside the Supreme Court to defend the Voting Rights Act. A handful of jurisdictions have been subjected to pre-clearance, or advance approval, of election changes through the Civil Rights Act provision it is relying on, but a court first must find that a state or local government engaged in intentional discrimination under the Constitution's 14th or 15th amendments, or the jurisdiction has to admit to discrimination. Unlike other parts of the voting law, the discriminatory effect of an action is not enough to trigger court review. Nowhere is the debate over voting rights is more heated than in Florida, where the chaotic recount in the disputed 2000 presidential race took place. Florida election officials are set to resume an effort to remove non-citizens from the state's voting rolls. A purge last year ended in embarrassment after hundreds of American citizens, most of whom were black or Hispanic, were asked to prove their citizenship or risk losing their right to vote.","output":"The Justice Department is set to sue the state of North Carolina over alleged racial discrimination in their new voting rules.

It found that men who regularly post selfies on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, are more likely to be narcissistic, impulsive and display other characteristics, such as a lack of empathy. Obsessed with selfies? Men who regularly post them on social media sites are displaying psychopathic traits, according to a new study, which found that selfie addicts are also likely narcissistic. Male celebrities such as Justin Bieber (pictured) regularly keep their fans updated with self-portraits. Researchers also revealed that self-objectification may be a bigger problem for men than previously thought, with many taking the time and effort to edit and improve their selfies, before posting them online. Psychologists from Ohio State University found that men who posted selfies regularly, scored higher than average for levels of anti-social traits. For example, men who doctor their images to improve their appearance, show signs of narcissism and self-objectification, said assistant professor of communication Jesse Fox. Narcissism is most commonly associated with vanity but as a psychological flaw, relates to a feeling of being more intelligent, attractive and better than others, according to the study published in the journal, Personality and Individual Differences. Researchers also revealed that self-objectification (illustrated with a stock image) may be a bigger problem for men than previously thought. Men who put their pictures online as soon as they can are more likely to show signs of psychopathy, which is defined as having a lack of empathy or regard to others and impulsiveness. Professor Fox explained: ‘Psychopathy is characterised by impulsivity. They are going to snap the photos and put them online right away. ‘They want to see themselves. They don’t want to spend time editing.’ To come to their conclusions, the researchers surveyed 800 men aged between 18 and 40 about their social media output, as well as giving them psychological questionnaires to establish personality traits. The survey asked them how often they post pictures on sites like Instagram and Twitter and whether they Photoshop their selfies first. Professor Fox said: ‘It’s not surprising that men who post a lot of selfies and spend more time editing them are more narcissistic. ‘The more interesting finding is that they also score higher on this other anti-social personality trait, psychopathy, and are more prone to self-objectification. ‘Most people don’t think that men even do that sort of thing, but they definitely do.' She warned that such behaviour can lead to further problems. ‘We know that self-objectification leads to a lot of terrible things, like depression and eating disorders in women. ‘With the growing use of social networks, everyone is more concerned with their appearance. ‘That means self-objectification may become a bigger problem for men, as well as for women.’ Experts linked selfies with mental illness in April last year by suggesting suggested that people regularly searching for the perfect angle from which to portray themselves could in some cases be ill. One leading psychiatrist said the majority of patients he sees with Body Dysmorphic Disorder take a lot of selfies. Dr David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust and The Priory Hospital, told The Sunday Mirror: ‘Two out of three of all the patients who come to see me with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) since the rise of camera phones have a compulsion to repeatedly take and post selfies on social media sites.’ Experts have linked selfies with mental illness and have suggested that people regularly searching for the perfect angle could in some cases be suffering from a confidence-related mental health condition. He told MailOnline: ‘Taking selfies is not an addiction - it’s a symptom of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) that involves checking one’s appearance.’ Cognitive behavioural therapy is often used to help patients moderate their obsessive behaviour relating to their appearance. Sufferers of BDD can spend hours trying to take pictures that do not show any defects or flaws in their appearance, which they are very aware of but which might be unnoticeable to others. In one extreme case of the disorder, a British teenager Danny Bowman tried to commit suicide because he was unsatisfied with his appearance in the selfies he took. He was so desperate to attract girls, he spent 10 hours a day taking more than 200 selfies trying to find the perfect image, but his habit, which began at the age of 15, caused him to drop out of school and lose almost two stone in weight. In an article for Psychology Today, Dr Pamela Rutledge, Director of the Media Psychology Research Centre in Boston Massachusetts, said: ‘Selfies frequently trigger perceptions of self-indulgence or attention seeking social dependence that raises the 'damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don’t' spectre of either narcissism or very low self-esteem.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The study suggests that individuals who often share selfies online might be exhibiting psychopathic traits. Conducted by psychologists from Ohio State University, the research found that men who regularly post selfies on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are more likely to be narcissistic, impulsive, and display a lack of empathy. Additionally, the study highlights that self-objectification may be a bigger issue for men than previously thought, as many take the time and effort to edit and improve their selfies before posting them online. Men who posted selfies regularly scored higher than average for levels of anti-social traits. Narcissism is a psychological flaw linked to a feeling of being more intelligent, attractive, and better than others, according to the study published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences. Men who put their pictures online as quickly as possible are more likely to exhibit signs of psychopathy, defined as having a lack of empathy or regard for others and impulsiveness. The study involved surveying 800 men aged between 18 and 40 about their social media output and administering psychological questionnaires to establish personality traits. The survey inquired about how often they posted pictures on sites like Instagram and Twitter and whether they edited their selfies first. \\"Most people don't think that men even do that sort of thing, but they definitely do,\\" said assistant professor of communication Jesse Fox. She also warned that such behavior could lead to further problems like depression and eating disorders, which have often been linked to self-objectification."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the English language and your task is to convert it into the Hindi language.

Increased transparency: Customers would have a more accurate representation of the product, and this could lead to more informed purchasing decisions. 2. Less dissatisfaction and returns: Since customers would be aware of the stains before purchasing, they would be less likely to be dissatisfied with the product upon receiving it or request for a return. 3. Affect sales: If potential customers find the stains unappealing, it may result in reduced sales for the product.

Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, visited the area on Sunday to survey the damage firsthand. Upon witnessing the scene, he described the devastation as a \\"war zone\\" and promised a thorough investigation into the cause of the accident, according to the BBC. As the search for the missing continues and investigators work to uncover the cause of the derailment, the small community of Lac-Megantic, as well as the entire nation of Canada, are mourning this tragic loss of life and seeking answers to prevent future incidents.

Here you can find information about first aid. The very first thing that you should do when you see an accident is to _ the situation and prevent further dangerous incidents. First of all, you have to recognize what has happened and what the dangers to rescuers and victims are. Think about how to take care of the victims. Helping usually takes place in very difficult conditions and injuries can be very bad. Therefore, you cannot be too afraid of making mistakes to help. Sometimes you have to face the fact that regardless of your actions and your efforts the victim's condition might not improve--he or she could even die. In some cases even professional medical aid may not succeed. If you have done everything you think you should do, you shouldn't feel guilty. Do not expose yourself to danger. Giving first aid can be dangerous. While trying to help a victim, do not forget about your own safety. If something happens to you, you won't be able to help anyone. Call for help after you find out the condition of a victim. But remember if a victim faints due to breathing failure caused by drowning, choking or poisoning, you should first take action that helps to bring back the heartbeat and breathing. While calling, talk shortly but clearly. Always provide the following information--the location of the accident, the kind of accident, the number of the injured and your full name and phone number and so on.

In her memoir, “All That Is Bitter and Sweet,” based on journals she wrote as well as her own childhood memories, Judd details abuse and neglect in her drama-filled upbringing; her relationship with her famous mom, Naomi, and sister, Wynonna; her Hollywood career, and her decision to focus on humanitarian work around the world. Read an excerpt: Chapter One: Family of Chance, Family of Choice Mamaw and my mother. Before seeing this snapshot, I had not known they had shared lighthearted moments. My favorite author, Edith Wharton, wrote in her autobiography, “My last page is always latent in my first, but the intervening windings of the way become clear only as I write.” So it has been with me as I have undertaken to make sense of my own past. Although the home of my heart is in the Appalachian Mountains, I always considered it auspicious that I was born in Southern California, one of the most transitory places in the world, during one of the most turbulent springs in American history. When I arrived by cesarean section at Granada Hills Hospital on April 19, 1968, California was the epicenter of a society in the throes of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. The Vietnam War was raging. The nation was still reeling from the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and Bobby Kennedy would soon be gunned down at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, leaving a generation of idealists lost in a tide of grief and regret. Some of the flower children who had flocked to San Francisco for the Summer of Love were now panhandling for loose change along Hollywood’s Sunset Strip — a place I would soon know well. My parents, Michael and Diana Ciminella, were small-town kids from rural eastern Kentucky. Like most everyone else in the Los Angeles basin, they had moved to California looking for a fresh start in what Joan Didion described as “the golden land where every day the world is born anew.” In 1967, my parents bought a tract house on a cul-de-sac in Sylmar, a suburb carved out of olive groves in the San Fernando Valley, about twenty miles north and a world away from Hollywood. My dad sold electronic components for the aerospace industry; my mom stayed home and seethed with boredom. They had dreams, just different ones. And they had secrets. They had married too young and for the “wrong” reason — namely, the unplanned pregnancy that produced my older sister, Christina (you know her as Wynonna), when Mom was only seventeen. It was a typical story of the time: high school girl becomes pregnant and “has” to marry her teen-age boyfriend. But there was a twist: Michael wasn’t the father of Diana’s baby — something he didn’t know at the time of the wedding, and something my sister and I wouldn’t learn for decades. When I came into the world four years later, my family’s troubled and remarkable course had already been set in motion, powerfully shaped by my mother’s desperate teenage lie and the incredible energy she dedicated to protecting it. I began to understand the dynamics of my past, and how we are only as sick as our secrets, when I was thirty-seven years old and started on a simple and practical path of personal recovery. It as then that I discovered we all belong to two families: our family of choice and our family of origin. My family of choice is a colorful assortment of surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends who infuse me with love, belonging, and acceptance. My family of origin, the one into which I was born, was also brimming with love but was not a healthy family system. There was too much trauma, abandonment, addiction and shame. My mother, while she was transforming herself into the country legend Naomi Judd, created an origin myth for the Judds that did not match my reality. She and my sister have been quoted as saying that our family put the “fun” in dysfunction. I wondered: Who, exactly, was having all the fun? What was I missing? As I write these words, I am happy to say that each of us has embarked on a personal process of healing, and my family is healthier than it has ever been. We have come far. In our individual and collective recoveries, we have learned that mental illness and addiction are family diseases, spanning and affecting generations. There are robust strains of each on both sides of my family — manifested in just about everything from depression, suicide, alcoholism, and compulsive gambling to incest and suspected murder — and these conditions have shaped my parents’ stories (even if some of the events did not happen directly to them) as well as my sister’s and my own. Fortunately, along with the dysfunction is a legacy of love, resiliency, creativity, and faith in a family whose roots I can trace back at least eight generations in the mountains of Kentucky and about 350 years in America, and as far as the shores of Sicily. That history is as much a part of my DNA as the arch of my eyebrows or the color of my hair. It’s imprinted in the soft r’s and long vowels that well up in my voice when I’m speaking about my home place or the way I whoop for my dogs from the doorway, barefoot, in a nightgown, assuming my mountain woman stance with a hand on one hip, a way of being as natural to me as breathing. Although I now make my home in rural middle Tennessee, eastern Kentucky still calls to me. Kentuckians have a deeply ingrained, almost mystical sense of place — a sense of belonging that defines us. As a teenager, I took a friend to see my great-aunt Pauline’s farm. She passed away when I was in the fourth grade. Nevertheless, although I had not been there since I was ten years old, I navigated my car deep into the countryside, to her homestead on Little Cat Creek, without making a single wrong turn. More recently, after flying over catastrophic mountaintop removal coal-mining sites in Pike County, I drove to Black Log Hollow in Martin County, where my paternal grandmother was raised. When I pulled onto Black Log, something ineffable — without words and deeper than memory, from a place so primal that it transcends thought and conscious action — tugged at my soul. I went unhesitatingly to the first mailbox on the right. The stenciled name read “Dalton,” which was my paternal grandmother’s maiden name; I had found my great-grandparents’ home and realized that folks to whom I am kin lived there yet. I called on the residents, and like a cliché, the old woman inside accused me of being the law or a tax collector. The only thing missing was a rifle across her lap. These mountains can hold dark secrets. Mary Bernadine Dalton, who became my Mamaw Ciminella, never talked to me much about her family or her years growing up. Her mother, Effie, was married at least five times. The husband who fathered Mamaw and her two sisters disappeared from the scene — she never said why, at least to me, although Papaw Ciminella, who loved family dearly and was a devoted reminiscer, told me that my great-granddaddy had hit Effie and she’d ended that marriage on the spot. Mostly, what I knew was that Mamaw was a gorgeous mountain girl with a luscious figure who, like the Kim Novak character in “Picnic,”fell for a charming, exotic outsider who loved adventure. Michael Lawrence Ciminella (Papaw) was the son of Sicilian immigrants who had settled in western New York, on the shores of Lake Erie. His mother was a classic homemaker in the Italian tradition, his father had a good job making wine for Welch’s, and they were surrounded by a vibrant extended family. They raised five children together, including Papaw. But, according to my cousins, there was a dark side to this quintessential American story. A family member had raped Papaw’s mother, and his oldest brother was conceived in incest. I can only imagine the suffering that created in Papaw’s family as he grew up, and it may explain why he developed ulcers that kept him out of military service during World War II. As a young man, Papaw, after his exciting tenure in the Civilian Conservation Corps in the western states, which allowed him to discover his love of rambling, installed copper roofing and gutters up and down the Appalachian Mountains. It was on one of these trips that he met the beautiful Billie Dalton at a clandestine juke joint in Inez, Kentucky. He swept her away from the local hero she was dating and married her in 1944, after a six-week courtship. They moved to Erie, Pennsylvania, where he found a good job with General Electric building locomotives during the war. My father, Michael Charles Ciminella, who came along, was their only child. After the war, Papaw and Mamaw briefly owned a diner in Erie until Papaw, who used to play some serious poker, lost the business to one of the local “hard guys” in a card game. His gambling days over (for a while, at least), Papaw moved his young family back to eastern Kentucky, where he worked as a brakeman for the C&O; Railroad. He was a wizard with all kinds of metalwork, and he eventually turned a part-time business building and installing gutters and siding into the successful Ashland Aluminum Products Company. Dad idolized his father, whom he remembers as outgoing, immensely competitive, hardworking and honest. Papaw never lied or cheated to make a sale, and he expected people to pay him when and what they owed him. Mamaw, in her early years, was as outgoing as Papaw. They were a beautiful and stylish couple, accomplished dancers who enjoyed socializing and golfing at the country club. But Dad’s memory is that Mamaw grew more eccentric as she got older. She liked her house to be perfectly clean, neat and orderly. She also tended to fret, particularly about the health of her only child. Dad had come down with a bad case of rheumatic fever as a young boy. It took him years to recuperate, and the family moved to Florida during the winters to help him heal. Mamaw must have been terrified of losing him, because she nearly smothered him trying to keep him safe. He chafed at her vigilance, and when it came time for high school, he asked to go to Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia to slip out from under her watchful eye. Dad thrived there, academically and athletically. The once sickly kid had turned into an outstanding baseball player, whose achievements were chronicled in the local paper and who briefly considered going pro. When he was sixteen, his parents bought him a Corvair Monza so that he could drive himself back and forth to Ashland. As soon as he received the car, Wendell Lyon, his best friend back home, enlisted him to drive him and his girlfriend, Linda McDonald, who would eventually become my godmother, to the movie theater over in Huntington, West Virginia. To seal the deal, Linda arranged a blind date for Michael with her pretty, fourteen-year-old across-the-street neighbor and friend, Diana Judd. Michael and Diana dated on and off for the next three years, and she has said that he first proposed marriage when she was only fifteen. She also claims she never loved him, but she enjoyed being taken on dates to the country club, and she was impressed by the comfortable lifestyle of the Ciminella family, which seemed luxurious compared with her family’s humbler circumstances. Charles Glen Judd, my maternal papaw, came from a family that didn’t have much money, but they had laughter, stability, and love. He was born on Shirt Tail Fork of Little Blainecreek, alongside a farm that had been in the family for generations. Papaw Judd and his folks moved to Ashland because the job options in Lawrence County were coal mines or nothing. When he was a senior in high school, he fell for a fourteen-year-old strawberry blonde cashier named Pauline “Polly” Oliver. Polly, my maternal grandmother, whom we call “Nana,” came from a strange and troubled background. Her paternal grandfather, David Oliver, had turned on the gas oven and then hanged himself in front of his sons, aged only six and four, apparently because he was distraught that my great-great grandmother had left him. Howard, Nana’s father, managed to save himself and his younger brother by breaking out a window. Howard, in turn, married a flophouse alcoholic party girl named Edie Mae Burton, who repeatedly cheated on him. When Nana was nine years old, her dad was found in the bathroom with a bullet in his head; it looked like suicide, but everyone suspected Edie and her boyfriend. Edie took off soon after the funeral, dumping Nana and her two younger siblings with her rigid, intimidating grandmother, Cora Lee Burton. Nana raised herself and her brother and sister among a collection of maladjusted grown aunts and uncles who were still living at home, and she went to work at her grandmommy Cora Lee’s restaurant, the locally loved Hamburger Inn. She was just fifteen when she married Glen Judd, and it must have seemed like a good deal. Glen bought his own treasure of a gas station and called it Judd’s Friendly Ashland Service. When he and Nana started having children, they bought his parents’ big wood frame house at 2237 Montgomery Avenue. Diana was the firstborn, followed two years later by Brian, then Mark, then Margaret. My mother has always described her early childhood as idealized, happy and secure, like a Norman Rockwell fantasy, with a stay-at-home mother who cooked wonderfully and a father she adored, who was hardworking and popular in the community. For Nana, though, the marriage was no picnic. Papaw Judd was a decent man who made a good living at the filling station, but he was as tight with money as two coats of paint. Nana never had new clothes and didn’t have a washer and dryer until the youngest of their four children was out of diapers. When the furnace quit, Papaw Judd told Nana to fetch plastic from the dry cleaner’s to insulate the windows. It was the only time Mom remembered her mother standing up to him about household finances. Papaw also worked long hours, often staying late to drink whiskey. My mother describes herself as wildly imaginative and a perfectionist as a child, the kind of kid who always had her hand in the air at school, earned good grades, and kept her room immaculate. She had neighborhood friends to play with in the humid summer evenings and siblings she loved, especially her gentle and funny younger brother Brian. Like all children, Mom must have absorbed the tension in the household, but she says the only thing she missed as a child was the attention of her elusive father. While she yearned for his affection, she learned to be noticed in other ways. Mom was a born extrovert who used her babysitting money to take tap-dancing lessons. And folks around Ashland all say how popular and beautiful she was. |||||","output":"In her shocking memoir, \\"All That Is Bitter & Sweet,\\" actress Ashley Judd reflects on her tumultuous upbringing in a country-singing family, including stories of abuse, drug-use, and her complicated relationship with her mother, legendary country singer Naomi Judd.

Railroad development in New Mexico began in earnest in 19th century America, during a period of rapid westward expansion and industrialization. It was part of a broader national initiative to establish a transcontinental railroad system to bind the newly united states. Several Pacific Railway Acts were passed to facilitate and subsidize the construction of such railroads, which were fundamental to the era's booming industrial growth and were regarded as central to the national interest. In New Mexico, the construction of the first railroad was led by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF), one of the largest railway companies of the time and among the main players in the drive to establish transcontinental railroads. Its rails were the first to cross into New Mexico. The AT&SF was chartered on February 11, 1859, with the goal of joining Atchison and Topeka, Kansas, with Santa Fe, New Mexico, in an effort to facilitate trade and settlement in the Southwest. However, the rugged terrain and the Civil War delayed the construction, and it wasn't until the 1870s that the company started laying tracks southward from Colorado. In 1878, the AT&SF reached the New Mexico border and laid its track through the Raton Pass, a mountain pass located on the Colorado-New Mexico border that offered the lowest crossing point in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. After overcoming significant engineering challenges, the railroad entered New Mexico in 1879 via the town of Raton, making it the entry point of the first railroad in the state. The introduction of the railroad in New Mexico dramatically changed the state's socio-economic landscape. It allowed for increased trade and faster transport of goods, spurred growth in industry and agriculture, and led to the rise of new towns near railroad stations. As a result, New Mexico witnessed sudden and significant population growth, attracting migrants looking for economic opportunities. The impact of the railroad's arrival extended beyond New Mexico's borders. The connection of New Mexico to a wider national and eventually transcontinental railroad network set the stage for the state's inclusion into the wider national economy, facilitated mobility across regions, and played a pivotal role in the industrial development of the American Southwest as a whole."},{"instruction":"- draft round is 1 - draft pick is 2 - number is 0 - height in is 11 - team is los angeles sparks washington mystics los angeles sparks - wnba profile is alana_beard - birth date is 14 may 1982 - draft team is washington mystics - draft year is 2004 - college is duke -lrb- 2000 -- 2004 -rrb- - birth place is shreveport , louisiana - draft league is wnba - weight lbs is 160 - position is guard / forward - high school is southwood -lrb- shreveport , louisiana -rrb- - career start is 2004 - nationality is american - years is 2004 -- 2011 2012 -- present - league is wnba - height ft is 5 - image is alana beard 2011.jpg Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the given equation for s, we need to isolate the variable s on one side of the equation. The equation is: 0 = -612*s + 18774 + 2646 First, let's combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation: 0 = -612*s + (18774 + 2646) 0 = -612*s + 21420 Now, we need to isolate s. In order to do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of s, which is -612: 0 / -612 = (-612*s + 21420) / -612 0 = s - 21420 / -612 Now, we need to solve for s. We do that by multiplying both sides of the equation by -1 to get: 0 = s + 21420 / 612 Finally, we will move the fraction to the left side of the equation to solve for s: s = - (21420 / 612) We can now perform the division to find the value of s: s ≈ -35.0327 So, the solution to the equation 0 = -612*s + 18774 + 2646 is approximately s ≈ -35.0327."},{"instruction":"Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

This was his first retailing experience and he really enjoyed it. After graduation, he began his own career as a retail merchant. He soon opened his first Wal-Mart store in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas. Wal-Mart specialized in name brands at low prices and Sam Walton was surprised at the success. Soon a chain of Wal-Mart stores sprang up across rural America. Walton's management style was popular with employees and he founded some of the basic concepts of management that are still in use today. After taking the company public in 1970, Walton introduced his \\"profit sharing plan\\". The profit sharing plan was a plan for Wal-Mart employees to improve their income dependent on the profits of the store. Sam Walton believed that \\"individuals don't win, teams do\\". Employees at Wal-Mart stores were offered stock options and store discounts. These benefits are commonplace today, but Walton was among the first to implement them. Walton believed that a happy employee meant happy customers and more sales. He also believed that by giving employees a part of the company and making their success dependent on the company's success, they would care about the company. By the 1980s, Wal-Mart had sales of over one billion dollars and over three hundred stores across North America. Wal-Mart's unique decentralized distribution system, also Walton's idea, created the _ needed to further encourage growth in the 1980s during growing complaints that the \\"superstore\\" was stopping smaller and traditional stores from developing.

The unnamed Narrator is an automobile recall specialist who is unfulfilled by his job and possessions, and has developed severe insomnia. He finds catharsis by posing as a sufferer of testicular cancer and other afflictions in support groups, remedying his insomnia. His bliss is disturbed by another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him he is attending these groups dishonestly. The two agree to split which groups they attend, but not before they exchange contact details on the premise of switching groups at short notice. On a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets and interacts with soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. Deciding against asking Marla for help, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. Tyler says the Narrator is beholden to consumerism. In the parking lot, he asks the Narrator to hit him, and they begin a fistfight. The Narrator is invited to move into Tyler's home: a large, dilapidated house in an industrial area. They have further fights outside the bar, which attract growing crowds of men. The fights move to the bar's basement where the men form Fight Club, which routinely meets for the men to fight recreationally. Marla overdoses on pills and telephones the Narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler picks up the phone and goes to her apartment to save her.

Understanding the question: The question asks what a contraceptive device will avoid the creation of, meaning we need to identify what the primary purpose of a contraceptive device is. 2. Definition of a contraceptive device: A contraceptive device is a method or tool used to prevent pregnancy. Its primary function is to prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg, which would result in the formation of a zygote that could develop into a fetus and eventually a person. 3. Analyzing the given options: - drug store, pharmacy, and drugstore: These options are locations where various medications and healthcare products, including contraceptive devices, can be purchased. They are not relevant to the purpose of a contraceptive device. - children: This option is related to the effect of using a contraceptive device, as it prevents the conception and birth of children. - person: This option encompasses the broader result of using a contraceptive device, as it prevents the formation of a new individual (from zygote to child to adult). 4. Concluding the correct answer: Based on the definition and primary function of a contraceptive device, the most appropriate answer is a \\"person\\" because it prevents the formation of a new individual by avoiding the fertilization of an egg and the subsequent development of a zygote, fetus, child, and adult."},{"instruction":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","output":"A task that would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning is one that involves understanding and applying knowledge of the principles and laws governing the physical world, such as mechanics, gravity, and motion. Essentially, a physical reasoning task would require an individual to evaluate a situation, reason through the factors involved, and make predictions about what might happen based on their understanding of the physical world. One example of such a task could be a physics-based obstacle course or a series of physical challenges designed to test an individual's understanding of physical principles, problem-solving skills, and capacity to adapt to a dynamic environment. Here is a scenario that includes several elements to test someone's physical reasoning skills: **The Physics Obstacle Course Challenge** The objective of this obstacle course is to navigate through a series of physical challenges and complete the course in the shortest time possible, while making use of the participant's understanding of physical principles to solve problems and overcome obstacles. 1. **Pulley System Puzzle:** Participants must use a pulley system to lift a heavy object (e.g., a sandbag) from the ground and place it on a raised platform. This task tests their understanding of mechanical advantage and force distribution, as they must determine the appropriate pulley configuration for the easiest and quickest lifting technique. 2. **Inclined Plane Navigation:** Participants must push an oddly shaped object up a ramp without it rolling back down. This challenge tests the understanding of the principles of friction, inclined planes, and force vectors. Participants must devise a strategy based on these principles to keep the object in place while moving up the ramp. 3. **Projectile Launch:** Participants must adjust the angle and force of a launch system, such as a catapult or trebuchet, in order to hit a target accurately. This task tests their understanding of projectile motion, gravity, and force application. They will have to calculate the appropriate angle and force required to hit the target, taking into account factors such as wind resistance and distance. 4. **Balance Beam Maze:** Participants must navigate a maze of balance beams while carrying a heavy load, such as a stack of bricks or a weighted backpack. This challenge tests their understanding of principles related to center of mass, balance, and stability. Participants must maintain their balance on the beams while taking into consideration the effect of the additional weight they are carrying. 5. **Pendulum Swing:** Using a pendulum attached to a high point, participants must swing from one platform to another while avoiding obstacles. This task tests their understanding of principles related to pendulum motion, conservation of energy, and timing. They must calculate the appropriate moment to swing and release, as well as the right trajectory to avoid the obstacles and land on the target platform. The Physics Obstacle Course Challenge not only tests the participants' ability to perform physical reasoning but also provides an opportunity to apply these principles in real-world, dynamic situations. This type of task encourages critical thinking, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, making it a comprehensive test of an individual's capacity for physical reasoning."},{"instruction":"Q: Who criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier? A: Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the Encyclopédie and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire and Émilie du Châtelet. Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"The answer provided does not directly address the question posed. The question asks about a critique of sciences for distancing man from nature and not contributing to people's happiness. The answer, however, speaks about the introduction of scientific theories by Philosophes and the popularization of Newtonianism, which is not relevant to the original question. A more appropriate answer would be: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, an influential 18th-century philosopher, criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier. In his 1750 work, \\"Discourse on the Sciences and Arts,\\" Rousseau argued that the advancement of knowledge, arts, and sciences had led to moral decay. He believed that as people became more educated and cultured, they lost touch with natural virtues and their true selves. Known for his works such as \\"The Social Contract\\" and \\"Emile,\\" Rousseau emphasized the need for a simpler, less materialistic lifestyle. He maintained that individuals are inherently good but become corrupted by the complexities and demands of society. According to his view, an increased focus on science and intellectual progress led to vanity, envy, greed, and the decline of morality. In conclusion, Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the philosopher who criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier. He believed that people should return to a more natural state and focus on their inherent virtues, rather than devoting their energy to the advancement of knowledge and the arts, which he found to be detrimental to human happiness."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: Do you have a room?

The alcid family includes the murres, guillemots, auklets, puffins, and murrelets. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Inuktitut (; inuk \\"person\\" + -titut \\"like, in the manner of\\"), also Eastern Canadian Inuktitut or Eastern Canadian Inuit, is one of the principal Inuit languages of Canada. It is spoken in all areas north of the tree line, including parts of the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, to some extent in northeastern Manitoba as well as the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. It is one of the aboriginal languages written with Canadian Aboriginal syllabics. - Puffins are any of three small species of alcids (auks) in the bird genus \\"Fratercula\\" with a brightly coloured beak during the breeding season. These are pelagic seabirds that feed primarily by diving in the water. They breed in large colonies on coastal cliffs or offshore islands, nesting in crevices among rocks or in burrows in the soil. Two species, the tufted puffin and horned puffin, are found in the North Pacific Ocean, while the Atlantic puffin is found in the North Atlantic Ocean. - The Innu (or Montagnais) are the Aboriginal inhabitants of an area in Canada they refer to as \\"Nitassinan\\" (Our Land), which comprises most of the northeastern portion of the province of Quebec and some eastern portions of Labrador. Their population in 2003 included about 18,000 people, of which around 14,000 lived in Quebec, under 3000 in Labrador, and the rest outside their traditional territory. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Guillemots is the common name for several species of seabird in the auk family (part of the order Charadriiformes). In British use, the term comprises two genera: \\"Uria\\" and \\"Cepphus\\". In North America the \\"Uria\\" species are called \\"murres\\" and only the \\"Cepphus\\" species are called \\"guillemots\\". This word of French origin apparently derives from a form of the name William, cf. . - Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most Charadriiformes live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), some occupy deserts and a few are found in thick forest. - Newfoundland and Labrador (; Innu: \\"Akamassiss\\"), is the most easterly province of Canada. Situated in the country's Atlantic region, it comprises the island of Newfoundland and mainland Labrador to the northwest, with a combined area of . In 2013, the province's population was estimated at 526,702. About 92% of the province's population lives on the island of Newfoundland (and its neighbouring smaller islands), of whom more than half live on the Avalon Peninsula. The province is Canada's most linguistically homogeneous, with 97.6% of residents reporting English (Newfoundland English) as their mother tongue in the 2006 census. Historically, Newfoundland was also home to unique varieties of French and Irish, as well as the extinct Beothuk language. In Labrador, local dialects of Innu-aimun and Inuktitut are also spoken. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Uria is a genus of seabirds in the auk family known in Britain as guillemots , in most of North America as murres , and in Newfoundland and Labrador as turr . These are medium - sized birds with mainly brown or black plumage in the breeding season . They breed on the coasts of the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . There are two species : Common murre or common guillemot , Uria aalge Thick - billed murre or Brünnich 's guillemot , Uria lomvia Uria auks are relatives of the razorbill , little auk and the extinct great auk and together make up the tribe Alcini . Despite the similar British common names , they are not so closely related to the Cepphus guillemots , which form the tribe Cepphini . These birds breed in large colonies on coastal cliffs , laying single elongated conical eggs directly on cliff ledges . They move south in winter to keep in ice - free waters . They dive for food from the surface , swimming underwater and being among the deepest divers of all birds , using their stubby wings to routinely dive to more than 100 meters , and feeding on fish and crustaceans , also some molluscs , insects and plant material . Adult birds are black or brown on the head , neck , back and wings with white underparts . The bill is long and pointed . They have a small rounded black tail . The lower face becomes white in winter . The flight is strong and direct , and these species have fast wing beats due to the short wings . Uria guillemots produces a variety of harsh cackling calls at the breeding colonies , but are silent at sea . Some prehistoric Uria species are also known : Uria bordkorbi ( Monterey or Sisquoc , Late Miocene of Lompoc , USA ) Uria affinis ( Late Pleistocene of E USA ) - possibly a subspecies of U. lomvia Uria paleohesperis ( Late Miocene of W USA ) U. brodkorbi is interesting insofar as it is the only known occurrence of the Alcini tribe in the temperate to subtropical Pacific , except for the very fringe of the range of U. aalge . It suggests that the Uria species , which are the sister... - Cepphus is a genus of seabirds in the auk family also referred to as true guillemots or, in North America, simply as guillemots. The genus name \\"Cepphus\\" is from Ancient Greek \\"kepphos\\", a pale waterbird mentioned by Greek authors including Aristotle. The English word \\"guillemot\\" is from French \\"guillemot\\" probably derived from \\"Guillaume\\", \\"William\\". \\"Murre\\" is of uncertain origins, but may imitate the call of the common guillemot. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

From Tokyo to Sydney, London to New York, thousands waited for hours – sometimes days – to get their hands on the third incarnation of the iPad. Some who didn’t like the idea of sleeping on a cold pavement paid as much as £300 to jump the queue. Scroll down to see video of Apple fans. Among the ordinary shoppers wanting to get their hands on the latest must-have product were profiteering gangs. They infiltrated queues to buy iPads and re-sell them at inflated prices abroad. Customers in Apple's Regent Street store, all bagged up with their purchases. Dozens of people were paid by 'agents' to join queues around London and grab iPads to sell on. However, there is no suggestion that those pictured had any part in this. Black market gangs in London paid people to join the queue and buy the new tablets so they could then be sold on at a profit. The frenzy – reminiscent of the scenes which greeted the launch of its predecessor this time last year – is all the more surprising given that the latest iPad represents only an evolution of previous designs rather than a revolution. Its key selling point is a so-called ‘retina display’, with a high-definition touchscreen boasting 3.1million pixels – more than an HD television. The new model, which costs from £399 to £659 in the UK, also comes with an improved camera and a faster processor, making it attractive to those who use it to play games. The wait for the pay-day paid off: 16-year-old Noah Green was fourth in the queue - but sold his spot for £300. Eager for a bite of the Apple: People sit in the queue for the new iPad 3 outside the company's flagship store on Regent Street in London. Noah Green, a 16-year-old student from Stanmore, North-West London, had been fourth in the queue at Apple’s flagship store in Regent Street, London, but said someone had paid him £300 to move back. Before going through the door, he said: ‘It is worth it. I am still 18th in the queue so I will be one of the first to buy an iPad. I am going to sell it though and earn some money.’ Many appeared to have been paid £10 or £20 to wait in line for hours on behalf of a third party. Some buyers had their hands full of shopping bags filled with products. One was even pictured wheeling items out on a trolley. First! 21-year-old Zohaib Ali from London celebrates getting his hands on the first iPad 3. Ali's 141-hour wait: The 21-year-old ate, drank and slept at the front of the queue. At Westfield shopping centre, in Shepherd’s Bush, West London, a number of buyers were seen handing purchases – still in their shrink-wrapped boxes – to a waiting group of Eastern European men. Every reviewer has raved about the iPad's screen, packing a huge 3.1 million pixels. Tech site The Verge said:. 'Yes, this display is outrageous. It's stunning. It's incredible. I'm. not being hyperbolic or exaggerative when I say it is easily the most. beautiful computer display I have ever looked at.

Tech Crunch said: 'Once you see and use the new iPad, there will be no going back.' One said: ‘We’re just buying and selling, we’re not doing anything illegal. We bought them and we sold them.’ At Covent Garden, men were seen handing over money, collecting receipts and organising scores of people queuing. One agent, who gave his name as Martin, said: ‘I hope to get around 70 iPads today. I will be sending them on to India.’ The new iPad will not be on sale officially in India for at least another week. Stores were given only a limited supply of the new device and many had sold out by mid-afternoon. This allowed buyers who did manage to get one the opportunity to make a quick profit by selling them via eBay. Sellers on the auction website were offering the 16GB version, which connects to the web via wifi, for as much as £562.79 – a mark-up of £163.79, or 41 per cent, on the official price of £399. The scenes were repeated around the world. In Paris, one customer, Athena May, said: ‘I don’t think it’s worth the price but I guess I’m a victim of society.’ Shares in Apple punched through the 600 barrier – a new record – briefly on Thursday pushing the value of the technology giant to 560billion (£354billion) and confirming it as the world’s most valuable company. Blanket coverage of the iPad launch: Fenella Barnes and Harry Barrington-Mountford, from Upminster, sit in the queue. Apple employees welcome customers to the company's Covent Garden store in London. He'll remember this: Staff clap for the first customer at an Apple store in Hong Kong this morning.

Some people paid others to stand in line for them, imagine asking your friends to hold your spot in the lunch line while you play a bit more. 6. One boy, Noah, even earned a nice amount of money (like selling 300 candies) for giving up his spot in line. 7. People were selling these iPads on a website called eBay to make more money. 8. Some people traveled really far to buy this iPad, and even stood in line for hours, like the time you waited to get on the giant slide at the fair. 9. Because of all this excitement around the new iPad, Apple, the company that makes iPads, became even more valuable – like finding a super rare, shiny Pokémon card."},{"instruction":"Given the background: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere. and the situation: John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter.

This justifies what answer for what question? Q & A:","output":"Q: What factors should be considered before deciding if the small children are girls and if the sparkling rope is twine? A: To determine the small children's gender and the nature of the sparkling rope, some primary factors should be considered: 1. Clothing and hair: Clothing or haircuts might provide some indication of gender, but it's essential to remember that appearances can be misleading and that children's appearances may not exclusively follow traditional gender norms. 2. Context and behavior: Observing the children's behavior and interactions with others may offer clues about their gender. However, it's essential to recognize that children's behavior can be diverse and might not necessarily align with gender stereotypes. 3. Material and structure of the rope: Examining the sparkling rope's texture, thickness, and flexibility can help in determining if it's indeed twine or another type of rope. However, it's important to note that there are various materials and variations of rope in addition to twine. Given these factors, we should avoid making assumptions about the children's gender and the nature of the sparkling rope without observing or gathering further information."},{"instruction":"Q:Pick one category for the following text.

What is the purpose of life? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choose your answer from: [i] no; [ii] yes;","output":"[i] no; Although both questions touch upon the topic of life and its significance, they are not the same. The first question focuses on the small yet important aspects of life, while the second question inquires into the overall purpose of life. To answer these questions thoroughly, let's explore both of them separately. 1. Small but important things in life: As an AI, the concept of personal life doesn't apply to me. However, I can certainly provide you with an answer that reflects the human experience. Life is filled with numerous things, but some of the small yet significant aspects that people seem to cherish are as follows: a. Quality time with family and friends: Engaging in meaningful conversations, sharing meals, and participating in enjoyable activities together make for lasting memories and strong bonds. b. Acts of kindness: Small gestures such as offering a helping hand, giving compliments, or lending a listening ear can have a tremendous impact on someone's day or even their life. c. Appreciating nature: Spending time outdoors and being present in the moment can help individuals attain a sense of peace and rejuvenation. d. Personal care and wellness: Taking time to rest, exercise, and maintain a balanced diet is essential for overall well-being. e. Gratitude: Acknowledging the good things and expressing thankfulness can boost your mood and help cultivate a positive mindset. 2. The purpose of life: The purpose of life may vary depending on one's personal beliefs, cultural context, and individual experiences. Here are a few perspectives on the purpose of life: a. To find meaning and happiness: Many people believe that the purpose of life is to discover and fulfill their own sense of meaning or create their own happiness through personal experiences and goals. b. To make a difference: Some individuals feel called to contribute positively to the world, leaving a lasting impact through their actions and decisions. c. Personal and spiritual growth: The pursuit of self-improvement and personal development may sometimes be considered the purpose of life. This could include seeking wisdom, cultivating virtues, and engaging in spiritual practices. d. To love and be loved: Building meaningful relationships and connections with others can also be viewed as an integral part of life. e. Philosophical perspectives: Philosophers throughout history have offered various existential views on the purpose of life, such as Aristotle's notion of achieving eudaimonia (human flourishing). It is essential to recognize that the meaning and purpose of life will differ among people, and each person must determine the purpose that speaks to their individual experiences and beliefs. Thus, while both questions deal with aspects of life and its significance, they hold distinct themes and should be considered separately."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task your given a passage and a question in Catalan, you must answer the question based on the passage.

The makers of Full & Slim claim that of 500 women who drank it before every meal, 70 per cent lost a stone or more in six weeks (file picture) It sounds too good to be true. A diet drink which claims to help people lose up to a stone in weight by mimicking the actions of a gastric band is to go on sale in Britain. The makers of Full & Slim say it works by expanding in the stomach to convince the drinker that he or she is full. They claim it can help overweight people lower their cholesterol, absorb fats more efficiently and reduce their chance of developing diabetes. The drink contains l-carnitine, an amino acid which helps burn fat in the body and turn it into energy, and glucomannan, a natural ‘super-fibre’ derived from the tuberous roots of the konjac plant. When glucomannan comes into contact with water in the intestine it increases in volume, becoming almost gel-like, causing food to move more slowly through the digestive system. This, in turn, helps control levels of sugar in the bloodstream. The makers say that of 500 women who drank the supplement before each meal, around 70 per cent lost a stone or more in weight within six weeks. Even women who simply took the drink, without dieting or completing any exercise, lost up to 3lbs a week.Full & Slim director James Harrington said: ‘The combination of ingredients suppresses appetite and mimics the effects of a gastric band, without undergoing the trauma of invasive surgery.’ However experts are sceptical about the benefits of natural foods and supplements that claim to speed up weight loss, with many studies claiming over-the-counter drinks and shakes produce no more weight loss than a placebo. But one recent survey found that, on average, volunteers given 4g of glucomannan a day for five weeks recorded a 5.1 per cent reduction in body weight, as well as a 5.54 per cent drop in their body mass index and 14 per cent drop in cholesterol. L-caratine in the drink expands the stomach, making the drinker feel full, similar to a gastric band (pictured) By contrast, slimmers offered a dummy drug or placebo reported drops in weight of just 1.93 per cent, a 1.97 per cent fall in BMI and 12 per cent drop in cholesterol. The drinks, which come in fruit-flavoured sachets, cost around £1.38 each or £28.95 for 21. Slimmers are advised to drink one with water 30 minutes before every meal. They will be sold at Boots from next month. Last month scientists revealed they had developed an implant containing genetically engineered cells which could replace the need for gastric band surgery. It responds to fat in the bloodstream by producing a hormone signal that tells the brain: ‘You’re full, stop eating’.

Yes or no? Answer: While such classic mechanisms are important locally, as with inorganic amorphous semiconductors , tunnelling, localized states, mobility gaps , and phonon -assisted hopping also significantly contribute to conduction, particularly in polyacetylenes. Question: what are organic semiconductors and what is concept of homo and lumo in organic semiconductor","output":"Organic semiconductors are a class of materials composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen atoms that exhibit semiconducting properties. These materials have gained significant interest due to their potential applications in various electronic and optoelectronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic solar cells (OSCs), and flexible electronics, among others. Organic semiconductors can be classified into two categories: small organic molecules and conjugated polymers. The semiconducting properties of these materials arise from the π-conjugation present in their molecular structure. π-conjugation refers to the overlapping of p-orbitals in the carbon atoms, extending over multiple adjacent atoms, forming a continuous electronic system. This allows for the delocalization of electrons, which gives rise to their unique electronic characteristics and defines their potential as semiconducting materials. The concept of HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) are central to understanding the electronic properties of organic semiconductors. HOMO and LUMO are the highest energy levels of the molecular orbitals occupied and unoccupied by electrons, respectively. The HOMO represents the energy level of the valence band, while the LUMO corresponds to the energy level of the conduction band. The energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO, known as the bandgap, plays a vital role in determining the optoelectronic properties of a semiconductor. In organic semiconductors, the bandgap is generally larger than in inorganic semiconductors, and their electronic transitions are predominantly characterized by HOMO-LUMO energy level changes. Due to the electronic structure of organic materials, electron transfer processes in these materials are typically associated with exciton formation - electron-hole pairs that are coupled through Coulomb interactions. The effective charge transport and dissociation of excitons in organic semiconductors are crucial for efficient device performance. When considering the statement provided, \\"While such classic mechanisms are important locally, as with inorganic amorphous semiconductors, tunnelling, localized states, mobility gaps, and phonon-assisted hopping also significantly contribute to conduction, particularly in polyacetylenes,\\" it is true that organic semiconductors, including polyacetylenes, exhibit different mechanisms compared to inorganic semiconductors. In organic semiconductors, charge transport predominantly occurs through hopping or tunnelling processes between localized states—HOMO and LUMO levels of different molecules. These processes involve thermally activated hopping, polaron transport, and phonon-assisted hopping. The nature of these processes leads to relatively lower charge carrier mobility in organic semiconductors compared to inorganic ones. However, the intrinsic disorder and flexibility in the molecular packing and electronic structure of organic materials offer tunability of their properties through various strategies such as molecular design, doping, and device architecture optimization, making them promising candidates for a wide range of electronic applications. In conclusion, organic semiconductors are a unique class of carbon-based materials that exhibit semiconducting properties, and the concept of HOMO and LUMO plays a central role in understanding their electronic behavior. Their charge transport mechanisms are different than those observed in inorganic semiconductors, with hopping and tunneling dominating charge carrier mobility, especially in conjugated polymers like polyacetylenes."},{"instruction":"Leo: Given the sentence \\"A man and woman are standing next to a rack of polka dotted shirts.\\" is it true that \\"A man and woman eat dinner at a romantic restaurant.\\"?

So, when discussing a \\"Conference Hotel and Rate\\" in Czech, you would say \\"Konferenční hotel a sazba\\". This phrase would convey the concept of a hotel that accommodates conference or meeting attendees and the associated cost or rate for staying there."},{"instruction":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: For about a decade I always have bought HP printers.

Hold the hair dryer above your head, and aim the nozzle down at your sides as you blow dry your hair. Set the style afterwards with some hair wax. Add a flat, wide directional nozzle to your hairdryer to make the process more effective and give you more control over the direction of the air flow. There is no need to wash it more often than that. Not only can over-washing affect the texture of your hair, but it will also remove any styling products that you applied to the sides. If you remove these styling products, the sides will poof out. Not only can they look stylish and keep you warm during the colder months, they will also help keep down the sides and prevent them from poofing out. Make your hair look longer by parting it down the middle before you put the hat on. If you don't like wearing hats that much, try leaving it on for about 2 hours; after you take it off, your hair should be flatter along the sides and not so poofy. Rather than combing your hair back, try a middle or side part instead. This works best when the sides are still short, but you can use this technique after you've flattened the sides with a hairdryer. If the sides of your hair are starting to get long, you can keep them flat by applying some hair gel and using the palm of your hand to smooth the gel downwards into your hair. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to make the parts nice and neat. Summary:","output":"The article provides tips for managing poofy hair on the sides, suggesting a proper hair washing routine, using a hairdryer with a wide nozzle, and avoiding over-washing. To keep the sides down, hats can be worn to help flatten the hair, and different parting styles can be tried for varied appearances. Applying hair gel can also help keep the sides flat, using a rat-tail comb for neat parting. Overall, the article offers guidance on how to maintain and style hair with poofy sides, ensuring a sleek and stylish look."},{"instruction":"Stream of consciousness rationale: P = P(A wins, B wins, C loses) + P(A wins, B loses, C wins) + P(A loses, B wins, C wins) = 1/5*3/8*4/7 + 1/5*5/8*3/7 + 4/5*3/8*3/7 = 63/280.

The given premise presents a scene where there is a public place with everyone looking normal except for one man who stands out due to his distinct attire and appearance. He is wearing all black clothes with spiked hair and carries a black bag. While this description provides certain details about the setting and the distinctive character, it does not provide enough information to determine whether the hypothesis stating that there is a crowd in the public place is true or not. Since the term \\"crowd\\" generally refers to a large number of people gathered together, typically in a disorganized manner, it is essential to establish a baseline for what would be considered a crowd in the given scenario. Unfortunately, the premise does not give any indication of the number of people present or the density of individuals within the public space. It simply states that everyone looks normal except for the one man dressed in black. Furthermore, the term \\"public place\\" is also quite broad – it can refer to a wide range of locations such as parks, squares, streets, shopping centers, and various other places where people tend to gather. Given the vagueness of this term, it is challenging to discern whether there would be a large number of people present at this particular location based on the information provided in the premise.

Solve 2559 = 117*i + 804 for i.","output":"Alright, let me help you solve this math problem step-by-step, like I'm talking to a 5-year-old. We have the problem: 2559 = 117*i + 804 Our goal is to find the value of i. Think of it as trying to figure out how many candies are in a jar (i = candies). We'll do this in a few simple steps. 1. First, let's get rid of the 804 next to the i. To do this, we'll subtract 804 from both sides of the equation like this: 2559 - 804 = 117*i + 804 - 804 2. Now, we'll do the subtraction: 1755 = 117*i Now, we have 1755 = 117*i. This means 117 candies multiplied by some number i give us 1755 candies in total. 3. To find out how many candies (i) there are, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 117 like this: (1755 ÷ 117) = (117*i ÷ 117) 4. Finally, we'll do the division: 15 = i So, the solution to the math problem is i = 15.

Here's a simple and delicious malt recipe that you can follow: Ingredients: - 2 scoops of ice cream (vanilla or your choice of flavor) - 1/2 cup of whole milk - 2 tablespoons of malted milk powder - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional) - Whipped cream and toppings (optional) Equipment: - Blender - Measuring cups and spoons - Glass or cup to serve Steps: 1. Gather and prepare your ingredients: Make sure you have your ingredients ready and within reach. This will help you work more efficiently during preparation. 2. Measure milk and malted milk powder: Pour 1/2 cup of whole milk into the blender. Then, measure out 2 tablespoons of malted milk powder and add it to the milk. The malted milk powder adds a unique and nostalgic flavor to the malt, making it different from a milkshake. 3. Scoop ice cream: Add 2 scoops of your preferred ice cream flavor to the blender. Classic vanilla ice cream works great, but you can also choose other flavors that you like or that complement the malted milk flavor. 4. Add vanilla extract (optional): For an additional layer of flavor, you can add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. However, this step is optional as the ice cream might already have a subtle vanilla flavor. 5. Blend until smooth: Place the lid on the blender and blend everything together on a low setting until smooth and creamy. Keep an eye on the consistency, as you may need to stop and scrape down the sides to ensure even blending. Be careful not to over-blend as it can cause the ice cream to melt too much. 6. Pour into glass: Once the malt has reached your desired consistency, pour it into a tall glass. The blend should be thick, smooth, and creamy. 7. Add whipped cream and toppings (optional): You can enhance your malt by adding a dollop of whipped cream and your choice of toppings (e.g., caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, sprinkles, crushed cookies, or chopped nuts). Adding these toppings creates a more visually appealing and flavorful experience. 8. Serve immediately: Enjoy your malt right away to ensure that it stays cold and maintains its thick texture. This recipe is just one example of how to make a malt - feel free to experiment with different ice cream flavors, toppings, and mix-ins to create your own unique and delicious creations."},{"instruction":"\\" We are very pleased that the court dismissed the vast majority of the plaintiff 's claims , \\" Coke spokeswoman Sonya Soutus said . \\" We are very pleased that the court dismissed the vast majority of the plaintiff 's claims , \\" said Coke spokesman Ben Deutsch .

They are victims and families of those killed and wounded in the Aurora movie theater massacre, and they want to know what happened to 5 million in donations collected since the violence of July 20. \\"There have been two tragedies in Aurora. The first was the theater shooting. The second is how the victims have been treated by the powers that be,\\" said Tom Teves, the father of Alex Teves, who was killed in the rampage at a midnight showing of \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\" Teves has emerged as a spokesman for a group of victims of the attack that left 12 dead and 58 wounded. On Aug. 28, Teves and 17 other family members and victims crowded onto a tiny stage at an Aurora meeting hall for the first time to ask about the millions raised for their loved ones. They also charged that they had been shut out of the process to distribute the funds. Last week, only Teves and seven others gathered and far fewer reporters attended for what Teves has said will be the last news conference on the matter. One by one the eight stepped forward to pay tribute to those lost, repeating, \\"We will remember.\\" Reading from a prepared statement and taking no questions Thursday, Teves said his group had been repeatedly misled by the Community First Foundation, which oversees the Aurora Victim Relief Fund that has been flooded with donations from across the country. He said his group has also been misled by the 7/20 Recovery Committee about who gets final say in how the money is divided. The coalition, made up of 30 community groups, health professionals and Aurora city officials, is in charge of making distribution recommendations. Teves said he was first told the victims and their families would get final say but now is being told the foundation can override their wishes. Calls to Community First for comment were not returned. Instead, a news release was emailed to reporters that says in part: \\"The 7/20 Recovery Committee remains committed to a robust and inclusive process that honors the input of all victims, and not just the voices of a few.\\" It further states that meetings with family members will continue and so far there has been \\"a very wide variety of opinions on the work ahead.\\" After the Aug. 28 news conference sparked outrage, Community First leaders said they would allow victims to have a voice in the process. This month, victims were sent a three-page survey that promised \\"100% of the Aurora Victim Relief Fund will be used exclusively to help meet the needs of the victims.\\" The survey lays out two disbursement possibilities. One would evenly divide the money among the wounded and the families of those killed, as well as others in the theater the night of the shooting and those displaced from their homes as authorities dismantled the booby traps in the apartment of suspect James E. Holmes. The second would divide it according to an individual needs assessment. The letter accompanying the survey says the models are based on those used to distribute funds after other tragedies, including those at Columbine High School in nearby Littleton and at Virginia Tech. The foundation has said it hopes to have the distribution plan in place by early November. Immediately after the shooting, Community First, along with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's office, cofounded the Aurora Victim Relief Fund. In late August, each of the 70 families of those killed or wounded received a 5,000 check from the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance for immediate needs — totaling 350,000 — with a promise of more to come. An additional 100,000 was taken from the fund and divided among 10 community nonprofit groups to help victims.

They purchase it for an unusually low price from Commander Beech (Donald Crisp). Rick and Pamela meet Beechâs 20-year-old granddaughter, Stella Meredith (Gail Russell), who lives with her grandfather in the nearby town of Biddlecombe. Stella is deeply upset by the sale because of her attachment to the house, despite its being where her mother died. The commander has forbidden Stella to enter the house or to see Rick. However, she gains access to Windward House through Rick, who has become infatuated with her. The Fitzgeralds' initial enchantment with the house diminishes when they unlock an artist's studio where they feel an inexplicable chill. Just before dawn, Rick hears the eerie sobs of an unseen woman, a phenomenon that Pamela investigates whilst awaiting her brother's return with their Irish housekeeper, Lizzie Flynn (Barbara Everest). The superstitious Lizzie notices a peculiar draft on the stairs. Rick and Pamela must face the obvious: Windward House is haunted. When Stella comes to Windward for dinner, she senses a spirit. Rather than fearing it, she associates the calming presence with her mother. Also, the strong scent of mimosa is that of her mother's favorite perfume. Suddenly she dashes out towards the very cliff from which her mother Mary fell to her death seventeen years earlier. Rick catches her just before she reaches the edge. Stella professes to have no recollection of the near-fatal incident. The Fitzgeralds and the town physician, Dr. Scott (Alan Napier), investigate. They learn that Stella's father, a painter, had had an affair with his model, a Spanish gypsy named Carmel.

The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the Piast dynasty, this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.

When we first brought Zeke and Kora home , the doctors did a myriad of test and work - ups . We expected the parasites and things like anemia to show up . But we knew the kids had been tested previously for most other things , so we did not anticipate any shocking revelations . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What will happen when the test results come back negative .","output":"When the test results come back negative, it will bring about a mix of relief and potential concern for the family. On one hand, the negative results would indicate that Zeke and Kora do not have any serious or life-threatening medical conditions that were previously undetected. This would bring great reassurance to the family, knowing that their new family members are not burdened with any major health issues. This knowledge would enable the family to continue focusing on providing the proper care, love, and attention needed to help Zeke and Kora adapt and thrive in their new home. On the other hand, if some symptoms or health issues persist without any clear answers from the test results, the family may feel a sense of concern and uncertainty about the overall wellbeing of Zeke and Kora. The absence of a clear diagnosis might lead them to seek further medical opinions and additional testing in an attempt to identify and address any underlying health problems that may have gone undetected in previous tests. Moreover, the process of undergoing more tests can be emotionally and physically draining for the family as well as Zeke and Kora. The uncertainty of their health condition may cause anxiety and stress for everyone involved, particularly for the parents who are responsible for making crucial decisions related to their children's medical care. The family will need to exercise patience and perseverance as they navigate through the complexities and intricacies of the healthcare system to search for conclusive answers. It is also important to remember that many children, especially those who were previously exposed to unfavorable living conditions, require time and a stable environment to recover from their initial health setbacks. In the case of Zeke and Kora, even when the test results come back negative, they may still need ongoing medical supervision and basic healthcare services such as regular checkups, vaccinations, and developmental assessments. This holistic approach would ensure that they continue to grow healthier and stronger, both physically and emotionally, within the caring environment provided by their new family. In conclusion, when the test results come back negative, the family will likely experience a combination of relief and potential concern. They will be thankful that Zeke and Kora do not have any major medical conditions and can then continue focusing on helping them adapt to their new home. However, the family may also have to face ongoing challenges related to any lingering health issues or concerns. They will need patience, resilience, and determination to explore further options, while ensuring Zeke and Kora receive the best medical care, love, and nurturing possible."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - Apollyon Sun were an industrial metal band formed by singer/guitarist Tom Gabriel Fischer and guitarist Erol Unala in early 1995, after the termination of Celtic Frost, Fischer's prior group. The group was unofficially dissolved in 2001 when Fischer invited Erol Unala to contribute to the reformation of Celtic Frost. Their name is taken from the Celtic Frost demo \\"Under Apollyon's Sun\\". - Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. The band have since experienced multiple line-up changes, with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war. - Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words \\"\\" (\\"nekros\\"; \\"dead\\") and \\"\\" (\\"philia\\"; \\"love\\"). - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration perpetrated against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent. The term \\"rape\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \\"sexual assault.\\" - The time signature (also known as meter signature, metre signature, or measure signature) is a notational convention used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are to be contained in each bar and which note value is to be given one beat. In a musical score, the time signature appears at the beginning of the piece, as a time symbol or stacked numerals, such as or (read \\"common time\\" and \\"three-four time\\", respectively), immediately following the key signature or immediately following the clef symbol if the key signature is empty. A mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a barline, indicates a change of meter. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - Cannibalism is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings. A person who practices cannibalism is called a cannibal. The expression \\"cannibalism\\" has been extended into zoology to mean one individual of a species consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food, including sexual cannibalism. - Siouxsie and the Banshees were an English rock band formed in London in 1976 by vocalist Siouxsie Sioux and bass guitarist Steven Severin. Initially associated with the English punk rock scene, the band rapidly evolved to create \\"a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation\\". \\"The Times\\" cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as \\"one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era\\". - Torture (from the Latin \\"tortus\\", \\"twisted\\") is the act of deliberately inflicting physical or psychological pain on an organism in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or compel some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture. - Judas Priest are a British heavy metal band formed in Birmingham, England, in 1969. The band has sold close to 50 million albums to date. MTV ranked them the second greatest metal band of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band struggled with indifferently produced records, repeated changes of drummer and a lack of major commercial success or attention until 1980, when they adopted a more simplified sound on the album \\"British Steel\\", which helped shoot them to rock superstar status. In 1989, they were named as defendants in an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging that subliminal messages on the song \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" had caused the suicide attempts of two young men. - Thomas Gabriel Fischer ( born 19 July 1963 ) , earlier known by his stage name of Tom G. Warrior , is a Swiss metal musician . He is considered to be one of the pioneers of the death metal style of singing , which resembles guttural growling . He led the groups Hellhammer and Celtic Frost , and today is the frontman of the band Triptykon . - Weimar Republic is an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was still \\"Deutsches Reich\\"; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \\"Deutsches Reich\\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries both left- and right-wing); and contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Weimar Republic government successfully reformed the currency, unified tax policies, and organized the railway system. Weimar Germany eliminated most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles; it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border. - Slasher films are a subgenre of horror films, typically involving a violent psychopath stalking and murdering several people, usually with bladed tools. Although the term \\"slasher\\" is sometimes used informally as a generic term for any horror movie involving murder, analysts of the genre cite an established set of characteristics which set these films apart from other horror subgenres, such as splatter films and psychological horror films. - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played. - Atonality in its broadest sense is music that lacks a tonal center, or key. \\"Atonality\\", in this sense, usually describes compositions written from about 1908 to the present day where a hierarchy of pitches focusing on a single, central tone is not used, and the notes of the chromatic scale function independently of one another . More narrowly, the term \\"atonality\\" describes music that does not conform to the system of tonal hierarchies that characterized classical European music between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries . \\"The repertory of atonal music is characterized by the occurrence of pitches in novel combinations, as well as by the occurrence of familiar pitch combinations in unfamiliar environments\\" . - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - A triptych (; from the Greek adjective \\"\\" \\"\\"triptukhon\\"\\" (\\"three-fold\\"), from \\"tri\\", i.e., \\"three\\" and \\"ptysso\\", i.e., \\"to fold\\" or \\"ptyx\\", i.e., \\"fold\\") is a work of art (usually a panel painting) that is divided into three sections, or three carved panels that are hinged together and can be folded shut or displayed open. It is therefore a type of polyptych, the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The form can also be used for pendant jewelry. - Dissection (from Latin ' \\"to cut to pieces\\"; also called anatomization), is the dismembering of the body of a deceased animal or plant to study its anatomical structure. Autopsy is used in pathology and forensic medicine to determine the cause of death in humans. It is carried out by or demonstrated to biology and anatomy students in high school and medical school. Less advanced courses typically focus on smaller subjects, such as small formaldehyde-preserved animals, while the more advanced courses normally use cadavers. Consequently, dissection is typically conducted in a morgue or in an anatomy lab. - Celtic Frost was a Swiss extreme metal band from Zürich. They are known for their heavy influence on the extreme metal genres. Formed in 1981 as Hellhammer, the band became Celtic Frost in 1984 and was active until 1993. It re-formed in 2001 and disbanded following frontman Tom Gabriel Fischer's departure in 2008. The band was inspired by heavy metal groups such as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Venom, but also by gothic rock acts like Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Christian Death, and by the hardcore punk group Discharge. - Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. \\"Nature\\" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena. - Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890 1937). - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a musical subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that formed during the late 1970s. Gothic rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. Proto-gothic bands include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and the Cure. - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\" - Mutilation or maiming is an act of physical injury that degrades the appearance or function of any living body. - Hellhammer was a Swiss extreme metal band from Nurensdorf, active during 19811984. They are regarded as a key influence on black metal, and one of the founders of death metal. In June 1984, Hellhammer became Celtic Frost. - Triptykon is a musical project of Thomas Gabriel Fischer, founding member of the pioneering heavy metal bands Hellhammer, Celtic Frost and Apollyon Sun. Fischer announced his departure from Celtic Frost in May 2008 and shortly afterwards revealed his new project would be entitled Triptykon. The name of the band is the Greek word for \\"triptych\\", and is aimed at stating that Triptykon is founding member Thomas Gabriel Fischer's third project after Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. The band logo is inspired by a writing pattern used in Weimar Republic. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Christian Death is an American deathrock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1979 by Rozz Williams. They became a highly influential act, heralding the American gothic rock and deathrock movements. - A blast beat is a drum beat that originated in hardcore punk and grindcore, and is often associated with extreme metal and more recently black metal and thrash. It is utilised by many different styles of metal. In Adam MacGregor's definition, \\"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the bass drum, snare, and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\\" Blast beats have been described as, \\"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence\\". - Satanism is a group of ideological and philosophical beliefs based on the character of Satan. Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966, although a few historical precedents exist. Prior to the public practice, Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various Christian groups toward perceived ideological opponents, rather than a self-identity. Satanism, and the concept of Satan, has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression. - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. 'thomas gabriel fischer' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'place of birth'?

The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals) and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. After signing to EMI in 1991, Radiohead released their debut single \\"Creep\\" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and one of the best albums in popular music. Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), recorded simultaneously, marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from experimental electronic music, 20th-century classical music, krautrock, and jazz. Kid A divided listeners but was named the best album of the decade by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and The Times. Hail to the Thief (2003) mixed rock and electronic music with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI. Their subsequent releases have pioneered alternative release platforms such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent; Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide by 2011.

Earthquakes let scientists know where the crust was moving. This led to the discovery that the Earths crust was broken up into regions, or plates. Earthquakes happen most often along these plate boundaries. This was evidence that continents can move. The movements of the plates are called plate tectonics. The Earths crust is divided into plates. There are about a dozen large plates and several small ones. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. Scientists know he plates are in motion. They now know the direction and speed of this motion . Plates dont move very fast. They move only a few centimeters a year. This is about the same rate fingernails grow. So you might wonder, what could cause this motion? What supplies the energy to cause this change?

Bogota authorities said at least 40 people were injured, including 28 men and 12 women. Many are believed to be officers deployed ahead of the protest. It is unclear if the blast was linked to the protests, which began after the city reinstated bullfighting this year. Gareth Lewis, a British traveller staying in a hostel in La Macarena, on the corner where the explosion took place, told the BBC: \\"I was sitting in my room in the hostel, the windows just came in, there was glass everywhere. \\"Quite a few police have been hurt, they're now sweeping up. They used tear gas and there's quite a bit of blood.\\" Mr Lewis, who has been advised to stay inside the hostel by officers, said he had witnessed protests \\"all week\\" and that \\"armed police have been everywhere\\". The protests began after a decision by the constitutional court, which ruled bullfighting was part of the country's heritage and therefore could be reinstated. The move angered animal rights activists, who have clashed with police during protests against the reopening. In January, demonstrators were arrested and officers fired tear gas to control groups physically attacking spectators. But the explosion was not necessarily linked to the protests. Jorge Restrepo, director of Colombia's Conflict Analysis Resource Center (Cerac), said the attack may have been targeting the police, taking advantage of the fact that many officers were gathered together due to the bullfight. He told the BBC it was possibly linked to a series of attacks against security forces in the capital that have taken place in recent months. Meanwhile, Bogota mayor Enrique Penalosa, who attended the scene, has announced he was convening a security council meeting for Sunday afternoon. \\"The terrorists won't intimidate us,\\" Mr Penalosa said on Twitter. \\"We are going to do all that's necessary to capture them.\\" He earlier tweeted one police officer had been killed, but has since removed the post. It has now been reported there were no fatalities. Two of the injured were said to be in a serious condition.

You probably thought of Google. But Google wasn't always the name of the famous search engine. In fact, the original name was BackRub! BackRub was the name two graduate students gave to the new search engine they developed in 1996. They called it BackRub because the engine used backlinks to measure the popularity of Web sites. Later, they wanted a better name -- a name that suggests huge quantities of data. They thought of the word googol. (A googol is a number followed by 100 zeros.) When they checked the Internet registry of names to see if googol was already taken, one of the students misspelled the word by mistake, and that's how Google was born. Google is just one example of a name change in the business world. Many other companies have decided to change their names or the names of their products. Here are some more examples: Jerry Yang and David Filo, two young computer specialists, developed a guide to Internet content in 1994. They called it \\"Jerry and David's Guide to World Wide Web.\\" But they soon realized that this wasn't a very catchy name, so they searched through a dictionary and found a better one: \\"Yahoo.\\" Sometimes companies change their names because of the popularity of one of their products. In 1962, a young runner named Phil Knight started a company called Blue Ribbon Sports. In 1971, Knight decided to design and manufacture his own brand of shoes. He named the shoes after the Greek goddess of victory -- Nike. Nike shoes became so well known that Knight changed the name of the whole company to Nike.

C) Yahoo: The creators changed the name because it was more catchy than their original name.

If the café makes a total of 54 bacon sandwiches, how many customers are in the group of customers that arrived? Your thoughts:","output":"Let's break down the information given: 1. 3 local offices ordered 10 bacon sandwiches each, which is a total of 3 * 10 = 30 bacon sandwiches. 2. Half of the group of arriving customers ordered 4 bacon sandwiches each. 3. The café makes a total of 54 bacon sandwiches. Now, let's find out how many bacon sandwiches were made for the group that arrived: 54 total sandwiches - 30 sandwiches for offices = 24 sandwiches for the group. Let X be the number of customers in the group that arrived, so half of the group would be X/2. Since half of the group ordered 4 bacon sandwiches each, the equation would be: (X/2) * 4 = 24 Divide both sides of the equation by 4: X/2 = 6 Now multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for X: X = 6 * 2 X = 12 So, there are 12 customers in the group that arrived."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Turkish: \\"Steel produced at Smederevo is not only a product, but also a symbol of strong US-Serbian ties,\\" Kostunica told reporters.","output":"\\"Smederevo'da üretilen çelik, sadece bir ürün değil, aynı zamanda güçlü ABD-Sırbistan ilişkilerinin de bir sembolüdür,\\" dedi Kostunica gazetecilere."},{"instruction":"Note the options at the end.

This statement is centered around a sporting event, specifically a baseball game between the Boston team and the Baltimore Orioles. The sporting discipline inferred from the context is baseball, which is one of the major sports in the United States and several other countries. The details provided such as \\"a four-game sweep\\" and \\"8-3 victory on Friday night\\" directly relate to sports terminologies used in the measurement of performance, strategic planning, and results in baseball games. The reference to Boston evidently dismisses the Orioles' goal signifies a sporting competition where one team is trying to prevent the other from achieving a specific goal. The mention of a \\".500 record\\" refers to the statistical records that are commonly maintained in sports, denoting a team's performance over a certain period or number of games. It's a benchmark that signifies a certain level of performance or achievement. The \\"8-3 victory on Friday night\\" tells us that a specific game was played which resulted in a decisive victory for one team over another.

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"From the given sentence, we can extract the following data: 1. Name: The individual mentioned in the sentence is William Anders. He is the main subject of the sentence. 2. Occupation: William Anders was an astronaut. This is inferred by his association with Apollo 8. Apollo 8 was the second crewed mission in the United States Apollo space program and the first crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit, reach the Moon, orbit it, and return. His position as a \\"crew member\\" specifies his role in that mission. 3. Specific Mission: The mission William Anders was involved in is referred to as Apollo 8. Apollo 8 played a significant role in the history of space exploration and helps to contextualize his contributions. 4. Retirement Date: William Anders retired on September 1st, 1969. This information establishes a key timeline or milestone event in his life and career. 5. Timeframe: The period mentioned in the sentence is 1969, which is relevant because it situates the event within the context of the late 1960s - a time when space exploration was rapidly evolving. From the above data, we can infer the following contextual information: 1. The relevance of William Anders's retirement: The fact that his retirement is mentioned may indicate his significance to the Apollo program, or the importance of his career in general. 2. Importance of Apollo 8: Mentioning Anders's involvement with the Apollo 8 mission highlights its importance in both space exploration history and his personal career trajectory. 3. Relationship between retirement date and Apollo 8: William Anders retired approximately eight months after the completion of the Apollo 8 mission. This may be taken as an indication of his either having accomplished his major career goal (i.e., participating in a milestone space mission) or his available options for further involvement in the space program after the mission."},{"instruction":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of using models to produce knowledge of the world?

She continued to knock, even though there had as yet been no answer, because the note card tacked to the right of the door indicated that these indeed were Prof. Turgy K. Sigger's office hours. She could see the light under the door and thought she had heard a groan. Just before she decided to give up, slow feet approached from the opposite side, then silence; with a dramatic turn of the knob, the door swung open. \\"Was this trip really necessary?\\" asked Prof. Sigger, blinking and brushing his oily, graying hair back into place. \\"These are your office hours,\\" Alona replied.

You can listen to this playlist on Spotify here. Like the new format? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com. When Bob Dylan released an album last year of standards associated with Frank Sinatra, “Shadows in the Night,” it was an intriguing sidebar to his own enormous catalog of songs disrupting Tin Pan Alley’s principles: a ragged voice and a rootsy band in the ruins of long-gone youth and pop’s elegant past. A second standards album, the new “Fallen Angels,” just repeats the gesture with diminishing returns. But “Melancholy Mood,” which was the B-side of Sinatra’s debut single with Harry James and his Orchestra in 1939, executes the gesture convincingly. Over the gently swinging band — which, like James, starts with a full instrumental verse — Mr. Dylan’s voice certainly has the mileage and tatters to put across sentiments like, “All I can see is grief and gloom/Till the crack of doom.” JON PARELES Merle Haggard’s final recording, made in his home studio on Feb. 9 — he died on April 6 from complications of pneumonia — is a Jimmie Rodgers-style blues. This was one of Mr. Haggard’s favorite forms, a tight box that nevertheless encouraged freedom: A 12-bar structure that can accommodate changeable phrase lengths and unconventional patterns of lyric repetition. His website says the song is about “memories of leaving Bakersfield in the late ’70s” — Bakersfield, Calif., where he grew up. Like many Haggard songs, it’s about disappointment with the way things are going: The night life is gone, and the Kern River has dried up. “Somebody stole the water,” he sings in a clear but shaky version of his voice; “another politician lied.” It contains what he did best, condensed images and expressions of getting in motion and leaving: “breakfast in the sky,” “donut on a paper,” “kiss an old boxcar goodbye.” Available from merlehaggard.com. BEN RATLIFF The least compelling but most revealing videos captured by fans from the May 7 AC/DC show in Lisbon — the first with Axl Rose serving as frontman — are the ones shot from up close, with the camera fixed mercilessly on Mr. Rose, still hobbled by a broken left foot. In them, Mr. Rose (replacing Brian Johnson, who is suffering from severe hearing loss), is seated, and while Angus Young moves around him doing his signature bent-over kick-shuffle, Mr. Rose howls to the best of his abilities, which, it turns out, are in strong shape. He yelps. He shrieks. He holds notes for ostentatious stretches. The vocal flamboyance Mr. Rose needs in Guns N’ Roses is different from the more direct hollering he does here, but it’s prepared him well. The amateur clips — of songs like “Hell Ain’t a Bad Place to Be,” “Highway to Hell,” “Shot Down in Flames” — tend to underscore the directness of his voice and underdeliver the power of the rest of the band, which is a shame, because they’re rather effective as a unit. By “Whole Lotta Rosie,” Mr. Rose is up and about, and the unit looks and sounds like it’s in fifth gear. But it’s less fun when you can’t see the lightning bolt on the bottom of his cast. JON CARAMANICA The video clip for Grimes’s “California” isn’t just her latest self-directed costume extravaganza. It’s also an entirely different production of the song — farewell to new wave guitars and synthesizers, hello to keyboard arpeggios and a new, more introspective transparency, at least at first. The song, from her 2015 album “Art Angels,” is both a plaint and a taunt: to recording companies courting her, to fans hating any change, to her own ambivalent pop ambitions. “I get carried away/commodifying all the pain,” she sings. In the video, she dances around as, among other things, a cowgirl singer in red, white and blue; a glittery mermaid; and a figure in gauzy red who’s very overdressed on a multicolored basketball court. But most of the time she’s a woman in an art-girl beret, tending (and dancing through) an artist’s studio full of statuary, unfinished or unsold: “When you get bored of me I’ll be back on the shelf,” she sings. J.P. Guitar distortion wells up immediately in “All for One,” the first new music in 21 years from the Stone Roses, as the band gears up for its latest reunion tour, which comes to Madison Square Garden on June 30. The song barely updates the band’s 1980s “Madchester” sound, which drew on Merseybeat, psychedelia, the post-punk noisiness of the Jesus and Mary Chain and the dance-music beats of the wild 1980s club scene in Manchester, England. “All for One” leans psychedelic, not funky, with a seesawing guitar riff that soon spins off multiple overdubbed guitars, along with a foot-stomping shuffle beat and lots of 1960s-style effects on Ian Brown’s voice as well as the guitars and drums. The last chorus becomes an overdubbed, very-late-60s chorale before a final buzzy guitar note. It’s a band emulating its younger self emulating music from decades earlier. Meanwhile, in the current political climate, the jolly lyrics strike a jarring isolationist note: “All for one, one for all/If we all join hands, we’ll make a wall.” J.P. Pink hasn’t just been at home practicing her trapeze act for the last two years, since the end of her most recent arena tour. Or has she? “You just gonna hang around all day?” her husband, Carey Hart, says in the opening moments of her new video, for “Just Like Fire.” The joke is that she is literally hanging, by a harness, as she executes a series of acrobatic twirls. She made “Just Like Fire” for the soundtrack to “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” a fact that the rest of the video makes clear: There’s a mirror-portal, and a giant chessboard, and a Mad Hatter tea party. (Pink’s daughter, Willow Sage, stands in for Alice.) It’s all a nice distraction from the fact that the song — produced by Max Martin, Shellback and Oscar Holter — brings nothing new to Pink’s musical formula. The beat says hip-hop, the strummy guitar says folk-pop and the chorus says “hot adult contemporary.” It’s a sturdy, on-brand effort, and given how long it has been since Pink released a proper new single, that’s wonder enough for now. NATE CHINEN Two items in this week’s news involved the maintenance of two major repositories of folk music and culture, in the widest sense of the word “folk.” Last Tuesday Ben Sisario reported on Smithsonian Folkways’ acquisition of Arhoolie Records, Chris Strachwitz’s great label for traditional blues, gospel, and Mexican music. (More information at arhoolie.com.) Also this week, Maximum Rocknroll, based in San Francisco, the volunteer-only punk zine published monthly since 1977, began a successful crowdfunding campaign to raise money for the digitization of its archive and preservation of its physical holdings. That would include most of the records it’s reviewed or featured on its weekly radio show, which would be pretty much every punk single you can imagine. “With your support,” reads Maximum Rocknroll’s indiegogo project page, “we can make our record collection — the largest of its kind in the entire world — accessible to anyone with an Internet connection.” (More information at maximumrocknroll.com.) BEN RATLIFF Some genres go through constant cycles of rebirth, but New York hip-hop seems to be in a perpetual state of death, or at least a kind of cryogenic purgatory. When the Terror Squad was at its peak, circa 2004, it was part of the last wave of hardcore mainstream traditionalists. After a decade in the weeds, that sound has been having a comeback — a last gasp? — thanks to rappers like Dave East of Harlem. Here, he bridges the generation gap by adding a verse to “All the Way Up,” the unexpected hit collaboration by the old Terror Squad crewmates Fat Joe and Remy Ma. Over the woozy horn loop by producer Edsclusive, he remembers a time when Terror Squad was on top, and he was preoccupied elsewhere: “When Remy was Terror Squadding with Pun and them/We was in the back room rumbling, no one coming in/Homie kinda arrogant, bet this 40’ll humble him.” J.C. “Be kind to your bad self,” urges Sadie Dupuis on “Death Note,” a growly, propulsive affirmation by Speedy Ortiz, the ambitious but low-to-the-ground indie-rock band. The track was named after a Japanese manga and anime series, whose conceit involves a notebook with lethal magical powers. Ms. Dupuis twists this into a metaphor for the therapeutic act of writing in the face of depression: “These are all love letters to me,” she sings. And while the sound is thicker and heavier here than on much of “Foil Deer,” Speedy Ortiz’s standout 2015 album, it’s clearly of a piece; it will appear on “Foiled Again,” a four-song digital EP, on June 3. N.C. Joe Temperley, the gallant Scottish baritone saxophonist, died this week at the age of 86. A veteran of some of the great big bands of the postwar era, he will be remembered for his stint in the late-period Duke Ellington Orchestra — and a subsequent role with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, in which he was a founding member. Last spring that band performed a concert in honor of Mr. Temperley, featuring glowing testimonials, select Ellingtonia, and a five-part suite by Wynton Marsalis, “Joe’s Concerto.” The full concert was broadcast by the NPR program Jazz Night in America, and it now stands as a noble tribute, and a good distillation of everything that made Mr. Temperley special. Be sure not to miss his tender delivery of “The Single Petal of a Rose,” which ends the concert in all due finery. N.C. Avian polyphony, a true conference of the birds at first light.

A popular singer named Bob Dylan made a new song that sounds a lot like another song that a man named Frank Sinatra sang a really long time ago. Some people might find it a bit boring because Bob Dylan has done this before, but the song is still nice to listen to. 2. Another singer, Merle Haggard, sadly passed away recently, but he recorded one last song before he died. This song is about his memories, and it sounds really sad and beautiful. 3. There's a band called AC/DC, and they did a show with a new lead singer, Axl Rose, because their usual singer, Brian Johnson, is sick. Axl Rose did a really good job, even though he hurt his foot! 4. Grimes, another singer, made a new music video for her song \\"California\\". It's really colorful and fun to watch, and it's got her dancing in lots of different costumes! 5. The Stone Roses, a band that was big in the 80s, are back together for a new tour and they just put out a new song. Some people might think it sounds a bit out of date, or like it doesn't fit in with what's happening in the world today, but lots of other people are really excited. 6. Finally, a singer named Pink made a new song for a movie called \\"Alice Through the Looking Glass\\".

Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire. A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing. Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term \\"shrubland\\" was first coined in 1903. - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - The Amazon basin is the part of South America drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries. The Amazon drainage basin covers an area of about , or roughly 40 percent of the South American continent. It is located in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. - Anthony 's nightjar ( Nyctidromus anthonyi ) , also known as the scrub nightjar , is a species of nightjar in the Caprimulgidae family . It is found in western Ecuador and north - western Peru . Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry shrubland . - Caprimulgus is a large and very widespread genus of nightjars, medium-sized nocturnal birds with long pointed wings, short legs and short bills. \\"Caprimulgus\\" is derived from the Latin \\"capra\\", \\"nanny goat\\", and \\"mulgere\\", \\"to milk\\", referring to an old myth that nightjars suck milk from goats. The common name \\"nightjar\\", first recorded in 1630, refers to the nocturnal habits of the bird, the second part of the name deriving from the distinctive churring song. - A nighthawk is a nocturnal bird of the subfamily Chordeilinae, within the nightjar family, Caprimulgidae. The term \\"nighthawk\\", first recorded in the King James Version of 1611, was originally a local name in England for the European nightjar. Its use in the Americas refers to members of the genus \\"Chordeiles\\" and related genera was first recorded in 1778. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - A plant community (sometimes \\"phytocoenosis\\" or \\"phytocenosis\\") is a collection or association of plant species within a designated geographical unit, which forms a relatively uniform patch, distinguishable from neighboring patches of different vegetation types. The components of each plant community are influenced by soil type, topography, climate and human disturbance. In many cases there are several soil types within a given phytocoenosis. - The number and type of plants, how leafy they are, and how healthy they are. In places where foliage is dense and plants are growing quickly, the index is high, represented in dark green. Regions where few plants grow have a low vegetation index, shown in tan. The index is based on measurements taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Terra satellite. Areas where the satellite did not collect data are gray. - Peru , officially the Republic of Peru, is a country in western South America. It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river. - Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal or crepuscular birds in the family Caprimulgidae, characterized by long wings, short legs and very short bills. They are sometimes called goatsuckers, due to the ancient folk tale that they sucked the milk from goats (the Latin for goatsucker is \\"Caprimulgus\\"). Some New World species are called nighthawks. Nightjars usually nest on the ground. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - A population is the number of all the organisms of the same group or species, which live in a particular geographical area, and have the capability of interbreeding.

Article:","output":"Title: The Untimely Tragedy of Oliver's Passing: An In-Depth Look at the Interplay of Football, Mental Health, and Personal Struggles Introduction: The recent news of the heartbreaking death of the former San Diego Chargers player, Oliver, has left the sports community reeling. As details of the circumstances behind his passing continue to surface, it's becoming increasingly clear that the pressures Oliver faced off the field, with regards to his personal relationships and career uncertainties, may have contributed to his tragic decision. This article delves into the complex dynamics that have surrounded Oliver's life and death and prompts an important conversation on the necessity of mental health support for professional athletes. The Police Report: A Devastating Incident According to the police reports, Oliver took his own life by shooting himself in the head. The incident occurred amidst growing concerns from his loved ones, who had noticed his increasing struggles with depression over the years. While the exact reasons for his actions remain unclear, it is believed that the weight of his marital issues and career challenges may have pushed Oliver to a breaking point. The San Diego Chargers: Six Glorious Seasons and Unfortunate Career Struggles Oliver's six-season stint with the San Diego Chargers saw an athlete with immense talent and strength, contributing significantly to the team's success during his tenure. Fans and teammates alike praised his dedication and resilience, acknowledging his position as a key player within the squad. However, his career also faced turbulent moments, with occasional injuries and fluctuating performance levels. It has been speculated that these challenges fueled Oliver's anxious thoughts about his long-term future in the sport, consequently amplifying his internal distress. Depression: An Unseen Foe Amidst Marital and Career Issues According to his wife, Oliver had been struggling with depression for a significant period, with his mental health severely impacted by personal life issues. The most notable of these problems related to his marriage, where conflicts and misunderstandings were becoming increasingly common. Additionally, the fear of potential career instability kept Oliver on edge, making it increasingly difficult for him to maintain his mental well-being. The Lingering Question: Can More Be Done to Support Professional Athletes' Mental Health? Oliver's tragic passing has sparked an important discussion around the mental health and well-being of professional athletes. Despite their seemingly perfect lives and enviable careers, many face immense psychological strain from the weight of expectations and the rigours of their profession. Coupled with personal life struggles, these factors can have a potentially debilitating impact on their mental health. Experts suggest that there is a need for increased mental health resources within sports organizations, ensuring that athletes have access to professional guidance and support when handling their personal struggles. Awareness campaigns focusing on the importance of open conversations and de-stigmatizing mental health issues in the sports community can also contribute to a more supportive environment for everyone involved. Conclusion: The tragic passing of Oliver has shed light on the internal battles and mental health struggles facing professional athletes. It serves as a stark reminder of how fragile these individuals can be, despite their outward strength and success. By addressing the underlying stigma and ensuring adequate mental health support, the sports fraternity can better protect and nurture the well-being of those individuals who dedicate their lives to the sports they love."},{"instruction":"Valery Lagunov, was born on July 2, 1942 in Moscow, Russia, he played in \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" as \\"Prince\\", a ballet in a prologue and three acts, first performed in which year?","output":"\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is a ballet in a prologue and three acts, with music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and choreography by Marius Petipa.

Step 3: Compare the information in both sentences. Identify the common elements: a man is repairing something on a roof. Note any discrepancies: the first sentence does not mention any specific type of repair, such as fixing a hole, nor does it mention whose roof it is. Step 4: Evaluate the statement based on the given information. The original sentence does not provide enough information to confirm or deny whether the man is specifically fixing a hole or if the roof belongs to him. Step 5: Present the conclusion. Based on Steps 1-4, it is not possible to tell if the statement \\"A guy is trying to fix the hole in his roof.\\" is true or not, given the information provided in the sentence \\"A guy on a roof doing repairs.\\""},{"instruction":"Complete the following sentence.

(B). hand was farther from the ground.","output":"First, I will analyze the given options to understand their relevancy to the scenario. Option A states that the foot was farther from the ground, which would make it less likely for the blood to pool in the foot due to gravity. This could be a possible explanation for more blood in the hand than in the foot. Option B states that the hand was farther from the ground, which means that the blood would have to travel further against gravity to reach the hand. This option seems counterintuitive as the hand would be expected to have less blood in this case. Based on the analysis, Option A seems more appropriate as it aligns with the concept of blood pooling in the hand due to gravity: There was more blood in the patient's hand than in their foot because the foot was farther from the ground."},{"instruction":"I can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies. It is a good thriller and has an emotional core but still I can't decide. I definitely liked it. This is the first movie of Terry Gilliam that I have seen. My first impression? I was engaged till the very end and it is not all that complex(to be confusing). The movie is set in the future. A man James Cole(Bruce Willis) is sent from the future in order to get some information from the past(1996 to be specific). A virus killed 5 billion people. He is sent from the future to get some information about it. Also involved here are a psychiatrist called Kathryn Railly. The love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life. The loose ends are tied up in a very interesting manner at the end. One thing I liked about this movie is that unlike other post-apocalyptic movies, the movie didn't prefer to give any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one guy and his longing for a regular life. \\"You want to see the ocean, be with her\\" is especially a poignant line in this movie. It chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind. Therefore this is not exactly post apocalyptic movie but instead it could be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes that range from time travel to blurred realities and so on. This is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990's. The complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters. The performances are quite good. Bruce willis surprised me here as he didn't act the regular tough guy here but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love. His desperation in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully. I have to check out his other movies. The gorgeous Madeleine Stowe is quite a treat to watch. EVer since I saw this movie, I have become so obsessed with her. She has given a great performance of a woman who sympathises with her patient and finally falls in love with him. Brad Pitt is the real surprise though with his portrayal of a crazy man named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn't have many critics who have kind words for him. The end is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie. The length or complexity is not as big a problem because this film is quite fast moving and there are enough incidents to keep people interested. And every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary. Good thriller 10/10 Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?

Kirschner, a Los Angeles lawyer. \\"This firm has been retained by Dorian S. Nakamoto, the subject of the recent Newsweek cover story on Bitcoin,\\" Kirschner said in an email. \\"He has issued the attached prepared statement. No further comment will be made by Mr. Nakamoto or the firm.\\" In the statement, Nakamoto says: \\"I did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin. I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report.\\" According to Nakamoto, he heard the term bitcoin from his son only in February after he had been contacted by the reporter working on the Newsweek story. When that story was published in early March, Nakamoto, 64, found himself at the center of a media circus as well as a raging online debate about whether he could in fact be the programmer who had created the virtual currency that has become a billion-dollar global phenomenon. Part of the story pointed to the fact that Nakamoto of Temple City had programming skills. In the statement, Nakamoto says: \\"My background is in engineering. I also have the ability to program. My most recent job was as an electrical engineer troubleshooting air traffic control equipment for the FAA. I have no knowledge of nor have I ever worked on cryptography, peer to peer systems, or alternative currencies.\\" The Newsweek story also notes what appears to be a strange gap in his resume over the last decade, the time during which the bitcoin code was written and released. Nakamoto explains: \\"I have not been able to find steady work as an engineer or programmer for ten years. I have worked as a laborer, polltaker, and substitute teacher. I discontinued my internet service in 2013 due to severe financial distress. I am trying to recover from prostate surgery in October 2012 and a stroke I suffered in October of 2013. My prospects for gainful employment has been harmed because of Newsweek's article.\\" Nakamoto ends by asking to be left in peace: \\"Newsweek's false report has been the source of a great deal of confusion and stress for myself, my 93-year old mother, my siblings, and their families. I offer my sincerest thanks to those people in the United States and around the world who have offered me their support. I have retained legal counsel. This will be our last public statement on this matter. I ask that you now respect our privacy.\\" ALSO: Reddit users launch fundraiser to help Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto Is bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto living quietly in Temple City? Did the real Satoshi Nakamoto just say Newsweek has wrong guy? ||||| Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, who Newsweek claimed was “the” Satoshi Nakamoto credited with the creation of bitcoin, has now issued a statement through his lawyer Ethan Kirschner completely denying his involvement in creating the digital currency. “I did not create, invent, or otherwise work on Bitcoin. I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report,” Nakamoto said in the statement. The Newsweek story, which revealed details about Dorian’s life including what town he lived in, sparked something akin to a modern tech manhunt as reports raced to chase the older man down. To be fair, Dorian denied everything then, too, and then again. And now we have Dorian’s denial in written form as well. Reuters Blogger Felix Salmon first produced the statement, but, in this ongoing story of slippery bitcoin “facts,” we have also confirmed the text of the note directly with Kirschner. “We have no comment beyond confirming that we’ve been retained by Mr. Nakamoto and that it is his statement that was released,” he told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. The drama around Bitcoin’s creator fails to die, very much in line with the roller coaster ride the crypto-currency has been going through over past year. This latest chapter is a particularly frustrating one, centred as it is not only on an individual who is claiming no involvement, but one who was already in difficult times. Not only were there apparently no facts unveiled in the Newsweek story, but there has been quite a significant casualty resulting from it, in the form of an individual’s privacy. Dorian writes in the letter that he had never heard of the word “bitcoin” before February 2014, when he was contacted by a reporter. (He does not name Leah McGrath Goodman in his letter.) It was his son who first mentioned the word bitcoin to him, he writes. While the Newsweek story sets up Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto as a hidden-in-plain-sight mystery solved, Nakamoto’s letter paints a rather different picture of the person. Here, we have a smart, but also struggling, individual. Someone who is very much on the other spectrum of the tech boom that is so often the subject of public discourse — and of bitcoin in particular. Despite having a background in engineering, Nakamoto notes that he couldn’t find a programmer’s job for over a decade. “I’ve worked as a laborer, polltaker and a substitute teacher,” he added in the statement. He says he has never worked on cryptography, peer-to-peer systems, or alternative currencies. He also underscores some of the other problems he has had outside of this case of apparently very mistaken identity. They include several health issues and “severe financial distress.” You can imagine that this letter, coming with legal backing, is a precursor to further legal action and claims for damages, either publicly or behind the scenes. Despite Newsweek maintaining a solid stance on its story, the tech world has been skeptical of the evidence from the moment it came out. We’ve even seen one person, allegedly the “real” Satoshi Nakamoto (or at least posting on an account linked with the original manifesto), post on a message board to deny the Newsweek article. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto was said to be the creator of Bitcoin in a Newsweek article.

The pair cater to a clientele who require fraudulent tourist photographs using fake backdrops, which can later be used as evidence that the person in the photograph was at any location in the country. One day, a married couple (Bud Jamison and Constance Bergen) turn up separately in need of alibi photographs: the man wants evidence of being on a Maine moose hunt while the woman needs photographic proof of being in Washington, D.C. The photographers, unaware that the man and woman are married, decide to play matchmaker with the pair. By coincidence, the man and woman have rooms opposite each other in the same hotel. The hotel's manager and the staff detective become suspicious of what is transpiring when the photographers and the couple zigzag between the rooms.

Sentence 2: I was surprised to be asked that. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The relationship between the first and second sentences raises some interesting considerations about the potential veracity and implications of each statement. However, before delving into the connections between the statements, it is essential to examine each sentence individually. 1. Sentence 1: \\"I was thrown by the question.\\" This statement communicates a feeling of being disoriented, taken aback, or momentarily confused by a question that was asked. The underlying reason for such a reaction might stem from the unexpected nature of the question, a lack of preparedness, or simply the surprising or novel content of the inquiry. Overall, the speaker suggests that they were unsettled or caught off guard, making it difficult for them at that moment to provide a coherent or thoughtful response. 2. Sentence 2: \\"I was surprised to be asked that.\\" The second statement similarly expresses the speaker's response to a question. In this case, the focus is on the feeling of surprise resulting from the experience of being asked a particular question. This implies that the inquiry was unanticipated or perhaps seemed irrelevant, intrusive, or otherwise out of place. The emphasis here is on the emotional reaction (surprise), and how it reflects the speaker's thoughts about why the question was asked or the context in which it occurred. Now, let's consider the question: if the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? On the surface, both sentences appear to describe a similar emotional state or reaction to a question. However, they differ in the specific emotional responses: the first sentence focuses on being \\"thrown,\\" whereas the second sentence highlights feeling \\"surprised.\\" It is possible for both emotions to be experienced simultaneously, as surprise can often lead to disorientation or confusion, as in being thrown off balance. In that sense, if the first sentence is true, it could suggest that the second sentence is also true, because the speaker may have experienced a chain reaction of emotions that began with surprise. However, it's important to note that the emotions or reactions described in the two sentences are not precisely identical, nor are they entirely dependent on each other. It is conceivable that one might feel thrown by a question without necessarily feeling surprised, or vice versa. In conclusion, it is plausible that if the first sentence is true, the second sentence might also be true, as the two emotional reactions might be experienced concurrently or in succession. However, given the nuanced differences between being \\"thrown\\" and feeling \\"surprised,\\" it is not absolutely necessary for the truth of the second sentence to follow automatically from the truth of the first sentence. The relationship between the two sentences depends on the particular context of the situation and the specific emotional reactions and thought processes of the speaker, which may ultimately determine the veracity of both statements."},{"instruction":"p: negative, that's what we saw, but there where no clouds ( cavok: ceiling and visibility are ok) Make this proper case.","output":"P: Negative, that's what we saw, but there were no clouds (CAVOK: Ceiling And Visibility Are OK) So, what this means is, somebody saw something and said \\"no\\", because they looked up at the sky and saw that there were no clouds, and everything looked really clear and good.

AKB48's producer, Yasushi Akimoto, wanted to form a girl group with its own theater (unlike pop groups performing occasional concerts and seen on television) and performing daily so fans could always see them live. This \\"idols you can meet\\" concept includes teams which can rotate performances and perform simultaneously at several events and \\"handshake\\" events, where fans can meet group members. The group has publicized special events to choose the promotional and recording lineups for some of its singles.

Ballots are obtained by purchasing the group's latest \\"election single\\", or, alternatively, through the group's mobile app products and fan club subscriptions. Top vote getting members are heavily promoted, with the winner getting the centerpiece of the group's live performances of the single. The total pool of votes counted has exceeded three million votes for individual events since 2015. Fans have reportedly bought hundreds of copies of singles to vote for their favorite members.

It's a warm language that's as diverse as the many countries and cultures that utilize it. Similar to other Latin-derived languages such as French and Italian, Spanish is known for its rolling cadences and expressive nature. Now, let's move on to creating some examples of Spanish sentences, and let me explain each one for educational purposes: 1) \\"Hola, ¿cómo estás?\\" - This is a basic greeting in Spanish, which translates to \\"Hello, how are you?\\" in English. 2) \\"Me gusta leer libros en el parque.\\" - This sentence translates to \\"I like to read books in the park.\\" The verb \\"gusta\\" is an interesting one in Spanish. Instead of saying \\"I like,\\" you essentially say \\"it pleases me,\\" hence \\"me gusta.\\" 3) \\"Estoy aprendiendo español para viajar a México.\\" - The sentence says, \\"I'm learning Spanish to travel to Mexico.\\" Note the use of \\"estoy\\" to denote something currently in progress - in this case, learning Spanish. 4) \\"Mi café favorito es el café con leche.\\" - Translation: \\"My favorite coffee is coffee with milk.\\" The sentence makes use of the word \\"favorito\\", which as you can probably guess, means 'favorite'. 5) \\"El arte de Picasso es muy impresionante.\\" - In English, it says \\"Picasso's art is very impressive.\\" Notice how the noun \\"arte\\" is preceded by \\"el,\\" which is one of the two definite articles in Spanish (the other being \\"la\\"). 6) \\"Los perros son los mejores amigos del hombre.\\" - Translates to: \\"Dogs are a man's best friend,\\" a popular saying in many languages. 7) \\"La educación es la llave para el futuro.\\" - English: \\"Education is the key to the future.\\" This sentence is philosophically rich and holds true regardless of language or culture! I hope this gives you a better understanding of the Spanish language, which is just as expressive, complex, and beautiful when looked into more deeply. Enjoy your Spanish learning journey!"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Nice Good\\" A:","output":"Based on the limited information provided in the review \\"Nice Good,\\" it is difficult to accurately assign a star rating out of five (★★★★★). However, we can infer a few things from the words used and make an estimation. The reviewer has used two positive adjectives, \\"Nice\\" and \\"Good,\\" which indicate satisfaction or a positive experience with the product or service being reviewed. Although these words do not provide a detailed account of the user's experience, they demonstrate that the experience was, to an extent, favorable. In the context of a 5-star rating system, where ★ is the lowest and ★★★★★ is the highest, this review suggests a rating within the range of three to five stars. Since both positive adjectives used are fairly generic and not particularly complementary, we can deduce that the rating would likely be on the lower end of this range. Taking these factors into consideration, I would estimate that the ★-rating of this review falls around ★★★½ stars. This rating reflects a moderately positive but generic response to the product or service in question, without any specific information or details to fully justify a higher ★★★★ or ★★★★★ rating."},{"instruction":"How is \\"Much as we support this fight against drug trafficking, however, the Confederal Group of the European United Left and I cannot support this motion for a resolution whilst its punitive nature is maintained, as this will have absolutely no dissuasive effect on young people whatsoever.\\" said in Finnish?","output":"Vaikka kannatammekin tätä taistelua huumekauppaa vastaan, Euroopan yhtyneen vasemmiston konfederaatioryhmän ja minun on kuitenkin mahdotonta tukea tätä päätöslauselmaesitystä niin kauan kuin sen rangaistusluonne säilyy, sillä sillä ei ole minkäänlaista nuoria ihmisiä pidättävää vaikutusta.

The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS. - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use. - Starglider is a 3D video game released in 1986 by Rainbird. It was developed by Argonaut Software, led by programmer Jez San. The game was inspired by Jez San's love of the 1983 Atari coin-op \\"Star Wars\\". - The Super FX is a coprocessor on the Graphics Support Unit (GSU) added to select Super Nintendo (SNES) video game cartridges, primarily to provide advanced 2D and 3D techniques. The Super FX chip was designed by Argonaut Games, who also co-developed (with Nintendo) the 3D space scrolling shooter video game \\"Star Fox\\" to demonstrate the additional polygon rendering capabilities that the chip had introduced to the SNES. - The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in the spring of 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US1. - Motorola, Inc. is an American multinational telecommunications company based in Schaumburg, Illinois, United States. After having lost 4.3 billion from 2007 to 2009, the company was divided into two independent public companies, Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions on January 4, 2011. Motorola Solutions is generally considered to be the direct successor to Motorola, Inc., as the reorganization was structured with Motorola Mobility being spun off. Motorola Mobility was acquired by Lenovo in 2014. - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile. - Jeremy \\"Jez\\" San OBE (born 29 March 1966) is an English game programmer and entrepreneur who founded Argonaut Software as a teenager in the 1980s. He is best known for the 1986 Atari ST game \\"Starglider\\" and helping to design the Super FX chip used in \\"Star Fox\\" for the Super NES. - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64. - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Starglider 2 is a 3D space simulator / flight simulator video game released in 1988 by Argonaut Games and was the sequel to Starglider . It was released for the Amiga , Atari ST , MS - DOS , Apple Macintosh and ZX Spectrum . - Argonaut Games plc was a British video game developer, founded in 1982 and liquidated in 2004. It was most notable for the development of the Super NES video game \\"Star Fox\\" and its supporting Super FX hardware. - The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app. - Atari Corporation was an American manufacturer of computers and video game consoles from 1984 to 1996. Atari Corp. was founded in July 1984 when Warner Communications sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari, Inc. to Jack Tramiel. Its chief products were the Atari ST, , Atari 7800, Atari Lynx, and Atari Jaguar. The company reverse merged with JTS Inc. in 1996, becoming a small division, which itself closed when JTS liquidated the IP to Hasbro Interactive in 1998. - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - A sequel is a narrative, documental, or other work of literature, film, theatre, television, music, or video game that continues the story of, or expands upon, some earlier work. In the common context of a narrative work of fiction, a sequel portrays events set in the same fictional universe as an earlier work, usually chronologically following the events of that work.

They were painted in the midst of the bustling life and terrible cruelty of medieval Russia, a land of ignorant peasants, cruel princes and Tartars invading thrice a year.Part I (86 mins.)Chapter 1 Hot-Air BalloonChapter 2 The Buffoon, 1400 AD. The opening image is of three monks who set off for Moscow across a harvested field: Kirill, Andrei and Danila. They take shelter from a rainstorm in a barn/inn. There, a buffoon is entertaining peasants with a song mocking the local boyar (lord). Then, some soldiers come and arrest the buffoon.Chapter 3 Theophanes the Greek, 1405 AD. This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel. An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him. Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years. I cant paint without you. I look with your eyes; I listen with your ears. Danila replies with tears in his eyes, You silly man, go with my blessing! Andrei kneels and kisses Danila's hand. Meanwhile, Father Kirill leaves the monastery in disgust, past a huge wall of logs, shouting You brood of vipers! You have made his temple a den of thieves.Chapter 4 The Passion according to Andrei, 1406 AD The chapter opens with Father Andrei walking through a forest with his apprentice, Foma.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

In very general terms, 1⁄4 gallon (0.9 L) of acid (when properly diluted) will cover about 50-70 square feet of concrete (about 4.5-6.5 square meters). Other suitable acids for etching include phosphoric acid and sulfamic acid. The latter is an especially good choice for first-timers because it is much less caustic and dangerous than the other acids. If you're unsure of whether you have the right type of acid, check the label on its packaging — most suitable products will mention that they can be used for concrete etching purposes. To begin, remove any any all furniture, vehicles, and other obstructions from the area you intend to treat. Etching acids can permanently damage common objects if allowed to remain in contact with them for even short periods of time, so have them well out of the way by the time you start your project. You'll also want to give the area a good sweeping to remove accumulated dust, dirt, or grime. The acid needs to be able to touch every part of the concrete's surface to react properly with it. Even small pieces of debris can interfere with the reaction, potentially causing an uneven etching. If you're etching concrete in your garage or on your driveway, there's a chance that there may be oil or grease stains on the driveway from your vehicle. Etching acids can't penetrate through oily substances, which means that any concrete under an oil stain will go un-etched. To remove oil and grease stains, try scrubbing with a commercial degreasing product — these are available from most home improvement stores for fairly cheap. Alternatively, try using ordinary laundry detergent. Most detergents are formulated to dissolve oil and grease, making them perfect for degreasing your concrete surface. When your concrete is perfectly clean and clear, use a hose with a sprayer attachment to wet the entire surface of the concrete. Spread the water evenly across the surface until all of the concrete is wet but no standing water remains. The concrete should stay at this level of wetness until the acid is applied. If you'll be etching up to any adjacent walls or other surfaces, be sure to also wet the bottom inch or so to minimize the possibility of direct contact with the acid. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short version of a longer piece of information or story. It includes only the most important points or main ideas, leaving out the less important or extra details. In the article, it talks about preparing the area and making sure you have the right acid before starting an etching project on concrete. This involves cleaning the surface, removing oil and grease stains, and wetting the concrete before applying the acid."},{"instruction":"If I tell you that Mollusks have a simple heart, and ask you the question \\"what kind of heart do mollusks have?\\", is the correct answer \\"organ\\"?

They both reflect the fact that a certain individual has made appearances on the runway representing various notable designers or fashion houses, including Lacoste, Michael Kors, Valentino, Fendi, Alexander Wang, Altuzarra, Jason Wu, and others. In both cases, the context is clear: it's about a person (likely a model) who has walked the runway for these brands. This suggests that she has had a diverse and successful career in the world of modeling, as these are all renowned labels in the fashion industry. Despite the different order of mentioning the designer names and slight variances in phrasing, the essence of the information remains the same in both sentences. It's also worth noting that the use of \\"among others\\" in both versions implies that the individuals listed are not the only designers for whom she has modeled; there are more designers or brands that are not mentioned, suggesting her professional runway career is even more extensive than revealed in these sentences. In summary, both sentences, although not identical in their structure and ordering, provide the same overall information about this person's runway experiences with a range of prominent designers or brands.

He was also troubled by the persecution of people in other religions especially when he started making Christian friends in college. Majed says âI saw how peaceful they are. I saw how forgiving they are. I saw the principles and the values that they have. So I didnât understand why you want to persecute people that they are that peaceful. And I needed to know what truth that this Christians have that I was not even allowed to hear.â To get answers Majed went to his Christian friend tamer who in turn gave him a bible.

Majed escaped and continued his work. 3 months later Egyptian police forced their way into his home and arrested him . Majed remembers âAn officer came and he said I need to know everything about you who you are who working with you. I told him I don't know anything I don't know what youâre talking about I don't know what organization and He told me you want to play tough we can play tough together. I told him tough is my middle name you donât need to worry about that. Next day they transfer me to Abu Zaabel Prison. For the locals Abu Zaabel Prison is called hell on earth.â Trying to get information interrogators began systematically torturing Majed .

Yes; b). No; Answer:","output":"Answer: b). No; The right answer to the question \\"name one kind of a protein that some viruses have inside their phospholipid envelope\\" cannot be \\"more abundant,\\" as \\"more abundant\\" is not a specific type of protein. The question is asking for a particular type of protein present in the phospholipid envelope of some viruses. Since some viruses have intrinsic proteins within their phospholipid envelope, the answer should be focused on a specific type of intrinsic protein that can be found in these viruses. Intrinsic proteins, also known as integral proteins, are proteins that are embedded within the lipid bilayer of the membrane. There are several types of intrinsic proteins, such as glycoproteins, ion channels, and receptor proteins, that play crucial roles in the viral life cycle. A better answer to this question might be: Matrix (M) protein: The M protein is an abundant and essential component of many enveloped viruses, including the influenza virus and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It serves as a crucial structural element in the virion by linking the lipid bilayer envelope to the underlying nucleocapsid core, which contains the viral genome. The M protein aids in the assembly, budding, and release of the virus particles from infected host cells, thus playing a key role in the viral life cycle."},{"instruction":"Q: You will be given a context and a question in Spanish.

Años más tarde O'Bannon comenzó a escribir una historia similar a la trama de Dark Star pero con más elementos del cine de terror.

Se puso en contacto con él y ambos accedieron a colaborar en sus respectivos guiones; coincidieron en que la película de O'Bannon habría de ser la menos costosa de producir así que trabajaron primero en dicho libreto. Para entonces O'Bannon ya tenía un borrador de veintinueve páginas titulado Memory, que describía cómo un grupo de astronautas despierta de un sueño inducido y se entera de que el trayecto de su nave ha sido interrumpido por una señal proveniente de un planetoide desconocido.

Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \\"nucleons\\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word \\"proton\\" is Greek for \\"first\\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei. - The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics. - Angina pectoris, commonly known as angina, is the sensation of chest pain, pressure, or squeezing, often due to not enough blood flow to the heart muscle as a result of obstruction or spasm of the coronary arteries. While angina pectoris can occur due to anemia, abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure, its main cause is coronary artery disease, an atherosclerotic process affecting the arteries feeding the heart. The term derives from the Latin \\"angere\\" (\\"to strangle\\") and \\"pectus\\" (\\"chest\\"), and can therefore be translated as \\"a strangling feeling in the chest\\". - Tritium (or ; symbol ' or ', also known as hydrogen-3) is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The nucleus of tritium (sometimes called a triton) contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of protium (by far the most abundant hydrogen isotope) contains one proton and no neutrons. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth, where trace amounts are formed by the interaction of the atmosphere with cosmic rays. It is produced by irradiating lithium metal in a nuclear reactor. Tritium is used as a radioactive tracer, in radioluminescent light sources for watches and instruments, and in nuclear weapons. The name of this isotope is formed from the Greek word (\\"trítos\\") meaning \\"third\\". - A radioactive tracer, or radioactive label, is a chemical compound in which one or more atoms have been replaced by a radioisotope so by virtue of its radioactive decay it can be used to explore the mechanism of chemical reactions by tracing the path that the radioisotope follows from reactants to products. Radiolabeling is thus the radioactive form of isotopic labeling. - Lithium (from , \\"stone\\") is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, it exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, appears only in compounds, which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion, is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride. - AstraZeneca plc is a BritishSwedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company. In 2013 it moved its headquarters to Cambridge, England, and concentrated its R&D in three sites: Cambridge, Gaithersburg, Maryland (location of MedImmune) for work on biopharmaceuticals, and Mölndal (near Gothenburg) in Sweden, for research on traditional chemical drugs. In 2015 it was the eighth largest drug company in the world based on sales revenue. - Alprenolol, or alfeprol, alpheprol, and alprenololum (Gubernal, Regletin, Yobir, Apllobal, Aptine, Aptol Duriles), is a non-selective beta blocker as well as 5-HT receptor antagonist, used in the treatment of angina pectoris. It is no longer marketed by AstraZeneca, but may still be available from other pharmaceutical companies or generically. - A nuclear reactor, formerly known as an atomic pile, is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used at nuclear power plants for electricity generation and in propulsion of ships. Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid (water or gas), which runs through steam turbines. These either drive a ship's propellers or turn electrical generators. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for district heating. Some reactors are used to produce isotopes for medical and industrial use, or for production of weapons-grade plutonium. Some are run only for research. Today there are about 450 nuclear power reactors that are used to generate electricity in about 30 countries around the world. - Dihydroalprenolol ( DHA ) is a hydrogenated alprenolol derivative that acts as a beta - adrenergic blocker . When the extra hydrogen atoms are tritium , it is a radiolabeled form of alprenolol , which is used to label beta - adrenergic receptors for isolation . - Cosmic rays are high-energy radiation, mainly originating outside the Solar System. Upon impact with the Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays can produce showers of secondary particles that sometimes reach the surface. Composed primarily of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei, they are of mysterious origin. Data from the \\"Fermi\\" space telescope (2013) have been interpreted as evidence that a significant fraction of primary cosmic rays originate from the supernovae explosions of stars. Active galactic nuclei probably also produce cosmic rays. - Beta blocker, also written -blocker, is a class of medications that are particularly used to manage cardiac arrhythmias, and to protect the heart from a second heart attack (myocardial infarction) after a first heart attack (secondary prevention). They are also widely used to treat hypertension, although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients. - Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed \\"protium\\" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one proton and no neutrons. - A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion (thermonuclear weapon). Both reactions release vast quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission (\\"atomic\\") bomb released the same amount of energy as approximately .

Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: David Meyer probably believes that Options: A.

Sander published an article in the November 2004 issue of the Stanford Law Review that questioned the effectiveness of racial preferences in law schools. He noted that, prior to his article, there had been no comprehensive study on the effects of affirmative action. The article presents a study that shows that half of all black law students rank near the bottom of their class after the first year of law school and that black law students are more likely to drop out of law school and to fail the bar exam. The article offers a tentative estimate that the production of new black lawyers in the United States would grow by eight percent if affirmative action programs at all law schools were ended. Less qualified black students would attend less prestigious schools where they would be more closely matched in abilities with their classmates and thus perform relatively better. Sander helped to develop a socioeconomically-based affirmative action plan for the UCLA School of Law after the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, which prohibited the use of racial preferences by public universities in California.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. park B. reduce C. descend D. fall E. set A:","output":"C. descend As the counterweight began to rise, the elevator began to descend into the mine. The counterweight and elevator system is designed in such a way that as one side rises, the other side descends in a controlled manner. This is an essential component of the elevator system, ensuring smooth and efficient transportation of people and materials in vertical shafts, such as in mines. In the context of the question, the options park, reduce, fall, and set do not effectively describe the action of an elevator in response to the rising counterweight. Descending is the most appropriate term to use, as it accurately depicts the vertical movement of the elevator going down into the mine. Descending suggests controlled downward movement, unlike falling, which indicates a more rapid and uncontrolled action. Furthermore, the elevator system relies on a counterweight to balance the forces. This mechanism is critical in maintaining equilibrium throughout the operation. Counterweights help to offset the weight of the elevator car and the passengers or materials it carries. As a result, the motor doesn't need to work as hard to lift or lower the car, improving efficiency and reducing wear on the motor. The counterweight and elevator essentially operate in tandem, with the rising counterweight ensuring the smooth descent of the elevator. In summary, the correct answer to the question \\"As the counterweight began to rise the elevator began to what into the mine?\\" is option C: descend. The operation of the counterweight and elevator system corresponds to one side rising while the other side descends, providing an efficient means of transporting people and materials within vertical shafts in various applications, including mines."},{"instruction":"Here is an article: Halloween is a spooky night, but there's nothing scary about this sad pit bull dressed up for the occasion.

When Liz DeStasio's smartphone abruptly stopped getting her parents' text messages, she chalked it up to old-person syndrome — that they had simply screwed up a setting that was preventing the texts from getting through. But the missing-text problem began spreading to more of her contacts, perplexing both her and her husband, Dominick. Soon, they found the common thread: All of the people whose texts weren't getting through were iPhone owners. \\"It was actually her father who noticed that whenever he sent a message, it was showing up as if it were sent under iMessage,\\" says Dominick. \\"Once he mentioned the iMessage thing, I put two and two together that all the people that were having trouble messaging her had iPhones.\\" It quickly became obvious that Liz had been affected by a known problem with iMessage: That is, if someone switches from an iPhone to a non-Apple phone and neglects to turn off the service — which routes text messages through Apple's servers instead of the carrier's SMS network — then that person will no longer get texts from other iPhones. What's happening is, on the back end, Apple still thinks the person's phone is an iPhone. Thus those texts have nowhere to go when they hit the phone number associated with the iMessage account, since the service isn't available on other phones. The problem has cropped up time and again, affecting many people who have switched from an iPhone to another platform. There was just one thing wrong with that theory, though: Liz DeStasio never owned an iPhone. Liz had just switched phones, upgrading to a Samsung Galaxy S4 from a dying Droid Bionic — both Android phones — getting a new phone number in the process. She and her family had just moved back to Pittsburgh from Las Vegas, so she felt her phone swap was a good time to ditch the 702 area code as well. The new number was Dominick's first clue in finding out exactly what was happening to his wife's missing texts. In his investigation, Dominick leveraged his expertise as a software engineer. He experimented with different kinds of texts from different people and confirmed it only affected messages from iPhones. Dominick got on the phone with a support person from Verizon. The initial person wasn't very helpful, so he needed to go up a couple of levels to find someone who could help. One supervisor said they'd perform a back-end fix, which did nothing. Finally, he got a Verizon network engineer on the line. As they were speaking, it dawned on him that the previous owner of his wife's phone number was a (former) iPhone owner, and hadn't deactivated iMessage. Although the engineer couldn't confirm that was the case, he said it was a very plausible theory. However, Verizon couldn't do anything about it, since iMessage is managed by Apple. The engineer told him that if Dominick or someone at Verizon called Apple and asked for iMessage to be turned off on a specific phone number, the chances of Apple doing so were extremely low. Dominick agreed, since he previously had unhelpful experiences with Apple's tech support, so instead he decided it would be easier for everyone if his wife just switched her phone number again. As soon as she did so, she began receiving texts again. Dominick related the whole saga on his blog. \\"The network engineer and I, what we agreed to was, 'She's only had this number for a day — let's try a different number,'\\" says Dominick. \\"As soon as we changed the number, it all started working.\\" Based on experiences others have had with this iMessage problem, Dominick made the right decision in not bothering to contact Apple. When Mashable contacted the company about the problem, Apple wouldn't comment, and its tech support staff appears inconsistent when it comes to recommending fixes for this problem. The standard response seems to be recommending a user simply deactivate iMessage on their old phone. If that's not possible (as was the case with Liz DeStasio), then the company recommends the user wait out the 30 days it takes for the iMessage servers to reset the account (which apparently happens if the user's phone number hasn't been active on the system for that long). That's a problem if you never actually owned the iPhone. It's also a problem if your iPhone has been destroyed or rendered inoperable because of damage, which happened to Bill McBain. McBain accidentally went swimming with his iPhone 4S still in his pocket in July. When he came out of the water, he found the iPhone to be completely dead. McBain had been meaning to switch phones anyway, so when he got a new phone he opted for a Samsung Galaxy S4. But within a couple of days, he began to notice he wasn't getting texts from other iPhones. He instantly realized the problem was with iMessage, but since his old phone wasn't working at all, he couldn't turn it on to deactivate the service. When McBain contacted Apple, the only fix they recommended was to turn off iMessage through his old phone. When the support person told him that was his only option, he requested to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor gave him only three options: Turn off iMessage on the old phone, borrow a friend's iPhone and use his new SIM card to turn off iMessage, or wait 30 days (an excerpt from the transcript is below). \\"Apple has got to have some internal way of changing this info sooner and it was pretty frustrating that they offered no workaround,\\" McBain told Mashable via email. \\"Since this time I've also had a couple coworkers talk about friends they knew that encountered the same issue.\\" There are actually a few other possible fixes Apple could have recommended. A user can go to the not-widely known Apple profile page, which lists all the Apple devices a user has registered. From there, the user can de-register the iPhone, which sometimes fixes the issue, even though registration generally only applies to warranties and support, not services. Nonetheless, many posts in support forums and even some wireless carriers recommend this solution. If de-registering the device doesn't work, the user can change their Apple password, which requires all devices associated with that Apple ID to re-establish contact with Apple's servers. When that happens, the iMessage server should no longer see the person's new (non-Apple) phone as an iPhone. However, if the user has associated iMessage with only a phone number and not an Apple ID, this probably won't work. Finally, the user can use Find My iPhone via iCloud.com to wipe the phone. Even if the phone is destroyed, wiping the phone tells Apple's servers to sever the iMessage connection — but again, only if the user has associated iMessage with the Apple ID (which it may not be, if it's tied only to the phone number). However, McBain says he tried all of those solutions, and none of them worked. Eventually, 21 days after he de-registered his phone, McBain got an automated email from Apple informing him that is iMessage profile had been modified, and he began receiving texts from iPhones again. The iMessage issue is also plaguing Jenny Liu, a colleague of Dominick DeStasio. When Liu switched from an iPhone 4 to a Galaxy S4 she experienced the same problem of missing texts from iPhones. She says she has tried both de-registering the device and changing her password, but she is still unable to receive the texts. Most likely, Liu and McBain had iMessage associated only with a phone number and not an Apple ID. In those cases, there appears to be no quick fix — not even on Apple's end. Unlike other messaging platforms such as Viber, WhatsApp and BlackBerry Messenger, iMessage intersects directly with SMS. Apple combines the two services in the same app, ostensibly for user convenience. However, it's also the main reason this problem continues to arise. \\"Many [messaging] services today latch onto a phone number, which is commonly understood, but it leads to these types of collisions,\\" says Andrew Bocking, head of BlackBerry Messenger for BlackBerry. \\"We've always focused on the PIN number — it really provided a unique identifier that's separate from what would be a traditional phone identifier. Because of that, obviously, it avoids this issue.\\" Since iMessage is tied to a user's phone number and affects SMS, wireless carriers have a stake in fixing it. However, all of the major carriers declined to comment for this story — understandable considering Apple is an important partner for them. However, a trusted source says at least one carrier has approached Apple about the issue, but addressing it requires constant management (i.e. money), and Apple has shown no interest in funding such an effort. Whether or not the company wants to work with carriers on recycled phone numbers, it's unclear why Apple isn't able to let users de-activate iMessage either via the web or a service call, as opposed to forcing them to wait weeks for the problem to fix itself. \\"I think weird is the right word for that,\\" says Bocking. \\"I remember this coming up a year and a half ago, and I thought they would have handled it beyond some 30-day timer. Generally speaking, I'm sure it could be handled better.\\" iMessage first came online in late 2011. Looking at forums since that time, the problem has come up repeatedly, and it doesn't appear Apple has addressed it outside of a cursory troubleshooting page. The lack of attention could be a simple oversight, and the reason it's not high on Apple's priority list appears obvious, at least to Dominick. \\"I can see the response, 'If you had an iPhone, you wouldn't have that problem,'\\" says Dominick. \\"I just think it's a very poor implementation, and there's no connection between the carriers. When a number goes back in a pool, there needs to be some kind of an API where they can de-register that number from iMessage, and that obviously isn't there.\\" The smartphone market is still growing. With Android market share growing faster than Apple's in many parts of the world, it stands to reason a larger number of people will switch from away from iOS as time goes on. And as they do a small but increasing number of people will lose the ability to receive texts from many people. \\"A lot of those new Android owners are likely former iPhone users, and if they are switching because their phone is inoperable Apple continues to hold their texts hostage,\\" says McBain. \\"I feel like the sign of a good company is letting you leave if you want.\\" The iPhone 5C could exacerbate the problem. The iPhone 5C is a lower-cost model that appears to be aimed at developing markets — places where pre-paid plans, multiple SIM cards and constantly changing phone numbers are more common, if not the norm. However, if switching phone numbers can lead to a 30-day blackout on texts from other iPhones, the iMessage problem could affect even more people in those markets, even among those who never owned an iPhone. Apple is a company that prides itself on providing an excellent customer experience, but that consideration doesn't appear to extend to former customers. iMessage has the potential to make their communication inconsistent once they leave iOS, but the message from Apple is clear: You're on your own. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the issues faced by some smartphone users, particularly those who have switched from an iPhone to a non-Apple phone, due to a known problem with iMessage. When someone switches from an iPhone to a different platform without turning off the iMessage service, they might stop receiving texts from other iPhone users. This occurs because Apple's servers still identify the user's phone as an iPhone, despite it no longer being an iPhone. The article goes on to narrate a case in which a person who never owned an iPhone faced this issue because the previous owner of her phone number was a former iPhone user who hadn't deactivated iMessage before changing phone numbers. The article further elaborates on the attempts to find solutions for this problem by contacting Apple and wireless carriers, but without much success. It raises questions about Apple's lack of action in addressing an issue that has persisted since 2011 and how the growing Android market might increase the number of people facing this problem in the future."},{"instruction":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: SnowballEarth:TheDiscoveryofEvidenceThattheEarthWasOnceFrozenOverfromPoletoPole","output":"Snowball Earth: The Discovery of Evidence That the Earth Was Once Frozen Over from Pole to Pole Okay little buddy, let's add those spaces so it's easier to read!

The island experiences occasional earthquakes due to its location on the western edge of the Pacific Plate and near the Philippine Sea Plate. In recent years, earthquakes with epicenters near Guam have had magnitudes ranging from 5.0 to 8.7. Unlike the Anatahan volcano in the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam is not volcanically active. However, due to its proximity to Anatahan, vog (i.e. volcanic smog) does occasionally affect Guam. Due to Guam being so close to Anatahan, what dod they have to worry about?","output":"Guam is close to Anatahan, which is a volcano. Because of this, sometimes Guam has to worry about something called \\"vog.\\" Vog is like a smog or a smoke, but it's made by the volcano. This vog can make the air not so nice to breathe and not so good for the people who live on Guam. But don't worry, Guam doesn't have any volcanoes itself, so they don't have to worry about that."},{"instruction":"Because the FGD estimate based on availability of resources is much less than the amount of FGD capacity that would be cost effective to build, EPA ran model sensitivities constraining the amount of scrubber capacity that could be installed by 2005 at 10,000 MWe. Does it follow that \\"Increasing the availability would help.\\"?","output":"Yes, it does follow that \\"increasing the availability would help.\\" Let us first understand the context and then analyze the situation in more detail. FGD, or Flue Gas Desulfurization, is a technology used to remove sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the exhaust flue gases produced by coal-fired power plants. These systems, often referred to as scrubbers, are crucial in helping to reduce air pollution and mitigate the environmental impacts of power generation. In the given situation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified that the FGD estimate – based on availability of resources – is significantly less than the amount of FGD capacity that would be cost-effective to build. EPA has therefore conducted model sensitivities constraining the amount of scrubber capacity that could be installed by 2005 at 10,000 MWe. The model sensitivities are designed to account for the uncertainties in the resource availability and to help identify effective policy approaches for future deployment of FGD technologies. By constraining the amount of FGD capacity, the EPA may be looking at understanding the effects of limited resource availability on the overall air quality and emissions reduction objectives. Now, let us consider the statement \\"increasing the availability would help.\\" If the resource availability were increased, it could lead to the following benefits: 1. Greater FGD Installation Capacity: With more resources available, more scrubber capacity can be installed, enabling a higher number of coal-fired power plants to reduce their sulfur dioxide emissions substantially. 2. Cost-efficiency: As mentioned previously, the FGD capacity based on resource availability is significantly less than what would be considered cost-effective. By increasing resource availability, more FGD technologies can be deployed, making it more economical in the long run and encouraging greater investments in pollution control. 3. Improved Air Quality: More widespread installation of FGD systems would lead to a more substantial reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions, resulting in improved air quality and reduced human health risks. 4. Reduced Environmental Impacts: By reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, the harmful effects of acid rain could be mitigated, thereby protecting ecosystems and reducing the detrimental impacts of air pollution on natural habitats. In conclusion, increasing the availability of resources for the installation of FGD systems would indeed help in addressing the gap between the current FGD estimate and the cost-effective capacity. This would have multiple benefits, such as improved air quality, reduced environmental impacts, and increased cost-efficiency in deploying these essential pollution control technologies. Such an increase in availability could be achieved through policy changes, financial incentives, or technological advancements, ultimately contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable future."},{"instruction":"What is the main thing to get happy in life?

Some prisoners were members of other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, landowners, and law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000-8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000-6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy).Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die. According to NKVD reports, if a prisoner could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude, he was declared a \\"hardened and uncompromising enemy of Soviet authority\\".On 5 March 1940, pursuant to a note to Joseph Stalin from Beria, six members of the Soviet Politburo — Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Mikhail Kalinin — signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish \\"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\\" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus.

In my first year out of high school in college, I didn’t quite get along with one vocal pipsqueak of a guy. Mid-year one afternoon post-dismissal, a small white car drove past dangerously close to me and honked as I made my way to the bus stand home. If there had actually been any malice intended, I would have been caught out totally by surprise. The next day, he wondered aloud why I did not respond or react to him flippantly wanting to ram me with his car as he drove by. To think of it, I had already taken a swipe at another guy whom I suspected of being behind the wheel less than an hour earlier. Professing some half-hearted disinterest, I thought and felt to myself that this episode wasn’t over - yet. Fast forward some 45–60 days later, this guy is suddenly absent from college for almost a week. Successive class lecturers note that it is not like him to skip classes without a valid reason. Late on the second day of absence, another lecturer asks our class about him. “His car crashed.”, I state almost flippantly, with a weak spirit of retribution shining inside my gut. But as you would realize from answering this question it later turned out to be true. While driving at quite a clip near his home, he had barreled through a residential cross-junction and broadsided a delivery van that had charged through the open junction with no regulating traffic lights. The van ended up upside down on the road shoulder and his parents-issued car was out of commission for like, three weeks. He suffered a concussion and a shattered nasal septum from the impact and police issued the van driver a ticket for dangerous driving. Basically, he had joked about striking me with his car hit-and-run and I had later joked to that lecturer and the class that he had crashed his car - and it turned out I was right. How does she feel about the man? - not enough information - He needs to stop driving - He should have had a different car - He should have driven safer A:","output":"It is difficult to determine exactly how she feels about the man based on the information provided, but there are a few possible sentiments that could be inferred. 1. Concern: She expressed worry when the man was absent from college for almost a week, which may suggest that she had some level of care and concern for his well-being. The fact that she noticed his absence and was aware that it was unusual for him suggests that despite their previous conflicts, she still paid attention to his actions and presence in class. 2. Disapproval: Given that he had previously threatened to ram her with his car and then followed through with a dangerous driving incident (albeit not involving her), she may feel some level of disapproval towards his reckless behavior and lack of safety on the road. This could be compounded by the fact that he suffered injuries and caused damage to another vehicle as a result of his actions. 3. Vindication: She may have felt a sense of vindication when her seemingly flippant comment about him crashing his car turned out to be true. This emotion could stem from the fact that he had previously put her in danger, and now he was the one facing the consequences of dangerous driving. In this sense, she might feel that he received some sort of karmic justice for his previous behavior. 4. Relief: It could also be possible that she feels relief that the incident did not involve her, and that she was not injured as a result of his dangerous driving. Furthermore, it appears that his dangerous behavior was addressed by the police, and this may bring her additional sense of relief, knowing that appropriate action was taken. Overall, it seems that her feelings towards the man are a mixture of concern, disapproval, vindication, and relief. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the exact extent of each emotion. As for the man's behavior, it is clear that he needs to stop driving recklessly and take road safety more seriously. Whether this involves getting a different car or simply adjusting his attitude towards driving, it is vital for his safety and the safety of others that he makes necessary changes to prevent further accidents."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What key details about hans vonk -lrb- footballer -rrb- can be extracted from the following bio?

McKay, best friends, former Trojan teammates and colleagues, will be together on the field again at the Coliseum for another USC-Notre Dame matchup on Saturday. This is the 40-year anniversary of the 1974 comeback win in which USC was down 24-0 and rallied for a historic 55-24 victory. Haden and McKay were instrumental in the comeback, one of the best in college football history. Neither remembers what then-coach John McKay said at halftime, but Haden, who was USC's quarterback, and McKay, a standout receiver, can't forget the scene at the Coliseum that day. \\"I'd never seen the Coliseum that way before,\\" J.K. McKay said. \\"Everyone stood up. I don't think anyone sat down until the game was over. If you watch the DVD of that game, from the moment of that kickoff return (by Anthony Davis), no one sat down.\\" Davis' 102-yard kickoff return to start the second half sparked the Trojans to an improbable come-from-behind win. USC scored 55 points in a span of 17 minutes. It was the final game at the Coliseum for seniors Haden and McKay and they went on to win the national championship. \\"I get reminded of it virtually every year when we play them,\\" said Haden, USC's athletic director. \\"I never really look back, to be perfectly honest. It will be fun gathering with my teammates from that game. They'll be introduced and it will be fun to see guys I haven't seen in a while. I generally don't look back on life and the career I enjoyed. I try to look forward to the next phase. But I understand the significance and it will be a fun afternoon.\\" It's not like Haden hasn't strolled down this memory lane before. And McKay, USC's senior associate athletic director for football, is in the same office if they ever want to relive Haden's touchdown passes of 18 and 45 yards to McKay. Their families will spend part of Thanksgiving together, too. Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports USC emphasizing turnovers with Golson and Notre Dame coming to town \\"It seems like two weeks ago and 120 years ago -- it depends on the moment,\\" McKay said. \\"Halftime, I've heard a lot of versions of it. I don't remember. We just scored (before halftime) and got the ball to start the second half and my dad made reference to Anthony Davis bringing the kickoff back (at halftime). He referenced that we weren't punting anymore, and I think he was right.\\" USC gained a measure of resolve just before halftime by scoring with 10 seconds left. Haden found Davis for a scoring strike but the extra point was blocked. And after that comeback was started, even Notre Dame's top-ranked defense couldn't stop the Trojans. \\"It was two completely different games,\\" Haden said. \\"It was inexplicable how everything went our way (in the second half). The ball bounced our way. That was a great defense. Anthony returned that kickoff for a touchdown and our defense got a turnover and had a short field. J.K. caught a touchdown pass. The defense scored a touchdown. J.K. caught another touchdown pass. It was just one eventful play after another. It wasn't all skill. There was some good fortune and luck on our side. They always talk about the luck of the Irish, but we had the luck that day.\\" Haden and McKay still keep in touch with many of their former teammates, including Davis, and they'll revisit the memories of that day as the team will be honored during Saturday's game. Matchup with struggling Notre Dame team just what USC needs after UCLA loss \\"It was my last game at the Coliseum and the second-to-last game I thought I'd ever play, and to go out in that manner at the Coliseum ...\\" Haden said wistfully. \\"Three years and we never lost a game there. Never lost a Pac-8 game there. Never lost in the Coliseum.\\" That lofty statistic probably will be discussed as old teammates share stories and memories of those games against Notre Dame. Haden joked that when he hears from old teammates, it's usually not to talk about the past. \\"They keep in touch with me now that I have this job and they're asking for tickets,\\" Haden said with a laugh. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"In 1974, USC's football team made a historic comeback against Notre Dame, winning 55-24 after being down 24-0. Pat Haden and J.K.

Object-oriented design (OOD) is a software design methodology that revolves around the concept of \\"objects.\\" These objects constitute the main building blocks in the system, encapsulating data and the functionality that interacts with that data. Object-oriented design is based on the following key principles: 1. Encapsulation: This principle is about bundling data and the methods or functions that operate on the data within a single unit called an object. This allows for proper data hiding and manages the complexity of a system by abstracting the inner workings of an object and exposing only relevant functionality. 2. Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism that allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. This promotes code reuse by allowing new objects to adopt the behaviors of existing ones. Additionally, inheritance enables a hierarchical classification of objects, providing the ability to model real-world relationships between classes in the system. 3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of the same class. This enables a single interface or method to interact with various types of classes or objects, making the code more flexible and scalable. 4. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components. These components are represented in the form of classes and interfaces, exhibiting a high level of abstraction that facilitates code maintainability, scalability, and reuse. Object-oriented design promotes clean, modular code that is easier to develop, maintain, and debug. By modeling real-world relationships between objects, OOD provides a better understanding of the problem domain and supports more efficient software development. Furthermore, OOD encourages the reuse of existing code, reducing time and effort spent on programming and enhancing overall system quality."},{"instruction":"Student: Premise: \\"Mr. soccer player of the green team attempts a shot.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"He eats cake in the store.\\" is true?

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

He was the scourge of Democratic Representative \\"Boss\\" Tweed and the Tammany Hall Democratic party political machine. In 1890, Nast published Thomas Nast's Christmas Drawings for the Human Race. He contributed cartoons in various publications, notably the Illustrated American, but was unable to regain his earlier popularity. His mode of cartooning had come to be seen as outdated, and a more relaxed style exemplified by the work of Joseph Keppler was in vogue. Health problems, which included pain in his hands which had troubled him since the 1870s, affected his ability to work. In 1892, he took control of a failing magazine, the New York Gazette, and renamed it Nast's Weekly. Now returned to the Republican fold, Nast used the Weekly as a vehicle for his cartoons supporting Benjamin Harrison for president. The magazine had little impact and ceased publication seven months after it began, shortly after Harrison's defeat. The failure of Nast's Weekly left Nast with few financial resources. He received a few commissions for oil paintings and drew book illustrations. In 1902, he applied for a job in the State Department, hoping to secure a consular position in western Europe. Although no such position was available, President Theodore Roosevelt was an admirer of the artist and offered him an appointment as the United States' Consul General to Guayaquil, Ecuador in South America. Nast accepted the position and traveled to Ecuador on July 1, 1902. During a subsequent yellow fever outbreak, Nast remained on the job, helping numerous diplomatic missions and businesses escape the contagion. He contracted the disease and died on December 7 of that year. His body was returned to the United States, where he was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

The group is headed by former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy and includes Kevin Sabet, a veteran of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Obama. The new group rejects the \\"war on drugs\\" model. It agrees that we don't want to lock people up for casual marijuana use -- or even stigmatize them with an arrest record. But what we do want to do is send a clear message: Marijuana use is a bad choice. There are many excellent reasons to avoid marijuana. Marijuana use damages brain development in young people. Heavy users become socially isolated and perform worse in school and at work. Marijuana smoke harms the lungs. A growing body of evidence suggests that marijuana can trigger psychotic symptoms that otherwise would have remained latent. It's possible to imagine a marijuana rule that tries to respond precisely to such risk factors as happen to be known by the current state of science. Such a rule might say: \\"You shouldn't use marijuana until you are over 25, or after your brain has ceased to develop, whichever comes first. You shouldn't use marijuana if you are predisposed to certain mental illnesses (most of which we can't yet diagnose in advance). Be aware that about one-sixth of users will become chronically dependent on marijuana, and as a result will suffer a serious degradation of life outcomes. As yet, we have no sure idea at what dosage marijuana will impair your ability to drive safely, or how long the impairment will last. Be as careful as you can, within the limits of our present knowledge!\\" Yet as a parent of three, two exiting adolescence and one entering, I've found that the argument that makes the biggest impression is: \\"Marijuana is illegal. Stay away.\\" I think many other parents have found the same thing. When we write social rules, we always need to consider: Who are we writing rules for? Some people can cope with complexity. Others need clarity. Some people will snap back from an early mistake. Others will never recover. \\"Just say no\\" is an easy rule to follow. \\"It depends on individual risk factors, many of them unknowable in advance\\" -- that rule is not so easy. Richard Branson: War on drugs a trillion-dollar failure. Over the past three decades, and in area after area of social life, Americans have replaced simple rules that anybody can follow with complex rules that baffle large numbers of people. Consider, for example, the home mortgage. Once the mortgage was a very simple product. Put 20% down, then sign up for a fixed schedule of payments over the next 30 years. In the space of a single generation, these 30-year fixed-rate amortizing mortgages turned what had been a nation of renters into a nation of homeowners. For more sophisticated buyers, however, the standard mortgage was a big nuisance. For them, bankers developed more flexible products: no money down, no documentation, interest-only, adjustable rate. These products met genuine needs. But as they diffused down-market, they became traps for people who did not understand the risks they were accepting. Consider how we finance higher education. Once, state governments subsidized their universities to offer a low tuition fee to all comers. Fee increases at private universities were constrained by the lower fees at the public institutions: Duke can raise its price only so high above the University of North Carolina. The universities soon realized, however, that by setting their tuition fees low, they were forgoing revenues that might be collected from the most affluent students. Universities rapidly raised their tuition fees, then offered discounts and aid to students in need. Kevin Sabet: Legalize Pot? No, reform laws. But while anybody could understand a 500 per semester tuition bill, the new system of rebates confuses the very people who most need help. A few days before Christmas, Jason DeParle of The New York Times reported a depressing example of the toll modern financial aid exacts upon students from less sophisticated backgrounds. He told the story of three bright girls from poor families who had recently tried -- and failed -- to gain college degrees. One of them was admitted to Emory, a prestigious school with a full-ticket price of 50,000, but one that grants very generous financial aid -- if the student can figure out how to make the financial aid work for her. The trouble was that students who most need aid are often precisely those who have nobody around them who has ever successfully navigated a complicated bureaucratic institution like a university financial aid office. \\"Though Emory sent weekly e-mails -- 17 of them, along with an invitation to a program for minority students -- they went to a school account she had not learned to check,\\" DeParle wrote. \\"Angelica reported that her mother made 35,000 a year and paid about half of that in rent. With her housing costs so high, Emory assumed the family had extra money and assigned ... an income of 51,000. ... (Angelica) discovered what had happened only recently.\\" Unable to cope with the school's e-mail system or to decrypt its rules for imputing family income, Angelica finally dropped out of Emory, burdened by 61,000 in student debt. In 1943, Vice President Henry Wallace published a book celebrating the coming \\"century of the common man.\\" That century did not last very long. We have transitioned instead into the era of the clever man and clever woman. We have revised our institutions, our programs, our rules in ways that offer profitable new chances to those with cultural know-how -- and that inflict disastrous consequences on those who are overwhelmed by a world of ever-more-abundant and ever-more-risky choices. Opinion: The end of the war on marijuana. We're not going to uninvent the no-money-down loan. Universities that receive applications from all over the planet cannot finance themselves like an old-fashioned state land-grant college. But we need to recognize that modern life is becoming steadily more dangerous for people prone to make bad choices. At a time when they need more help than ever to climb the ladder, marijuana legalization kicks them back down the ladder. The goal of public policy should not be to punish vulnerable kids for making life-wrecking mistakes. The goal of public policy should be to protect (to the extent we can) the vulnerable from making life-wrecking mistakes in the first place. There's a trade-off, yes, and it takes the form of denying less vulnerable people easy access to a pleasure they believe they can safely use. But they are likely deluding themselves about how well they are managing their drug use. And even if they are not deluded -- if they really are so capable and effective -- then surely they can see that society has already been massively re-engineered for their benefit already. Surely, enough is enough? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In this article, the author provides their perspective on the issue of marijuana legalization as a new member of the board for Smart Approaches to Marijuana, an organization opposed to the legalization of cannabis. Here are the main points they discuss: 1. Damage to Young People: The author emphasizes the physiological and psychological damage induced by marijuana. They mention that it affects brain development in young people, leading to issues like decreased performance in school or work, increased social isolation, lung harm, and potentially triggering latent psychotic symptoms. 2. Complexity of Risk Factors: The author acknowledges that it's possible to create a rule about marijuana usage that aligns with known risk factors. However, they argue that this complexity can be harmful, as it might be too difficult for people who are predisposed to addiction or unaware of their underlying health issues. They stress on the importance of a simple, straightforward rule – “Just say no” – to avoid this issue. 3. Comparison with Other Complex Decisions: The author connects the debate around marijuana legalization with other complex decision-making instances in American society, such as home mortgages and higher education financing. They highlight that the shift from simple to complex rules has resulted in confusion and harm, especially for those without the necessary know-how to navigate these contexts. 4. Vulnerability of Certain Sections of the Society: They highlight the vulnerability of people prone to make bad choices and argue that public policy should aim to protect these individuals from making life-damaging mistakes. The author criticizes the idea of marijuana legalization as it could worsen the situation for these people. 5. Recognizing Trade-offs: Acknowledging a trade-off, they argue that while some people might use marijuana responsibly, denying access could prevent vulnerable individuals from potential harm. They urge society to consider if current policy is already engineered towards the benefit of the capable and effective, questioning if more permissiveness is truly necessary. The author thus feels strongly towards preventing the legalization of marijuana, arguing that it poses unnecessary risks and complications, particularly for vulnerable sections of society. Their stance is primarily for the protection of those who are potentially unable to fully comprehend and navigate these complexities and risks."},{"instruction":"Give the step-by-step reasoning process and then the final answer.

The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd.

A Neanderthal man stumbles upon what appears to be a large, primal, vicious alien in a cave (although the camera work uses zooms and flash-edits to keep the creature from being visualized fully). The two fight, and the caveman wins, stabbing the alien to death. However, fans of the show will recognize the black oil as it bleeds from the alien's wounds and soaks into the Neanderthal. After a fade to modern-day small-town Texas, a little boy (Lucas Black) falls down a hole in his back yard, and finds a human skull. As he picks it up, black oil seeps out from the ground beneath his feet, and black slivers move up his legs until they reach his head - his eyes go black. Shortly afterward, a team of firemen descend to rescue him. They are presumably lost to the same fate as the boy.In the summer of 1998, at the end of the show's fifth season, the X-Files were shut down, and Fox Mulder and Dana Scully were assigned to other projects.

While Michaud remains to disarm the bomb, Mulder and Scully are able to evacuate the building and prevent hundreds of casualties before it explodes.
