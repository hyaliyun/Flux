It was also the third of seven Karloff/Lugosi features. In this entry the dominant role goes to Boris Karloff. Through specially designed astronomical equipment, Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) demonstrates to colleagues Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi), Sir Frances Stevens (Walter Kingsford), his wife Lady Stevens (Beulah Bondi) and their nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton), that a meteorite containing a powerful element, landed on the African continent many millions of years in the past. Rukh impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to Africa to find the mysterious element. Rukh goes off on his own and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element which he names \\"Radium X\\". Due to Rukh's long absences, his comely young wife Diana (Frances Drake) becomes attracted to Drake and the two fall in love. Meanwhile Rukh becomes contaminated by Radium X to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly. The contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark. Rukh goes to Benet for help. Benet devises an antidote which if taken on a daily basis, will provide temporary immunity to the element. Unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects Rukh's brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer. While Rukh is continuing his work, Sir Frances takes news of the discovery back to France. Diana and Ronald accompany him. When Benet informs him of this action, Rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. When he returns to France he learns of the healing power of Radium X as he cures his mother's (Violet Kemble Cooper) blindness and of Benet's work in curing the maladies of his patients. But Rukh's madness intensifies. First he murders an innocent man whom is identified as Rukh. Upon hearing of Rukh's apparent demise, Diana and Ronald marry. This angers Rukh and he begins to exact his revenge on the five other members of the expedition. One night he is lured into a trap set by Benet and...........

Context: The Xiongnu, a nomadic steppe confederation, defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior partner, but continued their raids on the Han borders. Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC.

No matter which country you visit, no matter which grade you are in, you may not learn art, geography, chemistry or Chinese, but you always learn math. Why is this so? How come so many students hate math, and yet cannot avoid learning it in school? Jenny Sanders, a high school student in California, asks, \\"What good do we get from learning math? We can use computers to compute numbers, and we can use computers to store information. I think learning math at school is a waste of time.\\" However, there is much more to math than just learning to add and subtract numbers. In fact, math is not so much about calculation as it is about learning to think logically and solving problems. Of course, Jenny was right that we can use computers to do calculations, but how would we even know how to use the computer if we can't think logically? In short, computers are only tools when solving problems. For example, imagine you are a cook and must serve dinner to 100 guests.

Plans were probably first made to construct the castle in 1284, but this was delayed due to lack of funds and work only began in 1295 following the Madog ap Llywelyn uprising. A substantial workforce was employed in the initial years under the direction of James of St George. Edward's invasion of Scotland soon diverted funding from the project, however, and work stopped, only recommencing after an invasion scare in 1306. When work finally ceased around 1330 a total of £15,000 had been spent, a huge sum for the period, but the castle remained incomplete. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe.

Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India.

Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969.

Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.

A dusted-off putter from better times made the difference, leaving him second in the Turkish Airlines Open after an eight-under-par round. By his own four-letter description, Poulter’s 2014 campaign has been woeful, with injuries, a missed cut at The Open, Twitter rows and an underwhelming Ryder Cup by his standards. In that time his world ranking tumbled from 12th to 44, leaving him in danger of slipping out of the top 50 for the first time since September 2006.

Ian Poulter insists he is 'feeling right now' after a year in which he has 'played s***' as he moves second. Miguel Angel Jimenez leads the Turkish Airlines Open on nine under par, a shot ahead of Poulter. He cited the new Titleist clubs he switched to after the Ryder Cup as well a putter he unearthed from the 2013 Open, in which he finished third. ‘I’d played s*** all year,’ Poulter said. ‘There’s no other word for it. It was disappointing. There was nothing good coming out of 2014. ‘It’s been tough to take, it really has. I thought I was doing the right things at the start of the year and took a massive step backwards with injuries and trying to play through them is not good. ‘That’s a horrible spiral to be in when you’ve got two tour cards to make sure you maintain. Thankfully I’m feeling right now.’ Poulter (left, taking an approach shot on the 11 and right, his reaction to the shot) is second on eight under par. Poulter added: ‘I am having a boost at the right time. Sometimes you get a new car and it makes you feel good. I got new sticks in the bag. It felt great to be able to do that and that they worked really quickly. ‘When you get something new you are excited to use it. I have been excited for the last couple of weeks. I am happy with everything.’ Miguel Angel Jimenez led by a stroke on a day that all but eliminated Jamie Donaldson’s chances of snatching the Race to Dubai from Rory McIlroy. The Welshman needs to win here and in Dubai next week while hoping McIlroy finishes outside the top five when he returns in the desert. But a level-par round of 72 left the Ryder Cup player nine shots behind Jimenez, while the other two Race contenders in Sergio Garcia and Victor Dubuisson were horribly off the pace, shooting rounds of 75 and 77 respectively. Meanwhile, Turkey insists it is still bidding to host the 2022 Ryder Cup, a day after announcing their withdrawal over environmental concerns. Wales' Jamie Donaldson is now highly unlikely to catch Rory McIlroy in the Race to Dubai. The Welshman had a poor day and will hope to recover at in Antalya over the next few rounds.

Context: The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship. Question: What is Sophie Richardson in charge of at the Human Rights Campaign? Options: - China - United States - North Korea - not enough information Answer:","output":"China"},{"instruction":"After the August missile strikes, diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no more promising than military options. The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000. During these trips the NSC, Treasury, and intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials, and later interviewed members of the Bin Laden family, about Usama's inheritance. Question: \\"Who was the US trying to contact during strained Saudi Relations in 1997, when they were denied the opportunity to question detainees?\\" Answer: \\"William Milam\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is incorrect. The United States was trying to contact Madani al Tayyib, an important al Qaeda financial official, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997. They were denied the opportunity to question detainees, including Tayyib, despite repeated efforts by U.S. officials."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

She walks 3 blocks north, then seven times as many blocks west. Then she turns around and walks 8 blocks south and twice as many blocks east in the direction of her home. If Janet can walk 2 blocks/minute, how long will it take her to get home? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"First, let's break down Janet's journey step by step to determine the total number of blocks she needs to walk to get home. 1. Janet walks 3 blocks north. 2. She then walks seven times more blocks west, which is 7 * 3 = 21 blocks west. 3. She turns around and walks 8 blocks south. (Keep in mind, she was 3 blocks north initially.) 4. She then walks twice as many blocks east, which is 2 * 8 = 16 blocks east. Now we'll analyze her position relative to her starting point/home: 1. Since she walked 3 blocks north and then 8 blocks south, she's now 8 - 3 = 5 blocks south of her starting point. 2. She walked 21 blocks west and then 16 blocks east, so she's now 21 - 16 = 5 blocks west of her starting point. So, Janet needs to walk 5 blocks north and 5 blocks east to reach her home, which is a total of 5 + 5 = 10 blocks. We know Janet walks at a pace of 2 blocks/minute. To determine the time it takes her to walk the remaining 10 blocks, we can use the following simple formula: Time (in minutes) = Total blocks / Blocks per minute Time = 10 blocks / 2 blocks/minute = 5 minutes It will take Janet 5 minutes to walk the remaining 10 blocks and reach her home."},{"instruction":"Title: Survival Against the Odds Product review: Hatchet was a great book about survival in the wilderness with almost no hope.

Yes Q: Question: what are lobbying groups? Would \\"For example, a medical association , or a trade association of health insurance companies, may lobby a legislature in order to counteract the influence of tobacco companies, in which case the lobbying would be viewed by most people as justified (duly defending against others' corruption).\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"Lobbying groups, also known as interest groups or advocacy groups, are organizations that strive to influence public policy, legislation, and decision-making processes in favor of their specific interests or objectives. These groups invest significant time, effort, and financial resources to persuade lawmakers, government officials, and the general public to support their particular stance on specific issues. Lobbying activities can range from direct communication with decision-makers in government and public institutions to broad public relations campaigns aimed at mobilizing public opinion. The phrase you provided—“For example, a medical association, or a trade association of health insurance companies, may lobby a legislature in order to counteract the influence of tobacco companies, in which case the lobbying would be viewed by most people as justified (duly defending against others' corruption).”—is indeed a reasonable answer to explain one aspect of lobbying groups. In this example, a medical association or a trade association of health insurance companies might engage in lobbying to advocate for public health policies and counteract the influence of tobacco companies. By doing so, they intend to reduce the prevalence of smoking, which is linked to various health issues such as lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. Lobbying in this context may be perceived as justified because it defends public health interests against the potentially harmful policies put forth by tobacco companies. However, it is important to note that the perception of lobbying may vary based on the nature of the interest group, the specific policies being advocated, and personal beliefs and biases. Some individuals might view these lobbying activities as a legitimate exercise of freedom of speech and representation, while others may view it as exerting undue influence on public policy-making. Lobbying groups can be classified into various categories depending on their primary purposes, membership types, and interests. Some common types of lobbying groups include: 1. Professional Groups: These represent the interests of a specific profession or occupation, such as the American Medical Association for doctors or the National Association of Realtors for real estate professionals. 2. Business and Industry Groups: This category includes trade associations and chambers of commerce that work to promote or protect the interests of specific industries or sectors, such as the American Petroleum Institute for the oil industry or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America for pharmaceutical companies. 3. Labor Groups: These organizations represent the interests of workers and labor unions, and they often lobby for improved working conditions, wages, and benefits, such as the AFL-CIO or Teamsters. 4. Public Interest Groups: These groups advocate for various social, environmental, or consumer causes that are believed to benefit the broader public. Examples include the American Civil Liberties Union, Greenpeace, and AARP. 5. Identity-based Groups: These organizations represent the interests of specific demographic or social groups and work to promote their rights and inclusion within society, such as the NAACP, National Organization for Women, or Human Rights Campaign. In conclusion, lobbying groups play a significant role in shaping public policy by representing and advocating for their members' interests. While some groups may have altruistic objectives, others may primarily focus on advancing their own narrow concerns. Ultimately, the perception of the value and ethics of lobbying depends on individual perspectives, values, and beliefs."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Build a satellite - Attach a rocket - Add rocket fuel - Launch rocket - Satellite goes into orbit.

If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

The determination of the substantiality of the targeted part of a group involves examining various factors: 1. Numeric size of the targeted part: One of the main factors considered is the numeric size of the targeted part of the group. The number of individuals targeted serves as the necessary and important starting point in evaluating whether a targeted portion is substantial or not. 2. Relative size to the overall group: While the absolute number of targeted individuals is significant, the scale of the targeting should also be measured relative to the overall size of the entire group. This helps contextualize the impact in terms of how severely it affects the group's existence and identity. 3. Prominence within the group: The prominence of the targeted portion within the group also plays a crucial role in determining its substantiality. If the targeted part is emblematic of the entire group or is essential to its survival, this factor may support a finding that the part is substantial in the context of Article 4 of the Tribunal's Statute. In summary, the article highlights that there are several factors to consider when determining whether a targeted part of a group is substantial enough to meet the requirements of genocide under the Tribunal's Statute. The numeric size, the relative size to the entire group, and the prominence of the targeted portion within the group are key factors that are weighed in this assessment.

For n distinct items to be arranged around a circular table, we have (n-1)! ways to arrange them. In this case, we have 3 Chiefs of Staff, so there are (3-1)! = 2! = 2 ways to arrange them around the table without any restrictions. However, we need to consider that the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) does not want to sit next to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB). Let's treat CNO and CNGB as a single entity, which we will call 'X'. Now we have two \\"units\\" around the table: X and the last remaining Chief of Staff, Chief of the Army Staff (CAS). These two \\"units\\" can be arranged in (2-1)! = 1! = 1 way. Now, we need to consider the arrangement of CNO and CNGB within the entity 'X'. They can be ordered in 2! ways (CNO-CNGB or CNGB-CNO). So, the total number of ways in which the 3 Chiefs of Staff can be seated around the table by considering the restriction is 1 (arrangements of 'X' and CAS) * 2 (arrangements of CNO and CNGB in 'X') = 1*2 = 2 ways. Since there were originally 2 ways to arrange them without any restriction, and 2 ways to arrange them considering the restriction, the answer is: 2 (Total Ways) - 2 (Ways considering the restriction) = 0 (ways where the CNO is not next to the CNGB) However, since this answer doesn't match any of the given options, there must be an error in the question given, or the options provided are incorrect.

Let's break down each statement. Premise: \\"Or have more to do over that same time frame, I don't know which that answer is.\\" The premise conveys the idea that there is uncertainty about having more to do over the same time frame. The statement does not make clear whether a positive or negative outcome comes from having more to do in that period. We can rephrase the premise as: \\"It is unknown whether there will be more tasks to do within the same time frame.\\" Hypothesis: \\"You have to fill your time with things or else you fall behind.\\" The hypothesis states that if a person does not fill their time with activities or tasks, they will end up lagging or falling behind in their life or work. This hypothesis assumes that engaging in activities or tasks over time is essential for progressing or maintaining a satisfactory level. Now, we can analyze the relationship between these two statements. The premise acknowledges uncertainty about whether there will be more tasks or activities to do within a particular time frame. However, the hypothesis asserts that one must fill their time with things to avoid falling behind. Although the statements appear to be somewhat related, there is no clear logical connection between the uncertainty about having more to do (the premise) and the idea that filling time with activities is necessary to avoid falling behind (the hypothesis). In other words, the premise doesn't provide sufficient information to draw a conclusion about the truth of the hypothesis. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also true. A more significant link between the premise and the hypothesis or additional information would be needed to establish a viable connection and determine the truth of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Japanese.

Calne is a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association and he is an Honorary Vice-President of the Cambridge University Lawn Tennis Club . - The endocrine system is the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs. The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen. - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling). - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine. - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland. - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match. - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature. - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\" \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\" \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives. - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living. - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs. Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

Note that the answer may not be present in exact form. At least, that’s the conclusion I draw from looking at the history of corrections of the S&P 500 Index based on daily data going back to December 30, 1949. Now that major indexes have officially entered correction territory, investors are wondering how long corrections tend to last. Let’s start with the worst-case scenario of a bear market. If a bear market is a move of 20% or more from peak-to-trough and a correction is a move of 10% to just under 20%, then the average bear market is a drop of 31.6% (median of 30.3%). I don’t think this is the start of a bear, though. As long as the future trend remains optimistic, the buying will resume. That leads to an even stronger bull market rally. In other words, a stock market correction can help the stock market catch its breath and hit even higher peaks. Most recessions occur with stock market declines of 30 percent or more. All stock market corrections are different, but some follow patterns. The current pattern looks more like 2011 than 1998, with some significant economic differences. All stock market corrections are different, but some follow patterns. How long do corrections last? Corrections generally last two months or less. They usually end when the price of a stock or a bond 'bottoms out'—for example, some will point to a stock reaching a 52-week low—and investors start buying again. How is a correction different from a bear market or capitulation? The stock market typically has a correction several times a year. For example, between 1983 and 2011, more than half of all quarters had a correction. That averages out to 2.27 per year. A stock market crash is when the 10 percent price drop occurs in just one day. Crashes can lead to a bear market. That's when the market falls another 10 percent, for a total decline of 20 percent or more. A stock market crash can cause a recession. The stock market usually makes up the losses in three months or so. If you sell during the correction, you will probably not buy in time to make up your losses. Corrections are inevitable. Is a correction good for the market? Many investors and analysts look at corrections as a necessary 'evil' to cool off an overheated stock or bond market. This is to prevent a huge sell-off or 'bubble burst,' as what happened with Internet stocks in 2000-2001. Definition: A stock market correction is when the market falls 10 percent from its 52-week high. Wise investors welcome it. A pullback allows the market to consolidate before going toward higher highs. Each of the bull markets in the last 40 years has had a correction. It's a natural part of the market cycle. Corrections can occur in any asset class. A correction is a decline or downward movement of a stock, or a bond, or a commodity or market index. The amount of the decline is at least 10 percent and a true correction exceeds that amount. In short, corrections are price declines that stop an upward trend.

The premise says, \\"if you want to go first go ahead\\". It's pretty broad and open-ended, which could apply to a variety of situations, not only games. It might apply to getting in line at a grocery store, asking a question in a meeting, starting a presentation, or literally moving first in any situation. On the other hand, the hypothesis says, \\"If you want to go first at the game go ahead\\". This statement is much narrower. It refers specifically to going first in a game. It could be a video game, a board game, a sports match, or any type of game. To the question of whether the hypothesis is \\"true\\", it's important to clarify that in logical terms, a hypothesis isn't deemed \\"true\\" or \\"false\\". Rather, it might be considered \\"supported\\" or \\"not supported\\". In this case, if the premise allows for anyone to go first in any situation if they want to, then it would also support the more specific case of going first in a game. So, if we look at the situation from the perspective of logical deduction, the specific (hypothetical situation of going first in a game) is contained within the general (premised situation of going first in any context). Therefore, the premise does support the hypothesis since going first in a game falls under the general umbrella of going first in any situation. However, authenticity of the hypothesis also depends on additional context like the rules of the game, whether it's a scenario where one could choose to go first or not, and practical limitations. For highly structured scenarios, like a chess match, typically one player is chosen at random or by rules of the event to take the first move. In conclusion, while the premise \\"if you want to go first go ahead\\" seems to support the hypothesis \\"If you want to go first at the game go ahead\\" in a broad, unlimited scenario, the validity or applicability of the hypothesis in real-world circumstances will depend on a variety of other factors. Hence, it can be said that the hypothesis could be true under certain conditions fitting the premise, but not universally for every case without additional context or conditions."},{"instruction":"Instructions: Two analogies that relate items to the associated containers is given in the form \\"A : B.

The move clears the way for gay marriage to begin in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin, notes the AP, and ripple-down effects in six other states mean that it will now be legal in 30 states and the District of Columbia. In declining to weigh in on the issue, the Supreme Court leaves in place an inconsistent, patchwork approach to gay marriage nationwide, but CNN notes that, with other cases percolating up through the legal system, the refusal is likely only temporary. Only four justices must assent in order to get a case on the court's docket, adds the AP; the justices declined the issue without comment.","output":"Once upon a time, the United States Supreme Court began a new term, a bit like starting a new year at school.

A 41-year-old woman battered her musician boyfriend to death with a guitar stand during a drunken row, a court heard. Samantha Adeokun, from Silverdale, Lancashire, is accused of killing her partner Peter Davegun, 42, in a brutal attack on December 23 last year. Stafford Crown Court heard she flew into a rage and beat her boyfriend by kicking and punching him as he curled up in a ball to protect himself. Samantha Adeokun, 41, from Silverdale, Lancashire, is accused of killing her on/off partner of six years Peter Davegun, 42, (above) by punching, kicking and beating him with a metal guitar stand until he fell unconcious. He suffered multiple injuries to his head and body after also being bludgeoned with a metal guitar stand leaving behind 'a bloodbath', jurors were told. Emergency services arrived at his flat in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, after Adeokun waited one hour to dial 999. She claimed her partner had fallen and hit his head on a TV stand after tripping on a mat. Paramedics arrived just before 2.45pm and found Mr Davegun's body lying in the foetal position on his bedroom floor. The court heard he had extensive bruising and bite marks on his body and had suffered severe internal injuries and seven fractured ribs. He was pronounced dead at the property at around 3.20pm. Adeokun went on trial yesterday accused of murdering her on-off partner of six years following the drunken row. Prosecutor Deborah Gould, opening the case, said: 'The prosecution case says the defendant literally beat him to death using her fists, feet and part of a guitar stand. Stafford Crown Court heard how 41-year-old Adeokun allegedly attacked her partner at his flat in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire (above) on December 23 last year during a drunken row. Mr Davegun died from his injuries. The court heard how Adeokun waited nearly one hour before calling emergency services after the alleged attack. When police arrived, Mr Davegun was found unconscious in a pool of blood and was pronounced dead. 'At least part of the time she was doing this, she was bleeding and standing above him. 'She struck him repeatedly, causing significant internal bruising and bleeding. She struck him from behind and from the front. 'You will hear from the pathologist that there's evidence he was struck while on the ground in the foetal position. 'After the attack, the defendant telephoned her daughter and said she was sorry. She said she and the deceased had a fight. 'She said she had been defending herself and Mr Davegun was, at that stage, unconscious. 'When her daughter asked if she had called 999, the defendant said she hadn't because she needed to get dressed because she had blood on her. 'She changed out of her clothing. Then, nearly an hour afterwards, she called paramedics, claiming Mr Davegun had fallen, hit his head and been unconscious for 40 minutes.' Adeokun denies murdering Mr Davegun and claims he fell and hit his head after tripping on a mat at the flat. The jury also heard a recording of the 999 call Adeokun made during which she described the scene as a 'bloodbath'. She told the operator: 'We had a big argument earlier on and he's just fell. 'I cut my finger and it looks bad. I cut my finger and it looks like I've killed him.' Adeokun denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

During his career, Richard Yates authored seven novels and two short story collections. His final novel, published in 1992, is entitled A Good School. This book, like many of his other works, deals with themes of loneliness, disillusionment, and the unattainable American Dream.

This means that somewhere in your past, you were either witness to or part of a codependent relationship. Through these situations, you were taught that it was wrong to express any needs, wants, or emotions. You may have spent portions of your childhood being called upon to meet the needs of others, which taught you as a child to suppress personal emotional and physical needs as you developed in favor of taking care of a family member. When you left this family environment, you may have continued this pattern within your own romantic and other relationships, which may then get passed on to your children. Another common situation that leads to codependency is a history of abuse. In these situations, if you have been abused, you may become codependent as a way to deal with the trauma of the situation. You may suppress emotions and needs in these abusive situations in favor of focusing on other’s needs. This abuse may have happened during your childhood and continued without intervention from your family. This can also happen in codependent familial relationships. This can be emotional, physical, or sexual abuse. Although codependency issues can occur in any type of relationship or with any person, there are certain types of people that encourage codependent relationships. Codependent relationships often develop between you and a person who needs looking after or taken care of. These types of people include: Those suffering from addiction Individuals with mental health disorders People with chronic illness Another past experience that may lead to codependency is divorce. In situations with divorce, an opportunity may arise when an eldest child has to step into a parental role to pick up the slack for the absentee parent. In these cases, the parenting of the child may produce behaviors of codependency. You may also not want to discuss these difficulties with the remaining parent so as to not upset them. This leads to the repression of emotions and can lead to codependency. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of this would be: Codependent behaviors are learned from our family, like when we see people not share their feelings or needs. Sometimes, kids have to take care of others and don't have time for their own feelings. This can also happen if someone has been hurt or abused. It often happens with some types of people who need help, like those with addiction or mental health issues. Sometimes, when parents get divorced, a child may become codependent if they have to act like a parent for their brothers and sisters. This makes them hide their feelings to not upset the remaining parent."},{"instruction":"Sentence from a movie review: manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun .

As of 2015, the population was 48,210. It is the county seat of Albemarle County, which surrounds the city, though the two are separate legal entities. Charlottesville has eighteen distinctive neighborhoods. It is named after the British Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines the City of Charlottesville with the County of Albemarle for statistical purposes, bringing its steadily growing population to approximately 150,000. Charlottesville is the heart of the Charlottesville metropolitan area, which includes Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene and Nelson counties. - Bella Morte is a gothic band that was formed in 1996 in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA. They incorporate elements of metal, dark wave, deathrock, alternative and synthpop. The band's name means \\"beautiful death\\" in Italian. According to Andy Deane, the name was chosen to \\"suggest that beauty can be found in tragedy\\", which is a theme occurring in every Bella Morte album. - Founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1993, Metropolis Records has developed a strong reputation over the years as a leader in various genres of underground music. Though widely known for electro-industrial, synthpop, future pop, darkwave, and gothic music, the label has always operated with a bent towards all genres of dark alternative music, be it electronics-based or post-punk. - Bleed the Grey Sky Black is Bella Morte 's fourth release on Metropolis Records . It reached # 1 on Metropolis ' pre-order sales in September 2006 . - Dark wave or darkwave is a musical term used for dark, usually gothic rock-influenced music that incorporates synthesizers, or elements of new wave and synthpop, although the term is also applied to post-punk bands that produce a dark atmosphere. The label began to appear in the late 1970s in German music media, coinciding with the popularity of new wave and post-punk. Building on those basic principles, dark wave is used to describe dark, introspective lyrics and an undertone of sorrow for some bands. In the 1980s, a subculture developed primarily in Europe alongside dark wave music, whose members were called \\"wavers\\" or \\"dark wavers\\". - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. - Electro-industrial is a music genre drawing on EBM and post-industrial that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, and other groups, either from Canada or the Benelux. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the \\"dark electro\\" genre, and in the mid-/late-1990s, the \\"aggrotech\\" offshoot. The fan base for the style is linked to the rivethead subculture. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - Deathrock is a subgenre of punk rock incorporating horror elements and spooky atmospherics, that emerged on the West Coast of the United States in the early 1980s. Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'bleed the grey sky black'. Choices: - album - area - assembly - band - building - cinema - city - complex - dance - death - electronics - independent city - intersection - label - line - literature - lyrics - metropolis - metropolitan area - music - music genre - name - new wave - part - performance - population - production - queen - rock - saw - sound - structure - style - subculture - technology - term - tragedy - ville - wave The answer is:","output":"- album"},{"instruction":"You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant.

Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. I am facing a new situation today: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who has less abnormal cells in their body? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, it can be concluded that Charlotte has fewer abnormal cells in her body compared to Jason. As mentioned in the article, cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control due to mutations in the genes that control the cell cycle. This uncontrollable division of cells leads to the development of a tumor, which is a mass of abnormal tissue. In Jason's case, he has been diagnosed with cancer, indicating that he has abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably in his body, forming tumors. On the other hand, Charlotte underwent several tests and was found to have no cancer. While she was diagnosed with high blood pressure, this condition does not indicate the presence of abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably, as is the case with cancer. High blood pressure is a separate health issue that involves the force of blood against the artery walls being higher than normal, which can be due to various factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and diet. Given this information, Charlotte has fewer abnormal cells in her body compared to Jason, as she has not been diagnosed with cancer. It is important for both individuals to seek appropriate medical care for their respective conditions and follow their doctors' recommendations for the best possible outcomes. In Jason's case, this would mean focusing on cancer treatment, while for Charlotte, managing her high blood pressure through lifestyle modifications, medications, or other recommended measures."},{"instruction":"Short movie review: tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The critic is thinking positively about the movie.

So host Mariana van Zeller is accompanied by chef Michael Voltaggio, and their first stop is Palestine, where Israelis and Palestinian Arabs coexist with, at best, unease. Much of the show is devoted to a quick tour of the city, noting areas of particular contention. It’s a great summation for viewers who usually find references like “West Bank” simply confusing. We also see Voltaggio hunting through shops and markets to find food that will be acceptable under the dietary laws of both Orthodox Jews and Palestinians. This in itself provides a fascinating sub-tour of the city. It all builds to the dinner, where guests include both Israeli settlers and Palestinians who want Israeli settlers to just get out. Not surprisingly, the conversation has sharp edges, and no one pretends it will end with a group hug and peace in our time. Still, the dialogue is civil enough to be illuminating, not just angry.

Human waste, also known as black water, includes sewage and wastewater generated from toilets and urinals. The disposal and treatment of such waste on a cruise ship involve a multi-step process that typically includes the following stages: 1. Collection: Human waste from toilets, urinals, and other sanitary facilities is collected through plumbing systems that lead to dedicated tanks or holding areas. These tanks are specifically designed to store black water temporarily onboard and can be constructed from materials such as stainless steel or advanced composites to prevent corrosion and leaks. 2. Treatment: Cruise ships utilize onboard sewage treatment systems to process black water. These systems can vary, but many ships use advanced wastewater purification technologies that cleanse and purify the waste before it is discharged overboard. Some of the primary methods of treatment may include: a. Biological Treatment: This process involves the use of aerobic bacteria that break down organic matter in the waste through anoxic and aerobic digestion. Biological treatment may happen in sequential batch reactors, moving bed biofilm reactors, or membrane bioreactors. b. Chemical Treatment: In some cases, chemicals like chlorine and ozone may be added to the waste to kill harmful pathogens and aid in disinfection. This helps eliminate viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other harmful organisms present in the sewage. c. Physical Treatment: Physical separation methods, such as sedimentation, coagulation, and filtration processes, are used to remove debris, oils, and solids from the waste. Ultrafiltration, microfiltration, and reverse osmosis are common physical processes employed in treating the wastewater. In some cases, the wastewater goes through multiple processes to ensure it's safe to be discharged into the ocean or reused for non-potable purposes onboard. 3. Discharge: Once treated, the purified wastewater can be safely discharged overboard, adhering to international maritime regulations and environmental guidelines. Cruise ships must primarily discharge black water in accordance with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and follow local laws and regulations of the countries they visit. 4. Offloading: In cases where treatment systems are unavailable or not functioning properly, the cruise ship might store the waste in onboard tanks until it arrives at a port. Once at the port, the waste is offloaded and transported to a land-based waste management facility for disposal or further treatment. In conclusion, managing human waste on cruise ships is a complex process that includes storage, treatment, and safe handling while ensuring adherence to environmental regulations and minimizing the impact on marine ecosystems. Modern sewage treatment systems on cruise ships allow for efficient processing and disposal of human waste, significantly reducing the potential for environmental contamination."},{"instruction":"Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist?

You'll get up and turn on the computer newspaper just like switching on the TV. An electronic voice will distribute stories about the latest events, guided by a program that selects the type of news you want. You'll even get to choose the kind of voice you want to hear. Want more information on the brief story? A simple touch makes the entire text appear. Save it in your own personal computer if you like. These are among the predictions from communication experts working on the newspaper of the future. Pictured as part of broader home based media and entertainment systems, computer newspapers would unite print and broadcast reporting, offering news and analysis with video images of news events. Most of the technology is available now, but convincing more people that they don't need paper to read a newspaper is the next step. But resistance to computer newspapers may be stronger from within journalism. Since it is such a cultural change, it may be that the present generation of journalists and publishers will have to die off before the next generation realize that the newspaper industry is no longer a newspaper industry. Technology is making the end of traditional newspapers unavoidable. Despite technological advances, it could take decades to replace news-print with computer screens. It might take 30 to 40 years to complete the changeover because people need to buy computers and because newspapers have established financial interests in the paper industry.

There is no mention of the cost of computer newspapers, making option B incorrect as well. Option D is not supported by the text, as it doesn't discuss the ease of reading traditional newspapers compared to computer newspapers. The correct answer, option C, is based on two points discussed in the article. First, it might take time for the general public to adapt to the idea of replacing traditional newspapers as they need to buy computers and get accustomed to the new way of reading the news. Second, resistance to computer newspapers may be stronger from within the journalism industry due to the cultural change involved. The article suggests that the present generation of journalists and publishers might need to \\"die off\\" before the next generation realizes that the newspaper industry should no longer rely on traditional paper-based newspapers.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

He seems beat down, but his next assignment is an album cover ... with the kissing woman on it! He asks around--who is the kissing album-cover woman? A guy behind the desk says she's not on the payroll. The photographer can't explain how she got into the shoot for the album cover--of a hundred pictures, she's in only one. A guy on a porch hasn't seen her (but tries to set Sonny up with one of his daughters). Sonny goes to look for her at the scene of the kiss. He hears a clarinet played by an older gentleman who sits on a rock by the ocean.

Wolf wants to redeem his father's reputation, but finds that such a feat will be harder than he thought after he encounters hostility from the villagers. Aside from his family, Wolf's only friend is the local policeman Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) who bears an artificial arm, his real arm having been \\"ripped out by the roots\\" in an encounter with the Monster as a child. While investigating his father's castle, Wolf meets Ygor (BÃ©la Lugosi), a demented blacksmith who has survived a hanging for graverobbing and has a deformed neck as a result. Wolf finds the Monster's comatose body in the crypt where his grandfather and father were buried; his father's sarcophagus bears the phrase \\"Henrich von Frankenstein: Maker of Monsters\\" written in chalk. He decides to revive the Monster to prove his father was right, and to restore honor to his family. Wolf uses the torch to scratch out the word \\"Monsters\\" on the casket and write \\"Men\\" beside it. When the Monster (Boris Karloff) is revived, it only responds to Ygor's commands and commits a series of murders; the victims were all jurors at Ygor's trial. Wolf discovers this and confronts Ygor. Wolf shoots Ygor and apparently kills him. The Monster abducts Wolf's son as revenge, but cannot bring himself to kill the child. Krogh and Wolf pursue the Monster to the nearby laboratory, where a struggle ensues, during which the Monster tears out Krogh's false arm. Wolf swings on a rope and knocks the Monster into a molten sulphur pit under the laboratory, saving his son.

The shoes- named Square Eyes- contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day. A wireless transmitter passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves , based on the day's efforts. The design was inspired by a desire to fight against the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, says Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London, UK. \\"We looked at current issues and childhood overweight really stood out,\\" she says. \\"And I wanted to tackle that with my design.\\" Once a child has used up their daily allowance gained through exercise, the television automatically switches off. And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps. Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both. Health experts suggest that a child take 12,000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television. So, every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equals exactly one minute of TV time. Existing pedometers normally clip onto a belt or slip into a pocket and keep count of steps by measuring sudden movement. Swan says these can be easily tricked into recording steps through shaking. But her shoe has been built to be harder for lazy teenagers to cheat. \\"It is possible, but it would be a lot of effort,\\" she says. \\"That was one of my main design considerations.\\" Answer:","output":"Multi-choice question: What is the main feature of the Square Eyes sports shoes, and what inspired their creation?

Vi Ripken was able to scare off the man, who was later apprehended by Aberdeen police, by activating the panic alarm on her key fob. She was uninjured, and the man ran away without taking anything, said Lt. Fred Budnick, an Aberdeen police spokesman. She was approached outside the NBRS branch in the 200 block of W. Bel Air Ave. about 3 p.m., Budnick said. \\"Detectives are looking at what exactly transpired,\\" he said. Jesse A. Bowen, 33, of the 800 block of Lafayette St. in Havre de Grace was charged with attempted armed robbery, attempted armed car jacking, possessing a dangerous weapon, first-degree assault and controlled substance related charges in connection with the incident, police said Wednesday morning. Bowen is being held without bail at the Harford County Detention Center. There was no physical assault and no theft, Budnick said, and employees at the bank called police. The incident was the second in just over a year involving Vi Ripken in Aberdeen, a community known for its low crime rate. \\"It's a little unusual,\\" for her to be the victim of two crimes in a relatively short period, Budnick said, adding that Tuesday's incident \\"appears to be a crime of opportunity.\\" In July 2012, Ripken was taken at gunpoint from her longtime home in Aberdeen, bound and driven around in her car, then released unharmed after about 24 hours. Police have not identified a suspect in that case. In August, the former Orioles great announced a 100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the kidnapper. Earlier this year, Ripken told The Baltimore Sun that her abduction left her worried but that she was determined not to let it ruin her life. Police said Tuesday's incident does not appear to be related to her kidnapping. \\"There is no indication he had any involvement in last year's case. And there's no indication he knew who she was,\\" Budnick said. \\"Right now, it appears to be a crime of opportunity rather than a targeted issue.\\" Detectives investigating the incident thought they were familiar with the suspect from descriptions and were able to put a name with the face and track him down, Budnick said.

In the past, women all over the world had to fight to get the same chance as men in education and jobs. Many people said that women should not receive much education because they would not do as well as men when they went to work. One woman who showed that women should have the same chance was Marie, a scientist. In the 1800s scientists knew that a metal, uranium, gave off radiation. They also knew how much radiation came from his element. But they didn't know what this radiation was like; they wondered why and how uranium gave off radiation. Marie Curie set out to answer these questions. In one of her experiments she was studying a certain material which, she knew, contained uranium, But it gave off 4 times as much radiation as usually does. What could explain this fact? Marie Curie thought that there must be another source of radiation in this material. In 1898 Marie Curie set out to find out this new source of radiation, which she named \\"radium\\". Her husband, who was also a scientist, helped her. They set up a laboratory in an old building behind a school. For four years Curies searched, doing many experiments, And one morning in 1902 Marie found the source of the radiation.

Question: What may happen as the cat is sick ?","output":"When a cat is sick, several things may happen that could impact its health and well-being. These changes can be physical, behavioral, or emotional, and it's essential to monitor them closely and provide the necessary support and veterinary care. Here's what may happen as the cat is sick: 1. Change in appetite: A sick cat may experience a change in appetite, either eating more or less than usual. In this case, the cat has started free-feeding, which means that it eats all of its food over a longer period of time. This change could be due to a loss of appetite and energy or a way to self-regulate and avoid overeating. 2. Weight loss or gain: If a cat's eating habits change while sick, it might experience weight loss or gain. Depending on its condition, this could lead to further health complications and make it challenging to recover. Careful monitoring of its weight and dietary intake is crucial. 3. Lethargy and weakness: Sick cats may become less active and spend more time resting or sleeping. They might be less energetic and show less interest in playing or engaging with their environment. This could be due to fatigue, pain, or discomfort. It's essential to provide a comfortable and quiet space for the cat to rest and recover. 4. Behavioral changes: Illness can cause changes in a cat's behavior, such as increased aggression, irritability, or hiding more than usual. These changes might be a result of pain, stress, or anxiety related to their condition, and it's vital to approach and handle the cat with caution and patience. 5. Gastrointestinal issues: Cats may experience gastrointestinal issues while sick, resulting in diarrhea, constipation, or vomiting. This case mentions the cat taking metronidazole, which is an antibiotic that helps treat gastrointestinal infections caused by certain bacteria and parasites. 6. Compromised immune system: If a cat is sick, its immune system is likely working overtime to fight off the illness, which could mean that it is more susceptible to other infections or illnesses. Ensuring the cat receives proper medications, as prescribed (like the doxycycline and clavamox mentioned), and a healthy diet will aid in the recovery process. 7. Medication side effects: While medication can be crucial in treating a cat's illness, it can also come with side effects. Some cats might experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea from the antibiotics administered. 8. Extra care and attention: As the cat is dealing with a sickness, it's essential to provide extra support, monitoring its health, administering prescribed medications appropriately, and keeping a positive environment for the cat. In summary, a sick cat may experience changes in appetite, weight, energy levels, behavior, and gastrointestinal health. They may need additional care and attention, including medical treatment and adjustments to their living conditions, to help ensure a full recovery. It's crucial to work closely with a veterinarian to manage the cat's health and well-being during this challenging time."},{"instruction":"Translate to French: (4) Paragraph 9(5)(b) of the Regulations is replaced by the following: (b) where the cost is a qualified frontier exploration expense, it shall be reduced by the amount of any credit that has been deducted under subsection 3(3) to determine the royalty payable in a preceding month if that credit includes an investment royalty credit that is calculated on the basis of that expense.","output":"(4) Le paragraphe 9(5)(b) du Règlement est remplacé par ce qui suit : (b) lorsque le coût est une dépense admissible d'exploration frontalière, il doit être réduit du montant de tout crédit qui a été déduit en vertu du paragraphe 3(3) pour déterminer la redevance payable pour un mois précédent si ce crédit comprend un crédit de redevance pour investissement qui est calculé sur la base de cette dépense.

Plot title: Never Cry Wolf Movie plot: A young, naive Canadian biologist named Tyler (Charles Martin Smith) (portraying the real-life biologist Farley Mowat) is assigned by the government to travel to the isolated Canadian arctic wilderness and study why the local caribou population is declining, believed due to indiscriminate wolf-pack attacks. Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by an odd, adventurous bush pilot named Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler and his gear in the middle of a frozen lake in a sub-zero Arctic nowhere. Unsure of where to start, Tyler's indecision quickly imperils him when he runs into a traveling wolf pack until he is rescued by a travelling elderly Inuit native named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who builds a shelter for him.Alone, Tyler's days are divided between research and mere personal survival, while nights are fraught with anxiety-born nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them, slowly dispelling their mutual fears. He and the wolves both begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them.As the spring season arrives and the winter snow slowly melts, Tyler (being a person of procedure) soon discovers the simple, blunt arctic is indifferent to his sense of order. First dealing with sub-freezing weather extremes, ranging from cold snow to warmer heavy spring rains, compromise his shelter, his paperwork duties, his research. Complicating matters further are an invasive horde of Arctic mice when they show up after the spring thaw: they are everywhere, frustrating him and the wolves. Yet the wolves seem to cope with the madness by eating the mice, which Tyler emulates in his own bizarre way to see if an animal can survive on mice alone.During the mild summer season, another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) encounters Tyler, who was sent by Ootek for... My question: The wolf call is played on what A:","output":"A: The wolf call is typically played on a whistle or a diaphragm call. In the movie \\"Never Cry Wolf,\\" wolf calls can be vital to Tyler's interaction and communication with the wolves, especially with George and Angeline. These wolf calls can be used to imitate howling, yipping, and other forms of communication that wolves use to convey messages within their pack or to other nearby wolves. As Tyler continues his research in the Canadian Arctic, he may utilize a whistle or diaphragm call to better understand and observe the behaviors of the wolf pack, ultimately helping him decipher the true cause of the caribou population decline."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a movie review?","output":"A movie review is when someone watches a movie and then shares their thoughts and feelings about it.

The encyclical is subtitled \\"On the Unity of Human Society.\\" It was the first encyclical of Pius XII and was seen as setting \\"a tone\\" for his papacy. It critiques major errors at the time, such as ideologies of racism, cultural superiority and the totalitarian state. It also sets the theological framework for future encyclical letters, such as \\"Mystici corporis Christi\\" (1943). The encyclical laments the destruction of Poland, denounces the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and calls for a restoration of independent Poland. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Pope Saint Pius X, born Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, (2 June 1835 20 August 1914) was Pope from August 1903 to his death in 1914. He was canonized in 1954. Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, promoting traditional devotional practices and orthodox theology. His most important reform was to order the codification of the first Code of Canon Law, which collected the laws of the Church into one volume for the first time. He was also considered a pastoral pope, in the sense of encouraging personal holiness, piety and a daily lifestyle reflecting deep Christian values. He was born in the town of Riese, which would later append \\"Pio X\\" (Pius X's name in Italian) to the town's name. - The Reichskonkordat (\\"Concordat between the Holy See and the German Reich\\") is a treaty negotiated between the Vatican and the emergent Nazi Germany. It was signed on 20 July 1933 by Cardinal Secretary of State (and later Pope Pius XII) Eugenio Pacelli on behalf of Pope Pius XI and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen on behalf of President Paul von Hindenburg and the German government. It was ratified September 10, 1933 and it has been in force from that date right up until the current day. The treaty guarantees the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. When bishops take office Article 16 states they're required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the German Reich established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 \\"Mit brennender Sorge\\" encyclical of Pope Pius XI. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Pope Pius XI, born Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (31 May 1857 10 February 1939), reigned as Pope from 6 February 1922 to his death in 1939. He was the first sovereign of Vatican City from its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929. He took as his papal motto, \\"Pax Christi in Regno Christi,\\" translated \\"The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ.\\" - Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (2 March 18769 October 1958), reigned as Pope from 2 March 1939 to his death in 1958. Before his election to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany (19171929), and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the \\"Reichskonkordat\\" with Nazi Germany, with which most historians believe the Vatican sought to protect the Church in Germany while Adolf Hitler sought the destruction of \\"political Catholicism\\". A pre-war critic of Nazism, Pius XII lobbied world leaders to avoid war and, as Pope at the outbreak of war, issued \\"Summi Pontificatus\\", expressing dismay at the invasion of Poland, reiterating Church teaching against racial persecution and calling for love, compassion and charity to prevail over war. - The Secretary of State of His Holiness The Pope, commonly known as the Cardinal Secretary of State, presides over the Holy See Secretariat of State, which is the oldest and most important dicastery of the Roman Curia. The Secretariat of State performs all the political and diplomatic functions of the Holy See and the Vatican City. - Luigi Maglione ( 2 March 1877 -- 23 August 1944 ) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church . He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1935 and served as the Vatican Secretary of State under Pope Pius XII from 1939 until his death . Pius XII never replaced Maglione , opting to assume the responsibilities of the office himself , with the assistance of two undersecretaries . - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945.

Therefore, when one delves into the features of the Han era, a multitude of questions arise. One such question could be: \\"How did the Han Dynasty contribute to the development of the Silk Road, and what impact did this have on China's relationships with other civilizations both economically and culturally during that period?\\" This question touches upon various key aspects such as the economic, cultural, and political developments during the Han Dynasty. Answer: The Silk Road, a network of trade routes connecting the East and the West, emerged and developed significantly during the Han Dynasty, resulting in profound economic and cultural impacts on China's relationships with other civilizations. Economically, the Silk Road opened up China to an extensive network of overland trade routes, further extending its connections to regions as far as the Mediterranean. A bustling economic hub, the Silk Road became an essential route for transporting Chinese goods, including silk, spices, paper, and porcelain, to the Western world. This not only invigorated the economy of the Han Empire but also interlinked the primitive economies of many Eurasian civilizations through trade. The inflow of various goods from other parts of the continent, such as gold, ivory, textiles, and precious stones, also added to the diversity and vitality of the Chinese market. Culturally, the development of the Silk Road facilitated a tremendous cultural exchange between China and other civilizations. For instance, Buddhism traveled from India to China mainly via the Silk Road, profoundly influencing Chinese philosophy, literature, art, and even daily life. The exchange of technology, ideas, and knowledge thus fostered was immeasurable. This includes advancements in astronomy, medicine, mathematics, and various other sciences. Politically, the Silk Road increased China’s interactions with other political entities, aiding in diplomatic relationships. Many historical records indicate that the Han emperors constantly sent envoys to the West through the Silk Road, strengthening peaceful diplomatic relationships and alliances. In conclusion, the Han Dynasty’s contribution to the development of the Silk Road led to a significant impact on China's economic, cultural, and political ties with other civilizations. It played an instrumental role in not only boosting the economy but also in shaping China's historical, philosophical, and cultural landscape."},{"instruction":"Heavy duty 500kg passenger lift for taxis and ambulances.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules. Question: \\"What detail about the crash of American 11 did White House Senior Advisor Karl Rove not tell the president?\\" Response: \\"The crash was a pilot error\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The correct response should be: White House Senior Advisor Karl Rove did not tell the president that American 11 had been hijacked."},{"instruction":"Rick Davis campaigned for John McCain since he could best support him in office.

Options: - parlor - front porch - rock concert - old folks home - child's room Let's give stream of consciousness first:","output":"A traditional place to have a rocking chair is the front porch. This choice has long been favored for several reasons. The front porch, especially in older homes, was a central gathering place where family members and friends could come together to chat, enjoy the outdoors, and pass the time. The gentle rocking motion of the chair provides a sense of relaxation and comfort, further enhancing the welcoming atmosphere of the porch. The other options mentioned also have some connections to rocking chairs, though they are less traditional placements: 1. Parlor: While parlors were historically used for entertaining guests and hosting social gatherings, a rocking chair is not typically the primary seating choice in such a setting. You would more likely find upholstered or wooden armchairs and couches in a parlor. 2. Rock concert: This is not a conventional setting for a rocking chair, as the loud music and energetic atmosphere do not correspond with the calming nature of a rocking chair. 3. Old folks home: Rocking chairs can be commonly found in senior living facilities or nursing homes, as they can provide a soothing, relaxing effect for elderly residents. However, it is not the most traditional place for a rocking chair, as they are not exclusive to this setting. 4. Child's room: Rocking chairs can be a charming addition to a child's bedroom or nursery, primarily to assist parents in calming a baby or reading bedtime stories to young children. But again, it is not the most traditional place for a rocking chair when compared to a front porch."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Which Supreme Court case in the 1940s was related to the protest that the participants of the Civil Rights Movement at The Greyhound Bus Station at 210 South Court Street in Montgomery, Alabama participated in? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the relevant facts Fact 1: The question refers to a Supreme Court case in the 1940s. Fact 2: The question refers to a protest at The Greyhound Bus Station in Montgomery, Alabama. Fact 3: The protest was related to the Civil Rights Movement. Step 2: Recall the relevant Supreme Court Case To find the relevant Supreme Court case, it is essential to recall key events and landmark cases related to the Civil Rights Movement. One such case is Morgan v. Virginia (1946), which is related to interstate bus travel and racial segregation. Step 3: Identify the connection between the case and the protest The connection between the Supreme Court case and the protest lies in its shared subject of interstate bus travel and segregation. The Morgan v. Virginia case declared segregation on interstate buses unconstitutional, and subsequent protests at bus stations, including the one at 210 South Court Street in Montgomery, Alabama, were related to the enforcement of the court's ruling. Step 4: Answer the question with the identified Supreme Court case The Supreme Court case related to the protest that participants of the Civil Rights Movement at the Greyhound Bus Station at 210 South Court Street in Montgomery, Alabama participated in during the 1940s is Morgan v.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In order to evaluate if the hypothesis \\"If they produce excess that would be bad for our economy\\" can be concluded from the premise \\"we don't want to piss them off and have them over produce and then because then our economy would be pretty bad,\\" we first need to analyze the premise and identify the assumptions and logical connections implied. The premise includes a few key elements: 1. \\"We don't want to piss them off\\": This suggests that we want to maintain good relations with the subject party (\\"them\\"), presumably individuals or entities that have some bearing on our economy. 2. \\"Have them overproduce\\": This implies that if the subject party is angered or upset, they might react by engaging in overproduction – that is, producing goods or services in excess of what is demanded. 3. \\"Because then our economy would be pretty bad\\": The premise ends by asserting that the consequences of overproduction would be negative for our economy, leading to an undesirable situation. Now let's examine the hypothesis: \\"If they produce excess that would be bad for our economy\\". This statement also presents two main points: 1. \\"They produce excess\\": The subject party engages in overproduction, resulting in an excess of goods or services. 2. \\"...that would be bad for our economy\\": The overproduction would have negative consequences for the economy. Comparing the premise and hypothesis, it appears that both involve a situation where \\"they\\" engage in overproduction and that this overproduction would negatively impact the economy. Given the similarities between these points, it is reasonable to conclude that if the premise is true – that is, if we manage to avoid angering the subject party and prevent them from overproducing goods or services, it would be because we believe that this overproduction would be detrimental to our economy as suggested in the hypothesis. While it seems highly plausible that if the premise is true, so is the hypothesis, it must be noted that formal logical validity would require strict logical reasoning. This analysis relies on the basis that the premise and hypothesis share similar elements and concerns without any counterexamples contradicting them. Therefore, based on the available information and interpretations, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. However, actual ramifications and implications may vary considerably depending on the specified context, subjects, and economic factors in the real world."},{"instruction":"In 2013 Peter married Anna Barattin while Julia is married to Nicholas Furiuele , both are members of the band Shantih Shantih .

Answer the above question based on the context below: Shackleton's first task, on arriving at the Stromness station, was to arrange for his three companions at Peggoty Camp to be picked up. A whaler was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the James Caird party were safe.It took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, The Southern Sky, which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some 70 miles (110 km) from their destination. The Southern Sky was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.On reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner Emma. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again. Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the Brunt Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea. After problems arose in identifying this glacier, a nearby ice rise was renamed the McDonald Ice Rumples.By now it was mid-August, more than three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island.

First, let's analyze the original sentence: \\"A person reads a paper with two people standing next to her in front of a group.\\" 1. Subject: A person (given that the pronoun \\"her\\" is used, it's reasonable to assume this person is a woman). 2. Action: Reads a paper (It is not specified whether \\"paper\\" means a newspaper or another type of paper document). 3. Setting: With two people standing next to her in front of a group (This could indicate that there is a group of people observing the scene, and the woman reading the paper has an audience). Now, let's take a closer look at the second sentence: \\"A woman reads a newspaper with two people standing next to her.\\" 1. Subject: A woman (The gender of the person is explicitly mentioned, unlike the original sentence). 2. Action: Reads a newspaper (This specifies that it's a newspaper, which is a subtle difference from the original sentence). 3. Setting: With two people standing next to her (It doesn't mention the presence of a group, a detail provided in the original sentence). The main similarities between the sentences are the subject (a woman) and the action (reading a paper/newspaper). Additionally, both sentences mention two people standing next to her. However, there are specific differences: 1. The original sentence doesn't explicitly mention the gender of the person, but this can be inferred from the pronoun \\"her.\\" In contrast, the second sentence directly states that the subject is a woman. 2. In the original sentence, the woman reads \\"a paper,\\" while the second sentence specifies that she's reading \\"a newspaper.\\" 3. The original sentence mentions a group in front of whom the scene takes place, while the second sentence omits this detail. Given these points, we can conclude that the second sentence is likely true based on the information provided in the first sentence. However, without further context and despite the differences highlighted above, the broad similarity of subject and action between the two sentences indicates that the sentence \\"A woman reads a newspaper with two people standing next to her.\\" is a true sentence."},{"instruction":"Here is a goal: how do you use an ebt card at a grocery store?

The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"As of 2001 , how many attorneys where on full role and how much money would the hike generate?\\" is \\"57,392 on the full roll- 2.6 million raise\\"?","output":"Imagine there is a big group of helper people called lawyers in a place called Illinois. They sometimes need to pay extra money so they can help others who don't have much money, especially when there is not enough money coming from usual sources. So, the top judge and his friends decided to ask the lawyers to pay a little more. In the year 2001, there were 57,392 lawyers who could give this extra money, and if all of them did, they would raise about 2.4 million - that's a lot of money to help others in need!

I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics. Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said. Democrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \\"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are. This is an election to tell the world who we are and what we stand for.\\" What is probably true about the Senate position in Alabama? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. The position has fluctuated throughout the years between Democratic and Republican candidates. B. It has a history of Republican candidates filling that position. C. not enough information D. It has not once been filled by a Democratic candidate. A:","output":"B.

Article: Have you ever wondered how your favorite NBA team received its famous name? All NBA teams have an interesting story or a history behind their names. Some of the names reflect the city's culture or history, others came from previous owners and many were selected through \\"Name the Team\\" contests. For teams like Los Angeles and Utah, the names were not always a reflection of the city. Even though Los Angeles has no lakes, the Laker name has been a city treasure for almost 40 years. Before going to Los Angeles, the team originated in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1948, team officials chose the name for its direct relationship to the state's motto, \\"The Land of 10,000 Lakes.\\" The team name went unchanged after moving to Los Angeles in 1960. Because Utah's team originated in New Orleans, Louisiana, it was called the Jazz. In 1974, New Orleans club officials chose the name to represent the city for its reputation as the \\"jazz capital of the world.\\" The name stayed with the team even after finding a new home in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1979. The Chicago Bull's original owner, Richard Klein, named the team the Bulls. He picked the name because a fighting bull is relentless, and never quits. Klein, who founded the club in1966, believed these qualities were necessary for a championship team and hoped his Chicago athletes would live up to the team name. A belief that Bulls----winner of the six NBA championships have definitely followed. In 1967, the Indian Pacers selected their team name in a different way from most other teams. Their decision was based on what they wanted to accomplish in the NBA. Team officials chose the Pacers name because the organization wanted to set the \\"pace\\" in professional basketball Question: Richard Klein named Chicago's team 'the Bulls\\" mainly because _ . Answer: Select from: 1. he had guessed the success of the team 2. he wished the team to have the qualities of fighting bulls 3. Chicago was then a city famous for fighting bulls 4. people in Chicago used to like watching bull fighting Answer:","output":"2. he wished the team to have the qualities of fighting bulls"},{"instruction":"Some question: Anil can do a work in 15 days while Sunil can do it in 25 days. How long will they take if both work together? Options: (A) 9 3/7 days (B) 9 7/8 days (C) 9 3/8 days (D) 4 3/8 days (E) 9 6/8 days Some stream of consciousness:","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined work rate of Anil and Sunil when they work together. First, let's determine their individual work rates: Anil's work rate is 1/15 as he can complete the work in 15 days. This implies that Anil can finish 1/15 of the work each day. Sunil's work rate is 1/25 as he can complete the work in 25 days. This implies Sunil can finish 1/25 of the work each day. Now, let's combine their work rates to determine their combined work rate when they work together: Combined work rate = Anil's work rate + Sunil's work rate Combined work rate = (1/15) + (1/25) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 25 is 75, so let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator of 75: 1/15 = 5/75 1/25 = 3/75 Now add the fractions: Combined work rate = (5/75) + (3/75) = 8/75 So, together, Anil and Sunil can complete 8/75 of the work each day. Now, to determine how many days it will take for them to complete the work together, we simply need to divide 1 (the entire work) by their combined work rate (8/75): Days to complete work = 1 / (8/75) To divide by a fraction, you multiply by its reciprocal, so: Days to complete work = 1 * (75/8) = 75/8 75/8 can be written as a mixed number: 9 3/8 days Therefore, the correct answer is: (C) 9 3/8 days"},{"instruction":"I can use this background: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. Now, I have a new situation: People in the coastal area naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil has more iodized salt. But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. Answer this question please: Where people are less at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland?","output":"Based on the background information provided, people in coastal areas are less at risk of mental retardation due to iodine deficiency compared to those living in inland areas. This is because the coastal population has access to higher amounts of iodide in their diet from sources like seaweed and saltwater fish, as well as naturally higher iodine content in the soil. On the other hand, inland populations have lower iodine levels in their soil and may not have as much access to iodine-rich food sources, making them more susceptible to iodine deficiency-related conditions such as developmental difficulties, poor thyroid gland function, and mental retardation."},{"instruction":"If \\"A man performing dangerous job duties.\\", can we conclude \\"A tall human performing.\\"?","output":"Well, little buddy, if we say \\"A man performing dangerous job duties,\\" we are talking about a person who is doing some tasks that might be risky or unsafe.

Victoria in Seychelles is the capital of the island nation, but it is much smaller and less known globally compared to Victoria in British Columbia. In Australia, there isn't a specific city named Victoria, but the state of Victoria has Melbourne as its capital, which is a large and significant city. Lastly, Victoria in Texas is a small city located in the southern US state, but it is not widely known and does not hold significant global recognition or status.

Here is a step-by-step reasoning process for eliminating some of the options you provided and identifying the most common relaxation techniques: 1.

Consider \\"listen to music\\" - Listening to music is a widely recognized method for relaxation. People often listen to their favorite songs, calming tunes, or soothing sounds to de-stress and unwind. 3.

Terms like \\"great\\" and \\"loved it\\" indicate an overall positive sentiment. While the reviewer does mention a slight negative, the noisiness, this is dwarfed by the positive aspects and does not take away from the overall impression. The review does not align with the 'negative' label as it contains predominantly positive comments about the food, atmosphere, and service. This means the exposure to negativity is minor and singular, thus should not be taken as a defining factor of the overall sentiment.

To find the number of ways to create a group containing 5 men and 2 women, multiply the number of ways to select the men and the women together: Total ways = 21 (ways to select men) * 3 (ways to select women) = 63 Therefore, the correct answer is: (A) 63."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you will be given a list of numbers.

Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - A coucal is one of about 30 species of birds in the cuckoo family. All of them belong in the subfamily Centropodinae and the genus Centropus. Unlike many Old World cuckoos, coucals are not brood parasites. On the other hand, they do have their own reproductive peculiarity: all members of the genus are to varying degrees sex-role reversed so that the smaller male provides most of the parental care. At least one coucal species, the black coucal, is polyandrous. Some species (\\"Centropus phasianinus\\") have the male investing more in incubation and parental care. Recent DNA evidence suggests that they should be raised to family status, as Centropodidae. - The true koels, Eudynamys, are a genus of cuckoos from Asia, Australia and the Pacific. They are large sexually dimorphic cuckoos which eat fruits and insects and have loud distinctive calls. They are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other species. - Malkohas are large birds in the cuckoo family Cuculidae, all in the genus Phaenicophaeus. The group name is derived from the Sinhala word for the red-faced malkoha; Mal-Koha meaning flower-cuckoo. These are all Asian tropical species. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"phoiniko-\\" \\"crimson\\", and \\"phaes\\" \\"eyes\\" or \\"face\\", referring to the red-faced malkoha. However, the 'œ' was mistranscribed as 'æ'. - The cuckoos are a family of birds, Cuculidae, the sole taxon in the order Cuculiformes. The cuckoo family includes the common or European cuckoo, roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals and anis. The coucals and anis are sometimes separated as distinct families, the Centropodidae and Crotophagidae respectively. - In paleogeography, Gondwana, also Gondwanaland, is the name given to an ancient supercontinent. It is believed to have sutured between about 573 and 510 million years ago (Mya), joining East Gondwana to West Gondwana. Gondwana formed prior to Pangaea, and later became part of it. - Couas are large , mostly terrestrial birds of the cuckoo family , endemic to the island of Madagascar . Coua derives from koa , the Malagasy name for a cuckoo or coua , which is in turn an onomatopoeic of some species ' call notes . Reminiscent of African turacos when walking along tree branches , they likewise feature brightly coloured bare skin around the eyes . Some resemble coucals in their habit of clambering through plant tangles while foraging , while the arboreal species move between tree canopies with gliding flight . Four species occur ( red ) in rainforests while the remaining six are found in the dry forests of western and southern Madagascar . They have large feet , with a reversible third toe like all cuckoos . Their long tibia suggest a relationship with the Carpococcyx ground - cuckoos of Asia , a genus with similar nestlings .

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Paragraph: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.

Question 2: How do I make a multiplayer Minecraft server? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing. Both questions refer to setting up a Minecraft server, with the primary difference being that the second question specifically mentions \\"multiplayer.\\" However, the default purpose of setting up a Minecraft server is to host a multiplayer environment, so the answers to both questions will be quite similar. Setting up a Minecraft server is an exciting project that enables you to host your own multiplayer world for friends, family, or just other players on the internet. By following these steps, you will be well-equipped to create your own Minecraft server: 1. Check system requirements: Before starting, ensure that your computer meets Minecraft's system requirements. Running a server demands more resources than the game itself. The recommended minimum system requirements are: - A recent version of Java (preferably the latest version) - 2 GB of RAM (4 GB or more is recommended for a smoother experience) - A stable internet connection 2. Download the Minecraft server software: Visit the official Minecraft website (www.minecraft.net) and download the server software. Choose the version that matches the game edition you and your friends will be playing. For example, if you want to set up a server on the Java edition, click on \\"Download Minecraft: Java Edition Server Software.\\" 3. Create a folder: Create a new folder on your computer and name it something like \\"Minecraft Server.\\" It can be placed anywhere convenient, but keeping it on your desktop is often the easiest. Move the downloaded server software (minecraft_server.jar) into this folder. 4. Configure the server: Inside the Minecraft Server folder, create a new text document. Open it and paste the following text: - For Windows: java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui - For macOS/Linux: #!/bin/bash cd \\"(dirname \\"0\\")\\" exec java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui Save the file with an appropriate name and the extension \\".bat\\" for Windows or \\".sh\\" for macOS/Linux. For instance, \\"start_server.bat\\" or \\"start_server.sh\\". This will create a script that will be used to start the server. 5. Run the server for the first time: Double-click the script file (start_server.bat or start_server.sh) you created in step 4. This will start the server for the first time and generate additional necessary files and folders within your Minecraft Server folder, such as \\"server.properties,\\" \\"eula.txt,\\" and the \\"world\\" folder. 6. Accept the EULA: Open the \\"eula.txt\\" file, change \\"eula=false\\" to \\"eula=true\\" to agree to the Minecraft server's End User License Agreement (EULA) and save the file. This is mandatory for running a Minecraft server. 7. Customize server settings: Open the \\"server.properties\\" file with a text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit) and modify configurations as desired, such as the game mode and difficulty. For example, to change the game mode to Creative mode, change \\"gamemode=survival\\" to \\"gamemode=creative.\\" 8. Restart the server: Run the script file (start_server.bat or start_server.sh) again to start your Minecraft server with your custom settings. The server console window will open, displaying any commands and server messages. 9. Port forwarding: For other players to connect to your server over the internet, configure port forwarding on your router. The default port for Minecraft is 25565. Consult your router's user manual for specific instructions on how to enable port forwarding. 10. Share the server address: Once the server is up and running, you can share your public IP address with friends and family. They can use this IP address to connect to your Minecraft server. To find your public IP address, you can use a service like www.whatismyip.com. That's it! You've successfully set up a Minecraft server. Join your server by starting the Minecraft game, clicking \\"Multiplayer,\\" and then \\"Add Server.\\" Enter your public IP address, and you're ready to explore your new Minecraft world with others. Remember to periodically save your server worlds and run updates to keep everything running smoothly."},{"instruction":"Solve 1148583*a = 1148360*a - 5352 for a.

The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now.

He starred in over 120 Malayalam films. During his film career, he was primarily an action star and was particularly famous for his macho image and unique style. He was reputed for his chauvinistic appeal and well known for performing stunts of a dangerous nature on his own. On 16 November 1980, Jayan was killed in an accident on the set of the movie Kolilakkam (English: Shockwave). The climactic scene of the movie was being filmed in Sholavaram, near Madras, Tamil Nadu. Jayan always performed his own stunts, and for this movie he was performing a particularly dangerous stunt that involved him boarding an airborne helicopter from a moving motorbike. The shot was accepted by the director in the first take; altogether three shots were filmed. According to the film's production executive, Jayan insisted on yet another re-take as he was not satisfied with its perfection. During the re-take, the helicopter lost its balance and crashed along with Jayan who was hanging onto the landing skids, and he later succumbed to his injuries. After his death was confirmed, a slide was added during the theatre show of his movie Deepam, which was running in packed houses, informing his death to the viewers who witnessed it with absolute shock and disbelief. A large number of his fans burst into tears and ran out of the buildings, while many continued to watch the movie, refusing to believe it and taking it for an ingenious promotion for some upcoming project. Jayan's body was taken to Trivandrum via aeroplane and later it was taken to his home in Quilon, where he was cremated. Thousands paid homage to the late actor, and the police had to take huge measures to deal with the crowds. His mother Bharathiyamma became bedridden after this incident, and she too died two years later.

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"As an AI, I don't sleep. However, I can provide you with a detailed plan for you to maintain a peaceful, undisturbed sleep. Here is the step-by-step plan to minimize distractions: 1. Choose the right environment: Ensure that your bedroom is quiet, dark, and maintains a comfortable temperature to promote sleep. You might want to consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or white noise machines to block out any external noise or light. 2. Establish a bedtime routine: Have a consistent bedtime routine that signals to your body that it's time to relax and prepare for sleep. This can include activities like reading, meditation, or taking a warm bath. 3. Limit exposure to screens: Turn off or keep electronic devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, outside of the bedroom. The blue light emitted from these devices can interfere with your body's production of melatonin, a hormone that aids in sleep. 4. Follow a consistent sleep schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock and can improve the quality of your sleep. 5. Avoid caffeine and alcohol: Limit your intake of caffeine and alcohol, particularly in the hours leading up to bedtime. Both substances can disrupt your sleep cycle, making it more challenging to stay asleep without distractions. 6. Exercise regularly: Engage in regular physical activity to help tire out your body and make it easier to fall asleep. However, try to finish exercising at least a few hours before bedtime to avoid stimulating your body. 7. Manage stress and anxiety: Practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation, to help you unwind before bed. 8. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillow: A supportive and comfortable bed can make a significant difference in the quality of your sleep. Choose a pillow and mattress that suit your preferred sleeping position, keeping your neck, spine, and head aligned. 9. Block out unexpected distractions: If you tend to wake up due to unexpected noises, like a ringing phone or a loud neighbor, consider using a white noise machine, earplugs, or a fan to drown out these disturbances. 10. Consult a healthcare professional: If you continue experiencing difficulty staying asleep despite implementing these steps, it may be helpful to consult a healthcare professional for advice or a sleep study. By following these steps, you should be better equipped to stay asleep without distractions and improve the overall quality of your rest."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Movie plot title: Lawrence of Arabia Movie plot: The film is presented in two parts, divided by an intermission. Part I[edit] The film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him. The story then moves backward to the First World War, where Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant, notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of General Murray, Mr. Dryden of the Arab Bureau sends him to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal in his revolt against the Turks. On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest. Brighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasimâand Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear. Lawrence persuades Auda abu Tayi, the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a blood feud.

In the final days of World War II, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, which had been occupying the Korean Peninsula since 1910. The Soviet forces quickly moved into the northern part of Korea, while the United States, who had been fighting against Japan in the Pacific, moved into the southern part. In order to establish a post-war administration on the peninsula, the United States suggested the 38th parallel as the dividing line between the Soviet-occupied North Korea and the US-occupied South Korea, with the intention that this would be a temporary arrangement until a unified Korean government could be established. This proposal was accepted by the Soviet Union, and soon the peninsula was divided into two distinct zones of influence. North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), was established on September 9, 1948, and was led by Kim Il-sung, who had strong ties to the Soviet Union. Kim had been trained in the Soviet Union and had led a group of guerrilla fighters against the Japanese during World War II. Kim Il-sung aligned the newly established North Korea with a Soviet-style socialist governing system. Under Soviet guidance, North Korea underwent rapid industrialization, collectivization of agriculture, and the establishment of a command economy. The Soviet Union provided financial support, military aid, and technical assistance to North Korea during this period, as well as backing the country's political and economic policies. This close relationship between the Soviet Union and North Korea laid the foundation for the prolonged influence of Soviet ideology and bilateral economic and military partnership. In conclusion, following World War II, North Korea was not controlled by a specific country, but it emerged as a result of the division of the Korean Peninsula between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Soviet Union played a major role in shaping North Korea's political, economic, and military foundations, with Kim Il-Sung, who had strong Soviet support, becoming the country's leader. The influence of the Soviet Union on North Korea lasted for several decades until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, after which the geopolitical landscape shifted dramatically."},{"instruction":"Q: Title: Great book about the history of the Navy Dive Program (Seabee Divers) Review: This is a great book about the Navy's dive program and the different units that encompass this great specialty in the Navy:Combat Photographers, Seabee Divers, MDSU's, and Seals.Excellent job Mr. Lonsdale!

The area, roughly corresponding to the historic region of Greater Poland annexed during the 18th century Polish partitions, was about . For more than a century, it was part of the Prussian Partition, with a brief exception during the Napoleonic Wars. - A grand duchy is a country or territory whose official head of state or ruler is a monarch bearing the title of grand duke or grand duchess. Relatively rare until the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the term was often used in the official name of countries smaller than most continental kingdoms of modern Europe (e.g., Denmark, Spain, United Kingdom) yet larger than most of the sovereign duchies in the Holy Roman Empire, Italy or Scandinavia (e.g. Anhalt, Lorraine, Modena, Schleswig-Holstein). During the 19th century there were as many as 14 grand duchies in Europe at once (a few of which were first created as exclaves of the Napoleonic empire but later re-created, usually with different borders, under another dynasty). Some of these were sovereign and nominally independent (Baden, Hesse and by Rhine, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Saxe-Weimar and Tuscany), some sovereign but held in personal union with larger realms by a monarch whose grand-dukedom was borne as a subsidiary title (Finland, Luxembourg, Transylvania), some of which were client states of a more powerful realm (Cleves and Berg), and some whose territorial boundaries were nominal and the position purely titular (Frankfurt). - The Congress of Vienna (German: \\"Wiener Kongress\\") was a conference of ambassadors of European states chaired by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich, and held in Vienna from November 1814 to June 1815, though the delegates had arrived and were already negotiating by late September 1814. The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other off and remain at peace. The leaders were conservatives with little use for republicanism or revolution, both of which threatened to upset the status quo in Europe. France lost all its recent conquests, while Prussia, Austria and Russia made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west, Swedish Pomerania and 60% of the Kingdom of Saxony; Austria gained Venice and much of northern Italy. Russia gained parts of Poland. The new Kingdom of the Netherlands had been created just months before, and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 became Belgium. The immediate background was Napoleonic France's defeat and surrender in May 1814, which brought an end to twenty-five years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by Napoleon's dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the Hundred Days of MarchJuly 1815. The Congress's \\"Final Act\\" was signed nine days before his final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815. - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - Eduard Heinrich Flottwell ( 23 July 1786 -- 28 May 1865 ; after 1861 von Flottwell ) was a Prussian Staatsminister . He served as Oberpräsident ( governor ) of the Grand Duchy of Posen ( from 1830 ) and of the Saxony ( from 1841 ) , Westphalia ( from 1846 ) and Brandenburg ( from 1850 ) Provinces . He was also Prussian Minister of Finance ( 1844 - 1846 ) and Minister of Interior ( 1858 - 1859 ) . Flottwell was born in Insterburg in the Province of East Prussia ( present - day Chernyakhovsk in Russian Kaliningrad Oblast ) , studied law at the University of Königsberg and entered the civil service at the Insterburg court in 1805 , from 1812 at the East Prussian Regierungspräsidium of Gumbinnen . After the Napoleonic Wars he together with Oberpräsident Theodor von Schön re-organised the administration of the West Prussian province at Danzig . In 1825 he was appointed Regierungspräsident of Marienwerder . When in 1830 the Polish November Uprising led by Micha Gedeon Radziwi broke out at Warsaw in Russian Congress Poland , his brother Antoni Radziwi was dismissed as Duke - Governor of the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen by King Frederick William III and the sole rule passed to Flottwell as the new Oberpräsident . He was a strong supporter of Germanisation and standardised schooling policies , which by some was seen as directed against ethnic Polish Prussians in the region . In 1843 in \`\` Anerkennung der Hilfe nach dem großen Hamburger Brand '' ( acknowledgment after the great Hamburg fire ) , he was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg . - The Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918 and included parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin. - The Partitions of Poland were three partitions of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth that took place towards the end of the 18th century and ended the existence of the state, resulting in the elimination of the sovereign Poland for 123 years. The partitions were conducted by the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and Habsburg Austria, which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures. - The Grand Duchy of Posen was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, created from territories annexed by Prussia after the Partitions of Poland, and formally established following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Per agreements derived at the Congress of Vienna it was to have some autonomy. However in reality it was subordinated to Prussia and the proclaimed rights for Polish subjects were not fully implemented. The name was unofficially used afterward for denoting the territory, especially by Poles, and today is used by modern historians to refer to different political entities until 1918. Its capital was Posen. The Grand Duchy was formally replaced by the Province of Posen in the Prussian constitution of December 5, 1848.

Conan O’Brien may have fewer viewers on his late-night TBS show than he had when he briefly hosted “The Tonight Show” at NBC, but he’s got one thing NBC couldn’t give him: job security. TBS said Monday it has renewed O’Brien’s contract through November 2015. This announcement comes on the heels of multiple reports that NBC is pushing out Jay Leno, who took “Tonight” back from O’Brien during an awkward shuffle in early 2010. O’Brien, whose TBS show runs 11 p.m.-midnight, has a much smaller audience than his broadcast network counterparts Leno, David Letterman on CBS and Jimmy Kimmel on ABC. To date this year, Conan is averaging slightly more than 900,000 viewers, a bit more than a third of the totals for his broadcast counterparts. TBS noted, however, that the median age of O’Brien’s viewers is the lowest on late-night TV, and that’s a prize statistic. “When we invited Conan to come to TBS, we knew he would bring with him a passionately loyal following of young adults,\\" said Michael Wright, president and head of programming for TBS, TNT and Turner Classic Movies (TCM). TBS said O’Brien has also scored big on social media. He “leads the late-night crowd when it comes to online activity and engagement,” said the network, “with the show and its host drawing more than 8.3 million followers on Twitter, 2 million fans on Facebook, 2 million unique users each month on TeamCoco.com and 15 million video views each month on TeamCoco.com and YouTube.” Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Conan O'Brien's TBS Contract Renewed Through November 2015 Amid NBC Late-Night Shuffle\\""},{"instruction":"Title: You must have this guide!!

While contemplating a recording contract, Helm had dubbed the band \\"the Crackers.\\" However, when Robertson and their new manager Albert Grossman worked out the contracts, the group's name was given as \\"the Band.\\" Under these contracts, the Band was contracted to Grossman, who in turn contracted their services to Capitol Records. This arrangement allowed the Band to release recordings on other labels if the work was done in support of Dylan. Thus the Band was able to play on Dylan's Planet Waves album and to release The Last Waltz, both on other labels. The Band also recorded their own album Music from Big Pink (1968), which catapulted them into stardom. On Music from Big Pink, Manuel was the most prominent vocalist and Helm sang backup and harmony, with the exception of \\"The Weight.\\" However, as Manuel's health deteriorated and Robbie Robertson's songwriting increasingly looked to the South for influence and direction, subsequent albums relied more and more on Helm's vocals, alone or in harmony with Danko. Helm was primarily a drummer and vocalist and increasingly sang lead, although, like all his bandmates, he was also a multi-instrumentalist. On occasion, Manuel switched to drums while Helm played mandolin, guitar, or bass guitar (while Danko played fiddle) on some songs. Helm played the 12-string guitar backdrop to \\"Daniel and the Sacred Harp\\". Helm remained with the Band until their farewell performance on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, which was the subject of the documentary film The Last Waltz, directed by Martin Scorsese.

They also mention a “cheesy phone conversation” which they view with disdain. Thirdly, the writer ends on a demanding note - \\"Now prove that you can write\\". This kind of statement often indicates expectation unmet, disappointment or a sense of not being up to the mark, which implies a negative tone. Lastly, the title – \\"Nice Try…Move On\\" – offers an ironic literary device suggesting disappointment and criticism, again reinforcing a negative tone.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) It’s not that 17.8 inches of snow wasn’t enough. But the number that will go down in the history books as Washington’s official total — recorded at Reagan National Airport — is downright paltry compared with some other spots in the region, raising the question: Why the disparity? The reason, it turns out, may be partly due to the improvised technique used by a small team of weather observers at the airport who lost their snow-measuring device to the elements midway through the blizzard. It was buried by the very snow it was supposed to measure. The mix-up, some say, may have kept the blizzard of 2016 from breaking into the region’s top three snowstorms on record, based on accumulations. It has also brought into focus the mechanics of how snow depth is counted and has prompted the National Weather Service to announce it will look into the procedures used at the airport. Mark Richards, senior weather observer at National, stood by the accuracy of the reading Sunday, saying his team did the best it could under tough conditions. But he acknowledged that the team had to abandon the standard measuring process when they lost the tool typically used to tally totals, called a snow board. “We would like it to be as accurate as possible,” Richards said. “… But it’s an inexact science. Everyone has to understand that measuring snow in a blizzard is a tough thing to do.” Susan Buchanan, a National Weather Service spokeswoman, said Sunday that the agency would assemble a team Monday to conduct a “comprehensive assessment of how snow measurements are taken” at National and other locations. She said the agency would make suggestions after its review. [In detail: How much snow fell in the Washington, D.C., region] The National Weather Service has clear guidelines on how to measure snowfall for one simple reason: Snowstorms have a huge effect on the economy, life and property. They cost millions of dollars. How much snow falls may determine whether additional relief is sent into a location after a major storm. The timeline of snowfall on Saturday suggests something was askew at National. At 8 p.m. Saturday, 17.8 inches of snow had been recorded there. Although snow continued to fall until midnight, that was the final measurement that the airport submitted to the National Weather Service. The measurement reflects a 0.3-inch increase in the three hours between 5 and 8 p.m., during which time light to moderate snowfall was being reported at the airport. It also reflects no additional snow accumulation in the four hours after 8 p.m. Significantly higher preliminary snowfall totals were reported at the region’s two other airports. Dulles International recorded 29.3 inches, while Thurgood Marshall-BWI Airport recorded 29.2 inches. Teams at both of those airports used snow boards. Still, Richards, who has been monitoring weather at National for 30 years, said the totals were not that far off from areas in nearby Arlington and Alexandria. Near National, a weather observer trained by the National Weather Service reported 19.4 inches one mile northwest of the airport in the Crystal City neighborhood. At the White House, approximately 3.5 miles north, 22 inches were recorded. Many residents question why Washington’s official weather records are measured at an airport on the river in Virginia, which may not be representative of the weather in the city. “People use National Airport as the weather centerpiece of the entire region, but it’s the warmest location in the entire region,” said Bob Leffler, a retired National Weather Service climatologist . “It’s just not a good site.” The blizzard was the snowiest storm on record at BWI, surpassing the 26.8 inches measured on Feb. 16-18, 2003. It was the second-snowiest storm on record at Dulles, coming in just behind Feb. 5-6, 2010, when “Snowmageddon” overtook the region. [Mr. President, move Washington’s weather observations to the White House] The National Weather Service requires that snow be measured with a snow board, which can be little more than a piece of plywood painted white. The board should be placed on the ground before the storm starts in a location that will be undisturbed by drifting. When the storm starts, snow should be measured every six hours, and then the board should be swiped clear. But once the storm got going Friday night, the board was buried and the observer could no longer locate the board. Instead, he took multiple snow depth measurements and averaged them. This is what was reported to the National Weather Service; it wasn’t snowfall, but rather snow depth. “Snow boards are the standard to use — when you can use them.” Richards said. “Snow boards are just not effective in a storm that has very strong winds its just going to blow off.” But without the use of a snow board, the measurement is questionable. Jim Lee, the meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service in Sterling, Va., said he agrees that if the snow hasn’t been measured by the guidelines, the totals are “perishable.” [Should National remain D.C.’s official weather station?] Leffler, also the author of the Weather Service snow measurement guidelines, said that depending on the density of the snow, the loss of the snow board may have kept the total 10 or even 20 percent too low. That adjustment would push National’s total past 20 inches. It also cannot be compared with the region’s other airports. “I can tell you with 100 percent certainty” that the measurements were performed by the guidelines at Dulles, Lee said. He said he knows this because his office is responsible for those measurements, and they used a snow board and swiped it every six hours.

The storm has stopped, and the cleanup is only beginning — but not without a snowball fight or some sledding first. The Washington region on Sunday lurched fitfully from under one of the heaviest snowfalls in memory, with federal and local governments set to be closed on Monday, the Metro system prepared to offer severely limited service Monday, and authorities warning that it could take days for the plows to reach some residential streets. Metro, which records more than 730,000 rail trips on an average weekday, said it would resume service on a fraction of its operations — partial service on three underground rail lines and 22 bus routes — after being shut down for the weekend by the storm. Virtually all school systems and colleges in the region said they would be closed Monday. The federal government and state and county governments also said they would be closed Monday. [Live updates on Monday as Washington digs out] Authorities urged drivers to stay off the roads and pedestrians to stay out of the streets. They said that digging out from a storm that lasted almost 36 hours and delivered more than two feet of snow in some areas will hobble movement well into the workweek. In addition to paralyzing the region, the storm brought airplane traffic in and out of the region’s three major airports to a virtual halt. Reagan National and Dulles International airports said late Sunday that their runways had been cleared of snow to allow limited operations to resume Monday, but flights weren’t expected to return to normal for days, causing the U.S. House of Representatives to cancel an abbreviated session that was planned from Monday to Wednesday. [The full list of what is closed today] The last of the snow fell in the region around 11:45 p.m. Saturday. Totals ranged from 10 inches to 35 inches and more, with the heaviest accumulation to the north and west of the city, outside the Capital Beltway. The National Zoo in Northwest Washington got 22.4 inches; Hyattsville, in Prince George’s County, got 25 inches; 30 inches fell in Manassas; and Round Hill, in Loudoun County, got three feet. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) asked people to be patient, saying that “getting back to business as usual will take time.” Gregory Johnson of the Maryland State Highway Administration said the state’s primary roadways will be cleared by Monday morning. The secondary roads will still be snow-covered, “with a lot of work to be done.” “I’m pleased with the progress that we’ve made,” said Hogan, reiterating his appeal for drivers to stay off the roads. “We’ve been lucky with no fatalities. We want to keep it that way.” Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and the state’s transportation secretary, Aubrey Layne, toured the hardest-hit areas by helicopter Sunday. McAuliffe said Saturday that snow removal cost the commonwealth 2 million to 3 million per hour. What's the proper technique for shoveling snow? A physical therapist offers specific tips for protecting your back while you dig out this winter. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) “It’s going to be one of the largest snow-removal efforts that we’ve had in Northern Virginia — one of the most expensive — because some of it’s so high,” Layne said. “It’s a lot of snow. It’s just a heck of a lot of snow.” [The final snow totoals, in detail] In the District, police said they would ticket and tow the cars of drivers who venture out and get stuck. “If you come out, you get yourself stuck on one of our streets, I have to tell you: We will aggressively ticket you, and tow your vehicle,” D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said Sunday. “We want to have tomorrow to keep cars off the road so we can continue to clear those major arterials.” Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said the tickets could cost as much as 750, and she warned that people also could be fined for walking in the street. “We’re going to have to start stepping up and being a little more aggressive about asking our public not to be out, walking in the streets,” Lanier said. Metro will open at 7 a.m. with limited service on the Red, Orange and Green lines as follows: The Orange Line will run between the Ballston and Eastern Market stations, the Red Line will run between Medical Center and Union Station, and the Green Line will run between Fort Totten and Anacostia. Trains will run every 20 to 25 minutes, the agency said. Fares will not be charged. Buses will run on what Metro is calling “lifeline service” on 22 lines only, from noon to 5 p.m., every half-hour. D.C. officials said there was no telling precisely how long it will take to clear the snow. “Two feet of snow is a lot to move,” Chris T. Geldart, director of the District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday. “We’re going to be in our response phase for at least 24 to 36 hours, and the recovery phase for much longer than that.” Authorities in Prince George’s County said nearly 80 percent of the county’s main and secondary roads have been plowed. “For the next 48 to 72 hours we need you to be patient with us,” said County Executive Rushern L. Baker (D). “We need at least 24 hours for us to clear the primary streets and secondary roads before we can get into the neighborhoods.” The county government will be closed Monday. “I know people want to get out of your houses and move around, but we need you to stay at home as much as possible,” Baker said. Alexandria closed its streets to all but emergency vehicles Sunday. “With about two feet of snow, we have had 50 percent more snow in the past 36 hours than we typically have all winter,” said Mayor Allison Silberberg (D). “The roads are still treacherous, and the roads will melt a bit each day and then refreeze each night.” Silberberg said Alexandria had cleared virtually all its primary roads by late Sunday and that crews had shifted to secondary roads. She said residential streets would be tackled Monday or later. Montgomery County officials said crews are focusing on plowing primary roads. After that, they will move into the 4,000 lane-miles of neighborhood roads, county spokesman Patrick Lacefield said. [The power surprisingly stayed on across most of the region] “Crews are working around the clock, but we are not just having to plow, we are also having to carry away” loads of snow, Lacefield said. Where to put the more than two feet of snow that accumulated in many areas was a problem for officials, businesses and homeowners alike. In a lighter snow, plowing it or shoveling it aside is relatively easy, but this was too much snow to be shoved to one side. “Where are we going to put it all?” Hampton Inn manager Dorene Sapp said as she looked out from her hotel pavilion just off Leesburg Pike. “We are hoping for some melting but at this rate, I don’t know where it’s all going to go.” Just finding a shovel to dig out cars was a problem at the Sheraton and Hyatt parking lots near Dulles International Airport. Scott Morris, a Dulles Airport police officer who stayed in a hotel rather than driving home to the Shenandoah Valley, was close to digging his car out after a grueling hour. He brought his own shovel, which another guest offered 250 to buy. “I said, ‘At this point, pal, there’s not enough money in your pocket to get this from me,’ ” Morris said. When Ray Atkins’s neighbor, a tax judge, said he was due in court in North Carolina on Monday, the neighbors in the 1500 block of Garfield Street in Arlington went to work. Shovels deployed, six people cleared the three-foot-deep snow from the driveway and sidewalks so that the judge could get out. But while the judge may be able to leave his driveway now, he’s going nowhere else because the block, just off Wilson Boulevard, is packed deep with snow. Even before the snowfall began, Ngozi Johnson knew she’d need a strategy to deal with her daughter’s boredom from being stuck indoors. Thinking back to her own childhood — when she and her siblings would fan out across their neighborhood and help people dig out — Johnson went to Lowe’s and bought two shovels. On Sunday afternoon, with the District buried under two feet of snow, she; her daughter, 13-year-old Nandi Johnson; and her daughter’s best friend, 12-year-old Wendell Wray, hit the streets. “I thought this would probably be the best time to learn the true value of a dollar,” Ngozi Johnson said. [Where Snowzilla fits among D.C.’s top 10 snowstorms] Also recognizing a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity, Noel Lemus, Marcio Cruz and Osmin Fuentes were out at 9 a.m. Sunday with snow shovels ready. “We’ve been doing this for five years,” said Lemus, who said the men worked as electricians but shoveled snow on weekends as a side job. Lemus said he grew up in El Salvador and then spent 18 years in Southern California before seeing snow for the first time in Washington about six years ago. Asked whether he ever thought he’d be shoveling snow, he shrugged. “It’s just like the work in my home country,” he said. But it doesn’t snow in El Salvador, he was reminded. “No, but shoveling the dirt is the same.” It was shoveling with a deadline for many people, including Brian Boxman of North Potomac. He also wanted to be done digging out by 2:59 p.m. so he could get settled in front of his big-screen TV for the AFC Championship match between the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos. His vision of the game, a beer and maybe nachos, kept the snow flying. “I’m under pressure,” he said as game time neared. Meanwhile, the number of people who died as a result of the storm increased. A Leesburg man had a heart attack and died early Sunday morning while trudging through waist-deep snow in an attempt to go home after working at a convenience store that had stayed open through the storm, police said. The man, whose identity has not been released, was in his 50s and collapsed around 2 a.m., police said. A resident saw him fall into the snow, called 911 and pulled the man inside a nearby home. Emergency responders were unable to revive him. “If the gentleman had been walking home on a sunny day, he probably would be alive,” said Leesburg police Lt. Brian Rourke. The man had tried to drive home after his shift at the convenience store, in the 700 block of Fieldstone Drive NE, but he abandoned his car after it got stuck and tried to walk the rest of the way home, Rourke said. Virginia authorities have attributed at least four other deaths to storm-related causes, and the storm had claimed at least 19 other fatalities nationwide as of Sunday morning. Other deaths included traffic fatalities, those from heart attacks while shoveling snow and two hypothermia deaths. One shoveling death was that of a 49-year old man from Abingdon, Md., northeast of Baltimore. ||||| A massive snowstorm descended on Washington, D.C., this weekend. | AP Photo Capitol police officer dies shoveling snow United States Capitol Police Officer Vernon Alston died of a heart attack on Saturday while he was shoveling snow at his home, according to an email sent to congressional officials by U.S. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine.

Story Continued Below Alston was pronounced dead on Saturday, the U.S. Capitol Police confirmed. “The death of Officer Alston is truly a tragic loss for the Alston family and the United States Capitol Police, which in fact is one in the same,” Dine said in the statement. “Officer Alston was someone who loved his job, and his loss leaves a huge void in the hearts of all of the men and women at the USCP.” Alston worked on the House Division of the Capitol Police and last worked on Friday, when a massive winter storm began descending on the Washington area. Congressional leaders expressed grief on Sunday morning upon hearing of Alston's death. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urged the congressional community to \\"all hold his family in our thoughts. He will be missed, but his service and dedication will no doubt be remembered by all who knew him.\\" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said in a statement: \\"I'm saddened to learn that the U.S. Capitol Police has lost one of our own over the weekend as a result of the storm. For 20 years, Officer Vernon Alston was a fixture on the Capitol grounds while keeping the community safe. I am always grateful for the dedication and sacrifice of the Capitol Police force and Officer Alston was an exemplar of that. My thoughts are with Officer Alston's family during this difficult time.\\" Rachael Bade contributed to this report. ||||| The House will be out of session this week due to “the severity of the winter storm in the D.C. area,” according to an email sent to lawmakers on Sunday.

Weather observers at the airport reported a snow total of 17.8 inches, which some have argued is significantly lower than measurements taken at nearby locations during the same period. It has emerged that the weather observers had to abandon their usual measuring process when the snow-measuring device they were using was buried in the snow they were attempting to measure. The National Weather Service (NWS) will now conduct an assessment of the snow measurement procedures used at the airport and may make suggestions for improvements."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, raspberries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apples or plums? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, the fruits Mary decided to candy were raspberries, apricots, and apples.

Context: I have been married twice. My wedding experiences were both very different, even though I cried at both ceremonies. At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance.

Question: suppose less snow on mountains happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The relationship between less snow on mountains and an increase in aluminum cans being recycled may not be apparent at first glance, but it ties in with larger environmental and socio-economic factors. The decrease in snow on mountains could be attributed to climate change, which in turn could influence how society views recycling and its importance in mitigating the aforementioned environmental issues. Less snow on mountains can have several consequences that might indirectly lead to more aluminum cans being recycled: 1. Shift in public perception: An increase in visible effects of climate change, such as less snow on mountains, may raise public awareness about the environmental consequences of human activities. This heightened awareness could, in turn, encourage more people to recycle, including aluminum cans, to reduce their ecological footprint. 2. Government policies and initiatives: As the impact of climate change becomes more evident, government policies may shift towards promoting recycling and reducing the use of single-use items. This could lead to new laws, tax breaks, or subsidies that encourage companies and individuals to take part in recycling efforts, leading to more aluminum cans being recycled. 3. Corporate responsibility and consumer behavior: With the growing demand for environmentally responsible products and practices, companies may shift their focus to using more sustainable materials and methods. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their purchases, which can encourage companies to prioritize recycling initiatives, again contributing to more aluminum cans being recycled. 4. Environmental consequences leading to further climate change: Less snow on mountains could alter water resources and increase temperatures, leading to disruptions and a potential increase in extreme weather events. These events could, in turn, exacerbate environmental issues and accelerate the need for more robust recycling schemes, including the recycling of aluminum cans. Overall, the reduced snow on mountains can lead to an increase in the recycling of aluminum cans due to a heightened awareness of climate change, government policies promoting recycling, corporate responsibility trends, and potential exacerbation of environmental issues. It is essential to recognize the interconnectedness of these factors and their collective influence on recycling practices."},{"instruction":"Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red and ultra-violet rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn.

Step 1: Find the combined length of the train and the bridge The length of the train is 260 m, and the length of the bridge is 140 m. So, the combined length is: 260 m + 140 m = 400 m Step 2: Convert the speed of the train from km/h to m/s The speed of the train is given as 45 km/h. To convert this to m/s, we'll multiply by (1000 m/km) and divide by (3600 s/h): 45 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 12.5 m/s Step 3: Calculate the time using the formula time = distance / speed Now that we have the combined length (distance) and the speed, we can find the time: time = 400 m / 12.5 m/s = 32 s The answer is (B) 32 seconds."},{"instruction":"Information: - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd.

But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set.

Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.[5] Taylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to...

Here are possible answers to this question: - reproduction - junior - copy - derivative - remake I believe the correct choice is \\"remake\\", here's why:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"remake.\\" A remake refers to the process of creating a new film or movie based on an existing one, with the purpose of updating, adapting, or reinterpreting the original content for a contemporary audience. Unlike other options presented, a \\"remake\\" directly indicates the production of a film inspired by another movie in the context of the entertainment industry. Let's briefly go through the other options to clarify why \\"remake\\" is the most suitable choice: - Reproduction: This term is too broad and can be applied to various forms of media, and it generally implies making an exact copy, rather than reinterpreting or updating the original content. - Junior: This term isn't applicable to the entertainment industry when describing reproductions of movies. It may be used in different contexts to indicate something younger or less experienced. - Copy: Similar to \\"reproduction,\\" a copy implies creating an exact duplicate of the original. This term does not convey the idea of updating or reinterpreting the content for a new audience. - Derivative: This term refers to something based on or derived from another source and isn't specific to movies. While a remake can be considered derivative, it doesn't precisely capture the concept of a new film version based on the original.

The military has entered the political discourse days before Venezuela's election, prompted by the defense minister's claim that Capriles plans to \\"dismantle\\" the country's armed forces. Gen. Henry Rangel Silva made the argument Tuesday in a TV interview, after Capriles announced that an active general had agreed to be his defense minister. Capriles didn't name the general, but Rangel said he didn't believe any Venezuelan general would betray President Hugo Chávez's socialist government by accepting the appointment. “He (Capriles) says he is going to appoint an active general as his Defense Minister (…) How can he say he is going to appoint an active general when his government plans to dismantle the Armed Forces?\\" Rangel said in Spanish, as quoted by Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional. \\"I don’t think there is one single active general willing to dismantle the Bolivarian Armed Forces.” Venezuela's military is constitutionally neutral but Chávez has packed its leadership with loyalists. That has raised questions about whether the armed forces would stay put if the results of Sunday's elections end up jeopardizing Chavez's rule. Retired general and former defense minister Fernando Ochoa Antich, a strong Chávez opponent, said General Rangel's claims are 'extremely serious\\" and 'threaten the country's institutionalism.' \\"Does this mean that if Capriles wins, the Venezuelan Armed Force will not acknowledge his victory?\\" Ochoa Antich said in Spanish. \\"I don’t think the military institution would go along with such an adventure.” Experts remain unsure themselves over how much of Venezuela's 115,000 military and national guard personnel are made up of so-called Chávez loyalists. \\"The military remains pretty professional especially at the low level and mid level ranks, and should back whoever wins,\\" said Adam Isaccson, senior associate for Regional Security at the Washington Office of Latin America, to Fox News Latino. But concern over violence and unrest after an election in Venezuela has never been higher. Right-leaning Capriles is Chávez's toughest challenger in the 14 years he's been in power. Polls indicate a dead-heat race, as the Chávez campaign has had to deal with national doubts over his health, a fledgling economy and an increase in crime. Barring a commanding win, both candidates are sure to challenge the results of the election and that has experts like Isaccson concerned about a Venezuelan military that may have to confront a heavily armed civilian population in the streets -the citizen militias that so far have been mostly supportive of Chávez. \\"Ultimately, the electoral tribunal is going to have to decide on a winner,\\" he said. \\"And the military is going to have to back that decision, but they maybe confronting a huge portion of the population.\\" Leading the more heavily armed citizen population, Isaccson said, are Venezuela's citizen militias who could clash with the professional military if presidential election results are disputed. \\"The biggest concern is 150,000 citizen militia members that Chávez has setup all around the country that are pretty overtly politicized,\\" Isaccson told Fox News Latino. \\"They are armed and they have some training.\\" Defense spending has actually gone down under Chávez. Defense spending accounted for about 1.1% of its GDP, on average, from 2007 to 2011, compared to about 1.5% from 1994-1998, the five years preceding Chávez's rise to the presidency, according to figures from the World Bank. Venezuela maintains about 115,000 military personnel on active duty, including the National Guard, according to Military Periscope. Since 2006, the U.S. has labeled Venezuela as not fully cooperative on anti-terrorism, an action that bans the sale or license of U.S. defense articles or services to Venezuela. Venezuela has about 20 U.S. built F-16 fighters and, according to a Reuters report, have fallen into disrepair. The president has used this as an argument in turning to Russia and China for new equipment. Russia has been by far Venezuela's largest arms supplier over the past five years (2007-2011), delivering more than 2 billion during that time, followed by Spain at 259 million and China at 218 million, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Weapons delivery totals differ from purchase agreements, which can be spread across several years. From 2005-2009, Venezuela agreed to purchase more than 6 billion of arms from Russia, including at least 24 Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets, 50 military helicopters, 100,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles, a license to build a factory to produce Kalashnikov rifles in Venezuela, and several submarines, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Typically, corn grown on good soil yields 400 bushels per acre, but in clay-rich soil, the yield is only half as much per acre as in good soil. One-third of Jorge's 60 acres of land is clay-rich soil and the rest is good soil. How many bushels of corn did Jorge's land yield last year? Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"To answer the question, we need to determine the number of acres of good soil and clay-rich soil, then calculate the yield for both types of soil separately and finally add them up to get the total yield. First, let's find out how many acres of good soil and clay-rich soil Jorge has: - Jorge has 60 acres of land in total. - One-third of this land is clay-rich soil, so (1/3)*60 = 20 acres. - The remaining acres are good soil, which is 60 - 20 = 40 acres. Now let's calculate the bushels of corn produced on both types of soil: 1. Good soil: - Jorge has 40 acres of good soil. - The yield on good soil is 400 bushels per acre. - Therefore, the total yield on good soil is 40 acres * 400 bushels/acre = 16,000 bushels. 2. Clay-rich soil: - Jorge has 20 acres of clay-rich soil. - The yield on clay-rich soil is half that of good soil, so it produces 400 bushels/acre * 0.5 = 200 bushels per acre. - Therefore, the total yield on clay-rich soil is 20 acres * 200 bushels/acre = 4,000 bushels. Lastly, we add the yields from the good soil and clay-rich soil to find the total yield: Total yield = 16,000 bushels (good soil) + 4,000 bushels (clay-rich soil) = 20,000 bushels. So, Jorge's land yielded 20,000 bushels of corn last year."},{"instruction":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What moves horizontally?\\" is in \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers.

Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field.

Bordeaux has a long and esteemed history in the world of wine, and its incredible offerings have placed it at the forefront of wine production and appreciation. In this discussion, we'll look into the noteworthy aspects and qualities of Bordeaux wines. First, let us look at the Bordeaux wine region. Situated in the southwest of France, Bordeaux is one of the most significant wine-producing areas in the world. The region has a unique climate characterized by the maritime influences of the Atlantic Ocean, which combines with multiple soil types to create a diverse range of wines. The area covers over 100,000 hectares of vineyards and produces approximately 960 million bottles per year. The Bordeaux region is renowned for producing outstanding red wine blends, which often consist of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, and Malbec. It's important to note, however, that Bordeaux also produces high-quality white and sweet wines, most notably using Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon, and Muscadelle grape varieties. Now, let's delve deeper into what makes Bordeaux wines great and stand out. A significant factor is the extreme diversity of the wines produced in this region. Bordeaux is divided into several key sub-regions, each with its own distinct terroir, which refers to the unique combination of soil, climate, and topography that shapes a wine's character. These sub-regions include Médoc, Graves, Saint-Émilion, Pomerol, and Sauternes. 1. Médoc: Located on the Left Bank of the Gironde estuary, Médoc is known for its exceptional Cabernet Sauvignon-based red wines. Its well-draining gravelly soils contribute to the growth of robust, full-bodied, and age-worthy wines, with notable appellations such as Pauillac, Margaux, and Saint-Estèphe producing some of the world's most sought-after bottles. 2. Graves: Also situated on the Left Bank, Graves is recognized for both its red and white wines. Blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the red wines are elegant and complex, while the white wines combine Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon to create a vibrant and refreshing taste. The famous sweet wine appellation, Sauternes, is also part of the Graves sub-region. 3. Saint-Émilion: A prominent appellation located on the Right Bank of the Bordeaux region, Saint-Émilion wines are primarily Merlot-based, yielding a smoother and more approachable profile. The sub-region is also recognized for producing red wines with a diversity of styles, from fresh and fruity to complex and opulent, thanks to its diverse soil types and excellent winemaking techniques. 4. Pomerol: A small appellation on the Right Bank, Pomerol is famous for its rich, velvety, and intensely flavored Merlot-based wines. With a clay-heavy terroir and relatively limited production, Pomerol wines boast a unique character, making them highly sought-after by wine enthusiasts. All these factors - the diverse terroir, the blend of grape varieties, and the exceptional winemaking traditions - contribute significantly to the greatness of Bordeaux wines. The region's producers are committed to upholding the highest standards of quality, leading to a prestigious reputation. As a result, wine connoisseurs worldwide continue to cherish Bordeaux wines as some of the best in the world."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question.

The best way to polish furniture depends on the type of material it is made of, such as wood, metal, or glass. However, in this guide, we will focus primarily on polishing wooden furniture, as it is the most common type. Below are the steps you should take to effectively polish wooden furniture: 1. Evaluate the furniture: Before you begin polishing, it's important to determine the type and finish of your wooden furniture. Look for any manufacturer's labels or tags that may indicate the type of wood, finish, or care instructions. 2. Choose the right polish: Select a furniture polish that works well with the type of wood and finish of your furniture. Different wood polishes may contain natural oils like lemon, tung, or linseed oil, or synthetic ingredients like silicone or petroleum distillates. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations or consult with a furniture specialist if you're unsure. 3. Gather your supplies: Some items you will need for polishing furniture include: - Furniture polish - Soft, lint-free cloth, microfiber cloth, or cheesecloth - Clean, dry cloth for buffing - Cotton swabs or a soft toothbrush for detailing - Gloves for protecting your hands 4. Clean the furniture: Before you apply the polish, it's essential to remove dirt, grime, and dust from the surface. Use a soft, lint-free cloth dampened with water or a gentle furniture cleaner to wipe down the surface thoroughly. Make sure to cover all areas, including corners and crevices. Allow the furniture to dry completely before proceeding to the next step. 5. Apply the polish: Pour a small amount of the furniture polish onto a soft, lint-free cloth or directly onto the surface, depending on the manufacturer's instructions. Use a circular motion to apply the polish to a small section of the furniture at a time. This ensures even coverage and prevents streaks. 6. Work in details: For the intricate parts of the furniture, such as carvings or edges, use cotton swabs or a soft toothbrush to apply the polish. This allows you to reach tight spots and prevents excess polish from building up in crevices. 7. Allow the polish to dry: Allow the furniture polish to dry according to the manufacturer's recommended drying time, which typically ranges from a few minutes to half an hour. Do not skip this step, as drying allows the polish to soak into the wood and provide protection. 8. Buff the furniture: Once the polish is dry, use a clean, dry cloth to buff the furniture. Use long, circular strokes to gently rub the surface until it shines. Work one section at a time to ensure an even and consistent shine across the entire piece of furniture. 9. Regular maintenance: To keep your furniture looking its best, establish a regular polishing schedule. Every few months, go through the process of cleaning, applying polish, and buffing to maintain the appearance and protective qualities of the polish. 10. Additional tips: - Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives on your wooden furniture to prevent damage. - Do not over-polish your furniture, as excessive polish can cause a build-up that can dull the finish. - Keep your furniture out of direct sunlight and maintain a consistent indoor environment (temperature and humidity) to preserve the wood. By following these steps and regularly maintaining your furniture, you can preserve its appearance, protect it from damage, and extend its life. Remember to always use the appropriate polish for your specific type of wood and finish to achieve the best results."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.

Given the context: What does Aubrey need to do before this? Possible answers: walk to the well, receive water to their well, help their family","output":"Before Aubrey can fill their jug with water from the local well, there are several steps that they must undertake to ensure that the process is carried out efficiently and safely. Some of these steps include the following: 1. Preparing the water jug: Aubrey must first find a clean, empty jug that is suitable for carrying water. They may need to clean the jug if it has been used previously or if it has been stored for a period of time. Ensuring that the jug is clean will help to prevent contamination of the water. 2. Checking the water quality: Aubrey should find out if the local well is providing clean and safe water. They can do this by talking to their neighbors, community members, or local health department to ensure there have been no recent reports of water pollution or contamination. 3. Plan the walk to the well: Aubrey should consider the distance to the well, the size of the water jug they will be carrying, and the terrain of the path to the well. Planning the route and timing can help Aubrey arrive at the well when it is not too crowded, which makes the process more efficient. 4. Preparing for physical activity: Walking to the well with an empty jug is relatively easy, but carrying a full jug of water can be physically demanding. Aubrey should wear comfortable shoes, and dress in weather-appropriate clothing to ensure they are protected from the elements. If the jug is large and heavy, Aubrey may also consider using a wheeled cart or another form of assistance for transporting the water. 5. Checking the weather: Aubrey should check the weather forecast before heading out to the well. If there are any possible rainstorms or extreme temperatures predicted, it may be better to postpone the trip to the well and find an alternative means of obtaining water. 6. Discussing with family: Aubrey may need to inform their family of their plans to collect water from the well. This is particularly important if there are specific family responsibilities or tasks that Aubrey is also responsible for completing. By communicating with their family, Aubrey can ensure that there are no conflicts with other family members' schedules or needs. In conclusion, before filling their jug with water from the local well, Aubrey needs to ensure that the water is safe for consumption, plan and prepare for their walk to the well, check the weather forecast, discuss their plans with their family, and prepare the water jug itself. Taking these steps will help to make the process of obtaining water from the well a smooth and successful endeavor."},{"instruction":"John makes 60 a week from his job.

Possible A: scheme, elephant, chess game, north carolina, chess set Why is \\"chess set\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Chess set\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons, which are explained in detail below: 1. Context: The question specifically mentions the \\"pawn,\\" which is a piece in the game of chess. A pawn is one of eight small game pieces used by each player and is an essential part of a chess set. 2. Relevance: When hand-carved pawns are mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that the context refers to a beautiful and intricate chess set, rather than individual game pieces. Therefore, a finely hand-carved pawn directly points to the craftsmanship and uniqueness of a chess set. 3. Logical connection: The other possible answers provided (scheme, elephant, chess game, North Carolina) lack a logical connection to the information given in the question. While chess game refers to the actual gameplay rather than the physical components, the other answers are unrelated to the question and do not align with the context provided. a. Scheme - Refers to a plan or strategy and does not relate to the craftsmanship described in the question. b. Elephant - While an elephant is an animal and could potentially be used thematically in a chess set or carved from a material like ivory, the actual question refers to a pawn, not an elephant. c. North Carolina - This is a geographical location and does not bear any relation to the hand-carved pawn or a chess set. 4. Consistency with reality: Chess sets are commonly crafted using various materials and techniques, and a hand-carved chess set is not an uncommon item. It can be a desirable and valuable possession due to the dedication, attention to detail, and artistic skill required to create it. Thus, \\"chess set\\" is an answer that adheres to common human experiences and expectations. In conclusion, \\"chess set\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense as it logically connects the carved pawn to its origin and purpose, remains consistent with the context provided, and adheres to what is generally known about chess sets in reality. The other options lack relevance, context, and validity, making \\"chess set\\" the appropriate choice that would resonate with most people's understanding of the subject."},{"instruction":"Read this: In response to Cusumano's perspective, Screen Producers Australia executive director Matt Deaner clarified the motivation of the film industry: \\"Distributors are usually wanting to encourage cinema-going as part of this process [monetizing through returns] and restrict the immediate access to online so as to encourage the maximum number of people to go to the cinema.\\" Deaner further explained the matter in terms of the Australian film industry, stating: \\"there are currently restrictions on quantities of tax support that a film can receive unless the film has a traditional cinema release.\\" Who made unclear the motivations of the filmmakers?

To fully understand the significance of Medoc in the story, it's important to first comprehend the plot and characters. The story is set in an unnamed Italian city during the carnival season and is narrated by Montresor, who seeks to exact his revenge on another character, Fortunato. Montresor believes that Fortunato has insulted him, and therefore, plans to murder him in a calculated and cold-blooded manner. He uses Fortunato's pride and love for wine to lure him into his family's underground catacombs, where he claims to have a cask of Amontillado, an extremely rare and valuable sherry. Medoc comes into scene when, during their journey through the catacombs, Montresor offers a bottle of Medoc to Fortunato, who is already visibly inebriated. Fortunato accepts the wine without hesitation, further clouding his judgment, and continues to follow his soon-to-be murderer deeper into the catacombs. It is evident that Montresor uses Medoc to manipulate Fortunato and ensure he remains inebriated enough not to resist or suspect anything. The role of Medoc in the story highlights Poe's use of irony and symbolism. While Fortunato is an expert in wines, he is unable to recognize the true intentions of Montresor, whose name itself means \\"my treasure\\" in French, hinting at the sinister aspect of his character. Montresor manipulates Fortunato's expertise in wine and his personal vanity while effectively using Medoc to keep him intoxicated and unaware of the impending danger. In conclusion, Medoc's mention in \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" represents an essential element that contributes to the story's chilling and macabre atmosphere. It serves as both a symbol of Fortunato's weaknesses and a tool used by Montresor to manipulate and control him, ultimately leading to a tragic and horrifying end."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Portuguese.

Jeff Davis, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet in Japan. Davis said Tuesday that for the second time, U.S. helicopter crews have been exposed to elevated, albeit low, levels of radiation during flights near Japan's nuclear reactors. In addition, the Navy is moving three incoming ships to a new location because of \\"radiological and navigation hazards\\" at their intended destination on the eastern coast of Honshu, according to Davis. Just as in an incident on Sunday, the crew members were stripped of contaminated clothing, scrubbed down with soap and water and tested. In all cases, they no longer tested positive for radiation exposure. On Sunday, tests detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 U.S. Navy helicopter crew members when they returned to the USS Ronald Reagan after conducting disaster relief missions in Japan, the military said Monday. No further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water, the Navy said. Nevertheless, the U.S. 7th Fleet has temporarily repositioned its ships and planes away from the damaged multi-unit Fukushima nuclear plant. The Navy, however, noted that the most radiation that ship personnel could have received was less than they would receive in a month of exposure to natural radiation sources, such as the rocks, soil and sun. \\"This will continue to happen,\\" Davis said. He did not know how many personnel tested positive for radiological contamination in the second incident nor what ships they were on. Most of the nine U.S. Navy warships now operating off Japan are involved in helicopter operations. For example, the USS Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group flew 29 sorties on Tuesday and delivered 17 tons of supplies, including food, water and blankets. The USS Tortuga is transporting 300 Japan Ground Self Defense Force personnel and 90 vehicles. Officials expect that air crew members will continue to be exposed to increased low levels of radiation, so the Navy is telling helicopter crews to keep their sleeves rolled down and keep cabin windows closed when possible. And some air crew members, Davis said, have been given potassium iodide pills. The iodide protects a person's thyroid gland from the effects of radioactivity and can reduce the threat of thyroid cancer. U.S. Navy spokesman Capt. Danny Hernandez said the iodide pills were given as a \\"precautionary measure only.\\" The U.S. Army's Camp Zama, about 25 miles outside Tokyo, is also taking steps in light of the potential radiation threat. According to messages posted on U.S. Army - Japan's official Facebook page, health officials have been taking \\"environmental radiation readings every 3 hrs\\" since Monday. \\"All readings taken to date have indicated absolutely no health risk to our community,\\" the message read. Nonetheless, the message noted that readings showed \\"negligible levels\\" that require the implementation of \\"mitigating measures,\\" including limiting outdoor activities, leaving windows closed and keeping children inside for playtime and school recess. The radiation exposure appears limited to Navy personnel. Representatives for the Marines and Air Force said they have not seen reports of anyone in their services testing positive for exposure. The Navy has three ships with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit on their way to Japan. They are expected to arrive on March 17. Out of concern about radiation, those ships, the USS Essex, USS Harpers Ferry and USS Germantown, will now position in the Sea of Japan on the west coast of Honshu, rather than the east coast, to aid in disaster relief. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1.

The first of several DC characters to bear the name Sandman, he was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Bert Christman. Attired in a green business suit, fedora, and gas mask, the Sandman used a gun emitting a sleeping gas to sedate criminals. He was originally one of the mystery men to appear in comic books and other types of adventure fiction in the 1930s but later was outfitted with a unitard/cowl costume and developed into a proper superhero, acquiring sidekick Sandy, and founding the Justice Society of America. Dodds has prophetic dreams which come to him as cryptic, ambiguous visions of crimes. Originally of unexplained origin, these dreams were later ascribed to encounter between Dodds and the entity known as Dream via retcon. The visions haunt Wes, who uses his keen intellect and amateur detective skills to properly interpret them. He is also a talented chemist and inventor, creating the sand-like substance and the Silicoid Gun ultimately responsible for transforming Sandy the Golden Boy into a Silicon-based life-form. In the early years of his career, Wesley Dodds possesses the strength level of a man who engages in regular exercise, and was a fine hand-to-hand combatant. As he grows older, his strength level diminishes in relative proportion to his age. As hobbies, Wes enjoys reading, writing, poetry, origami and philosophy. Through an unknown process, Wes passes his power of prophetic visions on to his former ward, Sanderson Hawkins upon the moment of his own death. Wesley Dodds' costume consists of a basic green business suit, fedora, a World War I era gas mask, a gas gun, and a wire gun. The gas mask protects Dodds from the effects of the gas emitted from his gas gun. The gas gun, a handheld device fitted with cartridges containing concentrated sleeping gas, is Wesley Dodds' only known weapon. Pressing the trigger on the gun releases a cloud of green dust rendering all within the Sandman's immediate vicinity unconscious. An upgraded canister dispenser for the gun is provided for him by his close friend and confidante, Lee Travis. Wes is also known to conceal smaller knockout gas capsules in a hollow heel on his shoe. These prove ideal when placed in situations where his gas gun is not readily available. He also makes use of a specially designed \\"wirepoon\\" gun, which fires a length of thin, steel cable. In the early days of his career, the Sandman drives a black 1938 Plymouth Coupe. The car is enhanced with various features to aid Wes in his crusade against crime. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Is he able to fight the criminals?","output":"Yes, he is able to fight criminals.

Her mother stayed home and raised Aaliyah and her brother.Throughout Aaliyah’s life, she had a good relationship with Rashad, who recalled Aaliyah having a beautiful voice as a child. Aaliyah's family was very close due to the struggles of her grandparents and when they moved to Detroit, the Hankersons were ready to take them in if necessary. These same bonds led to ties in the music industry, under the Blackground Records label.Aaliyah's mother was a vocalist, and her uncle, Barry Hankerson, was an entertainment lawyer who had been married to Gladys Knight. As a child, Aaliyah traveled with Knight and worked with an agent in New York to audition for commercials and television programs, including Family Matters; she went on to appear on Star Search at the age of ten.

Yes or no? Answer: \\" in his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language. Question: what does auld lang syne mean","output":"No, the response \\"in his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language\\" is not a correct answer to the question \\"What does 'Auld Lang Syne' mean?\\" \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is a Scots language poem written by Robert Burns in 1788 and later set to a traditional folk tune. The song has been a New Year's Eve staple for many English-speaking countries across the globe over centuries. The phrase \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" directly translates into standard English as \\"old long since,\\" but is understood to mean something along the lines of \\"times gone by,\\" \\"long time ago,\\" or \\"for old times' sake.\\" The song essentially reflects a sense of nostalgia and mutual understanding of the passing of time. Moreover, it brings a sense of togetherness and camaraderie in the spirit of reminiscing the good old days. The song starts with a rhetorical question - \\"Should old acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind?\\" - which in essence is a call to remember long-standing friendships, old times, and the joy derived from those memories. In short, \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is about preserving old friendships and looking back over the events of the year. Burns was known to collect traditional Scottish songs, and while \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" was in part an original composition, it was also based on an old Scottish folk song - a reflection of Burns' interest in Scottish cultural and musical tradition. On the other hand, the mention of \\"his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language,\\" while it could be referencing Burns' broader work and influence, does not directly provide a meaning for the term \\"Auld Lang Syne.\\" Notably, Burns is not particularly associated with the retelling of fairy tales but rather with poetry and songs. Therefore, the statement needs more context or perhaps a clarification since it doesn't answer the question about what \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" means."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 56*o + 49*o + 589 + 395 = -801 for o.","output":"Alright, let's solve this equation step by step, but first, let me rewrite it so it's easier to understand: 56 * o + 49 * o + 589 + 395 = -801 Now, to make it simple, let's solve this equation in a few steps. Step 1: Combine the terms with \\"o\\" in them. (56 * o) + (49 * o) = (56 + 49) * o = 105 * o Now our equation looks like: 105 * o + 589 + 395 = -801 Step 2: Combine the numbers without \\"o\\". 589 + 395 = 984 Now our equation looks like: 105 * o + 984 = -801 Step 3: Move the 984 to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. 105 * o = -801 - 984 105 * o = -1785 Step 4: Finally, we'll find the value of \\"o\\" by dividing both sides by 105. o = -1785 / 105 o = -17 So, the answer is o = -17."},{"instruction":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Polish.

He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter, is the chairman of the English department and thus Grady's boss. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending - the book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana.His students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Tripp's large house, is attracted to Tripp, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on.During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.Meanwhile, Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.), has flown...

Article: In many romantic movies or TV shows one scene always appears. It involves a handsome man standing outside a young woman's window, singing a love song to her to win her over. However, trying to woo a female with songs is not just something that humans do. A few animals sing love songs as well. Birds and elephants are romantic but the latest animal to _ a female might surprise you--it is the humble mouse. You may find it odd to find out that mice sing. We do not hear them because the frequency of their voice is so high. In fact, scientists have known for some time that male mice make special sounds to females, but it has always been assumed that the sounds are produced instinctively and randomly, with little thought going into the process. But new research suggests otherwise. When male mice with different voices were put in a cage together, scientists found that they would gradually change their pitches to sound like one another. But when a female mouse was put in the cage with two males, one male would change his pitch to match the other. \\"It was usually the smaller animal changing the pitch to match the larger animal,\\" professor Erich Jarvis, leader of the study, from Duke University, US, told BBC News. This ability, known as vocal learning, is rare in the natural world. It had been thought to be limited to some birds, such as parrots--as well as whales and dolphins. The latest findings challenge the long-held opinion that mice cannot learn to adapt their voices. Scientists also found the part of the brain that controls the mice's singing ability. In the experiment, they damaged the cells in this part of the mice's brain and found that the animals couldn't keep their songs in pitch or repeat them any more. This also happened when the mice became deaf. Jarvis said that this finding had changed his understanding of the way mice make sound. \\"In mice we find that the pathways that are at least modulating these vocalizations are in the forebrain, in places where you actually find them in humans,\\"...

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance.Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding\\" correctly answer the question \\"What did the investigators conclude in terms of government funding for the terror attacks?\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the paragraph provided, the statement \\"Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance.

It's important to note that, while some ungrammatical sentences might still convey a clear message, they are considered incorrect from a linguistic perspective. One example of a grammatically unacceptable sentence is: \\"He no have go park.\\" In this sentence, the rules of syntax and word order have been violated. Here's an analysis of why this phrase is grammatically incorrect: 1. The subject \\"he\\" must be followed by the auxiliary \\"does\\" to form a negative statement in the present simple tense. The correct way to express this is \\"he does not have.\\" 2. The word \\"no\\" in the sentence is being used incorrectly. The appropriate word to use is \\"not\\" when negating actions. Therefore, it should be \\"he does not have.\\" 3. The verb \\"go\\" is unnecessary for the intended meaning. The correct word to use here is \\"to\\" (e.g., \\"He does not have to go to the park\\").

The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \\"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\\". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing \\"Shine!\\" and Williams screaming \\"Hey!\\". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, \\"So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation\\" and \\"that bear with the red hat\\", as obvious references to Paddington.

The value of the coins increases by 2/3. He sells coins to recoup his original investment. How many coins did he sell? Your thoughts:","output":"To determine how many coins James needs to sell to recoup his original investment, we first need to identify the initial investment and then determine the new value of each coin after the increase. Step 1: Calculate the initial investment. James buys 20 coins at 15 each, so his initial investment is: 20 coins * 15/coin = 300 Step 2: Calculate the increased value of the coins. The value of the coins increases by 2/3. So we'll multiply the original value (15) by the increase ratio (1 + 2/3 = 5/3). 15 * (5/3) = 25 Now each coin is worth 25. Step 3: Determine the number of coins required to recover the initial investment. To find out how many coins James needs to sell, we'll divide his initial investment by the new value of the coins. 300 / 25 = 12 coins James needs to sell 12 coins at the increased value to recoup his original investment of 300."},{"instruction":"Article: Identify anyone who has acted as an official or unofficial mentor. Also identify people who maybe helped you get the job in the first place or helped you get a promotion. You should tell these people that you are leaving your job. Stop by their office so you can talk in person. You should also make sure they have your new work email address. Mentoring should continue even after you leave your job. Remember to thank them for helping you. Say something like, “You’ve been the best sounding board, Kathy. I hope we stay in touch.” You should next tell colleagues you were close to. Chances are you’ll maintain some sort of relationship outside of work, so you don’t want them to be insulted that you haven’t told them personally. Stop into their office and break the news. You aren’t obligated to tell others why you are leaving, but they will want to know nonetheless. Accordingly, you should settle on a story and stick with it. Your colleagues will talk to each other and compare notes. Don’t tell one person you’re leaving because you can’t take the stress but tell another person you’re leaving because the commute is shorter. Ideally, you should settle on a story that is non-controversial. For example, you can simply say, “They promised promotion opportunities which I want to pursue.” Everyone can understand why you would want to leave for that reason. Whatever you do, don’t badmouth anyone, not even over drinks after work. If you need to vent, then call up your parents or therapist. If other people need to know that you’re leaving, you can let them know by email. Keep it brief and friendly. Tell them your last day and ask them to contact you if they have questions. For example, other team members you work with occasionally should probably get an individual email. They might need to check about the status of a project. If you’re pressed for time, you can send one email and blind copy everyone on it. However, individual emails are better if you have time. Never send out an email to people you don’t know. In larger companies, it’s particularly awkward to read a good-bye email from someone you’ve never met before. Let your boss or Human Resources inform these people that you are leaving. Absolutely fight the urge to trash the company in a good-bye email. No matter how angry you are, nothing good has ever come from these stunts. Sometimes, they even end up in the news.

First, you should talk to your mentors or people who helped you in your job, tell them you're leaving, and make sure they have your new contact information. You should also tell coworkers who are close friends so they don't feel left out. When explaining why you're leaving, choose one reason and stick with it, but avoid badmouthing anyone. Finally, for people you're not that close to, you can inform them via email, but always stay polite and never send bad messages about the company. It's okay to let your boss or Human Resources tell people you don't know that you're leaving."},{"instruction":"An earthquake causes the ground to shake, and landslides are often triggered by the shaking of earthquakes. Given these facts, what causes landslides among the following options: - earthquakes - deforestation - scattered light - rainfall - Water expanding - erosion - mouth of rivers - flooding","output":"Landslides can be caused by several factors, often involving a combination of these factors. Among the options you provided, the causes of landslides include: 1. Earthquakes: The ground shaking during an earthquake can destabilize slopes and trigger landslides. The intensity of the shaking, the slope's stability, and the underlying soil and rock composition all play a role in determining if a landslide occurs. 2. Deforestation: Trees and vegetation help to stabilize slopes by increasing the cohesion of the soil and absorbing water from the ground. Deforestation can weaken the soil structure and decrease water absorption capacity, leading to an increased risk of landslides. 3. Rainfall: Heavy or prolonged rainfall can saturate the ground, adding weight and reducing the soil's strength. Rainwater infiltration can also increase water pressure within the soil, reducing the friction between soil particles and contributing to slope instability. In some cases, rapid snowmelt can have a similar effect. 4. Erosion: Natural erosion processes like river or coastal erosion can gradually remove material from the base of a slope, making it steeper and more susceptible to landslides. Human activities, such as construction and mining, can exacerbate erosion concerns. 5. Flooding: When rivers overflow their banks, they can saturate and destabilize nearby slopes, leading to landslides. Floodwaters can also erode the base of slopes, thus increasing the risk of slope failure. In summary, among the options you provided, earthquakes, deforestation, rainfall, erosion, and flooding are the primary factors that can contribute to landslides. Other factors, such as the slope's steepness, soil and rock composition, and human activities, can also contribute to the risk of landslides."},{"instruction":"In other words terrorism puts democracies in a dilemma Can democratic society be defended without resorting to undemocratic methods and thereby undermining the very democracy we are trying to protect Could you correct the punctuation please?","output":"In other words, terrorism puts democracies in a dilemma: Can democratic society be defended without resorting to undemocratic methods, and thereby undermining the very democracy we are trying to protect?"},{"instruction":"- Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.) - Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enter the atmosphere - The make-up of the atmosphere changes - Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere - The earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy - Human beings cut down trees - Human beings do not re-plant the trees - Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - The extra trapped energy starts to change the earth&#x27;s short term weather What might be the last step of the process?

Balanini pirates, fervent Muslims, disputed the coast of northeastern Borneo (modern Sabah) with the sultanate of Brunei. Sarawak's coast and jungle interior were controlled by the Iban — Sea Dayak pirates and Land Dayak slash-and-burn farmers. (The Dayaks practiced head-hunting, a ritual that was believed to bring spiritual energy to their communities. ) The region was unproductive and without great resources, except for the Sarawak river valley, where the Chinese mined for gold and antimony. Brunei chiefs traded the metals through Americans in Singapore. In 1839, the governor of Singapore sent James Brooke (1803–1868) to promote trade links with the Sultan of Brunei. He had been an audacious cavalry officer in the Anglo-Burmese wars and now exploited the situation for his own benefit. In exchange for helping the regent end a revolt of uppity Malay chiefs, Brooke was made Rajah of Sarawak in 1841, with his capital in Kuching (founded by the Malays just 11 years earlier). He tried to halt the Dayaks' piracy and head-hunting while defending their more \\"morally acceptable\\" customs. His attempts to limit the opium trade met with resistance by the Chinese in Bau, who revolted. His counter-attack with Dayak warriors drove the Chinese out of Bau and across the Sarawak border. Thereafter, Chinese settlement was discouraged and did not achieve the commercial dominance it enjoyed on the peninsula. In 1863, Brooke retired to Britain, handing Sarawak over to his nephew Charles. More reserved and remote but a better administrator and financier than his uncle, Charles Brooke imposed on his men his own austere, efficient style of life. He brought Dayak leaders onto his ruling council but favored the time-honored colonial practice of divide-and-rule by pitting one tribe against another to keep the peace. Northeast Borneo (Sabah) was \\"rented\\" from the Sultan of Brunei by British businessman Alfred Dent. Dent was operating a royal charter for the British North Borneo Company — a charter similar to that of the EIC. What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"One possible question that could be asked from this paragraph is: \\"How did James Brooke and his successors, the White Rajahs, maintain control and implement changes in Borneo during the 19th century, particularly in their interactions with local tribes, the opium trade, and the British North Borneo Company?\\""},{"instruction":"A UN standing army would be ideally suited to respond to contemporary crises. Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"To support the claim that a UN standing army would be ideally suited to respond to contemporary crises, I will gather evidence from areas such as efficiency, neutrality, consistency, and capability. 1. Efficiency: A UN standing army would be a permanent and easily mobilizable force, which means it would be able to respond quickly to crises as they emerge. Since the troops and resources would already be coordinated under one organization, the need for lengthy negotiations to form a coalition would be eliminated, resulting in quicker intervention during emergencies. 2. Neutrality: A UN standing army would be composed of diverse countries, helping it maintain political neutrality. This would enable the force to enter conflict and disaster zones without the stigma of a specific, potentially controversial national agenda, making it more likely to be accepted by the local populations and opposing factions. 3. Consistency: With a UN standing army, there would be a consistent approach to training, logistics, and operations, which could lead to increased effectiveness in missions. Rather than each participating nation operating under its own standard practices, a UN force would follow a single set of guidelines, contributing to better coordination and communication when addressing crises. 4. Humanitarian aid and disaster relief: Besides handling militaristic tasks, a UN standing army could be effectively trained to provide humanitarian aid and disaster relief. Having a well-prepared and equipped force on standby to quickly respond to natural disasters would be invaluable when it comes to saving lives and limiting suffering. 5. Deterrent effect: The existence of a UN standing army could act as a deterrent to potential conflicts and violence. The knowledge that a UN force could quickly respond to acts of aggression might encourage countries and factions to reconsider their actions and resort to diplomatic solutions instead. 6. Reduction of burden on member nations: The creation of a UN standing army would spread the responsibility of crisis response, reducing the burden placed on individual member nations. This could allow for more effective and balanced distribution of resources, ultimately benefiting all parties involved. 7. Legitimacy: Since a UN standing army would be operating under the banner of an international organization, it would have the moral authority and legitimacy to intervene in crises. This could lead to more successful conflict resolution, as stakeholders involved in the situation would be more likely to accept the intervention of a neutral, legitimate force. In conclusion, evidence from efficiency, neutrality, consistency, capability, humanitarian aid, deterrent effect, and legitimacy, support the notion that a UN standing army would be ideally suited to respond to contemporary crises."},{"instruction":"Given a trivia question, classify broad topical category from this list: 'theater', 'geology', 'book', 'tv', 'astronomy', 'aviation', 'military', 'government', 'boxing', 'projects', 'metropolitan_transit', 'law', 'venture_capital', 'broadcast', 'biology', 'people', 'influence', 'baseball', 'spaceflight', 'media_common', 'cvg', 'opera', 'olympics', 'chemistry', 'visual_art', 'conferences', 'sports', 'language', 'travel', 'location', 'award', 'dining', 'martial_arts', 'comic_strips', 'computer', 'user', 'tennis', 'music', 'organization', 'food', 'event', 'transportation', 'fictional_universe', 'measurement_unit', 'meteorology', 'distilled_spirits', 'symbols', 'architecture', 'freebase', 'internet', 'fashion', 'boats', 'cricket', 'film', 'medicine', 'finance', 'comic_books', 'celebrities', 'soccer', 'games', 'time', 'geography', 'interests', 'common', 'base', 'business', 'periodicals', 'royalty', 'education', 'type', 'religion', 'automotive', 'exhibitions'.

The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.

Options: - mistrial - criminal prosecution - citation - injustices - penalty","output":"If someone is found to be committing perjury, the judge is most likely to declare a \\"criminal prosecution\\" for that person. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process behind that answer: 1. Understand the term \\"perjury\\": Perjury is the act of deliberately giving false or misleading testimony under oath in a court of law or other legal proceedings. It is a criminal offense, as it can potentially impact the outcome of the trial and obstruct the course of justice. 2. Analyzing the options: a. Mistrial: A mistrial is declared when a trial is rendered invalid due to a procedural error or a hung jury. A person committing perjury could contribute to a mistrial, but the judge would declare a mistrial for the entire trial, not just for that person. b. Criminal prosecution: As perjury is a criminal offense, an individual found committing perjury could be subject to criminal prosecution. The judge would declare this option if there is evidence that the individual knowingly and deliberately gave false or misleading testimony. c. Citation: A citation is a formal reprimand or notice issued to a person for the violation of a law or rule. While a person committing perjury has violated the law, a citation is generally given for lesser infractions and not for a more serious offense like perjury. d. Injustices: This term broadly refers to unfair situations or actions. Although perjury can contribute to injustices in a legal proceeding, this term doesn't describe the judge's action or declaration against a person committing perjury. e. Penalty: A penalty may be imposed on a person found guilty of committing perjury. The judge, however, must first declare the intention to pursue criminal prosecution, which could later result in penalties like fines or imprisonment. 3. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of the options, the correct answer is \\"criminal prosecution.\\" A judge would likely initiate a criminal prosecution if someone is found to be committing perjury, as it's a criminal offense. This action would aim to hold the individual accountable for their false or misleading statements made under oath."},{"instruction":"Definition: A question that is free of any grammatical or logcal errors, should be labeled 'yes', otherwise it should be indicated as 'no'. A question is grammatically correct if all its entities i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, pronouns, adverbs are at appropriate position. A question is logically correct if the semantic makes sense. Input: Sentence: They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. Question: How often is the soil tested? Output:","output":"Part #1: A question that is free of any grammatical errors. Usage: Sample question - \\"What color is the sky?\\" This question is grammatically correct because all the entities (noun, adjective, pronoun, verb) are at appropriate positions. The question begins with an interrogative word, followed by a subject, verb, and object. Part #2: A question that is free of any logical errors. Usage: Sample question - \\"How do planets orbit the sun?\\" This question is logically correct because the question semantically makes sense. Planets do orbit the sun, and the question is asking about the mechanism or process behind it. Part #3: Labeling a question 'yes' if it is free of both grammatical and logical errors. Usage: Sample question - \\"Which country is the largest in size?\\" This question is both grammatically and logically correct. All entities are at their appropriate positions, and the question makes sense semantically. Therefore, it should be labeled 'yes'. Part #4: Labeling a question 'no' if it has grammatical or logical errors. Usage: Sample question - \\"How taste the yellow square?\\" This question has grammatical errors, as the entities are not in the correct positions, and it also has logical errors since it doesn't make sense semantically.

The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year.

It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore.

Problem: at a florist shop on a certain day , all corsages sold for either 20 or 30 . if 10 of the corsages that sold for 30 had instead sold for 20 , then the store ' s revenue from corsages that day would have been reduced by 20 percent . what was the store ' s actual revenue from corsages that day ? A:","output":"Let x be the number of corsages sold for 20, and y be the number of corsages sold for 30. The actual revenue from corsages on that day can be calculated as: Actual_revenue = 20x + 30y Now, the problem states that if 10 of the 30 corsages had instead sold for 20, the revenue would have been reduced by 20%. That means the revenue in this case would be 80% of the actual revenue. So we can write: 0.80 * (20x + 30y) = 20x + 30(y - 10) + 200 Now, we have to solve the above equation for x and y. 0.80 * (20x + 30y) = 20x + 30y - 300 + 200 16x + 24y = 20x + 20y - 100 4x = 100 + 4y So, x = 25 + y (1) Now, we have one equation and two variables. However, the problem does not specify the limit on the number of corsages sold for each price. But we know for the given problem, 10 corsages should have been sold for 30, i.e., y >= 10. So let's start with y = 10, we get: x = 25 + y = 25 + 10 = 35 Now, using these values for x and y, we can calculate the actual revenue from corsages on that day: Actual_revenue = 20x + 30y = 20*35 + 30*10 = 700 + 300 = 1000 Thus, the actual revenue from corsages on that day was 1000."},{"instruction":"I just took a test in school today.

'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work.

Answer the question: Steel has a lower or higher melting point than lead because it has less branching? A:","output":"This statement about branching and melting points is not applicable to metals like steel and lead; it is generally applicable to organic compounds with hydrocarbon chains. Thus, we cannot use this criterion to compare the melting points of steel and lead. Instead, we need to look at their respective properties and structures to determine which has a lower or higher melting point. Steel is an alloy primarily made of iron and carbon, with other elements added to improve various properties. The carbon in steel forms a strong lattice structure with the iron atoms, resulting in high strength and a high melting point. On the other hand, lead is a pure element with a relatively simple crystal structure and weaker atomic bonds, which causes it to have a lower melting point. In conclusion, steel has a higher melting point than lead, but not because it has less branching. The difference in their melting points is mainly due to the strength of atomic bonds and the molecular structure of each material."},{"instruction":"Bella eats 6 apples a day. If during the week she consumes a third of the apples Grace picks, how many apples will Grace have after 6 weeks? Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. Find out how many apples Bella consumes in a week. 2. Calculate how many apples Grace picks in a week based on Bella's consumption. 3. Determine how many apples Grace picks in 6 weeks. 4. Subtract the apples consumed by Bella over 6 weeks from the total apples picked by Grace in 6 weeks. Step 1: Bella consumes 6 apples a day. In a week (7 days), she consumes 6 * 7 = 42 apples. Step 2: Since Bella consumes a third of the apples Grace picks, we can find out how many apples Grace picks in a week by multiplying Bella's consumption by 3 (the inverse of a third). So, Grace picks 42 * 3 = 126 apples in a week. Step 3: To find out how many apples Grace picks in 6 weeks, multiply the apples she picks in a week by 6. Grace picks 126 * 6 = 756 apples in 6 weeks. Step 4: Now, let's find out how many apples Bella consumes in 6 weeks. We already know she consumes 42 apples in a week, so in 6 weeks she consumes 42 * 6 = 252 apples. Finally, subtract the apples consumed by Bella from the total number of apples picked by Grace in 6 weeks. Grace will have 756 - 252 = 504 apples left after 6 weeks."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Second question: What are real time application? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, I will address the two questions individually and then compare them to check if they are asking the same thing. 1. What are real-time applications of virtual functions? Virtual functions are a feature of object-oriented programming (OOP), primarily used in languages like C++ and Java. They allow for dynamic (runtime) polymorphism and, when used correctly, can make a codebase more flexible, modular, and maintainable. Step-by-step analysis: a. Identify the concept: In this case, it's virtual functions. b. Explain the concept's purpose: Virtual functions enable runtime polymorphism. c. List real-time applications: Some real-time applications include: i. Game development: In game programming, objects like characters, weapons, and items can have different behaviors, and virtual functions allow these objects to be treated as part of the same hierarchy, making it easier to manage different behaviors. ii. Computer graphics: In graphics programming, shapes and objects can also have different behaviors attributed through the use of virtual functions, which makes it simpler to manage rendering and interaction with these objects. iii. GUI development: When building user interfaces, components like buttons, text fields, and menus may share common behaviors. Virtual functions allow these components to be part of a common hierarchy, promoting code reuse and maintainability. 2. What are real-time applications? Real-time applications are software systems or applications that need to react or respond to events or inputs within a specific time constraint, ensuring real-time processing and minimal latency. These applications usually perform tasks that demand an immediate response, and delays in this response can result in suboptimal performance or even failure of the system. Step-by-step analysis: a. Identify the concept: In this case, it's real-time applications. b. Explain the concept's purpose: Real-time applications must ensure timely responses and processing. c. List some examples: Some real-time applications include: i. Audio/Video streaming: These applications must deliver media content with low latency and high quality to provide users with a seamless experience. ii. Video games: They require fast rendering and processing to ensure smooth gameplay and avoid latency, which could disrupt the player's experience. iii. Air-traffic control systems: These systems need to constantly update and process data on aircraft positions, ensuring timely decisions and responses for safety purposes. Now, comparing the two questions: The first question asks about specific real-time applications that use virtual functions, focusing on how this OOP concept is employed in real-world scenarios. The second question revolves around real-time applications in general, requesting examples of software systems that need to respond to events within a specific time constraint. These two questions are not asking the same thing. While the first question focuses on real-world applications of virtual functions, the second question is broader and inquires about real-time applications as a whole."},{"instruction":"Is the question \\"How many calories are there in a glass of water ?\\" asking about an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric entity?

It lies east of Stranraer and south of Newton Stewart. It is well known today as \\"Scotland's National Book Town\\" with a high concentration of second-hand book shops. It has a population of about 1,000. - Wigtownshire , was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918 . It was represented by one Member of Parliament . The first British general election in Wigtownshire was in 1708 . In 1707 -- 08 , members of the 1702 -- 1707 Parliament of Scotland were co-opted to serve in the 1st Parliament of Great Britain . See Scottish representatives to the 1st Parliament of Great Britain , for further details . In 1918 the Wigtownshire area was combined with Kirkcudbrightshire to form the Galloway constituency . - Dumfries and Galloway is one of 32 unitary council areas of Scotland and is located in the western Southern Uplands. It comprises the historic counties of Dumfriesshire, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright and Wigtownshire, the latter two of which are collectively known as Galloway. The administrative centre is the town of Dumfries. - The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favour of a single parliament, located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom with effect from 1 January 1801. - Wigtownshire or the County of Wigtown is a registration county and lieutenancy area in south-west Scotland. Until 1975, Wigtownshire was one of the administrative counties used for local government purposes, and is now administered as part of the council area of Dumfries and Galloway. As a lieutenancy area, Wigtownshire has its own Lord Lieutenant, currently John Alexander Ross. - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information. In Scotland registration counties are used for land registration purposes. - Galloway (Gaelic: \\"Gall-Ghàidhealaibh\\"; Latin: \\"Gallovidia\\") is a region in southwestern Scotland comprising the counties of Wigtown and Kirkcudbright. - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. - A Member of Parliament (MP) is the representative of the voters to a parliament. In many countries with bicameral parliaments, this category includes specifically members of the lower house, as upper houses often have a different title. - The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England. In 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament. - The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames. It was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London. Upon creation, Westminster was awarded city status, which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state. - In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government. Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries). - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament taxation, legislation and policy-making but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London. - The Acts of Union 1800 (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single Act of Union 1801) united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Both Acts, though since amended, still remain in force in the United Kingdom, but have been repealed in the Republic of Ireland. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Nurse Betty Movie plot: Betty (Renee Zellweger), is a kind and considerate diner waitress living in Kansas City, Kansas. She is a fan of the daytime soap opera 'A Reason to Love'. She has no idea that her sneaky husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), a car salesman, is having an affair with his secretary and that he intends to leave Betty in order to pursue a relationship with the secretary. She also doesn't know that her husband supplements his income by selling drugs out of the car dealership.When Betty calls to leave a message about borrowing a Buick LeSabre for her birthday, her husband tells Betty to take a different car as the LeSabre has stolen drugs hidden in the trunk.Two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock) show up at the house with Betty's husband. The hitmen torture Del into revealing that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of a car but are not successful in getting him to tell which car it is. Betty witnesses the murder and experiences a fugue state, escaping the reality of murder into the comforting fantasy of the soap opera. In her mind, she assumes the identity of one of the characters in the daytime drama, a nurse.That evening, Sheriff Ballard (Pruit Taylor Vance), Roy Ostery (Crispin Glover) a local reporter, and the police are examining the crime scene while Betty calmly packs a suitcase. She seems oblivious to the murder, even with the investigation going on right in her house. At the police station, a psychiatrist examines her.Betty spends the night at her friend's house in a nearby town, sleeping in a child's bedroom with the innocence of a little girl. In the middle of the night, she suddenly gets in her car and drives off. Betty's next stop is a bar in Arizona where the lady bartender talks about her inspiring vacation in Rome, and Betty tells her that she's engaged to a famous surgeon (describing the lead character from 'A Reason to Love'... not the actor who portrays him, but the character himself).Meanwhile, the two hitmen are trying to find her, as they have finally realized that she must have the car with the...

Grab your Euchre deck and have the dealer give each player 5 cards and assemble the kitty. Starting to the person left of the dealer, rotating clockwise, ask each player whether or not he wishes to declare the suit that is showing as trump until someone does (or a new cycle begins). If he does wish to declare this suit trump, he says \\"pick it up.\\" If he does not want to declare this suit trump, he says \\"pass,\\" or declares a pass by knocking on the table. He/She then discards one of their other cards (usually a low card of the non-trump suit). If a rotation of the circle is completed without anyone telling the dealer to \\"pick it up,\\" the card is turned face down and another rotation ensues. During this rotation, a player can call trump of any suit other than the one that was originally turned up. If the rotation completes without anyone calling trump, the deal is forfeited and passed clockwise to the next person in the circle. It's generally wise to only call a trump suit if you have a good hand. Otherwise, stay mum. Each player must follow suit -- meaning if a player has a card of the same suit as was led, he must play it on that trick. If a player does not have a card of that suit, he can trump the trick, or simply throw a card off suit. The highest card of the suit that was led takes the trick, unless a trump card is played. The highest card of trump will win any hand. If you lay a card that does not follow suit but you do have a card that does, this is called a \\"renege.\\" If another player calls you out on what you've done, they receive 2 points. If you are going alone, however, the penalty is 4 points (for whichever side is guilty). Because each game of Euchre is so short, it's a little easier to memorize the cards. Think about what cards you believe your opponents are holding to determine how to lead off and what to throw away. For example, if the dealer adds the original trump card to his hand, don't forget it. If you are leading and have two or more trump cards, go with those. Always lead a high trump if your partner called it; it'll help them locate the missing cards. Otherwise, work in a sequence. Say diamonds are trump -- lead with the Ace of Spades or Clubs to try to win it. Don't hold onto your good cards. Euchre goes fast -- if you act slowly, you'll miss your opportunity to use them. When opportunity knocks, answer the door. \\" Once one team gets to 9 points, this means they are \\"in the barn.\\" You must announce this with great enthusiasm, since it typically indicates that you are about to win the game. If you really want to have fun with it, have one partner interlock their fingers together, and flip upside down with the thumbs making \\"udders\\" and let the other partner \\"milk\\" them. The five tricks of Euchre can go by pretty fast, so it's best to keep score as you go. Use the 6 and 4 cards to keep tabs. Once a team reaches ten, you'll probably want to play again. Switch teams if skill sets are better suited in different combinations.","output":"In Euchre, players sit in a circle and one person gives out five cards to everyone. They take turns to decide which suit is the \\"trump\\" suit, which is the most powerful. When it's their turn to play a card, they must play one of the same suit, if they have it. The player who plays the highest card from the trump suit or the one played first usually wins that round. Euchre is a fast game, so you need to think about what cards the other players have and use your best ones quickly. When one team gets close to winning, they can celebrate in a silly way. It's good to keep track of your score, and you can play again with different teams if you want."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: However, let us not undermine this industry's capacity for recovery by being lax and negligent.

Make this proper case","output":"In order to grab power-ups and destroy bosses successfully in a video game, one must develop a solid strategy to navigate the game world effectively and maximize their character's abilities. This involves understanding the game mechanics, mastering control over the character, and familiarizing oneself with the different types of power-ups and their functions. First and foremost, a player must understand the game mechanics. Each game has its unique set of rules, objectives, and controls that govern gameplay. By gaining an in-depth knowledge of these factors, the player can develop strategies to navigate the game's environment and overcome its challenges. This may involve reading manuals, online guides, or simply spending time practicing in the game itself to gain the necessary experience. Secondly, mastering control over the character is crucial. Smooth and precise control allows the player to perform the essential actions such as running, jumping, attacking, and evading enemy attacks. Players should familiarize themselves with the key bindings or button layout for their specific gaming platform, whether it be a console, PC, or mobile device. Investing time in perfecting one's reflexes and execution will pay off when facing powerful bosses or encountering difficult situations. As the player advances through the levels, power-ups will become available to enhance their character's abilities or provide additional benefits. It is imperative to understand the different types of power-ups and their effects to use them to their full potential. Here are some general categories of power-ups commonly found in games: 1. Health and Life Restoration: These power-ups replenish a character's health points or lives, enabling them to sustain more damage before losing a life or game over. Players should prioritize collecting these power-ups in-game, especially when low on health or lives. 2. Damage Boosts: These power-ups increase the character's attack strength, enabling them to deal more damage to enemies and bosses. By utilizing these power-ups, players can shorten boss battles by destroying them faster. 3. Protection and Defense: These power-ups provide temporary invincibility, shields, or other forms of damage reduction. Acquiring these power-ups during boss battles can prove invaluable, as they often offer a brief respite from taking damage. 4. Utility and Mobility: These power-ups grant the character with additional abilities such as faster movement speed, higher jumps, or access to new weapons or items. By understanding when and how to use these power-ups effectively in the game, players can navigate the environment, avoid enemy attacks, and reach previously inaccessible areas. When facing bosses, it is essential to recognize their attack patterns and weak spots. By observing the boss' actions and predicting their movements, the player can anticipate when and how to dodge or counterattack. Each boss has different strengths and weaknesses, so adaptability is key to success. Knowing when to use power-ups and when to reserve them for later stages of the fight is a vital skill. In conclusion, grabbing power-ups and destroying bosses requires a combination of understanding the game mechanics, mastering control over the character, and having a comprehensive knowledge of power-ups and their uses. By developing these skills and implementing strategies in gameplay, players can increase their chances of victory and enjoy a more rewarding gaming experience."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) is the major federal agency responsible for funding health research in Canada.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Problem:Context_1 : Hypochromic anemia is a generic term for any type of anemia in which the red blood cells (erythrocytes) are paler than normal. (\\"Hypo\\"- refers to \\"less\\", and \\"chromic\\" means \\"color\\".) A normal red blood cell will have an area of pallor in the center of it; it is biconcave disk shaped. In hypochromic cells, this area of central pallor is increased. This decrease in redness is due to a disproportionate reduction of red cell hemoglobin (the pigment that imparts the red color) in proportion to the volume of the cell. Clinically the color can be evaluated by the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) or Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC). The MCHC is considered the better parameter of the two as it adjusts for effect the size of the cell has on its color. Hypochromia is clinically defined as below the normal MHC reference range of 27-33 picograms/cell in adults or below the normal MCHC reference range of 33-36 g/dL in adults. Context_2 : The Nazi Lowriders (or NLR, or The Ride) are an organized crime syndicate, and peckerwood prison and street gang based primarily in Southern California and Texas. They also have small factions in rural and suburban Chicago, and are believed to have spread to many other states. They are allies of the larger and more notorious gangs, the Aryan Brotherhood and the Mexican Mafia and fellow peckerwood gang Public Enemy No. 1. Their main rivals are the Bloods, the Crips, the Black Guerrilla Family, MS-13, Nortenos, and Nuestra Familia. The Nazi Low Riders operate in and outside prison walls. They are often fueled by their drug of choice, methamphetamine. NLR violence has struck the general public, including police officers. Context_3 : The color blood red is a dark shade of the color red meant to resemble the color of human blood (which is composed of oxygenated red erythrocytes, white leukocytes, and yellow blood plasma). It is the iron in hemoglobin specifically that gives blood its red color. The actual color ranges from crimson to a dark brown-red depending on how oxygenated the blood is, and may have a slightly orange hue. Deoxygenated blood, which circulates closer to the body's surface and which is therefore generally more likely to be seen than oxygenated blood, issues from bodily veins in a dark red state, but quickly oxygenates upon exposure to air, turning a brighter shade of red. This happens more quickly with smaller volumes of blood such as a pinprick and less quickly from cuts or punctures that cause greater blood flows such as a puncture in the basilic vein: all blood collected during a phlebotomy procedure is deoxygenated blood, and it does not usually have a chance to become oxygenated upon leaving the body. Arterial blood, which is already oxygenated, is also already a brighter shade of red— this is the blood see from a pulsating neck, arm, or leg wound, and it does not change color upon exposure to air. The color \\"blood red\\", therefore, covers both these states: the darker deoxygenated color and the brighter oxygenated one. Also, dried blood often has a darker, rust-colored quality: all dried blood has been oxygenated and then desiccated, causing the cells within it to die. This blood is often darker than either shade of red that can be seen in fresh blood. Context_4 : Dermatophyte test medium (DTM) is a specialized agar used in medical mycology. It is based on Sabouraud's dextrose agar with added cycloheximide to inhibit saprotrophic growth, antibiotic to inhibit bacterial growth, and phenol red a pH indicator. The pH indicator is useful in distinguishing a dermatophyte fungus, which utilizes nitrogenous material for preferred metabolism, producing alkaline by-products, imparting a red color change to the medium. Typical saprotrophic fungi utilize carbohydrates in the medium producing acidic by-products and no red color change. Context_5 : Amaranth, FD&C Red No. 2, E123, C.I. Food Red 9, Acid Red 27, Azorubin S, or C.I. 16185 is a dark red to purple azo dye used as a food dye and to color cosmetics. The name was taken from amaranth grain, a plant distinguished by its red color and edible protein-rich seeds. Context_6 : Red beds (or redbeds) are sedimentary rocks, which typically consist of sandstone, siltstone, and shale that are predominantly red in color due to the presence of ferric oxides. Frequently, these red-colored sedimentary strata locally contain thin beds of conglomerate, marl, limestone, or some combination of these sedimentary rocks. The ferric oxides, which are responsible for the red color of red beds, typically occur as a coating on the grains of sediments comprising red beds. Classic examples of red beds are the Permian and Triassic strata of the western United States and the Devonian Old Red Sandstone facies of Europe. Context_7 : Red diamond is a diamond which displays red color throughout its prism, and exhibits all the same mineral properties as colorless diamonds. Red diamonds are commonly known as the most expensive and the rarest diamond color in the world, even more so than pink diamonds or blue diamonds. Red diamonds, just like pink diamonds are greatly debated as to the source of their color, but the gemological community most commonly attributes both colors to gliding atoms in the diamond’s structure as it undergoes enormous pressure during its formation. Context_8 : Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored (black) grape varieties. The actual color of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is greenish-white; the red color comes from anthocyan pigments (also called anthocyanins) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier varieties, which produce a red colored. Much of the red-wine production process therefore involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin. Context_9 : The Union Philosophical Society or UPS is the seventh-oldest collegiate organization in the United States, and one of the three oldest literary societies. Founded at Dickinson College in 1789, it took the white rose and the Roman goddess Minerva as its primary symbols. The Union Philosophical Society adopted a badge in 1791, designed as a Maltese Cross with a wreath of white roses about the letters 'U.P.S.'. The white rose of this society is responsible for the white color adopted as one of the honorary colors of Dickinson College (the red rose of the Belles Lettres Society is responsible for the red color adopted as the other honorary color of Dickinson College). This was in opposition to Belles Lettres, the sixth oldest collegiate organization in the US, and founded three years before UPS. Throughout the college's history and only discontinued in the mid-20th century, Dickinson students had to join either Belles Lettres or Union Philosophical Society to participate in other extracurricular collegiate activities. Belles Lettres and UPS developed a rivalry that continues to this day.

Hypothesis: They chose to cook the meat in a crockpot. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise and the hypothesis describe two different cooking methods and environments. The premise presents a scenario where meat is sizzling, which typically occurs when cooking on a high-heat surface, such as a grill or stovetop. The use of the word \\"spilled\\" further suggests that the meat is being cooked on some elevated surface, whereas a crockpot would have contained the meat. Moreover, the mention of \\"charcoal\\" indicates that the cooking method likely involves direct heat from burning coals – such as grilling or barbecuing – which is generally incompatible with crockpot cooking. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests the meat was cooked in a crockpot, which is a slow cooker that uses low, consistent heat to cook food over an extended period. The cooking process in a crockpot is fundamentally different from the high-heat method described in the premise, as it does not involve sizzling, direct exposure to coals, or the risk of spilling onto the street. To summarize, the hypothesis and the premise are not congruent, as they describe distinct cooking environments and techniques. The premise does not support the hypothesis that the meat was cooked in a crockpot."},{"instruction":"Definition: Generate a question which can yield the answer mentioned in the input.

The framing of photographs plays a crucial role in establishing the visual aesthetics and thematic interpretations of the images. Framing can be understood as the strategic use of elements such as composition, lighting, and perspective to construct meaning within a photograph. However, framing is not merely a visual component, but also a material one, as it creates a physical boundary between the image and the viewer. This materiality, in turn, impacts our perception of the image and its content, revealing the staging and construction of the photograph as an essential premise. Framing as a material component: Framing transforms the intangible and ephemeral nature of the image into a tangible object that viewers can interact with on a physical level. This physical interaction allows viewers to engage with the photograph through touch, sight, and in some cases, sound. Framing materials, such as glass, wood, and metal, contribute to the overall materiality of the photograph, adding weight, texture, and dimension to it. These materials can also be used to create a protective barrier, preserving the image from environmental damage and prolonging its longevity. Framing as a visual element: The visual aspect of framing manifests in several ways. For instance, framing can involve the use of borders, mattes, or other design elements to separate the image from its surrounding environment. This separation draws the viewer's attention towards the photograph, emphasizing its significance and providing a viewing experience devoid of contextual distractions. Additionally, the choice of framing materials, colors, and styles can establish the desired mood or complement the existing visual elements in the image. Framing as a thematic statement: Framing can also be employed as a means to convey specific themes or messages within the photograph. Some photographers deliberately incorporate framing elements into their images, such as doors, windows, or other architectural features, to draw attention to the staged nature of the scene. This self-referential approach acknowledges the artifice of photography while also exploring the boundaries between reality and representation. The identification of staging as a basic premise: By acknowledging the materiality and visual impact of framing, viewers are made aware of the deliberate decisions that the photographer makes in presenting the image. This awareness underscores the notion that photography is, ultimately, an art form rooted in the process of staging, construction, and manipulation. Understanding this dimension of photography allows the viewer to appreciate the complexities behind image creation and recognize the photographer's role as an active participant in shaping the viewer's experience. In conclusion, the framing of photographs serves as a critical aspect in defining the visual, material, and thematic dimensions of the image. By drawing attention to the staging of the photograph, framing reveals the deeper intricacies of the photographic medium—reminding us that the images we consume are often carefully constructed representations of reality, rather than simple snapshots of the world around us."},{"instruction":"Context: I guess that really is n't the post offices fault though , as much as I would love to blame them for something else .

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.

John is pondering about how this species would fare in the future in these two countries. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would country A see higher or lower growth rate of the species than country B? Answer:","output":"Country A would see a lower growth rate of the species than country B. Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the background. - When the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources, resulting in high birth rates. - As population increases, resources decrease, leading to a lower reproduction rate and therefore lower population growth rate. Step 2: Apply the relevant information to the given scenario. - Country A has a large population of the species, which means that resources, such as food, are likely to be more limited compared to country B. - Country B has a smaller population of the species, indicating that there is likely enough food and other resources available, leading to a higher birth rate and population growth rate. Step 3: Compare the population growth rates between the two countries based on the given information. - Given that resources are more limited in country A due to the larger population, the birth rate and population growth rate will likely be lower in country A compared to country B. - In contrast, given the smaller population in country B and the higher likelihood of sufficient resources, the population growth rate will likely be higher in country B.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process following the breaking apart of the larger rock into smaller rocks by the continuous contact and interaction with particles in the environment is typically the transportation and deposition of these smaller rocks to new locations, ultimately leading to the formation of sedimentary rocks. When particles in the environment remove small pieces of the rock through the processes of weathering and erosion, these smaller fragments or sediment are subjected to further movement and transportation by various natural agents such as water, wind, ice, and gravity. This transportation phase can be relatively short or long, depending on the specific circumstances of the location and the nature of the natural agents involved. During the transportation phase, the smaller rocks may undergo additional weathering, abrasion, and sorting, which cause them to become even smaller, more rounded, and more uniform in size. These processes result from the continuous friction, collision, and pressure between the rocks and their surrounding environment, as well as from physical and chemical reactions with the transporting agents (e.g., dissolution in water or oxidation due to contact with air). Eventually, the smaller rocks reach a depositional environment where the transporting agent's energy is no longer sufficient to continue moving them. In these settings, the sediments gradually accumulate and settle, forming layers on the ground, the seafloor, or even on the ice surface. These depositional environments can include riverbanks, lakes, oceans, deserts, or glaciers, depending on regional geological and climatic conditions. Over time, as more sedimentary layers accumulate on top of each other, the pressure and weight of the overlying materials lead to compaction and consolidation of the sediment layers. Simultaneously, the mineral-rich fluids circulating through the pores between the sediment grains help cement the particles together, a process known as cementation. These combined processes of compaction, cementation, and lithification transform the loose sediment into solid sedimentary rock, such as sandstone, limestone, or shale. In summary, the last step in the process that begins with the weathering, erosion, and disintegration of larger rocks into smaller ones is the transportation and deposition of these smaller rocks into new locations, where they get compacted, lithified, and eventually form sedimentary rock layers. This process, which plays a fundamental role in the geological rock cycle, contributes to the continuous recycling and reshaping of Earth's crust and its diverse landscapes."},{"instruction":"If I tell you that Gas heats water and turns it into gas, and ask you the question \\"what heats water for boiling?\\", is the correct answer \\"water\\"?

The longtime Dean of the United States Senate served as its president pro tempore and chairman of both its Rules and Administration and Appropriations committees . He was a member of the Democratic Party . Having earned a reputation as a reclamation expert early in his congressional career , Hayden consistently backed legislation dealing with public lands , mining , reclamation , and other projects affecting the Western United States . In addition , he played a key role in creating the funding formula for the federal highway system . President John F. Kennedy said of Hayden , \`\` Every Federal program which has contributed to the development of the West -- irrigation , power , reclamation -- bears his mark , and the great Federal highway program which binds this country , together , which permits this State to be competitive east and west , north and south , this in large measure is his creation . '' Known as the \`\` Silent Senator '' , Hayden rarely spoke on the Senate floor . Instead his influence came from committee meetings and Senate cloakroom discussions where his comments were given a respect comparable to canon law . A colleague said of him , \`\` No man in Senate history has wielded more influence with less oratory , '' while the Los Angeles Times wrote that Hayden had \`\` assisted so many projects for so many senators that when old Carl wants something for his beloved Arizona , his fellow senators fall all over themselves giving him a hand .

An open primary is a primary election that does not require voters to be affiliated with a political party in order to vote for partisan candidates. In a traditional open primary, voters may select one party's ballot and vote for that party's nomination. As in a closed primary, the highest voted candidate in each party then proceeds to the general election. In a nonpartisan blanket primary, all candidates appear on the same ballot and the two highest voted candidates proceed to the runoff election, regardless of party affiliation. The constitutionality of this system was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2008, whereas a partisan blanket primary was previously ruled to be unconstitutional in 2000. The arguments for open primaries are that voters can make independent choices, building consensus that the electoral process is not splintered or undermined by the presence of multiple political parties.","output":"Based on the provided text, a registered Libertarian can vote in the primary if the election is held as an open primary. There are two formats of open primaries, which are the traditional open primary and the nonpartisan blanket primary, both of which allow voters from different party affiliations to participate. In a traditional open primary, voters can choose one party's ballot and vote for that party's nomination. The highest voted candidate in each party advances to the general election. This means that a registered Libertarian can participate in the primary by selecting a different party's ballot, such as the Republican or Democratic ballot, and then vote for a candidate within that party. However, it is worth noting that the ability to vote in another party's primary might vary from state to state, as some states may have restrictions on cross-party voting, even in open primaries. In a nonpartisan blanket primary, all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party affiliation, and the two highest voted candidates proceed to the runoff election. This system allows a registered Libertarian voter to participate in the primary and vote for a candidate of their choice from any party, including their own. It is important to note that the nonpartisan blanket primary format is not used in all states, but its constitutionality was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2008. The main argument for open primaries is that they allow voters to make independent choices, regardless of their party affiliation, which can help build consensus between various political factions and ensure that the electoral process is not splintered or undermined by the presence of multiple political parties. This encourages a more inclusive, democratic process and allows for greater political participation from a diverse range of voters, including registered Libertarians."},{"instruction":"Triple: Randall County, Texas COUNTRY United States What is a sentence that describes this triple?","output":"Randall County is a place in Texas, and Texas is a big state in the United States, which is a very big country where people live."},{"instruction":"Here is a news article: Photo Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has throat cancer and will begin treatment shortly at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, he said in a note to the bank’s employees and shareholders late Tuesday. Doctors discovered the cancer at an early stage, Mr. Dimon, 58, said, noting that his condition was “curable.” After a series of tests, he said the doctors confirmed that the cancer had not spread beyond the “original site” and the adjacent lymph nodes on the right side of his neck. Mr. Dimon assured employees at JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, that the prognosis from the doctors was “excellent.” Mr. Dimon, who has held the dual roles of chief executive and chairman at the bank since 2006, has been atop JPMorgan longer than any other bank chief. The announcement of his diagnosis came on Mr. Dimon’s 10-year anniversary at JPMorgan. That tenure, which began when JPMorgan acquired Bank One, has been marked by triumph — the bank emerged from the financial crisis in better shape than its rivals — and by tumult. The bank has worked to mend its frayed relationships with regulators — a painful reconciliation that cost it roughly 20 billion. In November, JPMorgan reached a record 13 billion settlement with a range of government authorities over its sale of questionable mortgage-backed securities in the lead-up to the financial crisis. The bank also reached a 2 billion settlement over accusations that it failed to sound alarms about Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. JPMorgan has also been buffeted by the departure of several top executives. In the last two years alone, at least 10 senior executives have left JPMorgan. Most recently, Michael J. Cavanagh, once considered an heir to Mr. Dimon, left the bank to join the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. And like its rivals, JPMorgan, which will report second-quarter earnings on July 15, is grappling with a slowdown in its trading business. It has been a particularly grueling stretch for trading units across Wall Street. The sluggish trading revenue traces, in part, to a spate of rules passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In the past, banks made some of their riskiest wagers — bets that sometimes translated into rich profits — through trading complex derivatives, bonds and commodities. In the new banking landscape, where interest rates remain persistently low, the role of those businesses has been diminished. In his annual letter to shareholders in April, Mr. Dimon stressed that despite the “constant and intense pressure,” he was proud of the bank’s resiliency and its resolve. Last year, JPMorgan earned 17.9 billion in profit despite the legal costs. Mr. Dimon reiterated his faith in the leadership of the bank on Tuesday. He did not outline any plans to cede the reins of the bank while he has treatment — a process that he said should last about eight weeks. In his note, Mr. Dimon emphasized that the company would “continue to deliver first-class results for our customers.” The illness of any chief executive naturally prompts questions about who is prepared to take over, at least for a little while. But Mr. Dimon emphasized in his note that he would remain immersed in the day-to-day operations of the bank. JPMorgan’s board has remained firmly behind Mr. Dimon, redoubling support for him. The board awarded Mr. Dimon 20 million in annual compensation for his work in 2013. The raise came one year after the board had cut his compensation to 11.5 million. Even before Mr. Dimon’s diagnosis the board agreed on various succession plans. “The board had already established a short-term, medium-term and longer-term succession plan,” said a JPMorgan spokesman, Joseph Evangelisti. Among the potential successors, people briefed on the matter said, are Gordon Smith, the head of JPMorgan’s consumer bank, and Mary Erdoes, who runs the asset management business. The inclusion of Mr. Smith and Ms. Erdoes reflected the changing fortunes of banking. JPMorgan’s consumer business, for example, has taken on more prominence as the bank shifts its focus to credit cards and auto loans and away from intricate deal-making and trades that once were the hallmark of Wall Street. ||||| James Dimon, chairman and chief executive of J.P.

Translate to English","output":"How does the Council plan to prevent the introduction of new benefits through the so-called back door, for example, by decisions of the Quaestors? What possibilities does the Council have to demand or ensure that the European Parliament uses the funds granted to it sparingly and efficiently? The Council, being one of the key institutions in the European Union, has several ways to ensure that new benefits are not introduced through back-door channels and that the European Parliament uses the allocated funds in an efficient and frugal manner. Here are some methods by which the Council may achieve these objectives: 1. Oversight and transparency: The Council can encourage transparent decision-making processes within the European Parliament, particularly when it comes to introducing new benefits to members. By ensuring the involvement of all relevant parties, including the Quaestors, the possibility of introducing benefits without proper scrutiny is minimized. 2. Monitoring and evaluation: The Council can undertake periodic audits and evaluations of the Parliament's financial situation and budgetary management practices. This will ensure that funds are being managed prudently. These assessments can lead to recommendations for better practices and management of resources if needed. 3. Collaboration and cooperation: The Council can liaise with the European Parliament and other relevant institutional actors, such as the Committee on Budgetary Control, to ensure a well-coordinated approach to resource allocation and budgetary management. This collaboration can lead to more effective strategies and measures that prevent potential misuse of funds or irregular introduction of benefits. 4. Legislative power: The Council, as part of the legislative branch of the EU, has the power to adopt and amend budgets and regulations. This includes laying down rules and guidelines for the introduction of new benefits and the efficient use of allocated funds. The Council can act upon any findings or evidence of misuse, and propose necessary changes to financial regulations and controls to prevent any irregularities in the future. 5. Advocating for fiscal responsibility: The Council can actively promote a culture of fiscal responsibility within the European Parliament, by consistently emphasizing the importance of efficient and prudent use of funds. This can involve organizing workshops, discussions, and other events to raise awareness and understanding of budgetary management best practices among parliament members and staff. In conclusion, the Council holds several tools at its disposal to prevent the introduction of new benefits through non-transparent channels and to ensure the efficient and prudent use of funds allocated to the European Parliament. By making use of these methods, the Council can contribute to safeguarding EU taxpayers' interests and promoting an environment of fiscal responsibility at the institutional level."},{"instruction":"Roger Clemens, armed with blackmail defense, no longer looking like Hall of Famer as he stands trial Thursday, July 7th 2011, 10:45 AM As we move up on the end game for Roger Clemens, who won all those games in the big leagues, it appears this is the defense that is supposed to keep him out of a perjury conviction and out of jail:That his former trainer Brian McNamee kept syringes and blood and all the rest of it in case he might want to blackmail an innocent man someday. As one lawyer who has followed this case from the beginning, who has watched Clemens and his attorney Rusty Hardin bungle themselves all the way into Judge Reggie Walton's courtroom said, \\"(Hardin) keeps opening doors that he's never going to be able to close.\\" If you play out what Hardin is saying, or plans to say in front of the jury that will eventually decide Clemens' fate, McNamee devised this elaborate plan to blackmail Clemens for a baseball crime - using steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs - that Clemens swore in front of Congress that he did not commit. After what might be as much 8 million in legal fees already, coming in behind a whole squadron of lawyers for even pre-trial hearings, this is the best Clemens can do. McNamee didn't consider blackmailing Andy Pettitte, another one of his clients, did not consider blackmailing Chuck Knoblauch, did not consider blackmailing Mike Stanton. Just Clemens. Pettitte and Knoblauch and Stanton, they all will testify that McNamee told them exactly what kind of drugs he was giving them. They knew. But according to Rusty Hardin and Roger Clemens, the guy who only thought he was getting B-12 from McNamee - The Rocket himself - was the one who McNamee treated like a potential threat. He needed to have something on The Rocket, just in case, like he was saving up DNA for a rainy day. McNamee was doing this even though he still had the run of Clemens' house right up until George Mitchell's report on performance enhancing drugs in baseball was released to the public. And you have to know right here that Roger Clemens can beat this rap, whatever the facts of the case, whatever happens when the government and Clemens' lawyers go toe to toe. If Casey Anthony can beat the rap in Florida after the hideous death of her 2-year old daughter, anything is clearly possible in our jury system. But if Roger Clemens did use performance-enhancing drugs and then lie through his teeth about that to Congress, he deserves to be sent up. He does. You are not supposed to get away with that even if justice in a case like this comes at a high cost. It is, as they say, the price of doing business. And if you think the government shouldn't be worried about drugs in baseball, tell that to former President George W. Bush, who told baseball to do something about steroids or he would. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a famous baseball player named Roger Clemens. He was accused of using some special medicines, called performance-enhancing drugs, that are not allowed because they can make a player unfairly strong or fast. Roger told the big important people in Congress that he did not use these drugs. However, his trainer, a man named Brian McNamee, had kept some evidence like syringes and blood just in case he needed to prove that Clemens was not telling the truth. Clemens' lawyer, Rusty Hardin, thinks McNamee was trying to trick Clemens and say he did bad things so he could get something from him, like threatening to tell a secret unless he gets paid. This is called blackmail. The article is saying that it seems a bit strange that McNamee only tried to blackmail Clemens, and not any of his other clients, like Andy Pettitte, Chuck Knoblauch, or Mike Stanton. At the end, the article says that even if Clemens did really bad things, like using these drugs and lying about it, he might still not get in trouble because sometimes our system of deciding who is guilty or not doesn't always work perfectly. But the article also says that if he did lie, he should be punished because it's bad to lie, especially to important people like Congress."},{"instruction":"Do these questions have the same meaning?

All of a sudden the lift stopped. Although they didn't know what had happened outside, they had only 100 minutes to get out of the building before it would fall into the dust. Soon smoke began coming into the lift. The men knew that something was wrong. They tried to open the door but found a wall in front of them. The wall had the number 15 on it and they knew they were on the 15th floor. But their lift usually didn't stop there, so there was no opening for them to escape. Jan decided they would have to make their own.

Starting with one small hole, they cut through the three-inch-thick wall. Then they kicked hard at the wall. The wall cracked apart. They saw before them a tile wall! Refusing to give up, they knocked a hole through the tile, then made the opening big enough to get through. Surprisingly, the fire-fighters were outside the hole, they took Jan and his partners to the nearest stairs and they ran down the stairs as quickly as possible.

These skillets are strong and long-lasting, but to keep them working well, we need to follow some important steps. First, we should not use any soaps or detergents to clean our skillet. Soaps and detergents are like the bubble baths our toys take but using them on our cast iron skillets can hurt them. Just like we need to keep our toys dry, we also need to treat our skillets carefully. Next, we should never put the skillet in the dishwasher. You might ask why since our plates and cups go in there. Well, the dishwasher is like a giant water park for our dishes, but it is too rough for cast iron skillets. They need a special kind of cleaning that the dishwasher cannot give them. Lastly, try to avoid using steel wool to clean your cast iron cookery unless you really, really need to. Steel wool is like a tough scrubby brush but is made of strong metal. Just like it can hurt if you get scratched, it can hurt the skillet too. Only use steel wool if it's absolutely necessary, like if something is super stuck on the skillet and won't come off. To keep our cast iron skillets happy and ready for cooking, we should remember these three important rules: no soaps and detergents, never put them in the dishwasher, and only use steel wool when there's no other choice.

Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said.

Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party.

Answer: it is not possible to tell"},{"instruction":"Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who takes Jenny Schilt into the castle?, using the article: One evening near the small Serbian village of Stetl, early in the nineteenth century, schoolmaster Albert Müller witnesses his wife Anna taking a little girl, Jenny Schilt, into the castle of Count Mitterhaus, a reclusive nobleman rumored to be a vampire responsible for the disappearances of other children. The rumours prove true, as Anna, who has become Mitterhaus' willing acolyte and mistress, gives Jenny to him to be drained of her blood. Men from the village, directed by Müller and including Jenny's father Mr. Schilt and the Bürgermeister, invade the castle and attack the Count. After the vampire kills several of them, Müller succeeds in driving a wooden stake through his heart. With his dying breath, Mitterhaus curses the villagers, vowing that their children will die to give him back his life. The angry villagers force Anna to run a gauntlet, but when her husband intervenes, she runs back into the castle where the briefly revived Count tells her to find his cousin Emil at \\"the Circus of Night\\". After laying his body in the crypt, she escapes through an underground tunnel as the villagers blow the castle with gunpowder and set fire to it., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"Anna, the wife of schoolmaster Albert Müller, is the one who takes Jenny Schilt into the castle of Count Mitterhaus. In the context provided, Anna has become a willing acolyte and mistress to Count Mitterhaus, who is rumored to be a vampire. Under these circumstances, she delivers Jenny to him to be drained of her blood, thus contributing to the rumours circulating about other children's disappearances linked to Mitterhaus. Consequently, the villagers led by Müller, inclusive of Jenny's father Mr. Schilt, invade the castle and attack the vampire count. However, it is not until Müller drives a wooden stake through Mitterhaus' heart that the villagers are able to end his reign of terror. In a twist of events, Anna is pushed by the temporarily revived Count to escape and search for his cousin Emil at the \\"Circus of Night\\", henceforth only managing to escape the villagers' wrath due to an underground tunnel. Despite her escape, it is clear from the narrative that Anna is quintessentially responsible for taking Jenny into the vampire count's castle."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"Two dogs fight over a ball that's in a puddle.\\", is the sentence \\"Two cats share a ball.\\" a true sentence?

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Three Musketeers Context: D'Artagnan (Michael York) and his father (Joss Ackland) engage in an exhausting sparring duel. The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to. Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited...","output":"In the movie \\"The Three Musketeers,\\" Rochefort wounds D'Artagnan, the son of the protagonist, but he does not die. Instead, he continues to play a significant role in assisting the delivery of the complete necklace to the Queen. This resolute act saves the royal couple from the embarrassment which the Cardinal had plotted. The movie first establishes D'Artagnan's character through an emotionally charged sparring duel with his father. D'Artagnan's father imparts valuable advice and presents him with a family sword which had been used by him and his father before him in service to the King. Despite his young age, D'Artagnan sets out from home on his journey to Paris with the desire to become a musketeer. Upon arriving in Paris, troubles arise as D'Artagnan encounters Rochefort, a spy working for Cardinal Richelieu. The latter mocks D'Artagnan's horse, and in response, the young Gascon challenges him to a fight. Rochefort not only defeats D'Artagnan easily but also snaps his sword in half. The plot later reveals that Rochefort is assigned by Richelieu's accomplice, Milady DeWinter, to report on the Duke of Buckingham in England. Despite his defeat, D'Artagnan continues to seek his place among the musketeers. As he visits their headquarters, he meets some of the renowned members, including Porthos, Aramis, and Athos. Though initially denied a spot in the musketeers due to his inexperience, D'Artagnan is given the opportunity to prove himself through service in the guard. During his time with the guard, he becomes close friends with the aforementioned Three Musketeers. D'Artagnan eventually plays a pivotal role in foiling Cardinal Richelieu's devious plot. Learning of the scheme to embarrass the royal couple, he works alongside the Three Musketeers. They manage to prevent the Queen's necklace from falling into the hands of the Duke of Buckingham, thereby preserving the dignity and honor of the royal family and averting a potential scandal. In conclusion, the wounded but not dead character in the movie \\"The Three Musketeers\\" is D'Artagnan, who, despite facing hurdles, ends up forming an alliance with the Three Musketeers and aids the delivery of the complete necklace to the Queen. This act foils the calculated plot by Cardinal Richelieu to embarrass the royal couple and potentially destabilize their rule. D'Artagnan's determination and strong sense of justice contribute to his eventual acceptance within the musketeers' ranks and, ultimately, the preservation of the monarchy's honor."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - A man and woman mate - Embryo is C - Embryo grows and develops into a fetus inside the woman&#x27;s womb - The fetus is born - Begins to grow and develop through infancy and childhood - In the teenage years the human experiences puberty - Reaches sexual maturity - At 18 the human becomes an adult - Adult may procreate continuing the cycle. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose fewer conceptions take place happens, how will it affect MORE babies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context suggests that if fewer conceptions take place, it would lead to an increase in the number of babies being born. To analyze if this hypothesis has an effect (direct or indirect) on the entire process of human development and reproduction, we need to explore the possible reasons for this perturbation and examine its implications on the different stages of the process. There could be several reasons why fewer conceptions might be taking place. These include changes in social norms, economic factors, family planning, or medical advancements that could impact fertility rates, such as enhanced contraception usage or assisted reproductive technologies. We can analyze the impact of these factors on the process of human development and reproduction. 1. Changes in social norms: In contemporary societies, couples might decide to have fewer children due to evolving cultural and social norms that focus more on career development and personal growth. As a result, people might choose to have children later in life, invest more resources in raising those children, and have a higher quality of life. Impact on the process: As fewer conceptions take place, the overall population growth rate may decrease. However, it is also plausible that the babies who are born may receive more attention, care, and resources from their parents. This could lead to better physical, emotional, and cognitive development in those children, potentially contributing to a more advanced and healthy society in the long run. 2. Economic factors: Economic factors, such as financial stability and job opportunities, might influence family planning and parenthood decisions. If couples decide to have fewer children due to economic concerns or financial planning, this could result in a larger number of couples who are more financially stable when they eventually conceive. Impact on the process: With greater financial stability, parents would be able to provide more opportunities, resources, and education for their children. This could lead to an indirect positive effect on overall human development. However, a reduced birth rate may also have negative economic implications in the long term, as it might result in a shrinking workforce and an aging population. 3. Family planning and contraception: Advances in contraceptive methods and increased awareness of family planning could lead to fewer conceptions as couples choose when they want to have children. This might also contribute to a decrease in unplanned pregnancies. Impact on the process: By having greater control over family planning, couples might have children at a time when they are more prepared to care for them. This could lead to better overall development of children, as they are more likely to receive ample resources and care. On the other hand, increased use of contraception, particularly long-term methods, might have unintended consequences on fertility rates and population growth. 4. Medical advancements in fertility treatments and technologies: With the advancement of fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), couples who have difficulty conceiving naturally may still be able to have biological children. While this may lead to fewer overall conceptions, it might facilitate increased fertility rates in specific segments of the population. Impact on the process: Fertility treatments and technologies can help couples achieve their reproductive goals, even if natural conception rates are declining. This could lead to better family planning and raise the chances of healthy babies being born. However, the increased reliance on medical interventions might also have ethical implications, such as selective reproduction and concerns over the commercialization of reproduction. Based on this analysis, the perturbation hypothesis does have an effect (both direct and indirect) on the process of human development and reproduction. However, whether this effect is overall positive or negative depends on the specific reasons for fewer conceptions and the subsequent implications at each stage of the process. The long-term consequences of this perturbation will require further analysis and research to fully understand and manage."},{"instruction":"Sentence: \\"Jason persuaded Medea to try to run away.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would likely rate the sentence, \\"Jason persuaded Medea to try to run away,\\" as acceptable linguistically, based on several criteria. In assessing the linguistic acceptability of this sentence, one can consider various aspects such as syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 1. Syntax: In terms of syntax, this sentence adheres to the standard rules of English grammar. It follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) structure that is typical of English sentences. The subject, \\"Jason,\\" is followed by the verb \\"persuaded,\\" and then comes the object, \\"Medea.\\" Additionally, the infinitive phrase \\"to try\\" and the infinitive \\"to run away\\" are embedded within the sentence structure, providing further information about the nature of the persuasion. Nested phrases and complex verb structures are common in English, so this sentence aligns with syntactic norms. 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence conveys a clear meaning—that Jason persuaded Medea to attempt to run away. Each of the words contributes to the overall meaning, with the verb \\"persuaded\\" indicating an action that Jason took to convince Medea. \\"To try\\" implies that Medea is going to make an effort or attempt something, while \\"to run away\\" specifies the particular action she is encouraged to undertake. 3. Pragmatics: From a pragmatic perspective, the sentence provides sufficient context for understanding the intended message. It follows conversational norms by using language that is appropriate to its context. Assuming that the speaker and listener understand the referents \\"Jason\\" and \\"Medea,\\" the sentence communicates the notion that Jason convinced Medea to consider escaping from a particular situation. Moreover, this sentence resonates with a broader cultural context, as it refers to characters from Greek mythology: Jason, the leader of the Argonauts, and Medea, a sorceress who ends up helping and marrying Jason. For those familiar with these myths, the sentence fits within the realm of plausible scenarios that involve these characters, making it an acceptable statement from that aspect as well. In conclusion, since the sentence adheres to syntactic rules, displays clear semantics, and aligns well with the pragmatic context and broader cultural background, a linguist would likely rate it as acceptable linguistically."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given reviews from Amazon's food products and a summary of that review.

Although it is not explicitly mentioned why Casey stopped asking, it can be inferred that they did so because they did not receive any answers or information despite their efforts. This can lead to a sense of frustration based on the following factors: 1. Lack of progress: Not receiving the results from the project suggests that the project has not made progress or completed its objectives. When someone is invested in an assignment or is responsible for it, they want to see it succeed. If the results are not provided, it may indicate that there are roadblocks, delays, or even negligence from other team members, which can be frustrating. 2. Ineffective communication: Communication is key in any work environment, particularly when collaborating on a project. If the team members have not been transparent with Casey regarding the project's status, it can create a communication gap that leads to frustration and mistrust. 3. Limited involvement or influence: When an individual is not provided with the expected information, they may feel as if their involvement in the project is not valued or that they lack the influence to make things happen. This feeling of disconnect may further contribute to their frustration. 4. Uncertainty: Not having clarity about the project's status can be unsettling and nerve-wracking. It is challenging to make accurate decisions and plan for the future if crucial information is missing. This uncertainty adds to the frustration that Casey may feel in this situation. 5. Impact on personal performance: In many work environments, performance is assessed based on accomplishments and completion of assigned tasks. If the project's results are not available, Casey might be concerned about the possible negative impact on their personal performance evaluation or reputation.

Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question. \\"May I help you?\\" The worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry. Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French. So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated.

Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops. And the guitar's age contributed additional warmth to the tone.

Some random thoughts:","output":"To find the sale price of sarees after successive discounts of 10% and 5%, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Calculate the price after the first discount After a 10% discount, the price will be reduced by 10% of the original price. 10% of Rs.400 = (10/100) x 400 = 40 So, the price after the first discount is 400 - 40 = Rs.360. Step 2: Calculate the price after the second discount Now, apply the 5% discount on the price after the first discount (Rs.360). 5% of Rs.360 = (5/100) x 360 = 18 So, the price after the second discount is 360 - 18 = Rs.342.

The guide added that in both cases on thing is constant, they are attacked by the lions. In which case wildebeests would have lower risk of attack from the lions, case A or case B? The answer is:","output":"To determine which case has a lower risk of attack from lions, we will look at each case individually and analyze how the group size may affect the likelihood of attack. Case A: Large group of wildebeests 1. Due to the large number of wildebeests, there are more eyes and ears to detect potential danger. 2. Large groups can intimidate predators, making them less likely to attack. 3. Individual wildebeests are more likely to get lost in the crowd, making it difficult for lions to single out potential targets. Case B: Smaller groups of wildebeests 1. Smaller groups may not be as vigilant or as effective in detecting potential threats from lions. 2. A lion may be more likely to attempt an attack on a smaller group, as it is less intimidating. 3.

The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad.

As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue.

My personal favorite debate moment on Wednesday night was when the candidates were asked to describe themselves in one word and Newt Gingrich said “cheerful.” Not an adjective you frequently hear when Newt is the topic, but you do appreciate the aspiration, particularly when Mitt Romney went for “resolute.” Remember Newt Gingrich? Won the South Carolina primary? Now he’s an also-ran, and his latest solution to his dwindling poll numbers has been to buy time for an infomercial in which he sits behind a desk and talks about energy for 30 minutes. Newt has always had a touching faith in the attention span of the average voter. Over on the other end of the table — exciting breakthrough, that table — was Ron Paul. He, too, has a new TV ad, directed at the youth of America, which begins with a picture of Rick Santorum. “Is this dude serious?” the announcer demands. “Fiscal conservative? Really?” The ad then goes on to say that Santorum’s votes to raise the debt ceiling were “not groovy.” I am not an absolute expert on the speech patterns of young people, but I am feeling pretty confident that they do not use the word “groovy.” Still, welcome back, Ron Paul! Good luck with that recount of the Maine caucus vote! The prime seats at the center of the table went to Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, one of whom is going to be the nominee for president of the United States. Take your pick, Republicans. On one hand, the guy who once drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car. On the other, the guy who won his first Congressional race by criticizing his opponent for moving his family to Washington. And then later moved his own family to Washington, but said it didn’t count because the Senate was different from the House. Much of the debate involved the two front-runners squabbling, and Santorum proved that even if the subject was rutabagas, he would still find a way to point out that Massachusetts passed its universal health care law when Mitt Romney was governor. When the topic turned to a murky discussion of contraception, in which birth control pills seemed to get the blame for rising rates of unwed motherhood, Santorum suddenly said: “The whole reason this issue is alive is because of the bill that you drafted in Massachusetts, Romneycare.” Romney then announced that everything — I think this included both unwed motherhood and the Obama health care reform — happened because Santorum had endorsed Arlen Specter for the U.S. Senate in 2004. The Arizona crowd was totally on Romney’s side. This was no easy task, since it required a lot of booing and cheering at those obscure earmark arguments. But Mitt needed all the help he could get. He’s facing a must-win primary next week in Michigan, which is, of course, his home state. Along with Massachusetts and New Hampshire and California, where he has, um, homes. Michigan appears to be the only Romney home state where Romney does not have an actual residence. In his attempts to make up for that oversight, Mitt has really been laying it on thick. “I love this state!” he told Michiganders at one campaign stop. “It seems right here! Trees are the right height!” In another ploy to re-win the love of the state whose major industry he wanted to send into bankruptcy, Romney got Donald Trump to record robo-calls that will tell innocent Michigan phone answerers that Mitt Romney, is a “good man” while Rick Santorum, is a “career politician.” Romney thinks Michigan voters will like him better because he has earned the respect of Donald Trump. A person who claimed he had to postpone plans to run for president himself and save the nation because of a conflict with the airing dates for “Celebrity Apprentice.” Well, there’s always Santorum. The career politician! Actually, Trump was entirely unfair on this point — Santorum has been out of office since 2006, when he was defeated for re-election by one of the widest margins in American history. Take your pick, Republican primary voters. If neither one works for you, there’s always Newt. Or Ron Paul. Some choice, dudes.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Paragraph: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person's mutation can be passed on to their offspring? Answer:","output":"Given the paragraph above, Kim's mutation can be passed on to their offspring.

The matter forms on the sea floor: With more dead organisms, there will be more organic matter accumulating on the sea floor. 3. Layers of sediment form above the matter compressing it: More organic matter on the sea floor could lead to thicker layers of sediment, increasing the overall compression of the organic matter. 4. After many years, the matter is compressed and heated: The large amount of organic matter, combined with time, pressure, and heat, leads to the process of creating crude oil. 5.

Article: It was originally built to defend an empire ,but now parts of the Great Wall of China are crumbling so badly they need someone to hurry to their defense. About 2,000 kilometers, or 30%,of the ancient fortification built in the Ming Dynasty has disappeared due to natural and human damage, according to the Beijing Times. And the situation could worsen, experts are warning as not enough is being done to preserve what remains. \\"It's a great pity to witness the Great Wall in such terrible situation ,\\" Mei Jingtian, a volunteer who has worked for three decades to safeguard the structure and has founded the Great Wall Protection Association, tells CNN. About 8,000 kilometers of the structure dates from the Ming period between the 14th and 17th centuries and is considered by some to be the original Great Wall.Of this, 2,000 kilometers is made up of naturally occurring earthworks - and so only 6,000 kilometers of actual Ming dynasty wall was ever built. Stretches built in other eras make up a total length estimated up to 21,000 kilometers. Many visitors to china associate the Great Wall with a widely restored stretch of Ming era wall at Badaling near Beijing, but this is far from typical of most of the structure. According to a 2014 survey done by the Great Wall of China Society, only about 8.2% of the Great Wall is in good condition, with74. 1% classified as poorly preserved, \\"The Great Wall is a vast heritage site - over 20,000 kilometers - thus increasing the difficulty in preservation and restoration,\\" Dong Yaohui, deputy director of the Great Wall of China Society, tells CNN. \\"Reliance on a very small amount of manpower by the local heritage departments is not enough to guard and protect the site.\\" A recent increase in interest from tourists in visiting wild sections, known as the \\"Wild Great Wall,\\" has Accelerated its deterioration ,according to the report.

The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic No. 1 hit single, \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", as well as by hits such as \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\", \\"It's My Life\\", \\"I'm Crying\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\". The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-orientated album material. Context: The original Animals line-up of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler and Steel reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in December 1968 and re-formed in late 1975 to record again. Burdon later said nobody understood why they did this short reunion. They did a mini-tour in 1976 and shot a few videos of their new songs like \\"Lonely Avenue\\" and \\"Please Send Me Someone to Love\\". They released the album in 1977 aptly called Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted. The album received critical praise. Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demos at that time, which were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed together with Alan Price and a complete line-up, foreshadowing later events. All five original band members reunited again in 1983 for the album Ark and a world concert tour, supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards, Nippy Noya on percussion, Steve Gregory on saxophone and Steve Grant on guitar. The first single \\"The Night\\" reached #48 at the US Pop Singles and #34 at the Mainstream Rock Charts, also gaining success in Greece. They released a second single called \\"Love Is For All Time\\". The Ark tour consisted of about one-third material from the original 1960s and two-thirds material from Ark or other songs. The latter included the songs \\"Heart Attack\\", \\"No More Elmore\\" (both released a year earlier by Burdon), \\"Oh Lucky Man\\" (from the 1973 soundtrack album to O Lucky Man! by Price), \\"It's Too Late\\", \\"Tango\\", and \\"Young Girls\\" (later released on Burdon's compilation, The Night). On 9 September, they had their first show in New York at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center, the tickets for which sold out. A Wembley Arena concert followed on 31 December (supporting The Police) which was released on the Rip it To Shreds live album in 1984 after they had disbanded again. Their concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in Royal Oak, Michigan on 29 November 1983 was released on 27 February 2008, as Last Live Show. A film about the reunion tour was shot but never released. Chas Chandler died from an aneurysm in 1996, putting an end to any possibility of another reunion of the full original line-up. Question: After the reunion did they do another incarnation?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, after the reunion, The Animals had another incarnation. They first reunited in the late 1970s, and then again in 1983 for the album \\"Ark\\" and a world concert tour. They had new members join them, like Zoot Money, Nippy Noya, Steve Gregory, and Steve Grant. They performed songs from the 1960s and some new ones too. But after Chas Chandler passed away in 1996, the full original line-up couldn't reunite again."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The film opens on 12 April 1945 with the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the succession of Harry Truman to the presidency.

American battle casualties have almost reached 900,000, with Japanese casualties at 1.1 million, and some 8 million Asian civilians have died in the war that began with Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. The new president knows nothing about the nuclear weapons being developed at Los Alamos, and he must soon decide on whether to use them and how. The US Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, has doubts even about the wisdom of the American fire-bombing raids on Japan. \\"One of these Gadgets [bombs]\\", U.S. Secretary of State James F.

Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. Context: Usher developed a friendship with American record producer, Jermaine Dupri, with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, My Way, released on September 16, 1997. The album's lead single, \\"You Make Me Wanna...\\", reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher's first record to be top single; the record led to his popularity reaching in the country. It also became Usher's first gold- and platinum-certified single in the United States. The album's second single, \\"Nice & Slow\\", peaked in January 1998 at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Usher his first US number-one single. In February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA. My Way has been certified six-time platinum in the United States. \\"You Make Me Wanna...\\" won the Best Male R&B/Soul Single at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards. In the closing months of 1997, Usher embarked on a series of tour engagements including a spot on Puffy's No Way Out tour, dates with Mary J. Blige, and the opening spot on Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope Tour. Usher's first concert album, Live, was released in 1999, which featured appearances by Lil' Kim, Jagged Edge, Trey Lorenz, Shanice, Twista and Manuel Seal; the album has been certified gold in the United States. Usher made his acting debut on the UPN television series Moesha, which resulted in a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998's The Faculty. Usher's extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year as he was cast in the soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful. He completed two more films, She's All That, and his first starring role in Light It Up. He also appeared in the Disney TV movie Geppetto. Usher's third studio album, originally titled All About U, was slated to be released in early 2001. The first single, \\"Pop Ya Collar\\", was released in late 2000 and became a number two hit in the UK but underperformed in the United States. The album was subsequently pushed back and retooled after select tracks were later leaked to the radio and Internet. After having revised and renamed to 8701, the album was released August 7, 2001 (8.7.01). The first two singles \\"U Remind Me\\" and \\"U Got It Bad\\" each topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four and six weeks, respectively. 8701 has been certified four-time platinum in the United States. Usher appeared in the 2001 film Texas Rangers. In February 2002, Usher won a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for \\"U Remind Me\\". The next year, he won the same award for \\"U Don't Have to Call\\", making Usher the only artist aside from Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder to win this award consecutively. In summer 2002, Usher contributed vocals to P. Diddy's \\"I Need a Girl, Part I\\".

Article: We are surrounded by mixed messages about mistakes: we're told we earn by making them, but we work hard to avoid them. So the result is that most of us know that we are going to make mistakes, but deep down, we feel we shouldn't. Experiments with schoolchildren who did well on a given test show that those who were praised for being smart and then offered a more challenging or less challenging task afterward usually chose the easier one. On the other hand, children praised for trying hard-rather than being smart-far more often selected the more difficult task. If we try hard to avoid mistakes, we aren't open to getting the information we need in order to do better. In a writing study, experiments showed that those who are so scared to make mistakes perform worse in writing tasks than those who aren't as worried about being perfect. They fear receiving any kind of negative feedback, so they don't learn where they went wrong and how to get better. We don't just learn more when we're open to mistakes, we learn deeper. Research tells us that if we're only concerned about getting the right answer, we don't always learn the underlying concepts that help us truly understand whatever we're trying to figure out. Mistakes need to be seen not as a failure to learn, but as a guide to what still needs to be learned. As Thomas Edison said, \\"I am not discouraged, because every abandoned wrong attempt is another step forward. \\" Furthermore, we often make mistakes because we try new things-we wander away from accepted paths. Teflon, penicillin-these are examples of great discoveries made by mistake. Take a page from Albert Einstein, who said, \\"Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. \\" Question: What will happen to students praised for being smart in face of choosing tasks compared to students praised for working hard? Options: A: He will choose a less challenging task. B: He will hide his mistakes from his teachers. C: He will work harder to avoid mistakes. D: He will ask his teachers for advice. The answer to this question is:","output":"A: He will choose a less challenging task. The article differentiates between students being praised for their innate intelligence (\\"being smart\\") and those being praised for their effort or hard work. In the series of experiments discussed, students who were complimented on their intelligence often avoided taking on a more challenging task because they were afraid of making mistakes. This suggests a fear of damaging the perception of them \\"being smart.\\" In comparison, students praised for their dedication and effort were more willing to take on more difficult tasks. They were not scared of errors, as those weren't perceived as a direct threat to their identity but rather seen as opportunities for improvement and learning. Hence, students who are praised for being \\"smart\\" may tend to select less challenging tasks due to their apprehension about making mistakes and potentially jeopardizing the perception of their intelligence. This aligns with option A, that such a student \\"will choose a less challenging task.\\" The other options do not correspond with the information presented in the article: - B: There's no indication that students praised for being smart hide their mistakes from their teachers. - C: It's not specifically mentioned that these students would work harder to avoid mistakes. The article suggests they might avoid situations (i.e., harder tasks) where mistakes are more likely, but doesn't imply they will work harder in general. - D: The article doesn't suggest that students praised for being smart are more likely to ask teachers for advice."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Sydney was painting Alex's nails because of the dance that weekend.

It is possible that M had previously mentioned to W about an upcoming exam, which is why W was surprised to hear that M was asleep at home instead of taking the exam. M had been feeling sick with a fever and had stayed in bed, unable to attend the exam. This information was likely shared between M and W before this conversation, as W inquires about M's health and shows concern for M's well-being. As the conversation progresses, we learn that M has spoken to their professor about missing the exam due to illness. We can assume that prior to this conversation, M had communicated with the professor to explain their situation, and the professor allowed M to take a makeup exam at a later date. Before this conversation, it is also probable that M had expressed their need to visit a drugstore to purchase aspirin, since W knows about M's plan to stop there on the way home. Additionally, W might be aware of M's transportation situation, as they discuss M not bringing their car. In summary, while we do not have the exact details of the conversation held between M and W prior to the provided conversation, we can infer that they had discussed M's upcoming exam, their health condition, the conversation M had with their professor about making up the exam, and the need for M to visit the drugstore."},{"instruction":"Given the question: If burning spruce is used to produce heat, then what is burned to produce heat?

The scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from Sudan. A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the Mahdist Army in 1896, and rebuffed a French attempted invasion at Fashoda in 1898.

In test A, whose substance would have higher temperature, John or Keith? John an Keith are coworkers in a chemistry lab. Yesterday, they conducted there tests, test A, test B, and test C. In test A, John kept a substance in solid state, but Keith changed the same substance from solid to liquid state. In test B, John conducted a chemical reaction in low temperature, but Keith conducted the same chemical reaction in high temperature. Finally, in test C, John kept an unstable material in room temperature, but Keith kept the same unstable material in a cool container. Hint: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. Answer:","output":"In test A, Keith's substance would have a higher temperature than John's substance. This is inferred from the information provided in the paragraph, which states that both John and Keith were working with the same substance. In test A, John kept the substance in a solid state, while Keith transformed the substance from a solid to a liquid state. Since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter, and it is mentioned that when a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is due to an increase in the temperature of the material, we can conclude that the change in state for Keith's substance indicates a higher temperature than John's substance. Thus, in test A, Keith's substance would have a higher temperature compared to John's substance."},{"instruction":"The top 50 m (160 ft) of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure. This upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than 46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form.

Born on March 5, 1898, Misao Okawa turns 117 tomorrow, and even she's not entirely sure why. \\"I wonder about that, too,\\" she told the AP, adding that to her, her life span has \\"seemed rather short.\\" Huffington Post and USA Today say Okawa is one of just five people alive today who were born in the 1800s, which means she's experienced three separate centuries, 20 US presidents, and a slew of technological wonders, from cars and planes to the advent of social media, Guinness World Records notes. Okawa, who married husband Yukio in 1919, has three children, four grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren, per the AP; sadly, Yukio died when she was in her early 30s—meaning she's been a widow for almost 84 years. The head of the Osaka nursing home where the spunky centenarian lives says she loves sushi (\\"particularly mackerel on vinegar-steamed rice\\") and makes sure she gets at least eight hours of sleep each night, the Telegraph reports. \\"Eat and sleep and you will live a long time. You have to learn to relax,\\" she says in a message to the paper. Okawa took over the honors of the world's oldest after Jiroemon Kimura, also of Japan, died at age 116 in 2013, Guinness notes; the average life span for a Japanese woman is nearly 86 years, the records group adds. The Wall Street Journal noted in 2012 that there were more than 50,000 centenarians in Japan, and the Telegraph points out that experts have cited that country's healthcare program, respect for its elders, and a nutritious diet of fish, rice, and vegetables as being partly responsible for citizens' longevity. Expand this summary.","output":"Sure little buddy, let me explain it to you! There is a really, really, really old lady in Japan who just turned 117 years old. That's more than twice your grandma's age! Her name is Misao Okawa and she was born way back in March 5, 1898. She said her life has gone by really fast, kind-of like how you feel when you're having fun at the playground and then it's suddenly time to go home. Guess what? She's one of just five people still alive who were born in the 1800s. That means she's lived through three whole centuries. Can you imagine that? She's seen 20 different US presidents, and all kinds of cool inventions like cars, planes, and even the internet! Misao got married to a man named Yukio in 1919, and they had three children. Now, she has four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. But, Yukio died when she was very young, about in her 30s. So she's been without her husband for a very, very long time. She lives in a nursing home in Osaka, Japan. The people who take care of her there say that she really loves sushi, especially mackerel on a special kind of rice. She also makes sure she sleeps a lot every night - at least eight hours, just like you! She thinks the secret to living a long time is to eat, sleep, and know how to relax. After a man named Jiroemon Kimura, who was also from Japan and 116 years old, died in 2013, Misao became the world's oldest person. You know, girls in Japan almost live to be 86 years old on average. When we last checked in 2012, there were more than 50,000 old folks who were 100 years or older in Japan. The experts think part of why they live so long is that Japan does good job taking care of its old folks, feeds everyone good food like fish, rice, and vegetables, and they sleep a lot, like Misao."},{"instruction":"Q:The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose body was flown to Adelaide? is inside the article: By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration.

Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\".

The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a rundown slum, with very little food and rats for pets. He gets out of bed wearing a t-shirt with the Superman crest.

A step-by-step solution is:","output":"To determine if the sentence \\"A little boy attempts to fix his bike.\\" implies that \\"A boy standing near a broken bike.\\" is true, we can break down and analyze the meaning of each sentence, and then draw a comparison. Step 1: Analyze Sentence 1 – \\"A little boy attempts to fix his bike.\\" In this sentence, we have the following elements: - A subject: \\"a little boy\\" - An action: \\"attempts to fix\\" - An object: \\"his bike\\" The sentence describes a situation where a young boy is trying to repair his own bicycle. Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2 – \\"A boy standing near a broken bike.\\" In this sentence, we have the following elements: - A subject: \\"a boy\\" - An action/state: \\"standing near\\" - An object: \\"a broken bike\\" The sentence describes a scenario where a boy is standing close to a damaged bicycle. Step 3: Compare Sentence 1 and Sentence 2. Let's compare the main elements of both sentences: - Subject: Both sentences feature a boy, with the first sentence specifying the boy as \\"a little boy.\\" Although there's no direct age statement in the second sentence, we can assume that it's the same boy. The subjects are similar enough. - Action: The first sentence describes an action \\"attempts to fix\\" which implies an effort being made to repair the bike. In the second sentence, the action is a state of being \\"standing near\\", implying that the boy is just close to the broken bike. - Object: In the first sentence, the object is \\"his bike\\", implying ownership. In the second sentence, the object is \\"a broken bike\\" which indicates a damaged bicycle without explicitly stating ownership, though it can be inferred. Step 4: Conclusion While both sentences convey similar situations concerning a boy and a bike, the second sentence doesn't explicitly state that the boy is trying to fix the bicycle. It only mentions that he is standing near a broken bike, which could be his or someone else's. However, we can infer that in both scenarios, a boy is near a damaged bike, so it is somewhat true that \\"A boy standing near a broken bike\\" can be deduced from the given sentence \\"A little boy attempts to fix his bike.\\" The main difference between the two sentences is the specific action (attempting to fix vs. standing near) being undertaken by the boy."},{"instruction":"Short movie review: a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Step 1: Understand the movie plot The plot of the movie involves a black man who experiences humiliation by a pack of dogs that are smarter than him.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a legal settlement reached by Pfizer Inc., the world's largest pharmaceutical company, to resolve personal-injury claims related to asbestos-containing products sold by a subsidiary company in the 1970s. To provide more context, asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that was widely used in several industries due to its insulating, fire-resistant, and tensile-strength properties. However, it became well-known that prolonged exposure to asbestos fibers could lead to severe health problems, most notably mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer that affects the lining of the lungs, chest, and abdomen. Throughout the 1970s, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. had manufactured and sold products that contained asbestos. People who were exposed to these products filed personal-injury claims against the company. These claims alleged that the company was negligent and responsible for the harm caused by these asbestos-containing products, likely due to a lack of proper warnings and safety measures to protect those who were at risk of exposure. In light of these claims, Pfizer Inc. opted to resolve the situation by agreeing to pay a significant amount of money, 430 million, to settle these personal-injury cases. This decision was likely made to avoid further legal complications, address the damage caused to those affected, and maintain its corporate reputation. By agreeing to pay the settlement, Pfizer acknowledged that it was accountable for the health issues suffered by the claimants who were exposed to the asbestos-containing products sold by its subsidiary. The settlement highlights the importance of corporate accountability, especially in cases where public health and safety are at stake. Companies must ensure that their products are safe for use and should take responsibility for any harm caused by their products, whether directly or through their subsidiaries. Furthermore, this case serves as a reminder that the effects of harmful substances, such as asbestos, can persist for decades after initial exposure, emphasizing the need for ongoing regulation and vigilance in protecting public health."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a question and a context passage.

The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince, and has become a dominant trend in phonology. The appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements (e.g. features) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of 'substance-free phonology', especially Mark Hale and Charles Reiss.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"In the context of the development of Optimality Theory at the LSA summer institute in 1991 by Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky, the concept of constraints and their importance in phonology and morphology is crucial for understanding the overall architecture of languages. The main idea of Optimality Theory is that languages choose the pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints that are ordered by importance, allowing for a lower-ranked constraint to be violated in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint. Regarding the question of which aspect – phonology or morphology – has more importance with constraints, it is essential to first understand the distinction between the two. Phonology is the study of the distribution and patterning of speech sounds, or phonemes, in a language while morphology is concerned with the structure and formation of words through the combination of morphemes, which are the smallest units of meaning in a language. In Optimality Theory, both phonological and morphological constraints play significant roles in determining the pronunciation and structure of words in a language. However, their importance may vary depending on the specific linguistic context and the properties of the language in question. In the original development of Optimality Theory, the primary focus was on phonological constraints. These constraints govern aspects such as syllable structure, assimilation, and stress placement in a language. The theory suggests that languages have an inventory of possible phonological constraints, and each language has its own specific ranking of these constraints, which determines the possible pronunciations of a word. Soon after the introduction of Optimality Theory, its scope was extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince. Morphological constraints deal with issues such as the arrangement of morphemes in a word, the selection of specific allomorphs (variant forms of a morpheme), and the realization of inflectional and derivational morphology in a language. Like phonological constraints, morphological constraints are ranked according to their importance in a language, with lower-ranked constraints being violated when necessary to satisfy higher-ranked constraints. Overall, both phonological and morphological constraints hold importance in the structure and pronunciation of words in a language under the framework of Optimality Theory. Their relative importance may depend on the linguistic context and specific properties of the language under analysis. It is essential to note, however, that Optimality Theory and its grounding on phonetic substance have been criticized by proponents of \\"substance-free phonology,\\" such as Mark Hale and Charles Reiss. These critics argue against the reliance on phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements like features, suggesting alternative ways to approach the study of phonology and morphology without assuming predetermined linguistic elements based on phonetic substance. Despite these criticisms, Optimality Theory remains a dominant trend in the study of phonology and morphology and sheds light on the importance of constraints and their relative ranking in the organization of linguistic systems."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: My parents influenced us with the concepts of family, faith and love for one's motherland when l was young.Even though we struggled to make ends meet, they stressed how fortunate we were to live in a great country with limitless opportunities.

Lola had agreed to meet Manni at the crime scene and to drive him to deliver the money to his boss, Ronnie. Lola tried to do so, but her moped was stolen en route to meet Manni. When Lola failed to arrive on time, Manni, carrying the cash in a bag, took a subway train. Manni panicked when he saw ticket inspectors in his car. He fled and thoughtlessly left the bag of money on the subway because he does not have a subway ticket. As he does, Manni spotted a homeless man examining Manni's money bag in the subway car. Manni, realizing what he had done, pursued the train as it departed, only to find the man and the money gone. Manni calls Lola from a phone booth. He complains that Lola let him down.

Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.

Immunoassays are not explicitly \\"banned\\" from being anything in particular, but they do have some limitations and restrictions in terms of their applications. 1. Inaccuracy: Immunoassays may sometimes result in false positives or negatives, as there is the potential for cross-reactivity with non-target substances. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay are crucial factors in determining its accuracy. 2. Ethical and legal considerations: Immunoassays that involve the use of samples from individuals or animals might be subject to ethical or legal regulations. The procuring, storage, and handling of samples must adhere to established guidelines to protect privacy and ensure animal welfare. 3. Intellectual property rights: The development and use of specific immunoassays may also be subject to patents and proprietary rights. Unauthorized use of proprietary techniques may result in legal challenges. 4. Environmental and safety concerns: Certain immunoassays may require the use of hazardous materials, such as toxic chemicals or radioisotopes. Thus, these immunoassays must adhere to regulations for appropriate handling, storage, and disposal of these substances. 5. Application limitations: Immunoassays are primarily designed for the detection or quantification of specific antigens or antibodies; their applicability across diverse biological systems or purposes may be limited.

Input: Question: What is the population of the place where the extension would connect to West Kirby? Passage 1:In 1873, the Hoylake and Birkenhead Railway was authorised to construct two extensions to its lines. One was a short connecting section near to Birkenhead docks, and the other was the extension from Hoylake to West Kirby. The station and the extension were opened on 1 April 1878 as the terminus of the Wirral Railway's route from Birkenhead Park station. The station's original signal box was built in 1886, to a London and North Western Railway (LNWR) design. This signal box was removed and replaced in 1932. After the opening of the Mersey Railway Tunnel in 1886, carriages were operated through Birkenhead Park, every half-hour, all the way to James Street station in Liverpool. As traffic increased, the line into West Kirby was doubled, from a single track, in 1896. After a board meeting on 28 October 1895, it was decided to extend the line from Hooton, into West Kirby. The station was relocated on the western side of the original station, with an enlarged island platform and rebuilt, in 1898-9, in red brick, with a turreted clock tower and mock Tudor frontage. A further platform was constructed for the Hooton line, on the eastern side of the original station. The site of the original station was used for goods sidings. In the present day, this is the site of The Concourse, a community building operated by Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council. Passage 2:Meléndez began his wrestling career in 1951 at age 18. During a lengthy tenure in his native Puerto Rico, he went under various monikers and learned the ropes with the likes of Pedro Morales and Carlos Colón Sr.. Meléndez made his United States debut at Sunnyside Garden in Long Island, New York in 1963. Primarily using the name Gypsy Joe by this point, he mainly worked for Nick Gulas and later Jerry Jarrett in the Southeastern region, particularly Mid-Southern Wrestling. During his Gulas run, he was often teamed with heels like Tojo Yamamoto, with whom he formed the No Pain Train, and The Cuban Assassin. He also joined forces with Frank Martinez to be collectively known as the Blue Infernos. The masked duo would attain tag team championships on numerous occasions. By the 1970s, Gypsy Joe was a local star of Chattanooga, Tennessee, regularly performing at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Auditorium on Saturdays and appearing on local WDEF-TV. His career wasn't limited to the South, however, winning championships around the country as well as in Canada’s Stampede Wrestling.

We need to add the two \\"x\\" parts on the right side: 149*x + 161*x = (149 + 161) * x = 310*x So now our equation looks like: -271*x - 19173 = 310*x 2.

The trauma activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he kills Thomas, who reveals that he is James's real father. James flees along with Thomas's son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James defends Victor and the two are sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody, and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but the group's (especially Victor's) disregard for human life causes James to leave. Six years later, James (now using the name Logan) is working as a lumberjack in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero approach Logan at work.

Thus, let me expand on the topic of writing a brief sentence and its significance in various forms of communication. A brief sentence is a concise statement that captures the essence of an idea or presents information in a clear, easily digestible manner. It is vital for effective communication, especially in our fast-paced world where attention spans are shorter, and the need for quick comprehension of complex topics is more critical than ever. The art of crafting a brief sentence is exemplified through various mediums, such as headlines, product descriptions, and slogans. In each medium, communicating the core message with brevity and clarity is the primary goal. Digital and print media, for example, employ brief sentences to entice readers, promote products, and deliver news efficiently. In the context of journalism, a brief sentence can often be found in article headlines or abstracts. By providing a short, informative statement, editors can showcase the main points of a news story, enabling readers to decide whether to delve deeper into the article. Social media also benefits from short sentences, as users have limited character-counts to express themselves or share content. For instance, Twitter enforces a 280-character limit, pushing users to craft concise and informative tweets. Moreover, brevity is essential in marketing and advertising. Crafting compelling taglines or product descriptions requires skillful manipulation of language to provoke a response from potential customers. For example, Nike's \\"Just Do It\\" slogan is not only memorable but also effectively communicates the brand's philosophy in a mere three words. Additionally, brief sentences are crucial in academic and business writing. Abstracts must concisely summarize research, and executive summaries must quickly present essential information for decision-making. In both instances, writing long-winded explanations could obscure the main points and hinder understanding. However, it is also crucial to maintain a balance between brevity and completeness. While a brief sentence aims to capture the essence of an idea, reducing complex arguments or data to a singular statement can sometimes lead to oversimplification or misinterpretation. In conclusion, brief sentences hold immense importance in multiple areas, including journalism, marketing, academic writing, and social media. The ability to convey information effectively and efficiently through a short statement is vital for clear communication and a successful exchange of ideas."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a movie review?","output":"Title: \\"The Shape of Water\\" - A Beautiful Blend of Romance, Fantasy, and Thriller Director: Guillermo del Toro Starring: Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer, Doug Jones Release Date: December 1, 2017 Rating: 4.5/5 Stars --------------------------------------- \\"The Shape of Water\\" is a visually-stunning, emotionally-driven, and genre-blending masterpiece that stands out as one of the most memorable films of 2017. Directed and co-written by visionary filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, this exceptional romantic fantasy thriller proves yet again that love transcends boundaries, language, and form. Set in the Cold War-era United States, the plot revolves around Elisa Esposito (played exquisitely by Sally Hawkins), a mute janitor working in a hidden, high-security government laboratory in Baltimore. Elisa's isolated world is filled with routine and a limited social circle, primarily consisting of her sassy, dedicated coworker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and her kindhearted, closeted neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins). The mundane days of Elisa's life suddenly take a magical turn when an enigmatic, humanoid, amphibious creature (portrayed by Doug Jones) is brought to the facility for top-secret research. Chained and tortured under the ruthless supervision of the villainous Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), the creature and Elisa form an unlikely bond. Their connection transcends the linguistic barrier as they communicate through sign language, music, and shared experiences. As the film unfolds, it masterfully weaves together a tale of undying love, hope, and courage. The narrative subverts traditional fish-out-of-water stories and sheds light on the monstrous side of humanity in the process. It also tackles broader themes such as Cold War-era paranoia, discrimination, and the complexities of trying to do the right thing. The performances of \\"The Shape of Water\\" are undoubtedly top-notch. Hawkins delivers an extraordinary portrayal of Elisa as she expresses a myriad of emotions despite her character being unable to speak – a feat that showcases her immense talent. Her chemistry with Doug Jones' character is both convincing and enchanting, making their interspecies romance a heartwarming and thought-provoking affair. The supporting cast members, particularly Spencer, Jenkins, and Michael Stuhlbarg, also add to the film’s richness and authenticity with their well-rounded, beautifully-acted characters. Shannon, as the antagonist, is both terrifying and deeply flawed, leaving a lingering impact on the audience. Visually, \\"The Shape of Water\\" is a feast for the eyes. Del Toro's penchant for breathtaking otherworldly realms is on full display, with magnificent set designs and stunning cinematography by Dan Laustsen. The color palette drenched in greens and blues adds to the underwater ambiance – an element that bolsters the film’s ethereal quality. This achievement is further amplified by the creature's intricate design, makeup, and prosthetics, which took months of rigorous work to perfect. Alexandre Desplat's lush, mesmerizing score is the cherry on top of this cinematic delicacy, providing the perfect accompaniment to the poetically-crafted sequences of Elisa and the creature's world. In conclusion, \\"The Shape of Water\\" is an incredible, must-watch film that pushes the boundaries of storytelling with its remarkable fusion of romance, fantasy, and thriller. Guillermo del Toro once again proves that he is a master of his craft, creating an enchanting, thought-provoking fairytale for adults that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on viewers long after the credits have rolled."},{"instruction":"In 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, Lin Zexu, to curb smuggling. This resulted in the First Opium War (1839–42). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations. The Jardines and Apcar and Company dominated the trade, although P&O also tried to take a share. A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the importation of opium. Legalisation stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey and Persia.

However, the rapid increase in drone usage has raised significant concerns about the potential encroach of privacy and civil liberties. Lawmakers in Congress have been warned about the nightmare scenario these UAVs could present, fueling an urgent debate in the legislative chambers. The Emergence of Drones In the twenty-first century, drones have emerged as disruptive technology that has found numerous applications. Originally developed for military purposes, drones have been employed in non-combat roles such as aerial surveillance, search and rescue, firefighting, and even delivering packages. The demand for drone technology has grown exponentially, with private citizens, corporations, and government agencies seeking to take advantage of their convenience and versatility. The Threat to Civil Liberties Despite their usefulness and novel applications, drones also present significant risks to civil liberties and privacy. ACLU legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani cautioned Congress about the potential risk of an Orwellian society where the government uses drones to spy on law-abiding citizens, making it nearly impossible for them to enjoy their right to privacy. Drones are equipped with cameras and other surveillance devices that can capture detailed images and videos of individuals, which could be used maliciously by law enforcement or third parties to invade citizens' privacy or track their activities. The lack of transparency and public knowledge regarding data collection and storage policies further exacerbates these concerns and erodes public trust. Congressional Concerns and Actions Members of Congress have taken heed of the warnings and are working on legislation to address the potential threats that drones pose to civil liberties and privacy. Some lawmakers have suggested imposing strict regulations on the use of drones, particularly by law enforcement, to prevent abuse of power and unwarranted surveillance. Furthermore, Congress may consider requiring specific warrants or establishing particular criteria for drone use in domestic investigations or specialized missions. They may also push for legislation that enforces transparency and accountability when it comes to data collection, storage, and sharing policies. Balancing Innovation and Privacy In the quest to balance innovation and privacy rights, stakeholders need to tread carefully to ensure that regulations do not impede the growth of the drone industry while also adequately protecting citizen's rights. As drones continue to advance in technology and application, it is essential for public and private sectors to work collaboratively, establishing a dialogue on ethical and legal norms surrounding UAV usage. The Role of the Public The public also has a crucial role in determining the future trajectory of drone technology and its impact on civil liberties. By engaging with lawmakers and demanding transparency, citizens can influence the nature of regulations and ensure their concerns are addressed. In working together with legislators, civil society, and drone industry representatives, the public can create an environment where drones serve the public interest without compromising personal freedom and privacy. Conclusion The rapid increase in drone applications brings with it both immense potential and significant challenges. While drones promise to revolutionize industries and daily life, they also present a potential nightmare scenario for civil liberties and privacy. By acknowledging the potential risks and implementing appropriate legislative measures alongside public engagement, Congress can protect citizens' rights while supporting the growth of a valuable and innovative industry."},{"instruction":"rooms here will provide you with apple tv's, usb chargers, free high speed internet access, air conditioning, a minibar, tea/coffee making facilities, and a seating area.

Historically, the member peoples of the Confederacy were nomadic bison hunters and trout fishermen, who ranged across large areas of the northern Great Plains of western North America, specifically the semi-arid shortgrass prairie ecological region. The Niitsitapi main source of food on the plains was the American bison (buffalo), the largest mammal in North America, standing about 6 1/2 feet (2.0 m) tall and weighing up to 2,000 pounds (910 kg). Before the introduction of horses, the Niitsitapi needed other ways to get in range. The buffalo jump was one of the most common ways. The hunters would round up the buffalo into V-shaped pens, and drive them over a cliff (they hunted pronghorn antelopes in the same way). Afterwords the hunters would go to the bottom and take as much meat as they could carry back to camp. They also used camouflage for hunting. The hunters would take buffalo skins from previous hunting trips and drape them over their bodies to blend in and mask their scent. By subtle moves, the hunters could get close to the herd. When close enough, the hunters would attack with arrows or spears to kill wounded animals. The people used virtually all parts of the body and skin. The women prepared the meat for food: by boiling, roasting or drying for jerky. This processed it to last a long time without spoiling, and they depended on bison meat to get through the winters. The winters were long, harsh, and cold due to the lack of trees in the Plains, so people stockpiled meat in summer. As a ritual, hunters often ate the bison heart minutes after the kill. The women tanned and prepared the skins to cover the tepees. These were made of log poles, with the skins draped over it. The tepee remained warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and was a great shield against the wind. The women also made clothing from the skins, such as robes and moccasins, and made soap from the fat. Both men and women made utensils, sewing needles and tools from the bones, using tendon for fastening and binding. The stomach and bladder were cleaned and prepared for use for storing liquids. Dried bison dung was fuel for the fires. The Niitsitapi considered the animal sacred and integral to their lives. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what was the importance and uses of bison?","output":"The importance and uses of bison for the Niitsitapi can be summarized from the quote: \\"The people used virtually all parts of the body and skin.

A grandmother has finally won a 40 year battle to have a lamppost removed from the middle of her driveway. The streetlight was put up outside the £160,000 home of Kath Jones, 72, when the estate in Bayston Hill, Shropshire, was being built in the 1970s. Mrs Jones said at the time of its construction, her late husband Albert pleaded with their local authorities to shift the lamppost by just two metres because he had already laid foundations for a garage. She said the couple even offered to pay for the work themselves but their pleas were ignored by highways bosses at Bayston Hill Parish Council. Mrs Jones says the lamppost has caused her a headache ever since with the widow damaging her car while pulling off her driveway six times in the last few years. But after more than four decades of complaining to the authority they have finally accepted her offer to pay £500 from her own pocket to have it removed. Emma Kay, Bayston Hill Parish Council. clerk, claimed the situation had only been brought to her attention two. months ago and confirmed work would begin soon.

Plot title: The Ten Commandments Movie plot: Pharaoh Rameses I of Egypt has ordered the death of all the firstborn Hebrew male infants after hearing the prophecy of the Deliverer, but a Hebrew mother named Yoshebel saves her own infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile. Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses. Many years later, Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with Ethiopia and then entering Egypt into an alliance with them. Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. An incident occurs when an elderly woman is almost crushed to death when her sash gets caught under the slab of stone, prompting Moses to scold overseer Baka. Moses frees the elderly woman, not realizing that she is his natural mother, Yoshebel.

Which flowering plant genus, Pelargonium or Sutherlandia, includes about 200 species of perennials, succulents, and shrubs, commonly known as geraniums? A:","output":"Pelargonium The flowering plant genus that includes about 200 species of perennials, succulents, and shrubs, commonly known as geraniums, is Pelargonium. This genus is a member of the Geraniaceae family, which also includes other genera apart from Pelargonium, such as Geranium and Erodium. Although often called geraniums, Pelargonium species are not true geraniums. True geraniums belong to the Geranium genus, another member of the same Geraniaceae family. The confusion between the two genera arises from the historical use of the common name \\"geranium\\" to describe all members of the Geraniaceae family. Pelargonium is native to South Africa, and many species have been brought to Europe and other parts of the world as ornamental plants, thanks to their beautiful and vivid flowers. They are mostly found along the eastern part of the Cape Provinces and the Northern Provinces of South Africa. Pelargonium plants exhibit a variety of growth forms, including herbaceous annuals, perennials, shrubs, and subshrubs, with succulents and geophytes among them. The leaves of Pelargonium species are typically alternate and palmately lobed or dissected. The flowers usually have five petals and can be single or double, in hues of white, cream, pink, red, magenta, purple, or bicolor. Pelargonium species can be easily propagated from stem cuttings, which quickly root when placed in a moist soil mix. They are also popular among gardeners for their fragrance, which can range from that of roses, lemon, mint, and even citrus. These scents are due to the presence of essential oils in various parts of the plant. Some commonly grown Pelargonium species: 1. Pelargonium x hortorum – Also known as zonal geranium, it is a hybrid species derived from crossing Pelargonium zonale and Pelargonium inquinans. It is widely cultivated for its large, colorful flowers and attractive, zoned leaves. 2. Pelargonium peltatum – Commonly known as ivy-leaved geranium, this species has trailing, ivy-like leaves and long stems that bear single or double flowers. 3. Pelargonium graveolens – Also called rose-scented geranium, this species is grown for its rose-like fragrance and is primarily used in the essential oil industry. In comparison, Sutherlandia is another genus in the Fabaceae (legume) family. It is primarily known for the species Sutherlandia frutescens, a small shrub from South Africa with red-orange flowers, traditionally used as a medicinal plant. To sum up, Pelargonium is the flowering plant genus that includes about 200 species of perennials, succulents, and shrubs and shares the common name \\"geraniums.\\" While these two genera are often confused, true geraniums belong to a separate genus in the Geraniaceae family, known as Geranium."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century. Do you have any questions?","output":"Given the breadth and depth of Chinese influence on the Japanese civilization documented above, there are several potential questions that might arise for further investigation and context: 1. How did the adoption of Buddhism and Chinese customs influence Japan's indigenous Shinto practices? Did the prevalence of Buddhism lead to any significant syncretism or conflict with Shinto beliefs? 2. How did the Chinese-influenced centralized governance system impact Japan's societal structures and political dynamics in the long term, especially considering the power often resided with military and economic families instead of the formal emperor? 3. Could you provide more depth on Prince Shotoku's \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution\\"? What were the key principles this constitution advocated and how did they shape Japan's governance and societal norms? 4. What was the catalyst that prompted Japanese monks, scholars, and artists to make the perilous journey to China to study various aspects of Chinese culture? 5. The Sogas and the Fujiwara clans bore significant influence on Japanese affairs over significant periods of time. What specific measures did each family undertake and what legacies did they leave behind in terms of facilitating or opposing Chinese influences? 6. Given the significance of Chinese influence, why is it that the emperor was only 'nominally' in power for the most part? How is this disparity in the symbolic and actual power structures reconciled within historical narratives? 7. How specifically did the Chinese calendar and Cosmological cycles influence Japanese historical records? Has this had any longer term implications for Japanese historiography? Each of these questions seeks to elaborate more on the specific contours of Chinese influence on Japanese historical development and socio-political structures, thereby enriching our understanding of this significant period of cross-cultural interaction."},{"instruction":"These are the last lines of which play: H: Shall the worms declare his truth?

Translate to English","output":"The Czech phrase \\"Je to teplý\\" translates to \\"It is warm\\" in English. The adjective \\"teplý\\" translates to \\"warm\\" in English and is typically used to describe weather, objects or even food. The verb \\"je\\" from \\"Je to teplý\\" translates to \\"it is\\" in English. So, when this is combined into the sentence \\"Je to teplý,\\" it means \\"It is warm.\\" This sentence can be used in various contexts. For example, you could use \\"Je to teplý\\" to describe the weather if it's a warm day. When you're describing the temperature of an object or dish, \\"Je to teplý\\" could also be used. For instance, if you've made a cup of coffee for someone and you say \\"Je to teplý\\" before handing it to them, it would mean that the cup of coffee is warm. Please note that in the Czech language, the adjectives change according to the gender of the noun they refer to. \\"Teplý\\" is used with masculine singular nouns. When referring to feminine singular nouns, \\"teplá\\" is used, and with neuter singular nouns, it's \\"teplé\\". For plurals, the words \\"teplí\\" for masculine animate, \\"teplé\\" for masculine inanimate and neuter, and \\"teplé\\" for feminine are used. However, in the given sentence \\"Je to teplý\\", there is no noun mentioned, hence we can't determine the gender and it's in the neuter form. Also, it's good to know that \\"Je to teplý\\" could also be answered to a question like \\"Jaký je oběd?\\" which means \\"How is lunch?\\". The response \\"Je to teplý\\" can also mean \\"It's warm\\", referring to the lunch. So that's what 'Je to teplý' means. It's a simple and commonly used phrase to describe the state of something being warm in the Czech language, lastly, keep in mind that the exact translation can vary slightly depending on the context in which it's being used."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A man preparing to repel down a mountain.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The man sits in the sand along the water's edge.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Energy expenditure: When an animal is woken up during hibernation, its body must work harder to increase its heart rate, blood flow, and metabolic rate again. This sudden break in hibernation consumes additional energy, which otherwise would be conserved during uninterrupted hibernation. 2. Increased stress: Disturbing an animal during hibernation causes stress, which may lead to an elevation of stress hormones such as cortisol. High cortisol levels in the bloodstream can negatively impact an animal's health and ability to return to a proper hibernation state. 3. Reduced body fat reserves: Constant disturbance during hibernation may lead the animal to use up its stored fat reserves faster than anticipated. Body fat reserves are crucial for an animal's survival during the hibernation period, as they provide energy and help maintain body temperature. **Indirect effects:** 1. Health risks: If the animal has to leave its den due to disturbances, it may be exposed to harsh weather conditions or predators. This exposure increases the risk of injury, infections, or predation, which can weaken the animal and hinder successful hibernation. 2. Inadequate rest: Hibernation serves as a time for rest and rejuvenation, and disturbance can diminish the quality of this critical resting period. Inadequate rest can cause long-lasting negative effects on the animal's health, including weakened immune system and reduced ability to reproduce. 3. Reduced reproductive success: Frequent disruptions may not only reduce an animal's body fat reserves but also affect its ability to find a mate or reproduce successfully. It might result in a decreased population if a large portion of animals within a species fails to reproduce. In conclusion, perturbations during hibernation can have significant consequences on an animal's hibernation process and overall health. It is essential to be cautious and respectful of their natural behavior to ensure their survival during this critical period."},{"instruction":"This is an email Sarah: I just wanted to thank you for the time and effort that you have spent on my behalf in trying to resolve this ratings situation.

Sir Frederick William Richards led a huge shipbuilding and naval works programme under a British Conservative statesman who served as prime minister for over how many years? The answer to this question is:","output":"Sir Frederick William Richards was a British Admiral and the First Sea Lord from 1893 to 1899. During his tenure, he led a significant shipbuilding and naval works program under the Conservative statesman Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, also known as Lord Salisbury, served as Prime Minister on three separate occasions. His first term was from June 23, 1885, to January 28, 1886. His second term was from July 25, 1886, to August 11, 1892, and his final term was from June 25, 1895, to July 11, 1902. In total, Lord Salisbury served as prime minister for approximately 13 years and 252 days. Under Lord Salisbury's leadership, Britain underwent a period of political stability, imperial expansion, and prosperous economic growth. During this time, the UK played an influential role in global affairs, and Lord Salisbury was recognized for his diplomatic skills. The shipbuilding and naval works program led by Sir Frederick William Richards aimed at modernizing and expanding the British navy to maintain its dominance over the seas, especially as other world powers were investing heavily in their own navies. This program was shaped by the global competition of the late 19th century, known as the naval arms race. Under Richards' direction, the Royal Navy saw significant technological advancement and growth. Ships were constructed incorporating new innovations in steel armor plate technology, steam turbine engine propulsion, and modern artillery equipment. Furthermore, Sir Frederick focused on implementing new ship designs, such as the development of the pre-dreadnought battleship, which would serve as the precursor to the revolutionary HMS Dreadnought. These efforts increased the strategic power of the British Empire and ensured its prominence in European and global politics during Lord Salisbury's administration. The relationship between Lord Salisbury and Sir Frederick William Richards exemplifies the strong collaboration between political and military leadership necessary to navigate the complexities of the rapidly changing world in the late 19th century."},{"instruction":"Question: Who was in control of the Danubian Principalities?

Options: (A) 5 mins (B) 3 mins (C) 7 mins (D) 9 mins (E) 2 mins Some stream of consciousness:","output":"To find the time it takes for the train to cross the bridge, we need to determine the total distance covered by the train and then divide this by the train's speed. First, let's calculate the total length of the train: - There are 24 carriages, each 60 meters long, so the combined length of the carriages is 24 * 60 = 1440 meters. - The engine is also 60 meters long, so the total length of the train (including the engine) is 1440 + 60 = 1500 meters or 1.5 km. The train has to cover its own length (1.5 km) as well as the length of the bridge (1.5 km) to completely cross the bridge. Therefore, the total distance the train needs to cover is 1.5 km (train length) + 1.5 km (bridge length) = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 km. Now, we know the train's speed is 60 kmph. To find the time it takes to cross the bridge, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed In this case: Time = 3 km / 60 kmph = 0.05 hours Now, to convert this time from hours to minutes, we can multiply 0.05 by 60: Time = 0.05 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 3 minutes So, the time it takes for the train to cross the bridge is 3 minutes, which corresponds to option B."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me the answer to which side of the white house is the front??","output":"Sure, little buddy!

Yes, local police departments sometimes lack resources - but what too many are also missing is the ability to treat victims of sexual violence with respect. After years of sitting on dusty shelves - shamefully ignored by police departments across the country - tens of thousands of rape kits will finally be tested. On 10 September, Vice President Joe Biden and New York City District Attorney Cyrus Vance announced a 79m initiative to start to whittle down the backlog. Vance said: “I’m saying today to all the women awaiting justice, you are not forgotten ... we will prevent future rapes by taking rapists off the streets, but the grants will do more than test kits - they will provide closure for victims and families.” But will they? Getting evidence from sexual assaults properly tested and processed is an undoubtedly an important part of the criminal justice system. But fully processed kits are not a magic bullet to putting rapists in jail, and they certainly don’t make amends to victims who have been poorly treated and their cases ignored. When Michigan State University professor Rebecca Campbell conducted a multi-year study of untested rape kits in Detroit, for example, she reported that it wasn’t just “chronic resource depletion” that led to the backlog - but “police treating victims in dehumanizing ways.” Related: 79m pledged to eliminate persistent rape kit backlog “[L]aw enforcement personnel regularly expressed negative, stereotyping beliefs about sexual assault victims. Victims who were assumed to be prostitutes were considered to be at fault for what had happened to them. Adolescents were often assumed to be lying, trying to avoid getting into trouble with their families by concocting a false story about being raped. Friends/acquaintances had got‐what‐they‐got because they had chosen to associate with the perpetrator. The fact that all of these victims had endured a lengthy, invasive medical forensic exam seemed to carry little to no weight.” This shouldn’t be an entirely shocking finding - rape victims have long complained about terrible treatment at the hands of police and the criminal justice system, and we know that rapists overwhelmingly go unpunished in the United States. But there’s more than just a moral issue at hand here. When victims are treated poorly by law enforcement, they’re less likely to trust them with their stories - and they’re less likely to come back. And when victims don’t come back, the police simply don’t follow through on their cases. This summer, for example, when Louisville Metro Police looked at why some of their rape kits went untested, Special Victims Unit Lieutenant Carolyn Nunn told local media that “a lot of our victims don’t want to go forward.” Without victims’ participation, the police won’t move forward with the case. Lynn Hecht Schafran, director of the National Judicial Education Program (NJEP), which trains law enforcement officials to properly handle sexual assault cases, tells me that testing all rape kits is crucial, but it’s only a first step. “Even when a kit is tested, law enforcement often fails to forward the case for prosecution, and prosecutors often fail to go forward with the few cases referred to them,” she said. Hecht Schafran also points out that a tested rape kit is not proof enough to put rapists away – it’s a piece of evidence that helps aid in prosecution. But too often – because of prevailing myths about rape and systemic victim-blaming – cases don’t even make it that far. “Because few law enforcement officers and prosecutors are educated about the way victims behave in traumatic situations, their attitude toward victims is often disbelief and disdain,” Hecht Schafran says. That’s in part why NJEP creates curricula for police, judges, prosecutors. “We know that when this education is made available to these gatekeepers it is transformative,” she says. If we want women to go through the grueling process of pressing charges if they are raped, we need to ensure that police and prosecutors aren’t just filling out forms and testing kits. They need to be thinking about ways to make victims feel more comfortable in an already-horrible situation, and that those in positions of power are trained, empathetic and leaving their biases at the door. And that’s going to a take a lot more than money to fix. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The nearly 80,000 untested rape kits that have been ignored by police in the United States aren't solely due to financial reasons. Apart from a lack of resources, the problem also lies in the capability of police departments to treat sexual assault victims with the respect they deserve. Even though a 79 million initiative to test the backlog of rape kits was announced, processing this evidence is not a guarantee that rapists will be put behind bars or that amends will be made to victims who have been poorly treated. Studies have revealed that police often treat victims in dehumanizing ways and express negative beliefs about them. This treatment discourages victims from trusting law enforcement, making them less likely to come forward with their stories. In order to improve this situation, it is essential for police and prosecutors to not only test kits but also create an environment where victims feel comfortable and respected by those in positions of power. This will take more than just financial resources to achieve."},{"instruction":"Translate from English to Spanish: Foreign language: English, German, French Spanish:","output":"Language extranjero: Inglés, Alemán, Francés Español:"},{"instruction":"How might one describe the sentiment of this review?

The atmosphere here is considered dense or thin? Assuming that: The density of the atmosphere decreases with an increase in the height above sea level (altitude). A:","output":"The atmosphere experienced by Yolanda in Florida would be considered dense, as she has moved to a location at sea level. To better understand why the atmosphere is denser at lower altitudes, it's important to analyze the various factors contributing to atmospheric density. Atmospheric density refers to the mass of air molecules per unit volume. The Earth's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), along with trace amounts of other gases. The weight of these air molecules creates a pressure that we experience at ground level, known as atmospheric pressure. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, which has a direct effect on atmospheric density. Several factors influence atmospheric density: 1. Altitude: As mentioned earlier, atmospheric density decreases with increasing altitude. This is due to the fact that the weight of the air molecules above decreases as you move higher from the Earth's surface. As a result, air pressure decreases, leading to a reduction in the number of air molecules occupying a given volume, and thus a decrease in atmospheric density. 2. Temperature: Air temperature also plays a role in determining atmospheric density. As the temperature increases, air molecules move faster and expand, causing a decrease in density. Conversely, when temperature decreases, air molecules become more densely packed, leading to increased atmospheric density. Since Florida is generally warm, this factor may push towards a slightly thinner atmosphere. However, when compared to the influence of altitude, the impact of temperature in this scenario likely remains secondary. 3. Humidity: Water vapor present in the air due to humidity can also affect atmospheric density. This is because water vapor has a lower molecular weight compared to other components in the Earth's atmosphere. When the air contains more water vapor, atmospheric density slightly decreases. Given Florida's subtropical climate, it typically experiences high humidity levels, which also acts to slightly reduce atmospheric density. However, despite the influences of temperature and humidity, the fact that Florida is located at sea level means that the atmosphere experienced by Yolanda will still be dense. This is because the dominant factor for atmospheric density in this case is the altitude. The closer to sea level a location is, the denser the atmosphere will be, due to the larger volume and weight of air molecules above that point.

Peace talks aimed at ending a 22-month-old crisis in Sudan #39;s troubled Darfur region, scheduled for Friday in Nigerian capital Abuja, has been postponed for a day, a spokesman for the African Union said.","output":"The information given is about the peace talks that were aimed to resolve the ongoing crisis in Sudan's Darfur region. The talks were scheduled to take place in Abuja, Nigeria, under the auspices of the African Union. However, they have been postponed for a day by the African Union spokesperson. The crisis in Darfur began back in 2003 and has continued for more than two decades. It is a complex conflict characterized by violence between different ethnic groups, government forces, and rebel movements in the region. The situation has resulted in a massive humanitarian crisis, with millions of people being displaced from their homes, widespread human rights abuses, and significant loss of life. The crisis in Darfur is rooted in a number of long-standing issues, including political, social, and economic marginalization of the non-Arab ethnic groups in the region by the central Sudanese government. This has resulted in a lack of access to basic resources, services, and development opportunities for the people of Darfur. Additionally, the region has been affected by environmental challenges, such as desertification and competition over scarce resources like water and fertile land, which further exacerbate tensions and conflicts between the different groups. In response to the ongoing crisis in Darfur, peace negotiations have been conducted by the African Union, an organization designed to promote unity, cooperation, and peace among African countries. These talks have aimed to address the root causes of the conflict, secure a ceasefire, and establish a comprehensive peace agreement among the warring factions. The goal of these negotiations is to bring an end to the violence and suffering, promote reconciliation, and establish a lasting and stable peace in the region. The peace talks scheduled for Friday in Abuja, Nigeria, represent an attempt to further advance these discussions and come to a resolution. By bringing together representatives from the Sudanese government, rebel movements, and other relevant stakeholders, it is hoped that the talks will allow for meaningful dialogue and progress towards ending the crisis in Darfur. The one-day postponement of the talks indicates that there may be some remaining challenges or obstacles that need to be addressed before negotiations can effectively proceed. This could include logistical issues, disputes over representation, or other concerns that prevent participants from engaging in constructive dialogue. However, the postponement also signifies that the African Union and other involved parties remain committed to finding a solution to the Darfur crisis and are willing to continue their efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region. In conclusion, the information provided is about the peace talks aimed at ending the 22-month-old crisis in Sudan's Darfur region. The talks, originally scheduled for Friday, have been postponed for a day by the African Union spokesperson. The crisis in Darfur has been ongoing for more than two decades and is characterized by violence, displacement, and suffering. These peace negotiations, led by the African Union, are essential in working towards a resolution to this devastating conflict and bringing about lasting peace and stability in the region. The fact that the talks have only been postponed for a day demonstrates the commitment and determination of the involved parties seeking a peaceful and lasting solution."},{"instruction":"Given the below context: En route to California to prospect for gold, ex-sheriff Hooker, professional gambler Fiske, and bounty hunter Luke Daly are forced to stop over in a tiny Mexican village by engine trouble on the ship they are taking. A desperate Leah Fuller hires the three men and local Vicente Madariaga, to rescue her husband, John, who is pinned under debris from a gold mine cave-in in hostile Apache territory. During the harrowing journey, Luke tries to force himself on Leah late one night, forcing Hooker to intervene. Leah tells Hooker that where her husband is trapped, once was a boom town, but a volcano eruption wiped it out, leaving only a church steeple and the mine uncovered by lava. The resident priest called it the \\"garden of evil\\". The Indians now consider the volcano sacred. The group then arrives at the mine. They find John unconscious, and they free him. Before John wakes up, Hooker sets the man's broken leg. When John regains consciousness, he accuses Leah of using him to get gold. Hooker talks to Leah later, about what her husband said; after he tells her that he has spotted signs of Apaches nearby, she offers him and the others all the gold they have dug up to take her husband away that night, while she remains behind to make it look like they are all still there.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What cuts the crew off from Earth? Title: First Spaceship on Venus Movie plot: In 1985 engineers involved in an industrial project to irrigate the Gobi Desert accidentally unearth a mysterious and apparently artificial \\"spool\\". When found to be made of a material unknown on Earth, the spool is circumstantially linked to the Tunguska explosion of 1908. The spool is seized on as evidence that the explosion, originally blamed on a meteor, was actually caused by an alien spaceship. Professor Harringway deduces the craft must have come from Venus. The spool itself is determined to be a flight recorder and is partially decoded by an international team of scientists led by Professor Sikarna and Dr. Tchen Yu. When radio greetings sent to Venus go unanswered, Harringway announces that a journey to Venus is the only alternative. The recently completed Soviet spaceship Cosmostrator intended to voyage to Mars, is redirected to Venus, a 30- to 31-day journey. During the voyage, Sikarna works furiously to translate the alien message using the spaceship's computer. When their spaceship nears Venus, radio interference from the planet cuts the crew off from Earth. By then, Sikarna's efforts lead to a stunning discovery: The spool describes a Venusian plan to irradiate the Earth's surface, with the extermination of mankind being the prelude to an invasion. Rather than containing a \\"cosmic document\\", as had been expected, the spool bears a cold-blooded message of destruction. Harringway convinces the crew to press on towards Venus rather than return to Earth with news that would panic mankind. With the ship's robot, Omega, American astronaut Brinkman pilots a one-man landing craft. On the ground, he encounters an industrial complex and finds small recording devices that look like insects. The rest of the crew follows when Cosmostrator lands, but they find no Venusian life forms. Journeying across the planet, they find the remains of a deserted and blasted city centered around a huge crater, signs of a catastrophic explosion so intense that shadowy forms of humanoid Venusians are permanently burned on to...

It was breathtaking. It was wonderful and a bit of frightening. It was Qomolangma, the highest mountain in the world. For many years, it has attracted tens of thousands of people who tried to climb its dangerous slopes. During May's 60th anniversary of the first successful climb, nearly 600 people from around the world, including a 5-year-old Italian boy, tried to reach the \\"roof of the world\\". China Central Television(CCTV) also sent a team to join the adventure. It broadcasted a special program, called \\"Standing at the world's third pole in 2013\\", from May 18 to 24 to cover the Chinese climbing Qomolangma. Over the last century, the 8848-metre-high peak has proven a great challenge for mountaineers. Those who try to stand on top of the world do so at great risk from extremely cold, avalanches , and falling ice. At 8,500 meters, the air contains just one-third of the oxygen at sea level, requiring most climbers to use oxygen tanks. Some of those who climbed the mountain paid the highest price---175 people have lost their lives on the slopes. On May29, 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary from New Zealand and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal became the first men ever to reach the top of the mountain. Nearly half a century later, the sons of the two pioneers, Peter Hillary and Jaming Tenzing Norgay, followed in their fathers' footsteps. In 2002, they also successfully reached the roof of the world. Over the last 60 years, more than 10,000 men and women have tried to climb the mountain and more than 1,200 have succeeded.

Witnesses say more than 10 militants were waiting in bushes a few hours down the road and sprayed the bus with bullets before boarding and asking Muslim passengers to separate from Christians. The Muslim passengers refused and hid Christians behind bags. \\"We even gave some non-Muslims our religious attire to wear in the bus so that they would not be identified easily.

Witnesses reported that the militants had been waiting in the bushes a few hours down the road and attacked the bus with gunfire before boarding the vehicle. Once on the bus, the militants demanded that Muslim and Christian passengers separate. However, the Muslim passengers refused to comply and instead protected their Christian counterparts, hiding them behind bags and even sharing their religious clothing to help disguise them. They told the militants that if they wanted to kill anyone, they would have to kill them all, as there were no Christians on board.

Reasoning: The answer \\"it is not possible to tell\\" can be justified due to the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle states that it is fundamentally impossible to know both the exact position and momentum of a subatomic particle, such as an electron, at the same time. This means that the more accurately we know an electron's position, the less accurately we can know its momentum and vice versa.

Adjust the values to determine how much baking soda you need to add for the volume of your pool. For example, if you want to go from 60 ppm to 80 ppm in a 10,000 US gal (38,000 L) pool, you would add 2.5 pounds (1,100 g) of baking soda. Adding too much baking soda to the water at a time could raise the pH of the water. Let the baking soda settle and mix with the water before adding more. If you need to raise the alkalinity further, wait until the next day to add more baking soda. Use a circular motion as you pour the baking soda. It may cause some cloudiness in the water initially. The baking soda will sink to the bottom of the pool and settle before it begins mixing. To avoid cloudiness in the water, pour the baking soda directly into the skimmer. Your pool water needs to pump and circulate through a full cycle before you retest the water. Check the alkalinity using your test kit. Let the pool run for a full pump cycle, which takes about 10 hours, before swimming. If your alkalinity levels are still off after the first baking soda treatment, add more baking soda to reach the desired ppm. Summary:","output":"1.

Article: I think it's hard for a teenager to live in the modern society. For example, how to go to school is a problem I often worry about. Every afternoon, my father picks me up at the gate of the school. Many parents pick up their children, too. Most of them drive private cars. Of all the cars, Anna's father's car is the best. Anna seems to have a very rich father. She always has beautiful dresses, shoes and bags. Besides these, she is also very beautiful. But she has no friends in school. When other students are playing, she never joins them. I don't like her because she is too perfect. It makes me uncomfortable to make friends with her. She seems to have everything. One afternoon, when I went to my father's car, I saw a small thing fall out of Anna's bag. So I called her quickly. However, she didn't look back and kept going. I felt very angry with her. During the dinner, my father asked me, \\"Why do you look unhappy?\\" \\"Today I saw something fall out of Anna's bag, so called her. But she didn't answer me. She is _ . \\" said angrily. \\"Oh, I know that girl. She has no friends and is unhappy because she was born deaf. I'm sure that she didn't hear you. \\" What my father said suddenly woke me up. Because she is deaf, she does not talk or play with anyone at school. She seems to have everything, but in fact she doesn't. Not everyone is perfect, even the perfect man has his weakness.

Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries. Despite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite. The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished America and determined its mores and values also explained why the American masses held elites in such contempt.

Yes or no? Answer: Tribes in the Eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Question: who owned kansas before it became a state","output":"Before Kansas became a state, the region was home to numerous Native American tribes, European explorers, and American settlers. The ownership of the land cannot be attributed solely to one group or nation, as it underwent a complex history of territorial claims and disputes. To begin with, Kansas was populated by a diverse range of Native American tribes. Some of the tribes that lived in Kansas before it became a state included the Kansa, the Osage, the Pawnee, the Wichita, and the Cheyenne. As you mentioned, tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. These tribes had diverse cultures and relied on farming, hunting, and gathering for their livelihoods. European explorers arrived in Kansas in the 16th century, with the Spanish explorer Francisco Vázquez de Coronado being one of the first to access the region. However, the land did not become a significant part of European colonization until much later. In 1803, Kansas was included in the Louisiana Purchase, which saw the United States acquire a massive territory from France under President Thomas Jefferson. This acquisition doubled the country's size and opened vast areas of land for settlement, including present-day Kansas. After the Louisiana Purchase, the U.S. government began trying to create policies regarding the area that would soon become Kansas. Several treaties and agreements were signed with different Native American tribes, but many of these led to disputes and were not always honored. In 1820, the United States Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which aimed at relocating Native American tribes from the eastern part of the country to the western territories, including Kansas. This act led to a significant resettlement of tribes from the East Coast into the Kansas region. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska and allowed incoming settlers to determine whether each state would be a free state or a slave state through popular sovereignty. This decision on the statehood of Kansas resulted in an armed conflict known as Bleeding Kansas, during which pro-slavery settlers and abolitionist settlers clashed to determine the future of the territory. In the end, Kansas was admitted as a free state on January 29, 1861, becoming the 34th state in the United States. In conclusion, before Kansas became a state, various Native American tribes resided in the area, followed by European explorers and American settlers. Ownership of the land was a complex process involving numerous territorial claims, treaties, and disputes, eventually resulting in Kansas joining the United States of America as a free state."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - The Real Ghostbusters is an American animated television series, a spinoff of the 1984 comedy movie \\"Ghostbusters\\".

Which cousin experienced fewer thunderstorms? Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. Hint: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information in the paragraph, Dee, who lived in a coastal town at sea level, experienced fewer thunderstorms as compared to Ann, who lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude. This is primarily because of the following reasons: 1. Temperature differences due to altitude: Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which is the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, leading to the adiabatic lapse rate. In some cases, temperature might increase with height, a phenomenon known as an inversion. Inversions can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below, leading to the formation of fog and acting as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. 2. Different surfaces: On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics, such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. Since Dee lived at sea level in a coastal town, her location could have had higher moisture content, which might have contributed to fewer thunderstorms compared to Ann's mountain village. 3. Effect of sun angle on climate: The Earth's axial tilt and its orbital plane result in sunlight being incident at different angles at different times of the year, causing seasons. Changes in Earth's orbital parameters also influence long-term climate. These variations affect temperature and moisture gradients, known as frontogenesis, which can influence cloudiness and precipitation, possibly leading to different thunderstorm patterns in Dee's and Ann's locations. Given these factors, it can be inferred that Dee, living in a coastal town at sea level, experienced fewer thunderstorms than her cousin Ann, who lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude."},{"instruction":"He won 235 points for his song, \\"Dancing Lasha Tumbai\\".

Options: - Sentence A: \\"I brush my teeth with a knife\\" - Sentence B: \\"I brush my teeth with a toothbrush\\"","output":"To determine which of the two sentences is nonsensical, we need to analyze each one individually and compare them to appropriate practices or real-life situations. Sentence A: \\"I brush my teeth with a knife\\" Brushing one's teeth typically involves using a toothbrush with bristles to clean the teeth, gums, and tongue. A knife, however, is a cutting tool and is neither designed for nor appropriate for dental hygiene purposes. Using a knife for brushing teeth would be dangerous, as it could cause injury to the teeth, gums, or other soft tissues in the mouth. Therefore, this sentence is considered nonsensical because it goes against common practices and logic. Sentence B: \\"I brush my teeth with a toothbrush\\" This sentence is logically correct since a toothbrush is a common tool designed specifically for brushing teeth. Toothbrushes have bristles that are designed for gentle scrubbing and cleaning of teeth and gums without causing harm. This statement makes sense and aligns with the everyday practice of maintaining personal dental hygiene. In conclusion, Sentence A (\\"I brush my teeth with a knife\\") is the nonsensical sentence. It is illogical and counterintuitive due to the potential danger and inappropriateness of using a knife for something it is not intended or designed for, i.e., dental hygiene."},{"instruction":"Tohle bude má první věc.

How does it feel like to always be an option to others? In terms of love life, friendship, work. Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Available choices: +no. +yes.","output":"These two questions are inquiring about different information. +no. Now, I will respond to each question separately. 1. How does a Facebook app like Love or Friendship calculator works? A Facebook app like Love or Friendship calculator typically uses a combination of algorithms, user inputs, and data mining techniques to generate compatibility scores or results. Here's a general overview of how the process works: a. User authorization and data collection: The user usually needs to authorize the app to access their Facebook data. The app then collects personal information from the user's profile, such as age, gender, location, relationship status, mutual friends, likes, and posts. b. User input: Depending on the app, the user may be asked to input information about themselves, the person they are interested in, and their preferences in a partner or friend. This may include personality traits, physical appearance, hobbies, interests, and other factors that could affect compatibility. c. Algorithm and calculation: The app applies its algorithm, which is a set of predefined rules or formulae designed to analyze the collected data and user inputs. The algorithm processes the data to determine which factors are most important in defining compatibility and assigns different weights to each factor. It may involve deriving meaningful relationships between data points, analyzing patterns, calculating similarity or distance metrics, and applying machine learning techniques. d. Result presentation: After processing the data, the app calculates a compatibility score or result that quantifies the level of compatibility between the users or their compatibility with the ideal match. The app may present the score as a percentage, a graphical representation, or a simple statement like \\"You are a great match\\" or \\"You are just friends.\\" Please note that these apps are largely for entertainment purposes, and their results should not be taken too seriously. The algorithms behind these apps are not scientifically accurate and cannot truly predict the success of personal relationships. 2. How does it feel like to always be an option to others? In terms of love life, friendship, work. Feeling like an option rather than a priority can lead to various emotional responses. I will outline some of the possible emotions and thoughts one might experience in different aspects of life. a. Love life: In a romantic relationship, feeling like an option might cause a person to feel undervalued, insecure, and unloved. They may question their partner's commitment and their own worthiness of love. It can lead to emotional stress, self-doubt, and a decline in self-esteem. b. Friendship: In friendship, repeatedly feeling like an option can result in feelings of loneliness, hurt, and resentment. One might feel taken for granted, unappreciated, and used by their friends. This may lead to questions of whether the friendship truly serves its purpose and if it has any real value. c. Work: In a professional setting, feeling like an option may result in a lack of motivation, decreased job satisfaction, and low self-confidence. One might feel that their efforts are not recognized, their opinions are not valued, and their work is not genuinely appreciated. Over time, this could harm not only one's career but also their mental well-being. To overcome these negative emotions and situations, it is essential for individuals to assert their boundaries and communicate effectively with their partners, friends, and colleagues about their feelings and needs. Developing self-confidence and knowing one's worth is also crucial for maintaining healthy relationships in all aspects of life."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a task that requires knowledge of physical objects to perform?","output":"An example of a task that requires knowledge of physical objects to perform is setting up a living room with furniture. In order to accomplish this task, one would need to understand the properties and arrangement of various physical objects such as sofas, chairs, tables, and more. Step 1: Analyze the living room space Before starting, we must analyze the living room space to understand its size, shape, and any permanent fixtures such as windows, doors, or built-in cabinets. This step ensures that we are aware of the pre-existing constraints for arranging furniture. Step 2: Determine the purpose and function of the living room Next, we should determine the primary purpose and function of the living room. This may include relaxation, entertainment, or socializing. Based on the function, we can choose the appropriate furniture and layout. Step 3: Select the essential furniture pieces required Based on the function, we will select the essential furniture pieces required for the living room. E.g., a sofa, coffee table, and a TV cabinet for a relaxation-focused living room or additional chairs for a socializing-focused living room. Step 4: Consider durable furniture materials It is essential to consider the materials appropriate for the living room furniture. For instance, if the living room is frequently used, we should opt for durable materials such as leather, metal, or hardwood. Step 5: Arrange the furniture Arrange the furniture in various positions considering the space available, ease of access, and the focal point of the living room (such as a TV or fireplace). This step ensures the optimal utilization of the space while also considering aesthetics and functionality. Step 6: Add accessories and decorations Once the furniture arrangement is complete, add accessories and decorations like area rugs, curtains, lighting, and artwork to enhance the aesthetics and create a welcoming atmosphere. By following these steps and understanding the properties and arrangement of specific physical objects, we can successfully set up a living room with furniture."},{"instruction":"Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What's the full name of the person who justifies stealing a car? ? Matt Franklin is a recent MIT graduate who works at a Los Angeles Suncoast Video store in 1988 while trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, something that his police officer father has grown impatient with. While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along.

Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, cons 11,000 in cash (187,600 today) in a pigeon drop from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him \\"the big con\\".

Eighty people were reported killed after gunmen burst into the Bataclan concert hall and took hostages before security forces stormed the hall. People were shot dead at restaurants and bars at five other sites in Paris. At least 180 people were injured. These are the deadliest attacks in Europe since the 2004 Madrid bombings. French President Francois Hollande, visibly shaken, called Friday night's almost simultaneous attacks \\"a horror\\" and vowed to wage a \\"merciless\\" fight against terrorism. Paris saw three days of attacks in early January, when Islamist gunmen murdered 18 people after attacking satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, a Jewish supermarket and a policewoman on patrol. Live: Follow the latest developments here In pictures: Paris shootings Eyewitness accounts from the scene The attack on the 1,500-seat Bataclan hall was by far the deadliest of Friday night's attacks.

The president was whisked to safety after the first of at least two explosions just outside the venue to convene an emergency cabinet meeting. Three attackers were reportedly killed there.

What happened in Paris on Friday night is exactly what Europe's security services have long feared, and tried to foil. Simultaneous, rolling attacks, with automatic weapons and suicide bombers in the heart of a major European city, targeting multiple, crowded public locations. The tactics have been used before, in Mumbai and elsewhere. But how they've come to Europe is one of many questions that will have to be answered. Were the attackers French citizens? If so, how they were radicalised, armed and organised - was it in France, in Syria, and by whom? Why weren't they detected? Is France, after two major attacks this year, uniquely vulnerable or does the carnage in Paris mean all of Europe faces new threats to our public places and events? And if a Syrian link is proven, will France recoil from that conflict or will it redouble its commitment to the fight against radical groups there? ||||| Paris (CNN) On a night when thousands of Paris residents and tourists were reveling and fans were enjoying a soccer match between France and world champion Germany, horror struck in an unprecedented manner. Terrorists -- some with AK-47s, some reportedly with bombs strapped to them -- attacked sites throughout the French capital and at the stadium where the soccer match was underway. Scores were killed in the coordinated attacks late Friday, leaving a nation in mourning and the world in shock. CNN will update this story as information comes in: [Latest developments, posted at 11:59 p.m. ET] • Paris Prosecutor spokeswoman Agnès Thibault-Lecuivre said eight extremists are dead after attacks. Seven of them were killed in suicide bombings. • U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with French President Francois Hollande to offer condolences and assistance in the investigation, the White House said. Earlier, Obama said, \\"This is an attack not just on Paris, not just on the people on France, but an attack on all humanity and the universal values we share.\\" He called the attacks an \\"outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians.\\" • A total of six locations were attacked in and just outside the capital, Paris prosecutor François Molins told reporters Saturday. • Five suspected attackers have been \\"neutralized,\\" said Molins. It was unclear whether that term meant the terrorists were dead. • A witness tells Radio France that attackers inside the Bataclan concert hall entered firing rifles and shouting \\"Allah akbar.\\" • At least 128 people were killed in the Paris and Saint-Denis shootings and bombings, French officials said. Saint-Denis is home to the national stadium where the soccer match was being played. • The worst carnage occurred at Bataclan, with at least 80 left dead. A journalist who was at a rock concert there escaped and told CNN: \\"We lied down on the floor not to get hurt. It was a huge panic. The terrorists shot at us for 10 to 15 minutes. It was a bloodbath.\\" Julien Pearce didn't hear the attackers speak, but he said one friend who escaped heard them talk about Iraq and Syria. Later, he said the men were speaking French. Two men dressed in black started shooting and after wounded people fell to the floor, the gunmen shot them again, execution-style, he said. • CNN affiliate BFMTV, citing French officials, said some gunmen were still at large. • Charlotte Brehaut and a friend were dining in Le Petit Cambodge, a Cambodian restaurant, when the shooting started from the street, she told CNN. \\"All of a sudden we heard huge gunshots and glass coming through the windows. We ducked with the other diners,\\" she said. She grabbed the arm of a woman on the floor. The woman didn't respond. The woman was shot in the chest and there was blood all around her. At least 14 people were killed in Le Petit Cambodge, authorities said. • Four attackers were killed, including three who were wearing explosives belts, at Bataclan during the police raid, Paris police spokesman Michel Cadot told France Info radio. • There is great alarm over the apparent methodology and likely planning that would have been needed to pull off such a series of attacks, one U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN. The attacks resembled tactics that have been used by a number of terror groups -- including al Qaeda's focus on mass casualties and visibility, and the small, tactical nature of attacks that are more the hallmark of ISIS and its acolytes. It is still not clear who is responsible. • U.S. citizens in Paris who are safe are being asked by the State Department to call their families. Those Americans in France needing assistance should call 001-202-501-4444. Americans concerned about loved ones in Paris should call 1-888-407-4747. An official told CNN the hotline was flooded with calls. • Michael Dorio, brother of a member of the band that was playing at the Bataclan concert, said he spoke to Eagles of Death Metal drummer Julian Dorio about 20-30 minutes after the attack. \\"He said he had been performing and heard the gunshots. They stopped playing and hit the deck and went backstage and exited,\\" Michael Dorio told CNN. • BFMTV reports that SWAT units stormed Bataclan and that the siege was over. Two attackers were killed, a police union said. Police brought out at least 100 hostages from the concert hall, a CNN producer said; some appear to be wounded. Hollande told reporters outside Bataclan that \\"terrorists capable of carrying out such atrocities must know that they will face a France that is determined and united.\\" Au 90 rue de Charonne, un 7ème corps ... pic.twitter.com/PGFh63cwTj — Tommy Pouilly (@5h55) November 13, 2015 • Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman told CNN the death toll is going to rise significantly. \\"We are facing an unknown and historic situation in Paris,\\" he said. • Hollande called the events \\"unprecedented terrorist attacks\\" and added, \\"This is a horror.\\" In a tweet, he said, \\"Faced with terror, this is a nation that knows how to defend itself, how to mobilize its forces and once again, knows how to overcome the terrorists.\\" Face à l'effroi, il y a une Nation qui sait se défendre, sait mobiliser ses forces et, une fois encore, saura vaincre les terroristes. — François Hollande (@fhollande) November 13, 2015 • One of the explosions at the Stade de France, home of the French national sports teams, outside Paris appears to be a suicide bombing, a Western intelligence source receiving direct intelligence from the scene told CNN's Deb Feyerick. A dismembered body, consistent with the aftermath of an explosion from that type of device, was found at the scene, the source said. Watch: Explosion heard at Paris soccer game • People were inviting people off the streets into their apartments, reports Philip Crowther, Washington correspondent for France 24. • Traffic on several subway lines has been interrupted following the attacks, the Paris police prefecture reported. Peace for Paris pic.twitter.com/ryf6XB2d80 — jean jullien (@jean_jullien) November 13, 2015 • There is no credible or specific threat in the United States, according to a U.S. government official. An FBI spokesperson said the agency and the Department of Homeland Security were closely monitoring the unfolding events. • Hollande, in an address to the nation, said he had declared a state of emergency, meaning border security will be ramped up. \\"We have to show compassion and solidarity and we also have to show unity and keep our cool. France must be strong and great,\\" he said.

Bandy also is the number two winter sport in tickets sold per day of competitions at the sport's world championship compared to the other winter sports. - Mjøndalen is the administrative centre of Nedre Eiker municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. It is situated south of the Drammenselva River opposite of Krokstadelva. History. Mjøndalen has traditionally been a railway site most known as an industrial sawmill location. Historically Mjøndalen was known for its industry; including paper & pulp production and a substantial cellulose industry. The production of wood products and furniture are also traditional commercial activities. All the paper mills closed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. - The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA, ; ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia.

The county extends from the Oslofjord and Drammensfjorden in the southeast to Hardangervidda mountain range in the northwest. The county administration is located in Drammen. Etymology. The county is named after the old manor Buskerud (Old Norse: \\"Biskupsruð\\") located on the west side of the Drammen River in Åmot, Modum municipality. The first element is the genitive case of \\"biskup\\" m 'bishop' (referring to the Bishop of Hamar), the last element is \\"ruð\\" n 'clearing, farm'. The farm was one of the largest in Buskerud, and the original name of the farm (before it became a benefice) was probably \\"Modum\\". At the time of the Reformation (ca. 153639) the farm became property of the Crown at which time the farm then served as the residence of the king's bailiffs until 1668. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard.

Second question: Why is my voice changing and I am not able to sing? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Pick your answer from: - no - yes","output":"When answering these questions, it is important to address them separately as they do not ask the same thing. So, the answer is: no. Now, let's address each question in detail: First question: When I sing, am I supposed to feel vibrations in my face? When singing, it is entirely normal to feel vibrations in your face, as well as other parts of your body. These vibrations occur because sound waves travel through physical objects in the form of mechanical vibrations. When you sing, your vocal cords vibrate, creating sound waves that radiate from your mouth and throat. As these waves travel through the air and interact with the surrounding environment, they also pass through the tissues and bones in your face, causing vibrations to be felt. There are specific sensations that singers often feel, such as resonance. Resonance refers to the amplification and enrichment of sound produced by the interaction of sound waves with the structures of the vocal tract, including the sinuses, nasal passages, and oral and throat cavities. A singer who is singing with proper technique will often feel resonance in their facial bones, particularly the mask area (around the nose, cheeks, and forehead). This is considered a positive sensation and indicates efficient use of the vocal instrument. Second question: Why is my voice changing and I am not able to sing? There are many possible reasons for changes in your voice and difficulties in singing. Some common factors include: 1. Age: As individuals mature, especially during adolescence, hormonal changes can affect the structure and function of the vocal cords. This may lead to a change in the range, pitch, or timbre of your voice. 2. Vocal fatigue: Excessive use or misuse of your voice, such as constant talking or singing without proper technique, can strain your vocal cords, causing them to swell or become irritated. This may result in temporary changes to your voice and reduced singing ability. 3. Illness: Infections such as colds, flu, or laryngitis can lead to inflammation or swelling of the vocal cords, which in turn may cause a temporary change in your voice and make it difficult to sing. 4. Technique issues: Singing with improper technique can place strain on your vocal cords and create tension in your throat, leading to a reduction in your singing ability and possible changes in your voice. These issues can typically be addressed with vocal training and guidance from a skilled voice teacher. 5. Psychological factors: Sometimes, the issue is not physical, but rather psychological. Performance anxiety, stress, or mood changes can affect the way you perceive your own singing abilities and the resulting sound that you produce. In order to determine why your voice is changing and you are not able to sing, it may be helpful to consult with a speech-language pathologist or experienced voice teacher to address your concerns, identify any underlying issues, and develop a personalized treatment or training plan to help you improve your singing abilities."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Women in formal wear sitting on a pew.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Women wearing formal wear sitting on a pew before a wedding.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Let's be accurate as possible and think first.","output":"To assess if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's break down the information given in both statements and compare them: Premise: \\"Women in formal wear sitting on a pew.\\" - There are women - They are wearing formal wear - They are sitting on a pew Hypothesis: \\"Women wearing formal wear sitting on a pew before a wedding.\\" - There are women - They are wearing formal wear - They are sitting on a pew - This is happening before a wedding Comparing the two, we can see that the first three points match in both statements. The difference is the addition of the context \\"before a wedding\\" in the hypothesis. It can be concluded that we do not have enough information in the premise to definitively state that the hypothesis is entailed by it. The premise only mentions women in formal wear sitting on a pew, without providing the context of a wedding.

The family doesn't have the money to purchase one at this time. The salesmen are persistent in their attempt to make a sale. Step 2: Identify potential offensive tactics 1. Approaching customers in a public area: Unsolicited sales pitch in public spaces can make people uncomfortable, as they might not have any interest in purchasing the product or they may feel pressured to make a purchase. 2. Persistence: Being persistent and not accepting the customer's initial refusal might come across as pushy or disrespectful, as it doesn't acknowledge the customer's financial situation or personal preferences. 3. Focusing on the sister: The salesmen are trying to convince the sister to buy a phone, which may make her feel singled out and uncomfortable. Step 4: Consider the impact of the tactics on the family These tactics can lead to feelings of embarrassment or distress, as the family is put in a position where they must repeatedly decline the offer. Moreover, the family's financial situation is indirectly highlighted in a public setting, which might further contribute to their discomfort. Conclusion: Some people might be offended by the salesman's tactics because they can be intrusive, persistent, and put pressure on the potential customers who may not have the means or desire to make a purchase.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., can you guess it ?

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who is giving the prisoners firearms? Movie title: The Grey Zone Movie plot: The film opens in October 1944, in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. A small group of Sonderkommandos, prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an insurrection that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot. Meanwhile, a Hungarian-Jewish doctor, MiklÃ³s Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who works for the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the womenâs labor camp. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers. A new trainload of Hungarian Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers. As the group is given instructions about \\"delousing\\", a fearful, angry man in the group begins shouting questions at one of the Sonderkommandos, Hoffman (Arquette), who has been issuing the instructions. Hoffman beats him to death in an outburst of frustration, in an attempt to make the man stop talking. After the gassing of this same group, a badly shaken Hoffman finds a young girl alive beneath a pile of bodies. He removes her from the chamber, and, after informing the leader of the insurgency, Schlermer (Daniel Benzali), takes her to a storage room and summons Nyiszli, who revives her. The group decides to hide her in the childrenâs camp. While the prisoners hide her in a dressing room, SS-OberscharfÃ¼hrer Eric Muhsfeldt (Keitel) suddenly walks in. Noticing that one of the prisoners present, Abramowics (Buscemi), is there illegally, he shoots him, prompting the girl... A:","output":"In the movie \\"The Grey Zone,\\" the prisoners, specifically the Sonderkommandos, are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village. These citizens are likely part of the Polish resistance, who were against the Nazi regime and sought to support any effort that might weaken or disrupt their operations. The firearms provided by the Polish citizens would be crucial in assisting the Sonderkommandos in their plot to destroy one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. Additionally, the prisoners also receive gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory, where female prisoners work. These women take great risks in smuggling the gunpowder into the men's camp by hiding it amid the bodies of deceased workers. This highlights the collaboration and solidarity among the prisoners in their shared goal of rebelling against the Nazis. However, as we evaluate this film proposal, it is essential to consider a few factors to determine whether it is worth investing in. First and foremost, we must consider the historical accuracy of the events portrayed in the film. While there were instances of resistance, uprisings, and sabotage within concentration camps during World War II, it is crucial to ensure that the movie does not significantly deviate from actual events or present misleading information. Consulting with historians and experts could help in making sure that the film is as accurate as possible. Additionally, it would be vital to assess the film's potential appeal to a broader audience. While the story seems to contain elements of drama, action, and struggle, the subject matter's sensitive nature and the graphic depiction of the events in the extermination camp could potentially limit the movie's target audience. Thus, some potential viewers might find the film to be too intense or challenging to watch. The film's production quality would also be a crucial factor in determining whether to invest in the project. A high-quality production team, alongside an experienced and talented cast, would be necessary to accurately portray the complex and nuanced story of the prisoners and their efforts to rebel against their oppressors. This could include considering the film's budget, director, screenwriter, and available resources to ensure the best possible outcome. Lastly, it is important to keep in mind the ethical considerations of producing a film based on such a sensitive and historically significant subject. Ensuring that the story is told with respect and empathy for the people who suffered through these horrifying events is essential. In conclusion, the decision to invest in this film proposal should involve careful consideration of its historical accuracy, audience appeal, production quality, and ethical implications. Balancing these factors will enable you to make an informed decision about whether or not to support the project."},{"instruction":"The rhythm is linked to the light–dark cycle. Animals, including humans, kept in total darkness for extended periods eventually function with a free-running rhythm. Their sleep cycle is pushed back or forward each \\"day\\", depending on whether their \\"day\\", their endogenous period, is shorter or longer than 24 hours. The environmental cues that reset the rhythms each day are called zeitgebers (from the German, \\"time-givers\\"). Totally blind subterranean mammals (e.g., blind mole rat Spalax sp.) are able to maintain their endogenous clocks in the apparent absence of external stimuli. Although they lack image-forming eyes, their photoreceptors (which detect light) are still functional; they do surface periodically as well.[page needed] Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What do blind mole rats have in place of vision?","output":"Blind mole rats (Spalax sp.) have developed certain adaptations in place of vision to navigate and survive in their underground environment. Here are some key adaptations: 1. Somatosensation: Blind mole rats have highly sensitive facial whiskers called vibrissae that provide them with information about their surroundings through touch. These tactile hairs help them detect subtle changes in their environment, such as vibrations, obstacles, and small openings, enabling them to effectively move around and perform tasks. 2. Enhanced sense of smell: They have an acute sense of smell that allows them to detect odors, track food sources, differentiate between environments, and identify conspecifics, even in the absence of light. The olfactory system of blind mole rats is highly developed to compensate for the lack of vision. 3. Echolocation: Although it is not as well developed as in bats or some marine mammals, blind mole rats do exhibit some level of echolocation. They make clicking or squeaking noises and use the reflected sound waves to navigate their surroundings and detect the presence of objects. 4. Electrosensation: Some studies have tentatively suggested that blind mole rats may have the ability to sense electric fields in their environment, although this has not been conclusively proven. If true, this would add another dimension to their perception of their surroundings. 5. Photoreceptors: While these creatures lack image-forming eyes, they still possess functional photoreceptors. These specialized cells can detect light, allowing them to maintain their endogenous circadian rhythms in response to changes in the light-dark cycle. In summary, although blind mole rats lack image-forming vision, they possess a range of sensory adaptations that allow them to effectively navigate and survive in their underground environment. This includes their highly sensitive whiskers, acute sense of smell, possible echolocation ability, potential electrosensation, and functional photoreceptors to maintain their biological clock."},{"instruction":"Vesitilannetta on valvottava jatkuvasti ja parlamentti on pidettävä säännöllisesti ajan tasalla ...

Water management and monitoring are crucial in today's world where water scarcity, pollution, and climate change effects pose significant challenges. Constant vigilance and regular updates on the water situation are essential to ensure the sustainable use, preservation, and equitable distribution of water resources. It emphasizes the role that government and decision-making bodies, such as the parliament, play in addressing these challenges. In order to stay up to date and make informed decisions, the parliament should receive regular reports and updates on various aspects of the water situation. It may include data on water availability and consumption, water quality, the status of water infrastructure, and emerging risks and challenges concerning water resources. Additionally, it should also consider best practices and recommendations from experts in the field to develop sound policies and adapt to the changing water scenario. It is essential for the government to involve all relevant stakeholders, including local communities, industries, and environmental organizations, in the planning and management of water resources. This will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the water situation and ensure that all perspectives are considered in the decision-making process. Furthermore, raising public awareness and promoting responsible water usage among citizens can significantly contribute to the sustainable management of water resources. People can be encouraged to adopt water-saving practices and technologies, such as rainwater harvesting, water-efficient appliances, and proper wastewater management.

Options: - outside - barber shop - psycho's pocket - suitcase - medicine cabinet If the answer is 'medicine cabinet'; explain the reasoning:","output":"The answer is 'medicine cabinet'. The reasoning behind this is that a woman generally stores her leg razor in the medicine cabinet because it is a common storage area for personal care items, toiletries, and grooming tools. A medicine cabinet is typically located in the bathroom, which is the most convenient place for shaving activities. This ensures the razor is within easy reach while she is getting ready and keeps the razor away from external factors like humidity or dust.

Other options, such as outside, barber shop, psycho's pocket, or suitcase, are not suitable or safe storage locations for a leg razor."},{"instruction":"While the original First Blood had its far-fetched moments, it was at least exciting in parts. In Rambo: First Blood, Part II the emphasis is shifted very much onto comic-book action. Plausibility is totally rejected; logic nose-dives; Stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission. Just like any other wish-fulfilment actioner of that time (e.g. Invasion USA, Commando, Red Scorpion), Rambo: First Blood, Part II cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for. If you can tell from the word go that Rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers, what is left to get excited about? Imprisoned after the events of the first movie, John J Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the Far East. The year is 1985, and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any American PoWs still trapped in the jungles of Vietnam. Rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier). Rambo's job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any American PoWs  if it doesn't, he is to rendezvous with a chopper; if it does, he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date. Aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge, the beautiful and resourceful Co Bao (Julia Nickson). Sure enough, Rambo discovers that there are PoWs in the camp, but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them when he reaches the rendezvous point, the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of Murdock who, it seems, doesn't really want to find any PoWs because of the political and military implications. Rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured, but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the PoWs and get his revenge on the treacherous Murdock. The few good points of the film come from Jack Cardiff's polished photography, Jerry Goldsmith's exhilarating score, and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics. Beyond these scant pickings, the film is a failure. The actors are reduced to macho posturing, the plot rings false, the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless, the dialogue is absurd even the violence becomes numbingly predictable. At the time of its release America was under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, a man with simplistic and near-hysterical anti-communist sentiments. For this reason, contemporary audiences lapped up this Commie-bashing shooting-fest as if it was the greatest movie of all-time, transforming it into an undeserved box office success. Thankfully times have changed  nowadays we can look upon it as a simple-minded action flick with a ludicrously high body count, ludicrously dumb politics, and a ludicrous hero. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer points out various aspects of the movie as weak or lacking, such as the implausible plot, lack of excitement due to the invulnerable hero, soulless action sequences, and absurd dialogue. They also criticize the political context of the movie and its simplistic approach to anti-communism. The reviewer acknowledges a few positive aspects like the cinematography, score, and stunt work, but overall, their opinion of the movie is unfavorable and dismissive."},{"instruction":"Where does the penis go when having sex?

Q: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. According to the above context, answer the following question. What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries? A:","output":"Those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries, as part of a diet rich in unhealthy, processed, and additive-filled foods, are likely to face a wide array of negative consequences which are associated with poor health choices. These individuals will face an increased risk of developing obesity, which has become an epidemic due to the widespread consumption of junk food, sugary sodas, and convenient, nutrient-deprived meals. In addition to obesity, this unhealthy lifestyle can contribute to the development of various health issues such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and metabolic syndrome. The constant reliance on fast foods and processed meals can also lead to digestive problems and nutritional deficiencies, as these food options contain limited vitamins, minerals, and essential nutrients. Furthermore, poor dietary choices can potentially result in a shorter lifespan due to the greater likelihood of developing chronic diseases. The increased risk of disease for those who frequently consume burgers and cheese fries, as part of an unhealthy diet, can also significantly reduce their quality of life during their later years. This may negatively impact their physical abilities, emotional well-being, and cognitive function, which are all crucial components of healthy aging. On the other hand, adopting a healthier diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, has been proven to lessen the risks of getting certain diseases and promote better overall health. By choosing to eat healthier foods, individuals can age in a more healthy manner, reducing their risk of conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and heart disease. In conclusion, people who continue to consume unhealthy foods like burgers and cheese fries are likely to face an increased risk of various chronic diseases, obesity, and reduced longevity which may lead to a poorer quality of life during their old age. By making a conscious decision to improve their dietary habits and adopt a more balanced and nutritious approach to eating, individuals can decrease their risk of serious health complications and enjoy a healthier aging process."},{"instruction":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Themodelsworedifferentcolouredlashes–green,yellow,orangeandblue–tobringouteachmodelseyecolour,inthemostbeautifulwaypossible.","output":"The models wore different colored lashes – green, yellow, orange, and blue – to bring out each model's eye color in the most beautiful way possible."},{"instruction":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn","output":"To determine whether this phrase is positive or negative, we should break it down and analyze its components. 1. \\"is concocted and carried out\\" - This part of the phrase suggests that an action or plan has been deliberately created and executed. 2. \\"by folks\\" - This part indicates the involvement of certain individuals in the action or plan. 3. \\"worthy of scorn\\" - This part signifies that the individuals involved are deserving of disdain or contempt.

The chain of thought and solution for this question is: 1. The sentence is about the Transformer and its function related to the conversion of coal or oil into electricity. 2. A Transformer does not directly use coal or oil as input or in its functionality. Transformers are electrical devices that are designed to change the voltage levels of alternating current (AC) or to convert AC voltage from one phase system to another. 3. The process of transforming coal or oil into electricity is typically carried out by power plants. First, coal or oil is burned in a boiler, converting water into steam. The steam then powers a turbine, which is connected to a generator that converts mechanical energy into electricity. 4. The electricity generated is then transmitted over long distances using high voltage transmission lines. Transformers are used in various stages of the transmission and distribution process to step up or step down voltage levels, but they do not \\"take coal or oil and transform it into electricity\\" directly. So, the sentence in question incorrectly attributes the transformation of coal or oil into electricity to the Transformer, when it should actually refer to power plants that convert these energy sources into electricity."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: Milorad Dodik has taken his place,\\" Simic said.

In recent years, there has been a growing concern among educators, parents, and policymakers about the effectiveness of the traditional educational system in fostering students' intrinsic motivation for learning. Many argue that the current system, which relies heavily on standardized testing, grades, and a one-size-fits-all approach, could be stifling creativity, curiosity, and the desire to learn. This context entails a critical review of the current educational system to explore whether it helps or hinders students in developing a passion for learning and how potential improvements could be made. Hypothesis: Implementing a more holistic, individualized, and project-based approach to education would increase students' intrinsic motivation for learning and result in better academic performance and overall well-being. This hypothesis posits that by focusing on an educational model that goes beyond merely memorizing facts and passing exams, students will develop a genuine interest in learning, which can, in turn, improve their academic performance. The hypothesis is built on the premise that educators should consider diverse learning styles and interests, fostering a sense of autonomy and self-driven learning in students. By engaging students in real-world projects, problem-solving activities, and collaborative work, they will be exposed to more meaningful learning experiences and develop a deeper connection to their studies. To test this hypothesis, a controlled study can be designed to compare the outcomes of students exposed to a more holistic, individualized, and project-based educational approach with those following a traditional curriculum. This study could involve both quantitative (e.g., standardized test scores, GPAs) and qualitative data (e.g., interviews, self-assessments of motivation and well-being) to evaluate the potential benefits of the proposed educational model. Additionally, follow-up studies should be conducted to assess the long-term effects of the proposed approach on students' motivation for learning, academic performance, and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: - caps is 102 130 15 - nationalyears is 2006 -- 2007 2012 -- - youthclubs is gorica - ntupdate is 7 february 2013 - birth date is 9 september 1986 - clubs is gorica maribor rijeka - nationalcaps is 5 3 - height is 1.79 m ftin 0 on - nationalgoals is 0 0 - nationalteam is slovenia u21 slovenia - birth place is Šempeter pri gorici , sfr yugoslavia - position is midfielder - fullname is goran cvijanović - years is 1997 -- 2005 2010 -- 2014 2014 -- 2015 - youthyears is 1997 -- 2005 - pcupdate is 29 may 2015 - goals is 15 31 1 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Step 3: Analyze if both sentences convey similar meaning. - Both sentences mention that the respective chains or supermarkets are trying to keep their stores open. However, the first sentence describes a specific number of striking workers being replaced by temporary employees, while the second sentence doesn't quantify the striking workers and states that managers and replacement workers are used. Step 4: Determine if the sentences convey the same meaning. - Although both sentences share some similarities, they do not convey the exact same meaning. The first sentence focuses on the specific number of striking workers replaced with temporary employees, while the second sentence highlights the usage of managers and replacement workers without any specific number and mentions the stores often operating at reduced hours. Conclusion: The sentences do not convey the same meaning, but they do share a common central theme of using temporary or replacement workers to keep stores operational during a strike."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Fifty has never looked better. It's been 50 years since the first James Bond film, Dr. No, premiered in cinemas. As first embodied by Scottish actor Sean Connery, Agent 007 was a fearless, cool-as-ice spy who excelled at sleuthing , fighting and saving the world. Since then, more than 20 films featuring the iconic spy have been released-making it one of the longest-running franchises in the history of cinema. On Nov 9, the 23rd Bond movie, Skyfall, celebrated the legend's 50th birthday. Over the years, audiences have changed. It doesn't matter. Six different actors have acted 007 and it doesn't matter. Even shocking technological and cultural changes can't bend Bond. Why? Is it the action, the sexy women, the cars, the gadgets and the exotic locations? Yes, but the most important reason is still the man himself. Bond can challenge his boss and shoot a bad guy in mere minutes. He is an expert in literature, languages, art and fine wines. He has a sharp tongue besides his wits. In the first film Dr. No, as Connery lit a cigarette, we heard James Bond's voice and saw his cafe for the first time. The simple scene and short phrase have defined the character for half a century. \\"Next to the Beatles and Stones, James Bond was the greatest British import of the 1960s,\\" David Kamp, a US contributing editor for Vanity Fair, wrote in a recent article about the birth of Bond and its influence on the US.

In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

Yes;"},{"instruction":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: James Harold Doolittle (December 14, 1896 - September 27, 1993) was an American aviation pioneer. A Reserve officer in the United States Army Air Corps, Doolittle was recalled to active duty during World War II. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for personal valor and leadership as commander of the Doolittle Raid, a bold long-range retaliatory air raid on the Japanese main islands, on 18 April 1942, four months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The attack was a major morale booster for the United States, and Doolittle was celebrated as a hero. Doolittle became acquainted with the field of space science in its infancy. He wrote in his autobiography, \\"I became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when I met Robert H. Goddard, who laid the foundation [in the US].... While with Shell [Oil] I worked with him on the development of a type of [rocket] fuel....\\" Harry Guggenheim, whose foundation sponsored Goddard's work, and Charles Lindbergh, who encouraged Goddard's efforts, arranged for (then Major) Doolittle to discuss with Goddard a special blend of gasoline. Doolittle piloted himself to Roswell, New Mexico in October 1938 and was given a tour of Goddard's workshop and a \\"short course\\" in rocketry and space travel. He then wrote a memo, including a rather detailed description of Goddard's rocket. In closing he said, \\"interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future, but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles away--who knows!\\" In July 1941 he wrote Goddard that he was still interested in rocket propulsion research. The Army, however, was interested only in JATO at this point. Doolittle was concerned about the state of rocketry in the US and remained in touch with Goddard. Shortly after World War II, Doolittle spoke to an American Rocket Society conference at which a large number interested in rocketry attended. The topic was Robert Goddard's work. He later stated that at that time \\"...we [the aeronautics field in the US] had not given much credence to the tremendous potential of rocketry. In 1956, he was appointed chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) because the previous chairman, Jerome C. Hunsaker, thought Doolittle to be more sympathetic to the rocket, which was increasing in importance as a scientific tool as well as a weapon. The NACA Special Committee on Space Technology was organized in January 1958 and chaired by Guy Stever to determine the requirements of a national space program and what additions were needed to NACA technology. Doolittle, Dr. Hugh Dryden and Stever selected committee members, such as Dr. Wernher von Braun from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, Sam Hoffman of Rocketdyne, Abe Hyatt of the Office of Naval Research and Colonel Norman Appold from the USAF missile program, considering their potential contributions to US space programs and ability to educate NACA people in space science. Did he ever work with anyone famous during this time?","output":"Yes, during this time, James Doolittle worked with many famous people. One example is when he worked with Robert H. Goddard, who was an important person in rocket development. He also met Charles Lindbergh and Harry Guggenheim, who supported Goddard's work.

A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults. The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero. Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. \\"They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,\\" she said.\\" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners.\\" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. \\"The question,\\" said Ms Darker Smith, \\"is why she did not break the door down herself.\\" Question: The passage is especially intended for _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"parents with young daughters\\"?

At the same time, the president's chief spokesman said the U.S. won't absolutely rule it out. 'A travel ban is not something that we're currently considering,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. 'We feel good about the measures that are already in place,' he insisted. White House on tilt? Obama's aides are facing tough questions from reporters who demand to know why planes from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are still allowed to land at US airports amid an Ebolaepidemic. Now arriving in the US: 77 sick patients believed to be infected with Ebola have been stopped from boarding planes bound for America, and the White House says that's enough to suggest the planes can still come. Global village: West African nationals can connect to the US via Nigeria or Europe and the White House says the planes have to continue flying if supplies and aid workers are to reach those in need. 'Our experts continue to be confident that the medical infrastructure that we have in this country is sufficient to prevent an Ebola outbreak from occurring,' Earnest said. He continued Monday to project confidence, which some have interpreted as reassuring while others see it as complacency. Still, he adopted a never-say-never attitude when pressed on the subject. 'This is something that we regularly assess and re-assess, and – so I wouldn't rule out any changes in the future,' he said. Earnest explained that a back-and-forth flow of aviation traffic is needed in order to fight the Ebola outbreak from an ocean away. 'We're relying on the commercial transportation system to move supplies and personnel into the region,' he said. 'So we don't want to obstruct one of the core components of our strategy.' The administration is relying heavily on what Earnest called 'a multi-layered screening protocol' to spare Americans from the kind of public health devastation that has brought three countries to their knees and killed thousands. 'There are extensive screening measures on the ground in west Africa where this outbreak has occurred,' he said, adding that 'there's guidelines and guidance and training that has been given to flight crews.' 'There also is a protocol in place for Customs and Border Patrol officers who are manning our ports of entry,' Earnest added, 'to be on the lookout for individuals, again, that may be exhibiting symptoms of Ebola – in other words, that are contagious with Ebola.' But health officials said Sunday that they are considering the approval of new measures designed to provide the U.S. with one extra firewall, such as checking the body temperature of everyone who enters the U.S. from an affected nation. Death toll keeps tolling: Red Cross workers loaded the body of this Ebola victim onto a truck for disposal on Sunday. Setting boundaries: US Air Force personnel mark out the location of a future field hospital in Liberia with razor wire, which could be needed to keep hordes of patients out of the few clinics available. Other pandemics have seen similar strategies. In 2009, at the height of the avian influenza scare, China and other Asian nations required temperature checks of every passenger deplaning in Beijing and other major points of entry. But those modest steps, like the more drastic travel ban proposals, are just drawing-board ideas. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that a 'discussion is underway right now' and 'all options are being looked at' for new U.S.-based screening plans. But the question, he told CNN, is whether 'the extra level of screening is going to be worth the resources you need to put into it. At a press conference Sunday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Dr. Thomas Frieden declared: 'There's no doubt that we can stop Ebola in this country.' He also said current screening protocols in Africa have stopped 77 potentially Ebola-infected people from boarding planes to America. The Ebola virus is transmitted via contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The current strain of the virus is believed to have killed about half of the people it has infected in Africa. U.S. officials stressed Friday during a White House press conference that America's public health system is more robust and will adequately protect the public. Highlights:","output":"- The United States has no plans to restrict travel from African countries affected by the Ebola virus epidemic, according to the Obama administration. - However, the U.S. won't absolutely rule it out and will continue to assess the situation. - White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest says the current measures in place are sufficient to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the US. - Health officials are considering new measures, such as checking the body temperature of everyone who enters the U.S. from an affected nation, as an extra layer of protection. - Commercial aviation traffic remains essential for moving supplies and personnel into the affected region, so the administration does not want to obstruct this core component of their strategy."},{"instruction":"I read this background article the other day: Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi. I am facing a new situation today: Bill and Chris are passionate entomologists. Bill knows everything there is to know about most ants except the Leafcutter ants. Chris studied Leafcutter ants extensively and exclusively for years now. They are good friends and exchange ideas often over a pint of beer. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend studied more about fungus eating ants?","output":"Considering the information given in the background article and the new situation, it is clear that Chris has studied more about fungus eating ants. This is because Chris has studied Leafcutter ants extensively and exclusively for years. Leafcutter ants are known to feed on a specific fungus that grows within their colonies, which is a unique aspect of their behavior and diet. Bill, on the other hand, knows about most ants but not specifically about Leafcutter ants. Therefore, Chris has more knowledge about fungus-eating ants."},{"instruction":"Given the question: You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews.

Nick has learned to develop photos by themselves but Donald has not because","output":"Nick has learned to develop photos by themselves but Donald has not because he hasn't yet had the opportunity to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge. While both friends share a passion for photography, their experience and learning paths have been quite different. Step 1: Understand the context of the text The context here is about two friends, Nick and Donald, who are interested in photography. Nick has learned to develop photos on his own, but Donald has not. Step 2: Identify the reasons for the difference in their skills In our continuation, it is important to highlight why Donald hasn't learned to develop photos like Nick has. The reason mentioned is that he hasn't had the opportunity to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge yet. Step 3: Elaborate on their experience and learning paths We can now delve deeper into the differences between Nick and Donald's experiences and learning paths in photography. Nick, for instance, discovered his love for photography at a young age and was determined to master every aspect of it. With access to resources and mentors, he got the chance to experiment with various techniques, such as film photography and traditional darkroom processes. He started by learning the basics of developing black and white film, which enabled him to understand the chemical reactions that take place during the development process. As he gained more experience, he began experimenting with different developer formulas and printing techniques, eventually becoming proficient in self-development of both black and white and color photos. On the other hand, Donald's introduction to photography was through digital means. He initially focused on learning about digital cameras, composition, and image editing software, such as Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop. Although he was fascinated by the idea of developing photos himself, the lack of resources and hands-on guidance made it difficult for him to venture into the world of film photography and darkroom processes. Moreover, since most of the photography industry has transitioned to digital formats, finding a mentor or even a local darkroom became increasingly challenging for Donald. Step 4: Summarize the comparison and their shared passion Despite the difference in their experience and skill set, Nick and Donald still bond over their mutual love for photography, with Nick often sharing his self-development knowledge with his friend. Inspired by Nick's expertise and passion for the craft, Donald is now actively seeking opportunities to expand his skillset into film photography and darkroom techniques. Their contrasting paths add depth and richness to their friendship, making them appreciate each other's perspectives and expertise in the art of photography."},{"instruction":"He said he 's just going to wear something he already has .

Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Please answer this question : Which cousin learned less about wolves? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, it can be inferred that Fox learned less about wolves. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Fox focused on reading about grazers and large herbivores, which typically constitute the primary consumers in a food chain. These organisms mainly consume plants, also known as primary producers. While it is true that wolves often prey on large herbivores, Fox's primary focus on grazers and herbivores would not provide as much direct information about wolves compared to Liam's study of apex predators. On the other hand, Liam's focus was on apex predators, which primarily refers to organisms that sit at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators of their own. In the context of the information provided, wolves are considered apex predators as they mostly prey on large herbivores (primary consumers) and face no natural predators themselves. This means that Liam would have gained more in-depth knowledge and understanding about wolves, recognizing their role as apex predators and their significance in maintaining trophic dynamics. Moreover, Liam's study might have involved learning about the application of the apex predator concept in various fields such as wildlife management, conservation, and ecotourism, providing deeper insights into the significance of wolves in these settings. In contrast, Fox's study would be focused on understanding the dynamics of herbivores in relation to the food chain, most likely without delving too much into the world of apex predators. In conclusion, Fox learned less about wolves compared to Liam due to the specific focus areas each of them chose to read about. While both cousins delved into the fascinating world of food chains, Liam's focus on apex predators would have provided him with a more comprehensive understanding of wolves and their role in the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

(June 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Introduction: The title card is shown as a billboard behind which Wile E. Coyote is hiding, ready to chase the Road Runner. He starts the chase, until he runs into a large truck. Wile E. runs the other way, and the truck shows the credit. The chase ends in a win for the truck, and the Coyote emerges battered. A box with director Chuck Jones' credit then squashes him. The Coyote throws the box away, and the shot freezes: COYOTE - Eatius Birdius. He resumes the chase, which freezes to show the Road Runner: Delicius-Delicius. The chase continues down the road until the Road Runner makes a U-turn. The Coyote turns around, then stops. The Road Runner completes the circuit around, meanwhile, and beeps as the Coyote turns around, causing him to leap back. The Road Runner starts off down the road and loosens it from its hinge briefly. Wile E. points worriedly and displays an \\"EGAD\\" sign, then an \\"!!\\" sign. He drops them and thinks of his new plan. 1. Wile E. hides in a manhole, and as the Road Runner passes over him, he pops out and fires a rifle. The bullet and the Road Runner are shown in slow time, with the bullet closing to within a half-body length of the bird. Then the Road Runner turns to notice the threat, lets out a beep and gears into super speed. The bullet then brakes in puzzlement and falls to the ground. Wile E. picks it up, and then it detonates. Behind another rock face (in completely different desert scenery), Wile E. paces until he comes up with a new plan. 2. Wile E. leaps out into the road with \\"1 sheet ACME Triple Strength BATTLESHIP STEEL ARMOR PLATE\\" in front of him; even this cannot stop the Road Runner from barreling through it. The Coyote stares in puzzlement at the resulting hole, which shows only the scenery behind him where parts of his body should logically be, then walks...

Once the chocolate is solid to the touch, they’re all done. Enjoy! What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article seems to be a part of a recipe guide or instructions on how to prepare a dish or confectionery that involves the use of chocolate. The main aspect discussed here involves placing a certain chocolate-coated item in a particular place, likely a refrigerator or freezer, until the chocolate has completely solidified or hardened. The given statement offers two options. The first option is to leave the items in the said place overnight to allow the chocolate to harden. The overnight method would probably facilitate a slow and thorough stiffening of the chocolate. Alternatively, the second option proposed is to keep them there just long enough for the chocolate to solidify. This method most likely suggests a shorter duration, making it a quicker option, beneficial when one is pressed for time. Once the chocolate on the items becomes solid to the touch, the preparation process concludes and they are ready to be served. This phrase correlates with many dessert recipes that require a final chilling and hardening step before the treats are fit to be enjoyed. In a summarized form, this excerpt of the article revolves around the final steps of a dessert recipe that requires the hardening of melted chocolate applied to an edible item by placing it in a cool environment such as a refrigerator or freezer. The emphasis is on ensuring that the chocolate is thoroughly solidified before consumption."},{"instruction":"Leo: If \\"Three men that include at least one street performer gather on a brick sidewalk.\\" does that mean that \\"Three men gather on a sidewalk.\\"?

Context: The political landscape in the United States looks a bit different in the wake of Tuesday's Senate election victory by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama. In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans. Moore was hurt by a depressed Republican turnout and a write-in campaign that drained away votes.

Both main band members of Painted Thin were vocalists.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can indeed conclude that the sentence \\"Both main band members of Painted Thin were vocalists\\" is true. Let's analyze the paragraph in detail to understand how we can reach this conclusion: 1. Painted Thin was a Canadian hardcore punk band from Winnipeg, active from 1993 to 1999. 2. The core of the band consisted of Stephen Carroll and Paul Furgale. Now, let's look at the roles that these two core members played in the band: 1. Stephen Carroll: Vocalist and Guitarist. 2. Paul Furgale: Bassist and Vocalist. Based on these details, it's clear that both Stephen Carroll and Paul Furgale took on the roles of vocalists within the band. While both of them contributed to the band in other ways (with Carroll serving as a guitarist and Furgale as a bassist), the fact that they were both involved in providing vocals for the band leads us to conclude that the sentence is accurate. In summary, since both main members of Painted Thin, Stephen Carroll and Paul Furgale, took on the role of vocalists during their tenure in the band, we can confirm that the sentence \\"Both main band members of Painted Thin were vocalists\\" is true."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Albany, Georgia, isPartOf, Dougherty County, Georgia; Albany, Georgia, country, United States; Albany, Georgia, isPartOf, Georgia (U.S. state)","output":"Based on the given data, a comprehensive sentence would be: \\"Albany is a city located within Dougherty County, which is part of the U.S. state of Georgia, and ultimately the country known as the United States.\\" Here's the step-by-step thought process and justification of why I chose this sentence: 1.

Each pizza is cut into 4 pieces. 3. Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas, while Ann and Cate eat 75% of their pizzas. 4. We need to determine the number of uneaten pizza pieces. Let's now calculate the amount of pizza each person eats and the amount left uneaten. Bill and Dale: - They eat 50% of their pizzas, meaning they each eat half of their pizza. - Each of their pizzas has 4 pieces, so they eat 0.5 × 4 = 2 pieces each. - Since each pizza has 4 pieces, the amount left uneaten for both of them is 4 - 2 = 2 pieces each. Ann and Cate: - They eat 75% of their pizzas, meaning they each eat three-quarters of their pizza. - Each of their pizzas has 4 pieces, so they eat 0.75 × 4 = 3 pieces each. - Since each pizza has 4 pieces, the amount left uneaten for both of them is 4 - 3 = 1 piece each. Now that we have the number of uneaten pieces for each person, we can add them together. Uneaten pieces: - Bill: 2 pieces - Dale: 2 pieces - Ann: 1 piece - Cate: 1 piece Adding all of them: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces Hence, there are 6 pizza pieces left uneaten."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Dawn Wiener (Heather Matarazzo) is a shy, unattractive, unpopular 12-year-old 7th grader in a middle-class suburban community in New Jersey.

Greg rolls his eyes at the mess and walks away. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person will experience more tooth decay? Hint: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.

In the most serious cases - seven of the 50 trusts that issued alerts - the hospitals declared they were unable to give patients comprehensive care. BBC Radio 4's Today programme has been told operations have been cancelled and patients left waiting on trolleys. NHS England said tried-and-tested plans were managing the pressures. Meanwhile, there have been calls for an investigation into the deaths of two patients waiting on emergency trolleys at Worcestershire Royal Hospital. One died from a cardiac arrest after reportedly waiting 35 hours, another died after an aneurysm. Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said there was an \\"absolute and urgent need\\" to help emergency departments. He warned that patients in affected hospitals could face delays in receiving pain relief and antibiotics. \\"We entered this winter in the worst state of affairs possible,\\" Dr Hassan told Today. \\"Staff are working at the very limit of their capabilities.\\" The Nuffield Trust health think tank released an analysis of the figures. A new system of recording the pressure on trusts is in place this winter, known as Operational Pressures Escalation Levels. It replaces the traditional system of hospitals declaring black or red \\"alerts\\". The Nuffield Trust said NHS England figures showed 50 hospital trusts had declared they were experiencing major pressures, compromising the flow of patients, and had to take urgent action. Of those, seven faced so much pressure they were unable to deliver comprehensive care and there was a higher chance of putting patients' safety at risk. It said that although there were not directly comparable figures, as the reporting regime had changed, an analysis of two weeks in December suggested trusts declared alerts on more days than they did under the old system the previous winter. Joe Harrison, chief executive of the Milton Keynes Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said patients were \\"struggling\\" to get out of hospital to go home or into another form of care. \\"We have significant numbers of patients needing hospital beds, putting pressure on the system,\\" he told Today. \\"Patients coming through our doors are clinically sicker,\\" he added. \\"They have got more things that need looking after and tend to stay longer in hospital.\\" Milton Keynes Hospital is currently at 92% bed occupancy. \\"We should be at 85% routinely, but quiet times are unfortunately becoming fewer,\\" Mr Harrison said. A spokeswoman for Northampton General Hospital said it had been running at a high alert level since Monday, with an unprecedented number of seriously ill patients. Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Taj Hassan said he had met NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and suggested emergency social care funding to help move patients out of hospital after treatment. A spokesman for NHS England said: \\"NHS tried-and-tested plans are currently managing the ongoing pressures of this winter. \\"Going into the new year, the public can play their part by avoiding going to A&E unless it is an emergency and using local pharmacies and NHS 111 for medical advice.\\" Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth MP, said: \\"These figures are alarming and highlight the pressures facing overcrowded, overstretched hospital departments this winter. \\"The government urgently needs to take action to make sure that our NHS can cope over the busy winter period and is able to provide the best possible care for patients.\\"","output":"Fifty hospitals in the United Kingdom have issued alerts and seven hospitals have declared they are unable to give comprehensive care to patients due to mounting pressures on the National Health Service (NHS) during winter months."},{"instruction":"La transición no habría impedido el proceso natural de uno de los Seres Sol. How do you say this sentence in English?","output":"The sentence \\"La transición no habría impedido el proceso natural de uno de los Seres Sol\\" can be translated into English as \\"The transition would not have prevented the natural process of one of the Sun Beings\\". Please note that without a specific context, it might be challenging to offer the most accurate translation because certain phrases or terms may quite politically, culturally, or contextually situated. For instance, \\"Seres Sol\\" is literally translated as \\"Sun Beings\\", but, depending on the context, it may refer to a metaphorical, philosophical or cultural concept. If \\"Seres Sol\\" is a title, name, or a specific term within a certain domain, we typically would not translate it but would leave it as it is and simply explain it. In this given sentence, \\"la transición\\" represents a change or shift, it is often used metaphorically to express substantial changes in situations or states of beings. \\"No habría impedido\\" stands for \\"would not have prevented\\", which is a conditional perfect construction to express something that would not have happened in the past under certain circumstances. Lastly, \\"el proceso natural\\" refers to a natural process, something occurring in its own course, autonomously, following the laws of nature. However, to fully understand and translate this phrase, more context would be required. It is likely referring to a metaphorical or philosophical concept due to the phrase \\"Seres Sol\\"."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: Which British comedian has a character called ‘The Pub Landlord’?","output":"The British comedian who has a character called \\"The Pub Landlord\\" is Alastair James Hay Murray, commonly known as Al Murray.

He is trying to devise a technique that would be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which reactants the particles would collide with greater force, reactant A or reactant B? Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph and hint, the particles would collide with greater force in reactant A, because reactant A has warmer reactants. At higher temperatures, particles have more energy and move faster, causing them to collide more forcefully."},{"instruction":"Q: who does billy russo become on the punisher? A:","output":"A: Billy Russo, portrayed by actor Ben Barnes, is introduced as a main character in the Marvel Television series \\"The Punisher,\\" which aired on Netflix from 2017 to 2019. In this series, the character Billy Russo evolves into the supervillain Jigsaw, one of the primary antagonists of the main character, Frank Castle, aka the Punisher. Billy Russo begins the series as a former Marine and a member of Frank Castle's covert military unit, Force Recon. He becomes Frank's close friend and confidant during their time in service together. However, after leaving the military, the two take different paths in life. While Frank Castle becomes the Punisher driven by his quest to take vengeance on the criminals responsible for the murder of his family, Billy Russo enters the private military sector, eventually becoming the founder and CEO of the private military corporation called Anvil. Unbeknownst to Frank Castle, Billy Russo conspires with high-ranking government officials and criminal elements who are responsible for the murder of Castle's family. This alliance leads to the creation of the covert operation known as Operation Cerberus, in which Frank Castle unknowingly participates, resulting in him becoming witness to illegal and morally ambiguous actions. When Frank tracks down Billy Russo's criminal involvement and confronts him, the painful betrayal culminates in a brutal showdown. Towards the end of the first season, the Punisher disfigures Billy Russo's face during an intense battle, smashing him against a mirror and dragging his face through the broken glass. Billy survives the brutal attack but is left with terrible scarring, and this marks his transformation into Jigsaw, named after his disfigured face resembling a jigsaw puzzle. As Jigsaw, Billy Russo loses his good looks and confidence that once helped him charm people around him. His damaged mind and the loss of his identity drive Jigsaw towards a darker and more violent path. He becomes obsessed with seeking revenge against the Punisher and ends up engaging in various criminal activities, including murder, extortion, and more. Jigsaw's transition to supervillain escalates the conflict between him and Frank Castle, making him a formidable foe and a symbol of the dark side of humanity that the Punisher relentlessly fights against. In the second season of the series, Jigsaw plays a crucial role as one of the leading antagonists, a shattered figure filled with rage, anguish, and a thirst for revenge. The character's arc demonstrates not only the dangers of betrayal but also the psychological consequences of violence and war on the mental state of individuals who have witnessed or participated in combat. In summary, Billy Russo becomes Jigsaw, a formidable supervillain and personal nemesis of the Punisher, Frank Castle. The character's evolution from former Marine and friend to a vengeful antagonist highlights the complexities of morality and the trauma experienced by those involved in war and criminal activities."},{"instruction":"Read the text and answer the questions.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you presented suggests that if more sound waves are produced outside, it will influence the amount of aluminum being rolled out. However, there is no direct or indirect causal relationship between the production of sound waves outside and the aluminum rolling process or the amount of aluminum being rolled out. The aluminum rolling process involves a mechanical system that converts aluminum ingots into thin sheets. This process is typically carried out in specialized facilities with heavy machinery and equipment tailored to handle aluminum production. The process is primarily driven by factors such as the demand for aluminum products, the efficiency of the machinery used, and the availability of raw materials, rather than external factors like the presence of sound waves. To summarize, the perturbation hypothesis involving more sound waves being produced outside does not have a direct or indirect effect on the aluminum rolling process or the amount of aluminum rolled out.

Calculate the sum of marks for the first 10 candidates: The average mark of the first 10 candidates is 55. So, we find the total sum of their marks using the same formula: Total sum for first 10 = Average x Number of candidates Total sum for first 10 = 55 x 10 Total sum for first 10 = 550 3. Calculate the sum of marks for the last 11 candidates: The average mark of the last 11 candidates is 40.

On Tuesday, Daisy had 3 dog toys left after losing some, and her owner went to the store and got her 3 more. On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing, so her owner went to the store and bought her 5 more. If Daisy's owner found all the lost dog toys, including the new dog toys, how many dog toys would Daisy have now?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"Step 1: First, let's determine the number of dog toys Daisy had on Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, Daisy had 5 dog toys. Step 2: On Tuesday, after losing some toys, Daisy had 3 dog toys left. Since we know she had 5 originally, that means so far she lost 5 - 3 = 2 dog toys. Step 3: Daisy's owner went to the store and bought 3 more dog toys on Tuesday. So, Daisy now had 3 (remaining from Monday) + 3 (new toys) = 6 dog toys on Tuesday. Step 4: On Wednesday, all of Daisy's old and new dog toys were missing. That means the total number of missing toys is now the 2 lost from Monday plus the 6 from Tuesday, which equals 2 + 6 = 8 missing toys. Step 5: Daisy's owner bought 5 more dog toys on Wednesday. If the owner found all the lost dog toys (8 toys) and added them to the new ones bought on Wednesday (5 toys), then Daisy would have a total of 8 (found toys) + 5 (new toys) = 13 dog toys altogether."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Dr. Alan Feinstone is a successful dentist. However, everything changes on the day of his wedding anniversary, when he discovers his wife Brooke is cheating on him with the poolman, Matt. After they finish, Alan retrieves his pistol and follows Matt in his car. He is led to Paula Roberts's house, a friend of Brooke's. Alan invents a story about a surprise party for Brooke and watches Paula invite Matt inside. Paula's dog attacks Alan, and he shoots it in self-defense. After returning to his car, he drives to work. At his dental practice, Alan's first appointment goes poorly when he hallucinates a child has rotten teeth and accidentally stabs him. As Detective Gibbs investigates the death of Paula's dog, Alan sees his second patient, April Reign, a beauty queen. Alan hallucinates she is his wife, and, while she is unconscious, takes off her pantyhose and fondles her before choking her. As she wakes, Alan snaps out of it and hides her pantyhose. Alan tells his manager, Steve Landers, she is still dizzy from nitrous oxide. When Steve realizes what really happened, he returns, punches Alan, and threatens a lawsuit. Alan ends the day early and sends his staff and patients home, including Sarah, a teenager who wants to have her braces removed. Later that night, Brooke meets Alan at a new opera-themed room at his practice. After sedating her under the premise of cleaning her teeth, he pulls out her teeth and cuts off her tongue. Detective Gibbs and his partner Detective Sunshine arrive at Alan's house the next morning to ask him questions. After the policemen leave, Matt discovers Brooke, who is still alive but sedated. Alan stabs Matt to death. Sarah and Paula are waiting for Alan at his practice. Alan sees Paula first, much to Sarah's disappointment. When Paula's conversation turns to how good a job Matt does for her, Alan overly-aggressively drills into her tooth, destroying it.

Upon discovering his wife's infidelity, he tracks down Matt, the poolman, which shows his obsession and loss of rational control. 2. Dr. Feinstone indulges in violence out of place, such as shooting Paula Roberts' dog in response to an attack. 3. He starts hallucinating at his dental practice, first seeing a child's teeth as rotten and inadvertently harming the child. His professional expertise begins to falter due to his mental turmoil. 4. He hallucinates his patient, April Reign, as his wife, sexually assaulting her in a delusional state. Furthermore, he lies to his manager about the incident. 5. The drastic step of sedating his wife, pulling out her teeth, and chopping off her tongue under the pretense of dental cleaning shows the extreme lengths of his distorted reality and vengeance. 6.

Webcomics can make use of an infinite canvas—meaning they are not constrained by size or dimensions of a page. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): With webcomics, readers have no access to what?","output":"In the context of webcomics, readers usually have no access to the following aspects: 1. Tangible copies: Unlike printed comics like graphic novels, manga, or comic books, readers cannot physically hold or touch webcomics. Webcomics exist exclusively in digital formats, which makes it difficult for some readers to have the same level of engagement or attachment compared to owning a physical copy. 2. Limited edition or collectible items: Collecting physical issues or special editions of printed comics can be a significant part of the comic reading experience for some people. However, this aspect is mostly absent in the webcomic landscape, as it's harder to own and display digital collectibles. 3. Direct interaction with creators: Although some webcomics allow readers to engage with creators using comment sections or social media, not all creators offer this level of interaction. In the webcomic world, this may leave some readers feeling disconnected from the authors or potentially unanswered questions about the comic. 4. Consistent updates or schedules: While traditional comics usually follow strict release schedules, webcomic creators often have the freedom to update their work at their own pace. This sometimes results in irregular updates or long gaps between installments, which can be frustrating for readers who like consistency. 5. Purchase and support options: While many webcomics are available for free, some readers may want to support their favorite creators financially. In traditional comics, audiences can do this by purchasing physical copies. Conversely, webcomic readers might encounter difficulties in finding ways to contribute financially, as different platforms offer varying methods, like Patreon or online stores, which can be confusing for some. 6. Quality control: Traditional comics often go through editorial and review processes to ensure high-quality storytelling and art. However, webcomics can be self-published by anyone without quality controls, which may make it harder for readers to find webcomics that match their tastes and preferences in terms of art and storytelling quality. In summary, the question about what readers have no access to, in the context of webcomics, can be answered by pointing out a few primary aspects. These aspects include tangible copies, limited edition or collectible items, direct interaction with creators, consistent updates or schedules, easier purchase and support options, and quality control."},{"instruction":"Translate from English to Spanish: Just paste this HTML code into your blog or website, your visitors can play dirty drag and we'll host the file for you!","output":"1.

Sentence B: \\"It's a town far from the city, I can see the moon shining in the sky.\\" - This sentence implies that being in a town far from the city allows the speaker to see the moon shining in the sky.

While the reviewer points out some issues they encountered, such as the lopsided shape, the challenge in removing the plug, and a slightly disappointing pump, their overall satisfaction with the product is clear. There are multiple aspects in the reviewer's feedback that highlights their positive view of the product. Firstly, they state that despite being shaped like an egg, it still \\"gets the job done and serves it's purpose.\\" This means they found the product ultimately functional and capable of meeting their needs. Secondly, the reviewer concludes their review with the statement, \\"I'm satisfied the ball is a good product.\\" This declaration of satisfaction underscores the overall positive sentiment conveyed in the review.

When Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323 BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction of poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this. With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 – 317 BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 – 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army.A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent...

Catching Fire, out in Chinese theaters on Nov 21, is set in a futuristic society called Panem. Every year its government holds a televised fight to the death. Two teenagers from each of the 12 districts of Panem are chosen to compete. In the new film, last year's victors Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her partner Peeta are back home after winning the 74thHunger Games. Katniss just wants to live a normal life. However, that never seems to happen. She has nightmares, which remind her that she is a killer. Her worst nightmare comes true when the annual Hunger Games arrive again. The teenager finds herself back in the competition along with Peeta. Since Katniss brings hope to Panem through her courage, President Snow plans to use this year's Games to kill off Katniss and Peeta and in turn _ the fires of rebellion. \\"This is the next step of Katniss' heroism and the next part of her journey to finding out who she is really going to be,\\" Lawrence told Reuters.

What the crap were you expecting from a Jet Li movie? Did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story, then just loaded it up with action? Of course not!

The industrial average was first calculated on May 26, 1896. Currently owned by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by S&P Global, it is the most notable of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was first published on February 16, 1885. The averages are named after Dow and one of his business associates, statistician Edward Jones. It is an index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market. It is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was also created by Dow. The \\"Industrial\\" portion of the name is largely historical, as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. The average is price-weighted, and to compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments, it is currently a scaled average. The value of the Dow is not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks, but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is larger than the sum of the component prices. Although the Dow is compiled to gauge the performance of the industrial sector within the American economy, the index's performance continues to be influenced by not only corporate and economic reports, but also by domestic and foreign political events such as war and terrorism, as well as by natural disasters that could potentially lead to economic harm. - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic. - Banaadir (or \\"Bandir\\") is an administrative region (\\"gobol\\") in southeastern Somalia.

They demanded the release of ten RAF members detained at the Stammheim Prison plus two Palestinian compatriots held in Turkey and US15 million in exchange for the hostages. The assassination of Siegfried Buback, the attorney-general of West Germany on 7 April 1977, and the failed kidnapping and murder of the banker Jürgen Ponto on 30 July 1977, marked the beginning of the German Autumn. It ended on 18 October, with the liberation of the \\"Landshut\\", the death of the leading figures of the first generation of the RAF in their prison cells, and the death of Schleyer. - Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC).

Martin Luther King Jr. has declined the post her father once held as president of the Atlanta-based Southern Christian Leadership Conference, saying she was interested in being more than a \\"figurehead.\\" The Rev. Bernice A. King was elected to the office in October 2009, but never served as president as a string of legal battles divided the 53-year-old organization. Bernice King told CNN political contributor Roland Martin she made suggestions to the organization in October about how the presidency might operate. She said she felt \\"disrespected\\" because there was no formal communication until earlier this month. \\"What they sent back was merely a job description that primarily spoke to a board-driven organization,\\" King said. \\"I was elected to lead the organization. I was frankly not interested in merely being a figurehead of the organization.\\" \\"I envisioned SCLC emerging as the vanguard for next-generation nonviolent activism in the tradition of my father,\\" King said in a statement earlier Friday. \\"Amidst the turmoil, chaos and confusion surrounding SCLC over the last 15 months, my team and I dedicated an exhaustive amount of time, energy and resources to assess the organization and prepare for my transition.\\" The group's national board of directors said King was shifting \\"her attention to furthering her mother's legacy and embark upon other ministry initiatives. \\"We wish the best for Elder Bernice King, and pray for her great success as she moves forward,\\" it said in a statement. A judge in Fulton County (Georgia) Superior Court ruled in September 2010 the current national board should be in charge, instead of another faction, although that decision is under appeal. Dr. Howard Creecy, acting president of the SCLC, told CNN that the board supported King's right to make a \\"quality decision.\\" \\"We never asked for the storms we had to pass through,\\" he said, indicating the gap between King's election and her taking the presidency was a \\"lengthy period.\\" The SCLC \\"gave a voice\\" to people affected by the Gulf oil spill disaster and remains concerned about the plight of the poor, Creecy said, adding that the group is \\"restoring our credibility.\\" Bernice King said she now plans to shift her attention to furthering the legacy of her mother, Coretta Scott King, and pursuing ministry initiatives. \\"We wouldn't know Martin Luther King as we know him if it were not for all of her work.\\" Coretta Scott King died in January 2006, 38 years after her Nobel Peace Prize-winning husband was assassinated. The SCLC has seen a power struggle dating back about a decade, said Ralph Luker, a retired professor who specialized in the civil rights movement and has been an observer of the organization. Bernice King's brother, Martin Luther King III, was president of the SCLC from 1997 to 2004. They and sibling Dexter King had been locked in a bitter legal battle over their parents' estates and rightful succession. The group, which has chapters and affiliates throughout the country, was a leading organization during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Bernice King told Martin she wants to work with the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference on education, health care, immigration and other issues. \\"Regardless of what institution, the work of my father will continue,\\" she said. It's now up to the SCLC to determine the proper leadership model, the minister told CNN. \\"I will continue to pray for them to move forward in a positive direction,\\" Bernice King said. Dr. Bernard LaFayette Jr., vice chairman of the SCLC, said the organization will move forward. \\"She deserves the right to make her own assessment,\\" he said of Bernice King.

The driver's world championship and manufacturer's world championship are separate championships, but based on the same point system. The series currently consists of 13 three-day events driven on surfaces ranging from gravel and tarmac to snow and ice. Each rally is split into 1525 special stages which are run against the clock on closed roads. - M-Sport is an auto racing team based at Dovenby Hall near Cockermouth, Cumbria, England, United Kingdom. Formed in 1979 by the former WRC driver Malcolm Wilson, and originally known as Malcolm Wilson Motorsport, the team has had varying success running cars in several rally championships. Since 1996, M-Sport has prepared and run the official Ford World Rally Team cars in the World Rally Championship and since 2014 the company also is the official Bentley Motorsport outfit, competing in the Blancpain Endurance Series. - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom. - Petter Solberg (born 18 November 1974) is a Norwegian professional rally and rallycross driver. - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at .

From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German). - Lillehammer is a town and municipality in Oppland county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Gudbrandsdal. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Lillehammer. As of May 2011, the population of the town of Lillehammer was 26,639. The city centre is a late 19th-century concentration of wooden houses, which enjoys a picturesque location overlooking the northern part of lake Mjøsa and the river Lågen, surrounded by mountains. Lillehammer hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics and 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. Before Oslo's withdrawal from consideration, it was included as part of a bid to host events in the 2022 Winter Olympics if Oslo were to win the rights to hold the Games. - The 2016 Winter Youth Olympics (Norwegian: \\"Vinter-OL for ungdom 2016\\"), officially known as the II Winter Youth Olympic Games, took place in and around Lillehammer, Norway, between 12 February and 21 February 2016.

Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - A co-driver is the navigator of a rally car in the sport of rallying, who sits in the front passenger seat. The co-driver's job is to navigate, by reading off a set of pacenotes to the driver, often over a radio headset, due to the high level of noise in the car. The co-driver tells the driver what lies ahead, where to turn, the severity of the turn, and what obstacles to look out for. This role is particularly critical in high-end rally competitions such as WRC. Co-drivers are also often called on to perform maintenance on the car during road sections and special stages, such as changing a wheel. - Cato Menkerud ( born August 23 , 1973 in Lillehammer , Norway ) is a rally co-driver . He started as a co-driver in 1992 for his father Helge Menkerud . In addition to Henning Solberg , he has co-driven for Petter Solberg , Birger Gundersen , Thomas Kolberg , Alexander Foss and Henrik Lundgaard . After the 2009 World Rally Championship season Menkerud split from Henning Solberg , and became the co-driver for Eyvind Brynildsen . In addition to being a co-driver he runs a gas station in Lillehammer , where he lives . He is married to Charlotte . - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of... - In rallying, pacenotes are a commonly used method of accurately describing a rallying route to be driven in extreme detail. As well as dictating the general route to be taken, in terms of turnings, junctions, etc., all notable features of the route which might affect the way it is driven at speed are included. These details include the distance between each feature, the degree and severity of bends, adverse camber, crests and hill jumpings, surface type and conditions, potholes, special instructions to the driver, etc. - Henning Solberg (born 8 January 1973) is a Norwegian rally and rallycross driver. Together with his female co-driver Ilka Minor, he currently competes in the World Rally Championship (WRC) with cars of M-Sport. Solberg is the older brother of the 2003 FIA World Rally Champion Petter Solberg and through his in Sweden born spouse Maud the stepfather of Swedish rally driver Pontus Tidemand. - Rallycross is a form of sprint style automobile racing, held on a closed mixed-surface racing circuit, with modified production or specially built road cars, similar to the World Rally Cars, although usually with about stronger engines, due to e.g. their 45 mm turbo restrictor plates. It is mainly popular in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Great Britain. An inexpensive, entry level type of rallycross is the Swedish \\"folkrace\\" or its Norwegian counterpart, the so-called \\"bilcross\\". The folkrace is most popular in Finland where it was founded back in late 60's. In Europe, rallycross can also refer to racing 1:8 scale off-road radio-controlled buggies.

This implies that Taylor may be in a situation where they are surrounded by negative influences or potential threats. Step 2: Identify possible outcomes A) Taylor successfully uses the Bible to combat evil B) Taylor faces challenges but ultimately manages to overcome them with their faith and the teachings from the Bible C) Taylor faces challenges that they cannot overcome, resulting in failure or detrimental consequences. Step 3: Evaluate the likelihood of these outcomes Several factors contribute to the likelihood of each outcome, such as Taylor's level of faith, determination, and support system. Assessing these factors can help predict which outcome is more likely to occur. Step 4: Provide a final answer While it is impossible for me to predict the exact outcome for Taylor, considering the context hints that Taylor values faith and is determined to fight evil.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ).

You need to read the extract and create questions that can be answered from the extract. Once you create a question you also need to provide the correct answer for it. Write your answer like \\"Question: your question, Answer: your answer\\". The questions should be well-formed and grammatically correct. The questions should be completely answerable from the given passage and should not require any external knowledge. Subjective questions are not allowed. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Create questions that result in factoid answers. A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is a factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage. Input: Based on the best-selling historical novel by Jeff Shaara, \\"Gods and Generals\\" covers the events of the American Civil War before the climactic battle of Gettysburg. Seen from the points of view of leaders such as Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Winfield Scott Hancock and Robert E. Lee, the film begins just after the attack on Fort Sumter in April 1861, and culminates with the battle of Chancellorsville in May of 1863. Directed by Ronald F. Maxwell, the film is an epic, dramatic prequel to \\"Gettysburg,\\" the classic 1993 film also directed by Maxwell.Gods and Generals is the second installment of the Michael/Jeff Shaara Civil War trilogy and the second to be filmed. The third and final installment, The Last Full Measure, was in pre-production but lost financing and has been suspended indefinitely. Congruent to the 1992 production of Gettysburg, Gods and Generals is of epic length with a final release running time of nearly four hours, having been trimmed from roughly six. The story opens just before the secession of Virgina and just after Lincoln had called for 75,000 troops to repel the rebellion. Robert E. Lee is offered and declines the command of Union forces. Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, an instructor at VMI during the secessionist takeover of the institute, commits himself to the defense of Virginia and is rapidly swept up in a leadership role of the fledgling Army of Northern Virginia. The story follows primarily from the perspective of Jackson, as well as other key figures on both sides, but is decidely emphatic of the Confederate POV. We follow Jackson through three early and decisive CSA victories; Manassas (1st Bull Run), Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville, the scene of his untimely death. The film diverges dramatically from the book version in that the battle of Antietam, a tactical CSA victory, is omitted entirely (it was however filmed but ultimately removed from the final print). Throughout these campaigns Jackson is portrayed as a deeply pious, stern, yet confident and capable commander. The story follows the decision makers, military and political, on both sides and how their actions influence the course of the war through May 1863. Gettysburg, based on Shaaras Killer Angels, picks up the saga from there. Output:","output":"Part #1: Creating questions that can be answered from the extract. Usage: Question: Who is the author of the historical novel \\"Gods and Generals\\"? Answer: Jeff Shaara. This meets the criteria because the passage specifically mentions that the novel is written by Jeff Shaara. Part #2: Providing the correct answer for the question. Usage: Question: Which battle does the film \\"Gods and Generals\\" culminate with? Answer: Chancellorsville. This is a correct answer since the passage states that the film \\"culminates with the battle of Chancellorsville in May of 1863.\\" Part #3: Well-formed and grammatically correct questions. Usage: Question: Who directed the films \\"Gods and Generals\\" and \\"Gettysburg\\"? Answer: Ronald F. Maxwell.

You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Don't waste your money Product review: I bought a Melitta burr coffee mill at a kitchen outlet for apparently the regular retail price of about 25. It lasted about a month. The grinding was just ok but it did tend to clog up. I think it put too much stress on the motor to do espresso grinds. Anyway, not an issue now since the motor didn't hold up at all. I am now going to go ahead and buy something that costs more but that I can depend on to last. Answer:","output":"The given product review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. The reasons for this are as follows: 1. Negative Review Title: The title \\"Don't waste your money\\" is a strong deterrent, implying that the reviewer would not recommend purchasing the product because it does not meet their expectations and might not be worth the investment. 2. Short Lifespan: The reviewer mentions that the Melitta burr coffee mill only lasted about a month, which is a very short lifespan for a product in this category. This shows that the product may have low durability and potentially poor build quality. 3. Grinding Issues: The grinding capability seems to be mediocre at best, with the reviewer saying it was \\"just ok\\" and that the mill tended to clog up. For a coffee grinder, it is crucial that the grinding is efficient and consistent, and this issue suggests that the product does not perform effectively for its primary function. 4. Unsuitable for Espresso Grinds: The reviewer also notes that the mill struggled to grind beans fine enough for espresso, which might have caused undue stress on the motor. The inability to handle finer grinds is a considerable limitation for some coffee enthusiasts, making the product less attractive. 5. Motor Failure: The motor of the coffee mill failed after a short period of use, which indicates a significant quality issue. A reliable motor is essential for a product like this to function correctly and without any operational issues. 6. Preference for a Higher-Priced, Dependable Product: The reviewer's intention to purchase a more expensive but reliable alternative suggests that the Melitta burr coffee mill did not meet their expectations. A higher-priced product may offer better quality, performance, and durability, making it more appealing in comparison. Taking all these factors into account, it is clear that the review paints a rather negative picture of the Melitta burr coffee mill. Therefore, the chances of me buying the product would be significantly decreased after reading this review, and I would likely consider exploring other options in search of a higher-quality and more reliable coffee grinder."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Brothers for the following movie plot: John Tucker is popular, sexy, talented and a complete player.

Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and there are no mechanism-based therapies. The disease is defined by the presence of abundant neurofibrillary lesions and neuritic plaques in the cerebral cortex. Neurofibrillary lesions comprise paired helical and straight tau filaments, whereas tau filaments with different morphologies characterize other neurodegenerative diseases. No high-resolution structures of tau filaments are available. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps at 3.4-3.5 Å resolution and corresponding atomic models of paired helical and straight filaments from the brain of an individual with Alzheimer's disease. Filament cores are made of two identical protofilaments comprising residues 306-378 of tau protein, which adopt a combined cross-β/β-helix structure and define the seed for tau aggregation. Paired helical and straight filaments differ in their inter-protofilament packing, showing that they are ultrastructural polymorphs. These findings demonstrate that cryo-EM allows atomic characterization of amyloid filaments from patient-derived material, and pave the way for investigation of a range of neurodegenerative diseases.","output":"Title: Cryo-EM Reveals Alzheimer's Tau Filament Structures: Identifying the Seed for Aggregation and Polymorphs"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: HOTEL INFORMATION 3800 W.

Wrap a cotton strip around your hairline, tucking it under the rods.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Mastering the Art of Hair Curling: A Step-By-Step Guide to Achieving Perfect Curls Introduction: From beachy waves to soft, defined curls, the world of hair styling is constantly evolving, and one technique that remains relevant is the art of hair curling. Curling rods are among the most popular tools for at-home hair enthusiasts, as well as professional stylists. These versatile tools offer an array of possibilities, transforming your locks from lifeless to fabulous in minutes. In this detailed article, we'll explore the step-by-step process of curling your hair to achieve salon-like results, right in the comforts of your home. Step 1: Preparing Your Hair and Tools Before diving into the hair-curling process, gather the necessary tools and ensure your hair is in the right condition. Start with clean, dry hair. Make sure you have combed your hair and removed any tangles. To protect your hair from heat damage, you may also want to apply a heat protectant spray. For this demonstration, you'll need: - Curling rods (in the size of your choice) - End papers - Rat-tail comb - Hair clips (for sectioning) - A cotton strip Step 2: Sectioning Your Hair Begin by creating three sections of your hair – a middle section and two side sections. Use the rat-tail comb to part your hair down the middle and clip the side sections away for now. This will make it easier to work through each section one at a time, ensuring even curls throughout your hair. Step 3: Starting with the Middle Section Take a thin strand of hair from the middle section (roughly 1-inch wide) and comb through it to ensure it's smooth. Holding the strand taught, fold an end paper around the tip of the hair strand. This helps to properly secure the hair onto the rod and ensures an even curl from the roots to the ends. Step 4: Wrapping the Hair Strand Around the Curling Rod Place the wrapped tip of the hair strand onto the curling rod and begin wrapping the strand around the rod, moving away from your face. Remember to keep tension on the hair strand as you wrap it, and maintain an even distance between each wrap to control the curl size. Once the hair strand is completely wrapped, secure the rod in place by snapping the rod's closure or using a hairpin. Step 5: Repeating the Process for the Entire Middle Section Following the same technique, continue to take thin strands of hair from the middle section, fold end papers onto the tips, and wrap each strand around curling rods one at a time. Clip the rods as you finish each strand. Continue the process until the entire middle section is wrapped in rods. Step 6: The Side Sections Move on to the side sections of your hair and apply the same process. However, instead of just one row of rods, create two columns of rods for each side section. This will ensure even distribution of curls and provide better support for the curling process. Begin from the front of your head and work towards the back for both columns as you proceed. Step 7: Wrapping a Cotton Strip Around the Hairline To protect your hairline and keep the rods securely in place during the curling process, wrap a cotton strip around the hairline. Make sure to tuck the strip under the secured rods, ensuring a snug fit. This will also help to absorb any moisture from your hair, allowing for a more efficient curling process. Step 8: Letting the Curls Set For optimal results, let the curling rods remain in your hair for at least 45 minutes, or until your hair is completely dry (if you applied a heat protectant spray). You can also opt for a hooded dryer or a soft bonnet dryer if you prefer a faster, more controlled setting process. Step 9: Unraveling Your Curls Once your hair is completely set and dry, gently remove the cotton strip. Starting from the bottom and working your way up, carefully unclip and unwind the curling rods from each hair strand. Be sure to handle your curls with care to maintain their shape while removing the rods. Step 10: Finishing Touches At this point, you will have a head full of beautifully defined curls. To style your curls, gently run your fingers through your hair, or use a wide-tooth comb to break up the curls and create a more natural, voluminous look. Finish off your look with a light hairspray or serum to hold your curls in place and add shine. Conclusion: Curling your hair with curling rods may seem like a daunting task, but with practice, this step-by-step guide will help you achieve perfect curls in no time. Don't get discouraged if you don't achieve flawless curls on the first try; the more you practice, the better your results will be. Experiment with different rod sizes and styling techniques to find the perfect curling method that works best for your hair type and desired look. Happy curling!"},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Apple chief executive Tim Cook says the European Commission ruling that Apple should pay billions of euros in back taxes to the Republic of Ireland is \\"maddening\\" and \\"political\\".\\" Article:","output":"Title: Apple Boss Tim Cook is Not Happy with a Big Money Decision Once upon a time, in a land far, far away called Europe, there was a special group of people called the European Commission. This group makes important decisions, just like how your parents decide what's good for you. One day, they made a decision that the Apple company, who makes iPhones, iPads and other things we all love, should give lots of money, like lots and lots of pocket money, back to a place called the Republic of Ireland. Now, the boss of Apple is named Tim Cook, and when he heard about this decision, he was not very happy. He felt like it was like being asked to share his toys, even though he didn't think he had to. Tim Cook said that what the European Commission decided was \\"maddening\\" and \\"political.\\" \\"Maddening\\" is when something makes you really, really frustrated, like when your brother or sister borrows your toys without asking first. And \\"political\\" means it has to do with big people's decisions, like when mom and dad decide where to go on vacation. Tim Cook doesn't think it's fair that Apple has to give away lots of money like that. He believes that the decision was not made for the right reasons. It's like when someone tells you to do something, just because they can, even if it doesn't seem fair. But, just like when your parents tell you to share your room or your toys, sometimes big people and even big companies like Apple have to do things they don't like. Even if Tim Cook doesn't agree with the decision, they might still have to give the money to the Republic of Ireland in the end. That's the story about how Apple's boss Tim Cook felt when he was told his company needs to pay lots of money back to a faraway place. It just goes to show that even when you grow up and become the boss of a big company, you still have to follow the rules and sometimes do things you don't want to."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],N={key:0},j={key:1};function z(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
