Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work. What happened after the potential buyer found out about the murder? - He decided not to buy the house - not enough information - He decided to go see the house - He asked his friend about the house The answer is:","output":"He decided not to buy the house.

Justification: The feeling of exhaustion, or getting tired, is a natural response of the human body as a result of physical or mental strain. When we participate in activities that require energy, our body undergoes various processes, which lead to fatigue. Here are some factors that come into play: 1. Energy depletion: As we engage in activities, our body burns calories and uses energy reserves to fuel the process. Over time, these energy reserves get depleted, leading to fatigue. 2. Muscle fatigue: Muscle cells need oxygen and nutrients to function properly, and muscles create tension by contracting. Continuous contraction leads to muscle fatigue, as the cells begin to run out of energy. This often results in muscle soreness or stiffness. 3. Build-up of metabolic waste: As muscles work, they produce metabolic waste as a byproduct. The buildup of waste products, such as lactic acid, within muscles can cause a sensation of fatigue. 4. Mental strain: Cognitive tasks or emotional stress can lead to mental fatigue. It affects our ability to concentrate and increases the sensation of tiredness, even if we haven't engaged in physical activity. 5. Sleep and recovery: Lack of proper sleep impairs our body's ability to recover from daily activities, and sleep deprivation can lead to an ongoing feeling of exhaustion. Understanding and managing the factors that lead to fatigue can help reduce its impact on our daily lives, whether it be through planning rest periods, properly hydrating and fueling the body, or finding ways to manage mental stress and ensure adequate sleep."},{"instruction":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

It wants to know the number of different combinations when selecting 3 books with at least one paperback book included. This means that we have to count the combinations with 1 paperback and 2 hardbacks, as well as the combinations with all 3 paperback books. However, there is only 1 paperback book, so there is no possibility of choosing more than 1 paperback. So, we only need to consider the combinations with 1 paperback and 2 hardbacks. To find the number of combinations, we could either count the combinations directly, or use the complementary counting method, which is to find the total number of combinations and subtract the combinations without any paperback books. Let's try the complementary counting method. We have a total of 8 books, so there are C(8,3) total ways to choose 3 books, where C is the combination formula. Then we count the combinations with only hardback books, since there are 7 hardbacks, we have C(7,3) combinations. The number of combinations including at least one paperback book is C(8,3) - C(7,3). Using combination formula, we have: C(8,3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!) = 56 C(7,3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!) = 35 So the number of combinations with at least one paperback is: 56 - 35 = 21.

Pence will pay a three day visit to Israel. (AP Photo/Tsafrir Abayov) (Associated Press) U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen wave as they landed at Tel Aviv airport Sunday, Jan. 21, 2018. Pence will pay a three day visit to Israel. (AP Photo/Tsafrir Abayov) (Associated Press) AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Jordan's king appealed Sunday to Vice President Mike Pence to \\"rebuild trust and confidence\\" in the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, following fallout from the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Pence tried to reassure the monarch that the U.S. was committed to restarting peace efforts and to a two-state solution, if both sides agree. Such a caveat deviates from long-standing U.S. support for that approach as the only possible outcome of any peace deal. Trump's announcement on Jerusalem last month infuriated the Palestinians, who seek the Israeli-annexed eastern sector of the city as a future capital. They accused the U.S. of siding with Israel and said Washington can no longer serve as a mediator. Jerusalem is the emotional centerpiece of the long-running conflict, and Trump's policy shift set off protests and condemnation across Arab and Muslim countries. It posed a dilemma for Abdullah, a staunch U.S. ally who derives his political legitimacy in large part from the Hashemite dynasty's role as guardian of a key Muslim site in Jerusalem. Any perceived threat to Muslim claims in the city is seen as a challenge to Jordan, where a large segment of the population is of Palestinian origin. Pence told the king that the U.S. has committed \\"to continue to respect Jordan's role as the custodian of holy sites, that we take no position on boundaries and final status.\\" It was a message Pence relayed Saturday in talks with Egypt's president. Later, after meeting U.S. troops near the Syrian border, Pence said he and Abdullah had \\"a very frank discussion.\\" \\"Look, friends occasionally have disagreements and we agreed to disagree on the decision by the United States to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. But what we agreed on was the need for all parties to come back to the table,\\" Pence said. \\"The Palestinian Authority has been absent from direct negotiations since 2014. And I hope I impressed upon King Abdullah our earnest desire to restart the peace process,\\" Pence said. Abdullah expressed concerns about the regional fallout from the Jerusalem decision. \\"Today we have a major challenge to overcome, especially with some of the rising frustrations,\\" he said. He described the Pence visit as a mission \\"to rebuild trust and confidence\\" in getting to a two-state solution, in which a state of Palestine would be established in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967. Another cause of concern for Jordan is the Trump administration's decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Jordan vehemently opposes such a move if taken ahead of an Israeli-Palestinian partition deal. Israel views Jerusalem as its unified capital. An international consensus has long held that the city's final status should be decided through negotiations, which was also U.S. policy going back decades. Palestinians view Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital as a blatantly one-sided move. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not meet with Trump administration officials and called off a meeting with Pence that had been scheduled for mid-December. In a new expression of that snub, Abbas overlapped with Pence in Jordan from Saturday evening to midday Sunday, when the Palestinian leader flew to Brussels for a meeting with European Union foreign ministers Monday. There, Abbas is expected to urge EU member states to recognize a state of Palestine in the pre-1967 lines, and to step up involvement in mediation. Nabil Abu Rdeneh, an Abbas adviser, reiterated that \\"the U.S. is no longer acceptable as a mediator.\\" Pence was scheduled to hold meetings on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, deliver an address to the Knesset and visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. Netanyahu called Pence \\"a great friend of Israel\\" and said there was \\"no alternative for American leadership\\" in the peace process. \\"Whoever is not ready to talk with the Americans about peace — does not want peace,\\" he said at a meeting of ambassadors in Jerusalem. Palestinians in the West Bank protested Pence's arrival by burning posters with his image on them. ___ Associated Press writer Karin Laub contributed to this report. ||||| AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan’s King Abdullah told U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday he looked to Washington to rebuild “trust and confidence” in moving toward a two-state solution in Israel after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the country’s capital. With Pence sitting across from him in the royal palace, King Abdullah said Jordan viewed the Israel-Palestinian conflict as a “potential major source of instability”. He said he had raised his concerns for some time that such a decision on Jerusalem “does not come as a result of a comprehensive settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict”. He also reiterated that East Jerusalem should be the capital of a future Palestinian state. “We hope that the U.S. will reach out and find the right way to move forward in these challenging circumstances,” the king said. At the end of the visit, Pence in remarks to the press said he “agreed to disagree” with King Abdullah on the impact of Trump’s move. Pence said in Egypt on Saturday and again in Jordan that the United States would support a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians if they both agreed to it. Trump’s endorsement in December of Israel’s claim to Jerusalem as its capital drew universal condemnation from Arab leaders and criticism around the world. It also broke with decades of U.S. policy that the city’s status must be decided in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the Arab-Israeli war in 1967. Pence told the king that Washington was committed to preserving the status quo of holy sites in Jerusalem. King Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in the city, making Amman particularly sensitive to any changes of status there. “For us, Jerusalem is key to Muslims and Christians, as it is to Jews. It is key to peace in the region and key to enabling Muslims to effectively fight some of our root causes of radicalization,” he said. Jordanian officials fear Trump’s move has wrecked chances of a resumption of Arab-Israeli peace talks, which King Abdullah had sought to revive. Slideshow (6 Images) They also worry the move could trigger violence in the Palestinian territories which could spill over into Jordan, where many people are descendants of Palestinian refugees whose families left after Israel was created in 1948. “We take no position on boundaries and final status. Those are subject to negotiation,” Pence said. After the meeting, Pence flew to a military facility near the Syrian border to meet with U.S. troops. He will finish his three-nation Middle East trip in Israel. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"US Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen landed at Tel Aviv airport in Israel on 21 January 2018.

Hardwood is preferred over softwood because it creates less smoke and burns longer. Adding a woodstove or fireplace to a home is often felt to add ambiance and warmth.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Burning wood results in several outcomes, such as: 1. Heat production: As wood burns, it releases energy in the form of heat. This heat can be used to provide warmth in homes, especially during cold seasons, as well as for cooking purposes. In rural areas where other forms of fuel may be scarce or expensive, wood is a readily available and affordable energy source. 2. Light: Wood combustion also produces light, which can be used for illumination at night or in dark spaces. The radiant light and warmth from a wood-burning stove or fireplace can add a cozy and nostalgic atmosphere to a home. 3. Combustion by-products: When wood is burned, it produces several by-products, including smoke, ash, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Smoke consists of various gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, and other harmful pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). Ash is the solid residue left after complete combustion, which can be used as a fertilizer or disposed of safely. 4. Greenhouse gas emissions: Burning wood releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, a major greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. However, wood is considered a renewable energy source in the sense that trees can be replanted and absorb CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow, offsetting some of the emissions. 5. Air pollution: The incomplete combustion of wood can release harmful contaminants into the atmosphere, such as volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, and various toxic compounds. These pollutants have adverse effects on both human health and the environment. This is why hardwood is typically preferred over softwood for burning, as it produces less smoke and burns more efficiently. Overall, burning wood results in heat and light, but it also produces a range of by-products, including emissions and pollutants, that can impact both the environment and human health.

Another student: Let's say, hmmm...","output":"To find the value of the new perimeter, first consider the original square with side length 's'. The measure of each side of the square has been multiplied by 5, so the new side length is 5s. The perimeter of the original square (x) is the sum of the lengths of its four sides, which can be represented as x = 4s (since there are 4 equal sides in a square). Now let's find the perimeter of the new square, which we'll call y. The new square has side length 5s, so the new perimeter is the sum of the lengths of its four sides, which can be represented as y = 4(5s). To simplify this equation, we get: y = 4 * 5 * s = 20s. Next, we must express the new perimeter (y) in terms of the original perimeter (x). Since we know the original perimeter's formula is x = 4s, we can solve for 's': s = x/4. Now, substitute the value of 's' in the new perimeter: y = 20 * (x/4), which simplifies to y = 5x. So, the value of the new perimeter is 5 times the original perimeter.

Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\".

This is because it is a species of orchid in the genus Bulbophyllum, which falls under the plant kingdom. Orchids are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants known for their unique and often fragrant blooms. They are categorized in the family Orchidaceae and represent one of the largest families of flowering plants, with over 25,000 species and more than 100,000 hybrids. Bulbophyllum is a genus of orchids that is composed of around 2,000 species, making it one of the largest orchid genera. They are mostly epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning that they grow on other plants or on rocks, rather than in soil. Bulbophyllum species are characterized by their distinctive pseudobulbs, which are thickened stems that serve as water storage organs and provide support for the plant.

Based on the premise, the alleyways and passages connect to or lead off from the main thoroughfare. This means that they are closely related and exist in proximity to the main thoroughfare. Step 3: Evaluate whether the premise supports the hypothesis. The hypothesis claims that the alleyways and passages are far from the city's main thoroughfares, suggesting that they are not in proximity to significant roads. However, the premise tells us that these alleyways and passages branch off from a main thoroughfare, indicating that they are indeed close to at least one major road. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise. From the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true. In fact, the premise contradicts the hypothesis by stating that some of the oldest alleyways and passages in the city lead off from a main thoroughfare, which implies they are close to a significant road rather than far from it."},{"instruction":"Coming off their shutout home win over the Rams, the Seahawks flew to Candlestick Park for a Week 2 NFC West showdown with the San Francisco 49ers. Seattle would trail early in the first quarter as 49ers kicker Joe Nedney got a 37-yard field goal, along with running back Frank Gore getting a 79-yard touchdown run. The Seahawks would respond in the second quarter as kicker Olindo Mare made a 36-yard field goal. San Francisco would reply with Nedney making a 42-yard field goal. As the Seahawks looked to bounced back from the deficit, quarterback Matt Hasselbeck received an injury as he was hit on the ground by 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis. Hasselbeck would leave the game with cracked ribs, yet Seattle closed out the half with backup Seneca Wallace completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to running back Julius Jones. In the third quarter, the Seahawks deficit quickly increased as on the 49ers' first offensive play of the second half, Gore would explode for an 80-yard touchdown run. San Francisco would close the game out in the fourth quarter as Nedney nailed a 39-yard field goal.

The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

Zidek noted there have been no reports of injuries, and damage so far has been largely limited to blown-out windows and battered roofs. Hooper Bay and Tununak reported scattered power outages. The highest wind gusts recorded — 89 mph — were at Wales at the western tip of the Seward Peninsula, said Bob Fischer, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Fairbanks. In Nome — the biggest of the coastal communities with about 3,600 residents — wind gusted to 61 mph, Fischer said. The storm knocked out power in the town for several hours before sunrise. Winds were expected to remain strong throughout Wednesday. \\"Water was at the bases at a number of buildings but not in the homes yet,\\" Fischer said. Tides could reach 7 feet above normal, he said. The height of snow and hurricane-force winds hit Nome at about 2 a.m., police spokesman Zane Brown said. Some roof damage to homes was reported, he said. Residents along Front Street, which runs less than 100 feet from the seawall that protects the historic gold mining town from the Bering Sea, were asked to voluntarily evacuate Tuesday night. They stayed with friends on higher ground or at one of two shelters opened by the city at a recreation center and at the Nazarene church, he said. Officials feared the lack of shore-fast sea ice would leave Nome and Native villages sprinkled along the coast vulnerable to sea surges. The last time forecasters saw something similar was in November 1974, when Nome took the brunt of another storm. The sea surge it created measured more than 13 feet, pushing beach driftwood above the level of the previous storm of its type in 1913. The state is closely monitoring the storm and was ready to send help wherever needed and when it was possible, said Zidek, with the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. \\"Our number one priority is the safety of life in those communities,\\" Zidek said. He noted there have been no reports of toppled fuel tanks or toxic spills. The state and emergency managers in the villages have long prepared for the powerful storms that batter Alaska's western coast, holding twice-yearly meetings on dealing with emergencies. In the past few years, the state has held evacuation workshops as well, Zidek said. A spokeswoman for the Coast Guard said early Wednesday it had received no calls from vessels seeking help from the storm. Petty Officer 1st Class Sara Francis said the agency was assisting a 143-foot fishing boat with engine problems north of the Aleutian Islands but the Rebecca Irene's troubles were unrelated to the storm. The vessel was operating Tuesday with two engines and one failed. The cutter Sherman took 20 of the vessel's 34 crewmen off the boat. Francis said a tug was expected to reach the Rebecca Irene on Wednesday morning. Weather had diminished to 2-foot waves and 4-foot swells. Francis said the storm hit after most crab fishing had concluded. \\"We're kind of in a lull with a lot of the fisheries,\\" she said. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"A very powerful storm has hit the western coast of Alaska. It brought strong winds, like a hurricane, and lots of snow to the coastal communities. Some people living near the coast had to move to safer places because of the high water levels. The storm also caused some damage to roofs and windows and made the electricity go out in some areas. Even though the people in Alaska are used to extreme weather, this storm is not a usual one and could be very dangerous. So far, there have been no reports of people getting hurt, and the state is keeping an eye on the storm and is ready to help when needed."},{"instruction":"Tämä ei tietenkään merkitse sitä, että laajentumisprosessi olisi nyt toteutettu, mutta olemme ottaneet tärkeän askeleen.

KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\"). Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"All of them\\" correctly answer the question \\"Did the four bombers know the masterminds behind it?\\"?","output":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, the answer to the question \\"Did the four bombers know the masterminds behind it?\\" would ostensibly be \\"Yes,\\" as at least some connection can be drawn between each individual mentioned and the operational masterminds, namely Osama Bin Laden, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), and Mohammed Atef. However, the text does not explicitly mention that each of the four bombers (Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni) knew the three masterminds directly. It is stated that Bin Laden personally selected the four individuals to serve as suicide operatives, implying a direct connection between Bin Laden and the selected operatives. Furthermore, KSM was told by Bin Laden that Mihdhar and Hazmi were selected because they already had U.S. visas, which suggests that they were at least aware of the key person behind the operation, even if KSM himself had not met them. As for Khallad, his father was known to have been acquainted with Bin Laden. However, the links between the bombers and the masterminds are not made wholly clear for each case, particularly Abu Bara al Yemeni, whose relationship with the masterminds is not explicitly described in the passage, and the extent to which each of the selected individuals knew about the others involved in the planning stages of the operation is not specified. In conclusion, while it can be inferred that the bombers were generally aware of the masterminds behind the operation, to state that \\"all of them\\" inextricably knew the masterminds in a direct and personal sense may be inaccurate given the ambiguity of the information provided. We can surmise that the bombers likely knew of or were acquainted with the masterminds, but the precise degree of mutual knowledge or personal familiarity cannot be conclusively determined from the passage. Therefore, a more accurate response would be \\"most likely, but not definitively confirmed for all individuals.\\""},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: It Came from Beneath the Sea Movie plot: A nuclear submarine on maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean, captained by Commander Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey), comes into contact with a massive sonar return. The boat is disabled but manages to free itself and return to Pearl Harbor. Tissue from a huge sea creature is discovered jammed in the submarine's dive planes. A man-and-woman team of marine biologists, Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue) and John Carter (Donald Curtis), is called in; they identify the tissue as being a small part of a gigantic octopus. The military authorities scoff, but are finally persuaded after receiving reports of missing swimmers and ships at sea being pulled under by a large animal. Both scientists conclude the sea beast is from the Mindanao Deep, having been forced from its natural habitat by hydrogen bomb testing in the area, which has made the giant creature radioactive, driving off its natural food supply.[3] The scientists suggest the disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may be the work of the foraging sea beast. Both Pete and the Navy representatives express doubt and demand further proof. Later, as Pete assists John and Lesley, a report comes in of an attack on a French shipping boat; several men escaped in a raft. The French survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, and when the first sailor's description of a creature with giant tentacles is met with skepticism, the other sailors refuse to testify. Lesley is able to convince the first sailor to repeat his story for government officials, who then have the evidence they need. The U.S. government halts all sea traffic in the North Pacific without revealing the reason. John flies out to sea to trace a missing ship, while Pete and Lesley follow up on a report of three missing people on the coast of Oregon. The local sheriff, Bill Nash (Harry Lauter), takes Pete and Leslie to the site of the attack, where they find a giant suction cup imprint in the beach sand; they then request that John join them.

They both indicate that the concept of the ensemble is expanded upon in the article titled \\"mathematical ensemble (Statistical physics).\\" The primary difference between the two statements lies in the phrasing and emphasis, as explained below: 1. In the first sentence, \\"The idea of the ensemble is further discussed in the mathematical ensemble (statistical physics) article,\\" it describes the subject (\\"the idea of the ensemble\\") first, followed by the location where a more in-depth explanation can be found (\\"the mathematical ensemble (statistical physics) article\\"). By structuring the sentence this way, the emphasis is placed on the topic that is being explored further. 2. In the second sentence, \\"The idea of the ensemble is discussed further in the article mathematical ensemble (Statistical physics),\\" it refers to the location of the information first (\\"the article mathematical ensemble (Statistical physics)\\") and then tells readers what to expect from the content (\\"The idea of the ensemble is discussed further\\").

The following title sequence moves through space and eventually reveals the planet Krypton, the home world of a highly-evolved race resembling humans and bearing a unique molecular density and structure, a result of the planet's gravitational strength and the radiation of its adjacent red sun. The planet is ruled by a Council of Elders, each representing a particular \\"clan\\" and bearing a crest of that particular House. The planet's greatest scientist, Jor, bears an S-shaped crest, the House of El. Jor-El is supervising the trial of three criminals caught attempting to overthrow the planet's government - General Zod, the planet's former defense chief; his henchman Non, a hulking killer unable to speak; and Ursa, a woman determined to exterminate men other than the man she loves, Zod. As the elders render a guilty verdict, Zod notes that the verdict must be unanimous, so Jor-El ultimately holds the key to their fate. Despite his disillusionment with the Council of Elders, Jor-El renders a conviction. The vast dome of the planet's capital city opens to the night, and a small extra-dimensional prison - the Phantom Zone - tumbles out of the sky and pulls the three criminals out of the trial room and into an eternity in dimensional limbo through space. While a frightened Ursa begs for forgiveness, Zod defiantly swears that he will have his vengeance on the House of El, even if it takes him a thousand years.However, Jor-El's more pressing concern lies in the orbital shift of Krypton; this shift is putting the planet into the fatal gravitational pull of its central star, a fact blithely ignored by the Council Of Elders.

The poll by the Angus Reid Institute (ARI) found that 33 per cent of Canadians strongly or moderately agree with Trump's call for a \\"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\\" While two-thirds of Canadians disagreed (and 49 per cent strongly so), that still leaves a large proportion of Canadians looking kindly on a plan that has been widely condemned both in Canada and the U.S. And it puts Canadians on almost the same level with Americans. A Washington Post-ABC poll conducted at the same time as the ARI survey found that 36 per cent of Americans supported Trump's ban, with 60 per cent thinking it \\"the wrong thing to do.\\" At this stage of the presidential primaries, Trump is only trying to win over Republican voters. The Post-ABC poll suggests his plan is a winner, with 59 per cent of Republicans supporting it and 38 per cent thinking it the wrong thing to do. However, despite interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose recently telling the Canadian Press that \\"I think [Trump's] off the spectrum, frankly … that's not a voice that we welcome in our party,\\" the ARI poll indicates that a majority of Canadians who voted for the Conservatives in October think Trump is onto something. In total, 55 per cent of Canadian Conservative voters strongly or moderately agreed with Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Canadians who voted for the Liberals and New Democrats were strongly opposed, however — 77 per cent of New Democrats and 82 per cent of Liberals disagreed with the ban, with about two-thirds strongly disagreeing with it. In a town hall held by Maclean's magazine this week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rejected Trump's \\"hateful\\" rhetoric. In the U.S., 82 per cent of Democrats in the Post-ABC poll said it was the wrong thing to do. Note that the ARI poll was conducted using the firm's online panel, whereas the Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone with live interviewers. This difference in methodology has the potential to influence responses, and so some caution should be exercised when comparing the two polls. Trudeau on Donald Trump's views on Muslims2:00 The ARI poll showed some regional and demographic differences on the issue, with support for Trump's Muslim ban being highest on the Prairies. There was also a link to education: less educated Canadians looked more favourably on the ban than more educated Canadians. And despite the controversies over reasonable accommodations in Quebec, the ARI poll showed that Quebeckers were less likely than other Canadians to support Trump's ban. When presented with two options, one suggesting that Trump's rhetoric is \\"bad for society, it encourages fear and hatred\\" and the other that it is \\"good for society, it gets at 'politically incorrect' issues that should be talked about,\\" 63 per cent of Canadians thought it was bad for society (including 66 per cent of Quebeckers). The remaining 37 per cent thought it was good for society. Perhaps Canadian and American politics aren't so different after all. The poll by the Angus Reid Institute was conducted between Dec. 10 and 13, 2015, interviewing 1,530 Canadians via the Internet. As the poll was conducted online, a margin of error does not apply. The poll by the Washington Post-ABC was conducted between Dec. 10 and 13, 2015, interviewing 1,002 Americans via the telephone.

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts!

What role did his military service in Vietnam play in the shaping Kerry's political career?"},{"instruction":"Question: I can use this background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Now, I have a new situation: Two coworkers are sitting in the large break room eating lunch and watching the news on TV when they see an advertisement for glasses. John, upon seeing the ad, comments that he really should go and get a new pair since he is nearsighted and hasn't gotten a new pair of glasses in a couple years. Rick says he is glad that he doesn't need to wear glasses because it seems like such a pain to have to always have something on your face. John nods in agreement and then both men turn to see a woman at the other side of the break room waving at them and trying to get their attention. Answer this question please: Which person's parents are less likely to wear glasses? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information and the situation provided, it is more likely that Rick's parents are less likely to wear glasses in comparison to John's parents. As mentioned, there is evidence that myopia (nearsightedness) is inherited and if one or both of a person's parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that the person will need them too. In this situation, John is nearsighted and needs to wear glasses, which implies that he might have inherited this trait from one or both of his parents, making it more probable that John's parents need glasses. On the other hand, Rick does not require glasses and expresses his satisfaction about not needing to wear them. This suggests that Rick's genetic predisposition for needing glasses might be lower compared to John's, and therefore, his parents are less likely to wear glasses in comparison to John's parents. However, it is vital to mention that needing glasses is not solely determined by genetics. Environmental factors, visual stress, and health conditions can contribute to a person developing vision problems. But based on the information provided, it is more probable that Rick's parents are less likely to wear glasses compared to John's parents."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: The application does not mention either proportionality or a possible infringement of the limits of possible delegation.","output":"Aplikace neuvádí ani proporcionálnost, ani možné překročení mezí možné delegace."},{"instruction":"Ration DMI in livestock depends on many factors, including body size, lactation stage, and time of year, and can be estimated through calculation of the gross energy (GE) intake: Translate to French.","output":"La ration DMI (ingestion de matières sèches) chez le bétail dépend de nombreux facteurs, notamment la taille du corps, le stade de lactation et la période de l'année, et peut être estimée par le calcul de la consommation d'énergie brute (GE) : La ration DMI chez les animaux d'élevage dépend de nombreux facteurs, tels que la taille du corps, le stade de lactation et la période de l'année.

American Coalition of Life Activists (1999), the Ninth Circuit Court found the American Coalition of Life Activists (ACLA) guilty of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, and held that ACLA's actions constituted \\"true threats\\" against abortion providers. ACLA published personal information, including names and addresses of abortion providers, on \\"Wanted\\" posters and an internet site called the \\"Nuremberg Files\\". The court found that ACLA's actions were not protected by the First Amendment's freedom of speech because they incited violence and intimidated abortion providers. Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health providers were awarded a 109 million judgment against ACLA, which was later reduced to 21 million after an appeal."},{"instruction":"Devlet müdahelesi olmasaydı muhtemelen durum daha kötü olurdu.\\" dedi.

Egyptian society and the forces in Egypt are in a state of anticipation. World media has its cameras and correspondents in Cairo and major cities around the country. But many Egyptians wonder if the revolution amounted to nothing more than a military coup. It has been a year since the eruption of the first Egyptian revolution that stunned the world and ended 30 years of authoritarian, oppressive and corrupt rule by Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's last pharaoh. Mubarak ended up in jail along with his sons and his regime's major figures, with stories of their unimaginable corruption, brutality and looting surfacing ever since. But since then, most Egyptians have become angry and frustrated with the performance of the Military Council -- comprising more than a dozen elderly generals -- that has taken control. Egyptians, political forces and revolutionaries accuse the Military Council of being accomplices with the remnants of the Mubarak regime and of refusing to enact real reform, to the point of actually waging a counter-revolution. Egyptians have been enraged by the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations that followed the revolution, and in the arrests, humiliations and even killings of protesters. The Military Council is still controlling the state media and the political scene. Western governments and human rights organizations are expressing their dismay, with Human Rights Watch reporting killings and brutal attacks, some of them sexual, on protesters. The council is the Old Guard, desperately trying to preserve the military's long-standing privileges and special status. The military has been running Egypt since 1952 -- with rulers such as Gen. Mohammed Naguib, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, Mubarak and Marshal Tantawy coming from its ranks. The military has dominated Egypt's modern political scene, with members serving as presidents, prime ministers, Cabinet ministers, governors, party elites, heads of the security services, ambassadors, heads of many companies, and even ministers of culture and the media -- in a true Orwellian fashion. The military institution in Egypt consumes more than 25% of the government expenditure and owns about 30% of the national economy. The United States has given Egypt a hefty military aid package of billions of dollars for nearly three decades. Egyptians respect their armed forces, but are desperate for a civil state where human rights, rights of minorities, and accountability and transparency are guaranteed. They do not want another pharaoh-like president coming from that institution. Egyptians have been asked to commemorate the special occasion of the revolution's first anniversary by taking to the streets Wednesday, wearing black in mourning of the deaths of hundreds of the revolution's martyrs. But some political forces refuse to call it a celebration -- they say the revolution is not finished and their demands have not been met. Demonstrators have already started to pour into Tahrir Square. Activists are calling for the immediate transition of power from the Military Council to a civilian council, or even an interim caretaker. Now, after bringing down the Mubarak regime and his notorious State Security apparatus, Egyptians have broken the fear barrier and believe there is no turning back. Will they stun the world again, with Egyptian Revolution, Part II? Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aladdin Elaasar. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"One year ago, there was a big problem in Egypt. People were not happy with their leader, Hosni Mubarak. Hosni Mubarak was in charge for a long time and some people believe he was a mean and selfish leader. So, the people stood up together and made a huge change - they helped to remove Hosni Mubarak from power. Now, there are new leaders in Egypt, but some people are worried that these new leaders are just like the old ones. They think that the new leaders are not really making Egypt better for everyone, and they want more changes. Many people in Egypt want to have a better and happier country where they have more say in making decisions. To remember what happened a year ago, some people in Egypt are wearing black clothes and going to the streets to talk about how they feel. They hope that things will keep getting better in Egypt and that they can make some more changes in the future."},{"instruction":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? \\"American Buzz Aldrin was born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, His real name was Edwin E.

But I want to slightly take issue with and then expand on something Ruth Marcus wrote in her post. “So I don’t really blame Romney for what he did. I blame him for what he fails to remember, or to acknowledge, that he did,” Marcus opined. To be fair, she is saying that Romney’s juvenile knucklehead teenage behavior shouldn’t be held against him, especially since it was nearly 50 years ago and that we all are not the people we were in those formative years. At least we hope not. But what Romney is alleged to have done was physically and emotionally violent. Take a careful look and you won’t find the word bully or bullying in The Post story. But that’s exactly what those incidents detailed in Jason Horowitz’s story are. And while those incidents happened in the 1960s, they are the same kind of bullying that is happening today. Actually, today the harm can not only come from a fist or a pair of scissors. It can come via text message, Instant Message, Facebook, You Tube and any other medium that allows private insult to become public humiliation in seconds. Millions of kids — boys and girls, straight, gay or perceived to be gay — suffer indignities every day in their schools and in their neighborhoods. Many times, the situation is made worse by adults who don’t take the pain caused by bullying seriously. “Oh, it’s just a phase.” Or the ever popular “boys will be boys.” The powerful documentary “Bully” by Lee Hirsch tracks five kids ages 11 to 17 in different parts of the country who have been harassed. Two of them had their stories told posthumously by grief-stricken parents. Romney had an opportunity to rise above his rabble-rousing past and more forthrightly recognizethe pain that he caused. To acknowledge that his hijinks of yesteryear are the harassment of today. President Obama, as well as his administration, has taken bullying seriously. It’s still not too late for Romney to join him. This is not a gay issue or a partisan issue: It’s a moral issue. And it’s about time we start treating it like one. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about Mitt Romney, who is a famous person, and how he behaved badly when he was in high school many years ago. He was involved in \\"hijinks\\" which means he was doing things that were not nice to other people. Some people think these actions were a type of bullying. Now that Mitt Romney is older, the writer of the article thinks he should admit what he did was wrong, and help other people understand that bullying is not okay. Bullying is when someone is mean to another person on purpose, and it can hurt their feelings or make them feel bad about themselves. This can happen in schools or online. The writer wants Mitt Romney to work with people like President Obama to help make bullying stop, because it is a big problem that hurts a lot of kids."},{"instruction":"Gilbert \\"Gil\\" Scott-Heron (April 1, 1949 - May 27, 2011) was an American soul and jazz poet, musician, and author, known primarily for his work as a spoken-word performer in the 1970s and 1980s. His collaborative efforts with musician Brian Jackson featured a musical fusion of jazz, blues, and soul, as well as lyrical content concerning social and political issues of the time, delivered in both rapping and melismatic vocal styles by Scott-Heron. His own term for himself was \\"bluesologist\\", which he defined as \\"a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues\\". His music, most notably on the albums Pieces of a Man and Winter in America in the early 1970s, influenced and foreshadowed later African-American music genres such as hip hop and neo soul. At the time of Scott-Heron's death, a will could not be found to determine the future of his estate. Additionally, Raquiyah Kelly-Heron filed papers in Manhattan, New York's Surrogate's Court in August 2013, claiming that Rumal Rackley is not Scott-Heron's son and should therefore be omitted from matters concerning the musician's estate. According to the Daily News website, Rackley, Kelly-Heron and two other sisters have been seeking a resolution to the issue of the management of Scott-Heron's estate, as Rackley stated in court papers that Scott-Heron prepared him to be the eventual administrator of the estate. Scott-Heron's 1994 album Spirits was dedicated to \\"my son Rumal and my daughters Nia and Gia\\", and in court papers Rackley added that Scott-Heron introduced me [Rackley] from the stage as his son.\\" . In 2011, Rackley filed a suit against sister Gia Scott-Heron and her mother, Scott-Heron's first wife, Brenda Sykes, as he believed they had unfairly attained US250,000 of Scott-Heron's money. The case was later settled for an undisclosed sum in early 2013; but the relationship between Rackley and Scott-Heron's two adult daughters already had become strained in the months after Gil's death. In her submission to the Surrogate's Court, Kelly-Heron states that a DNA test completed by Rackley in 2011--using DNA from Scott-Heron's brother--revealed that they \\"do not share a common male lineage\\", while Rackley has refused to undertake another DNA test since that time. A hearing to address Kelly-Heron's filing was scheduled for late August 2013, but, As of March 2016, further information on the matter is not publicly available. However, Rackley still serves as court-appointed administrator for the estate, and donated material to the Smithsonian's new National Museum of African American History and Culture for Scott-Heron to be included among the exhibits and displays when the museum opened in September 2016. According to the Daily News website, Kelly-Heron and two other sisters have been seeking a resolution to the issue of the management of Scott-Heron's estate. During the time Scott-Heron's 1994 album Spirits was being produced, he was living in Brooklyn, New York, with Nia and her mother.

By Jaquelyn Reingold. With Cynthia Nixon, Cecilia deWolf, Evan Handler, David Thornton, Tom Mardirosian, Jim Fyfe. Directed by Mary B. Robinson. At Ensemble Studio Theatre, 549 W. 52nd St. Tickets: 35. (212) 206-1515. With her midlife hangups, boyfriend problems and a biological clock that's quickly counting down, the borderline neurotic at the center of \\"String Fever\\" could easily be one of \\"Sex and the City's\\" catty quartet. It's unavoidable because the character is played by Cynthia Nixon, co-star of the HBO series. Despite \\"String Fever's\\" familiar premise and stock supporting characters, playwright Jaquelyn Reingold has fashioned a funny, offbeat and touching look at relationships. The wonderfully acted, small-scale production by Ensemble Studio Theatre is big on charm and long on laughs - even with a science-based subtext that ties a not-so-complicated love triangle to a complex physics theory. Nixon is excellent as Lily, a dowdy, insecure music teacher suffering from a devastating breakup with her troubled musician boyfriend, Matthew (David Thornton). It's her birthday. She is lonely. And she is thinking of having a baby through artificial insemination. Things start looking up for Lily when she meets Frank (Jim Fyfe), a charming, cat-loving physicist who's an expert on \\"string theory\\" - the idea that matter is made up of microscopic strings. Under Mary B. Robinson's brisk direction, \\"String\\" unspools as an appealing romantic comedy populated by oddball characters whose eccentricities never seem forced. Evan Handler, as Lily's goofy actor friend from Iceland, is a standout. A seasoned stage actress, Nixon gives a layered performance that's a pleasure to watch. As a teenager, she was in the original Broadway production of Lanford Wilson's \\"Fifth of July,\\" and she was a 1995 Tony nominee for \\"Indiscretions.\\" Her Lily has a vulnerable sweetness that can't hide a hair-trigger temper, the result of too many disappointments in love. \\"String Fever\\" was commissioned by the Sloan Foundation, which awards grants to playwrights who tackle sciencerelated topics. Though Lily uses string theory as a metaphor for her life, forget the physics and focus on the performances.","output":"\\"String Fever\\" is a funny, offbeat, and touching play focused on relationships, featuring a small-scale production that is big on charm and laughs.

It's No Biggie Nicki Minaj Not Filing Police Report Against Cardi B After Shoe-Throwing Attack EXCLUSIVE Nicki Minaj isn't going to the cops after Cardi B went after her at a New York Fashion Week party Friday night ... because it really didn't bother her at all. Sources close to \\"Chun-Li\\" rapper tell TMZ ... even though Cardi's shoe-throwing attack at the Harper's Bazaar party Friday night was a shock -- her security handled it and Nicki was totally fine. We're told Minaj was unscathed and nobody on her team was injured either ... so she sees no reason to file a police report and carry on with the drama. As for Cardi -- who was left with a lump on her head after the ruckus she started -- law enforcement tells us she hasn't filed a police report either. People connected to Cardi told us they believe she got the lump from being elbowed by someone on Nicki's security. We broke the story ... Cardi reached a breaking point after Nicki making comments about her fitness as a mom. Judging from Cardi's own words, she was looking for a fight. She never made contact, either with her fists or her shoe. Nicki played it super cool later while leaving the Plaza hotel ... and it seems she's still not letting it affect her ... at least outwardly. ||||| Sorry, this video isn't available any more. Cardi B has been accused of hurling her shoe at Nicki Minaj during a spat that broke out between the pair at this year’s New York Fashion Week. However it appears the rapper has a history of lobbing her shoes at her enemies, as Nicki isn’t the first person to fall victim to one of Cardi’s heels. Remember that time the 25-year-old slid off her stiletto on an episode Love & Hip Hop, and threw it at Asia without any warning? The pair were having a fight over Asia’s ex beau Swift after she was convinced Cardi had slept with him. When refusing to answer the question on what their beef was really about, Cardi took matters into her own hands and hurled her shoe at the then 24-year-old. At the time Swift spoke out on the drama and revealed why Cardi had got so wound up. Advertisement Advertisement Talking to Hollywood Life he said: ‘Even the host at the reunion show was asking Asia to explain, saying, “Why you didn’t give her a chance?”‘ ‘[But] Asia didn’t want to explain. So Cardi got mad and threw the shoe at her.’ He added: ‘Cardi told Asia, “Just admit it, you didn’t like me because I was a stripper,”…which is truth, because Asia was denying it. She used to tell me, “You are around a stripper, you doing this,” and I tried to explain to her that this was Cardi’s past — that she’s not a stripper anymore; that we’re working on music.’ Cardi is notorious for starting beef with fellow stars, like the time she got into a physical fight with Yorma, and has seemingly started another feud with her fellow rapper Nicki Minaj. Sorry, this video isn't available any more. The pair appear to be embroiled in a spat following the incident (Picture: Getty) In video footage that emerged today, the new mum can be seen running towards what appears to be Nicki’s entourage. A voice can be heard from the crowd of a woman shouting: ‘Are you crazy?’ as Cardi reemerges from the group, falling into security who are trying to defuse the situation. Nicki isn’t seen on the video and is yet to make a comment about the incident. However, according to TMZ Cardi took off her shoe and threw it at the singer before leaving the NYFW party with a pretty substantial black eye.

He was smiling at my Erik. \\"He might hurt my Erik,\\" I thought. Everyone in the restaurant looked at us and the old man. Then we decided to leave. The old man sat between the door and us. As I walked closer to the man, I turned my back. Suddenly, Erik leaned over my arms, reaching with both arms in a baby's pick-me-up position . Before I could stop him, Erik had escaped from my arms to the man's. Soon the very old smelly man and my young baby developed a kind of friendship. Erik put his little hand on the man's face, and I saw the old man closed his eyes and tears running down his face. His aged hands held my baby so gently . A moment later, the old man opened his eyes, passed me my baby and said, \\"Thank you, Madam. You've given me the best Christmas gift.\\" I cried, with my face burning hot.

Sentence 2: I don't want to take your fans. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In fact, the two sentences express opposing ideas. Sentence 1: \\"I just want to steal all of your fans.\\" This sentence conveys the desire of the speaker to take away or divert the attention and support of the listener's fan base for themselves. The use of the word \\"steal\\" implies an act that is morally wrong or deceitful, suggesting that the speaker intends to take advantage of the listener's fans in a way that is not ethical or fair. Sentence 2: \\"I don't want to take your fans.\\" In contrast, this sentence expresses the speaker's lack of desire to take away or acquire the listener's fan base. The absence of an intention to \\"take\\" the fans shows that the speaker does not want to engage in any deceitful or morally wrong behavior to gain the listener's fans. In summary, the two sentences do not share the same meaning or entailment, as the first sentence implies an intention to take away the listener's fan base through dishonest means, while the second sentence shows a lack of desire to take away or obtain the listener's fans at all."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end): The Individualism of Gil Evans is an album by pianist, conductor, arranger and composer Gil Evans originally released on the Verve label in 1964.

The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory: the port of Georgetown, Maryland, founded in 1751, and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749. During 1791–92, Andrew Ellicott and several assistants, including a free African American astronomer named Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point. Many of the stones are still standing.A new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The federal district was named Columbia (a feminine form of \\"Columbus\\"), which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time. Congress held its first session in Washington on November 17, 1800.Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 that officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government.

Over the last eight years he believes he is around £600 up and said the whole ritual of his bet came from a premonition he had against the League Two club's local rivals in 2008 - his first pay day. \\"I had a bit of a dream that we'd beat Torquay 4-1 in the first leg of the Conference play-off semi-final, so for a laugh I went and put a tenner on us to beat Torquay at home, but we lost 2-1,\\" he told BBC Sport. \\"I thought 'typical' and forgot about it when we were playing the second leg until I was walking up to the ground in Torquay and I saw a bookmaker, had a couple of quid in my pocket and thought 'go for it', and the rest is history.\\" Hamilton-Kendall has had wins at various prices from 33-1 up to 100-1, the odds he got when Exeter came away with three points at the Hive at the weekend - a tidy profit of £1,000.

We want to find the value of 'r' in this equation: -197 * r = -201 * r - 4 First, we'll try to move all the terms with 'r' to one side of the equation. To do this, we will add 201*r to both sides: -197 * r + 201 * r = -4 Now, let's combine the 'r' terms: 4 * r = -4 Now, we want to find the value of 'r'. To do this, we need to divide by 4 on both sides of the equation: (4 * r) / 4 = -4 / 4 That simplifies to: r = -1 So, the solution is r = -1."},{"instruction":"Q:What key details about yr . robert lalkovits -- axone can be extracted from the following bio?

An Adoratrix named Tentopet appears with Ramesses III in the Temple of Khonsu in the Karnak temple complex . Tentopet is likely to have been a daughter of Ramesses III , and is likely to be identical with Queen Duatentopet , making her a sister or half - sister of her husband . Her steward Amenhotep was buried in Theban tomb TT346 . - Heqamaatre Ramesses IV (also written Ramses or Rameses) was the third pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. His name prior to assuming the crown was Amonhirkhopshef.

His promotion to crown prince: - Ramesses II (variously transliterated as \\"Rameses\\" or \\"Ramses\\" (or ); born ; died July or August 1213 BC; reigned 12791213 BC), also known as Ramesses the Great, was the third pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. He is often regarded as the greatest, most celebrated, and most powerful pharaoh of the Egyptian Empire. His successors and later Egyptians called him the \\"Great Ancestor\\". Ramesses II led several military expeditions into the Levant, reasserting Egyptian control over Canaan. He also led expeditions to the south, into Nubia, commemorated in inscriptions at Beit el-Wali and Gerf Hussein. - Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150) until the Macedonian conquest in 305 BC, although the actual term \\"Pharaoh\\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until circa 1200 BCE. - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.

Can we infer the following? Maternity leave varies in Europe.","output":"Yes, we can infer that maternity leave varies in Europe based on the initial statement. Maternity leave policies, including allowances and duration, often differ among countries due to the diverse legislation, cultural, and social norms that exist throughout Europe. Additionally, the statement shows that there might be some confusion surrounding the rights and entitlements of fathers, suggesting that parental leave policies are not uniform across the continent. The term \\"maternity leave\\" typically refers to the time taken off work by a pregnant woman or a mother immediately after the birth of her child. Maternity leave provisions ensure that women receive adequate time off for their health and well-being during pregnancy, childbirth, and after the birth, as well as nurturing their newborns without worrying about losing their jobs or incomes. In Europe, the maternity leave policies are generally more progressive than those in some parts of the world. However, they still vary significantly from one country to another. The European Union (EU) provides a foundation for maternity leave policies with the Pregnant Workers Directive, which mandates a minimum of 14 weeks' maternity leave, with at least two weeks being obligatory before or after childbirth. In some EU countries, this directive has been further expanded to offer more generous provisions for new mothers. For example: 1. Sweden: Sweden offers one of the most generous maternity leaves in Europe, with a total of 480 days of parental leave per child, which can be split between both parents. Out of these 480 days, 90 days are specifically allocated to the father, highlighting a strong focus on gender equality and shared parenting responsibilities. 2. United Kingdom: UK law provides for 52 weeks of maternity leave, with 39 weeks of those eligible for statutory maternity pay. The UK has also introduced shared parental leave, which allows both parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay after the birth of their child. 3. Germany: German legislation offers mothers 14 weeks of fully paid maternity leave, with the possibility to extend the leave period up to three years, though with reduced pay after the initial 14 weeks. Fathers also have the option to take parental leave. 4. France: France provides mothers with 16 weeks of paid maternity leave for the first and second child, 26 weeks for the third child, and even longer for multiple births. Fathers can take 11 consecutive days of paternity leave within four months after their child's birth. These examples demonstrate that maternity leave policies and the extent of entitlements for fathers, such as paternity leave or shared parental leave, differ across various European countries. While it is evident that some progress has been made in promoting gender equality and providing fair options for both parents, there is still room for improvement to create comprehensive and consistent parental leave policies throughout Europe."},{"instruction":"Are the following two questions the same? Can jellyfish change color? Do jellyfish change color?","output":"The following two questions, \\"Can jellyfish change color?\\" and \\"Do jellyfish change color?\\" are related in terms of their subject matter, but they have subtle differences in their meanings and implications. Analyzing these questions will help to highlight their unique properties and the answers they seek. 1. Can jellyfish change color? This question asks if jellyfish possess the ability or capacity to change color. It focuses on determining whether or not the innate traits or characteristics of jellyfish allow them to alter their colors. The answer to this question is yes, some species of jellyfish are capable of changing color. For example, certain species such as the comb jellies (Ctenophores) exhibit bioluminescence, which allows them to produce and emit light through a chemical reaction within their bodies. This light production can create various colors, and changes in these colors can be observed when the jellyfish are exposed to different types of environmental stimuli. Bioluminescence is often used by these marine creatures for various purposes, such as attracting prey, communication, or as a form of protection against predators. Another example of color change in jellyfish is the freshwater jellyfish (Craspedacusta sowerbyi), which can adapt its color depending on its surroundings. This color change can help the jellyfish blend in with its environment and avoid predation. 2. Do jellyfish change color? This question, in comparison, seeks to understand if jellyfish actively and commonly change color in their natural habitat. It aims to know whether the color-changing behavior is a regular occurrence in the jellyfish's life. The answer to this question is that it depends on the specific species of jellyfish since not all jellyfish exhibit color changes. In the case of the previously mentioned comb jellies and freshwater jellyfish, color changes can indeed occur regularly as part of their natural behavior. However, there are many other species of jellyfish that do not display any color-changing abilities. For example, the popular moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) does not actively change color but can appear differently depending on light conditions or the presence of their prey, such as colored plankton or crustaceans, inside their translucent bodies. In conclusion, the questions \\"Can jellyfish change color?\\" and \\"Do jellyfish change color?\\" are not precisely the same, though they may appear similar at first glance. The first question delves into the potential abilities of jellyfish, while the second question investigates the actual occurrence of color changes in these creatures. It is essential to understand these differences to be more accurate in the information we seek regarding jellyfish and their fascinating color-changing abilities."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Facts: - clubs: juventus mantova roma sampdoria alessandria - caps: 12 141 19 13 8 24 - position: striker - nationalcaps: 8 - years: 1957 1965 1965 -- 1967 -- 1963 1963 -- 1964 1964 -- 1965 - height: 1.80 - nationalyears: 1958 -- 1964 - nationalgoals: 2 - birth date: 24 february 1940 - name: bruno nicolè - nationalteam: ita - birth place: padua , italy - goals: 2 47 2 2 0 4 Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of bruno nicolè .

The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat.

Novosokolnikin piiri refers to a district in Russia called Novosokolniki. The name suggests a geographical region or administrative unit in Russian Federation, comparable to a county or a district. This area is located in the northwestern part of Russia and as per the latest census reports, houses a notable population. Finnish language is primarily spoken in Finland and is a member of the Uralic family of languages. It shares this family with Hungarian and a handful of languages spoken in small communities in Russia. Finland's proximity to Russia and its historical interactions may explain the use of Finnish to describe Russian geographical and administrative subdivisions. Furthermore, there are also considerable Finnish-speaking communities in Russia, and this might be another reason for such nomenclature. It's important to note the differences in character use between the Finnish alphabet and the English alphabet. While they share many similarities, the Finnish alphabet includes some additional letters not found in the English one, such as \\"ä\\" and \\"ö\\". Also, certain letters found in the English alphabet, like \\"b\\", \\"c\\", \\"f\\", \\"q\\", \\"w\\", \\"x\\", \\"z\\" and \\"å\\", are used only in loan words and foreign names in Finnish language. Finnish is known for its agglutinative structure, meaning it has a tendency to join morphemes together. This results in long, compound words, much longer than most in English. Understanding Finnish requires not only knowledge of vocabulary but also a strong understanding of its unique grammatical structures. The use of Finnish to describe geographical locations in Russia might seem unusual if you're not familiar with the historical connections and geographical proximity between Finland and Russia. However, it highlights the rich tapestry of linguistic influences that comes about because of human migration and interaction over centuries. Thus, Novosokolnikin piiri, referring to Novosokolniki district, is not just a representation of a geographical location, but a reflection of linguistic and historical connections."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The premise states that there was a war in 1812 that re-established the Poland-Lithuania border. It also says that Napoleon's troops were defeated as they moved towards Moscow. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis. The hypothesis suggests that Napoleon was successful in conquering both Poland and Russia in 1812. Step 3: Compare the premise with the hypothesis. The premise describes a situation where Napoleon's troops were crushed as they advanced on Moscow, which implies that Napoleon was not able to conquer Russia. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that Napoleon successfully conquered both Poland and Russia. Step 4: Draw a conclusion. Based on the comparison, it seems that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is unlikely to be true as well. The premise suggests that Napoleon was unsuccessful in his campaign to Moscow, Russia. This contradicts the hypothesis that Napoleon was successful in conquering both Poland and Russia.

Fortunately, the State of New Mexico, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the U.S. Department of Energy have moved fast, realizing that time is not our friend in this situation. Recall that the Waste Isolation Pilot Project, the only operating geologic nuclear waste repository, had its first minor accident on Valentine’s Day after 15 years of perfect operations (NMED). It was a small release of radiation that did not, and will not, harm anyone or have any environmental consequence. Those of us studying this issue figured since it happened at WIPP, it must be a WIPP problem, so we thought about what could go wrong with the rock or with the way WIPP operates. But WIPP was not the problem at all. The problem was what came to WIPP (Kitty Litter). Some drums slowly got hot, and one blew its top, because of what was in them. Photo of WIPP waste containers in Panel 7 disposal Room 7, after the Valentine’s Day radioactive release, shows magnesium oxide scattered over the drums and standard waste boxes that contain the transuranic waste. A breached drum shows heat discoloration and an open lid from the force of the rupture. MgO is a granular material placed in thin supersacks on top of the waste that are supposed to break as the ceiling creeps in after panel closure, letting the MgO fall around the waste to act as a sorbent to any water and CO2 in the room over time, as well as to buffer the pH to optimal levels. It also forms a strong sorrel cement when if contacted with brine, and sorbs plutonium really well. These sacks absorbed and dissipated a significant amount of energy during the event. Source: DOE It’s natural that everyone was being very cautious, but we took three months to get back to the suspect drums and so focused on the wrong things like the rock is falling. The initial investigation reports were highly critical of the WIPP facility’s operations and management, yet did not catch the actual cause of this event and instead focused on issues that had little significance to the accident. In fact, the radiation release during this event was almost completely contained by the WIPP safety systems. Only 1.3 millicuries were released into the environment, especially americium (Am), an amount of Am many times less than the Am in all the smoke detectors of any small town in America. At the same time, digging into documents, assay sheets and records (every container and drum is barcoded and tracked) told us what was in those drums and why they generated heat and pressure in a slow burn. These reactions aren’t affected by shocking, shaking, friction or any other things you think of with a bomb, because these are not like bombs. They’re like slow-burning charcoal briquettes. The reactions just require time. It is understandable that DOE was being careful (WIPP Recovery), not wanting to speculate and muddy the waters, and maybe having to retract something later. It is their job to be very certain and this event was nothing if not bizarre. The possible legal issues alone would scare me catatonic. Also, the types of chemical analyses needed, the difficulty in reconstructing the event, the difficulty of getting into the underground – these are not actions one rushes into. But DOE’s reticence was being seen as obfuscation and was getting the State and the public frustrated. Community support is wavering. State support is wavering. If not checked, this process will not end well for DOE, and WIPP might never reopen. So we can’t let this go along on its own formal timescale. We need to take hold of it and take action. If we do not move quickly, the Carlsbad community, and the entire State of New Mexico, will be unfairly punished for 30 years of support of a mission critical to the United States – that of cleaning up the legacy of the Cold War. No one else stepped up, and no one else will. We need to reward that support by not wasting time and letting the site sink into oblivion because America has become afraid of taking action. Fortunately, the New Mexico Environment Department realizes this and issued two Administrative Orders to DOE to address, as fast as possible, the two most pressing issues – the drums still hanging around someplace not WIPP, and sealing off the rooms and panels down in WIPP that have some of these drums (NMED LANL Order; NMED WIPP Order). Secure drum overpacks provided by LANL for explosion-containment of suspect unstable drums not yet in WIPP until final disposition is determined. Source: DOE Using what’s known as Acceptable Knowledge documents that detail the contents of each drum and their treatment histories (such as CCP-AK-LANL-006 and other DOE and contractor documents), we can reconstruct the general story as follows. Beginning over 30 years ago, activities involving separating americium (Am) from old weapons materials generated a moderate amount of transuranic waste contaminated with americium (Am), plutonium, uranium and minor amounts of other radionuclides, and containing various metal-nitrate salts (strong oxidizers), such as (Mg,Ca)(NO3)2 with minor amounts of Fe, Na and K. When dewatered, these hot evaporator bottoms were poured onto a tray, vacuum dried, flashed crystallized, rinsed with cold water and put in bags, where they sat for 30 years. Come time for disposal a few years ago, these wastes still had some nitric acid liquid. Department of Transportation regulations require no free liquid (<1%) during transport, so these wastes were stabilized with neutralizers and sorbents like sodium carbonate, triethanolamine and polyacrylate as they were put into drums for packaging and shipment. It was recommended sometime later that inorganic kitty litter made from silicate minerals be added as a sorbent (widely used in radiochemistry as well as the home litter box), but also to dissipate heat and generally mitigate auto-oxidation reactions of the kind we think occurred in these drums in WIPP. Anhydrous citric acid (a reducer) was used to bring the pH down if over-adjusted. For reasons perhaps related to good intentions, or merely related to dust generation, the inorganic kitty litter was replaced by organic wheat-based litter early on in the process. There were a few other components of not much import in the drums, but additional organic components just added more fuel. Some decisions regarding these additives are vague and not attributable to a real chemist. Citric acid should never be used with metal-nitrate salts, because of the rapid evolution of heat. Similarly for acrylates. The use of organic additives for whatever purpose adds fuel to this mixture. And organic litters have the wrong properties for their intended function but being organic, they too add to the amount of fuel that could burn. I do think the correct litter alone would have prevented these reactions. When real chemists did look at this mixture, they were appalled. These drums were assigned as a specific waste stream and were able to be tracked through a barcode system. The suspect drums that breached in WIPP were from waste stream LA-MIN02-V.001 in which all drums were mixed with the incorrect litter. 368 of these drums were identified as being disposed of in WIPP: 313 in Panel 6, and 55 in Panel 7 Room 7. Investigators have looked at several rows of waste on either side of the breached drum looking for evidence of damage or any breaches in other waste containers, but found nothing. So we know where they are, we know where the contamination is, and we know how to clean this up. Two actions need to be taken immediately, and are the subject of the two NMED Administrative Orders issued last week. First, there are more drums like these out there, not having been shipped to WIPP yet. They need to be rounded up, put under safe conditions, treated or repackaged. This has nothing to do with WIPP. As of today, it appears that LANL has secured all these drums in special explosion-proof containers in isolated areas with fire-suppression capabilities, and is monitoring them continuously (see photo of overpack). This was done quite quickly once the waste stream was identified. Their final disposition is being planned. Second, the drums already in WIPP, in Panel 6 and Panel 7 (Room 7) need to be sealed off with bulkheads like we do all the time, and shut off from the ventilation system. Metal bulkheads can handle these energetic events easily, and as the salt creeps in, they will be contained as only 2,000 feet of massive molecularly-tight salt can do. Panel 6 is full and complete, so putting up two bulkheads is the first logical step. Room 7 in Panel 7 can be finished with crushed salt and also two bulkheads. Room 6 Panel 7 is contaminated and could be sacrificed by just filling with crushed salt and bulkheaded. (see figures of different types of room seals). Different types of room and panel seals in the WIPP underground. Top left: brattice cloth, a temporary block when the room or panel is full while waiting for more secure seal, not meant to be air tight but does stop most air flow to waste. Bottom left: metal bulkheads which are fairly airtight and secure, especially two emplaced with airspace between, sufficient to contain any more kitty litter drum events and very quick and easy to install (days). Upper right: 12-foot explosion-proof block wall, a very secure seal but time-consuming to install (months) and requires many workers to spend a lot of time near the waste face. Bottom right: Run-of-mine crushed salt emplaced along the panel entry drift, very secure, relatively easy to emplace and will self-seal as the whole-rock salt creeps in over years to become molecularly tight. Source: DOE The second NMED Administrative Order calls for DOE to submit a plan by the end of next week to accomplish sealing of these rooms. The other rooms in Panel 7 and the exhaust paths and shaft are not very contaminated and can be deconned without great cost or time. Plans for these are forthcoming as well. WIPP operations could then resume in less than a year without wasting billions of dollars and without completely derailing nuclear clean-up activities across the country. This was not a WIPP problem, but WIPP will fix it. Greater oversight of the waste packaging, and implementing the recommendations of the accident reports that pointed out various operational deficiencies, won’t take long and can be executed quickly without great cost. If we don’t move quickly, it will cost billions and could derail the only successful nuclear waste disposal program in the world. Also, this response is a test to see if America can handle the environmental issues surrounding nuclear better than other countries who shall remain nameless. If WIPP can’t resume operations, we will be forced to stop putting our nation’s nuclear waste in a safe place and it will either stay right where it is, or go to a second-rate place. This would bode ill for other nuclear-related issues such as our high-level defense waste or our nuclear waste confidence proceedings needed for NRC to issue new reactor licenses. The need for this repository has not changed. The fact that the salt is the best rock type has not changed. The excellent 15-year operational and safety record of WIPP prior to this event has not changed. This event did not result from a flaw of WIPP itself, but from operations elsewhere from WIPP. If WIPP resumes in short order, we will be able to deal with the waste backlog across the country in a year or two. WIPP was ahead of schedule and under budget before this event. The recovery costs won’t be very large if we move fast. Most importantly, however, with WIPP back online we will have a chance of actually disposing of our legacy nuclear weapons waste within a hundred years from when they began being produced in the first place.","output":"The Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP), the world's only deep geological nuclear waste repository, encountered its first minor radioactive leak in 2014 after 15 years of perfect operations. Instead of focusing on the actual cause of the event, initial investigation reports were critical of WIPP's facility management. Since then, the New Mexico Environment Department, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the U.S. Department of Energy have acted swiftly to address the two most pressing issues: the drums still around WIPP and the drums in WIPP. If WIPP doesn't resume operations, billions could be wasted and the U.S.'s only successful nuclear waste disposal program could be derailed, causing nuclear waste to remain in unsafe locations or be moved to second-rate places. If WIPP resumes in a timely manner, the waste backlog across the U.S. can be dealt with in a year or two, and the country will have a chance to dispose of its legacy nuclear weapons waste."},{"instruction":"What would call playing fetch with a small dog?

Stream of thoughts:","output":"In order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's analyze the meanings of both statements and compare their similarities and differences. Premise: \\"People walking around town.\\" This statement describes a scenario in which people are moving about within a town. It does not specify the purpose of their movement, their pace, or any other details about the people themselves. Hypothesis: \\"The people are strolling through the village.\\" This statement focuses on the same scenario – people moving within a specified area. However, the wording implies a few additional details. The term \\"strolling\\" generally conveys a leisurely, relaxed pace of walking. Additionally, the area where the people are walking is referred to as a \\"village,\\" which has slightly different connotations than \\"town.\\" Based on the comparison of these statements, it is plausible to say that the hypothesis could be a more detailed interpretation of the premise. However, it is important to note that there are some assumptions made in the hypothesis which are not explicitly mentioned in the premise: 1. The pace of walking: The premise doesn't specify the speed or nature of the walking, while the hypothesis suggests a \\"stroll\\" – a slower, more relaxed pace. 2. The size and type of the location: The premise refers to a \\"town,\\" while the hypothesis refers to a \\"village.\\" Although both terms describe a populated area, a village typically implies a smaller, more rural setting. In conclusion, while the hypothesis provides a possible interpretation of the premise, it is not entirely entailed by the premise itself due to the additional assumptions made regarding the pace of the movement and the change in description of the location. Nonetheless, the overall scenario of people moving around within a populated area is consistent between both statements."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"\\"I'm afraid there will be backlash,\\" 24-year-old Justin told Newsbeat from the northern Paris suburb of Saint Ouen.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Young Parisians Express Fear of Backlash in Saint-Ouen In the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Ouen, the word on the street is a resounding echo of concern for the possibility of backlash. As France undergoes significant political and social turmoil in recent years, the people of Saint-Ouen, especially the youth, are becoming increasingly anxious about the outcomes and consequences that might arise. We had the opportunity to speak with 24-year-old Justin, a resident of Saint-Ouen, who shared his insights about the situation. \\"I'm afraid there will be backlash,\\" Justin told Newsbeat, as an air of uncertainty looms over the quaint Parisian suburb. While many are enthralled with the scenic beauty, rich history, and the unmistakably French ambiance that Saint-Ouen offers, the same cannot be said for its current political climate. Various factors contribute to the anxiety of Saint-Ouen's inhabitants. The gradual rise of extremist ideologies, the persistence of discrimination, and the adverse effects of economic policies have sparked widespread fears about the stability of their once peaceful community. Justin's fears, much like those of other youth in the area, stem from the possibility that these issues might escalate to unprecedented levels of unrest or backlash from radical factions within the city. One cannot ignore the impacts of globalization and the migration crisis in Europe that have fundamentally shifted the socio-political dynamics in France. These events have fueled the rise of far-right political parties and their subsequent influence in the city, increasing the likelihood of a resistance or counter-movement from other groups. The tense political climate only serves to escalate Justin's concerns for the future of his community. The residents of Saint-Ouen, particularly the younger generation, feel a sense of powerlessness about their situation. The youth, often the drivers of social change, are concerned about the implications this tension and instability will have on their education, career prospects, and overall quality of life. The fear of backlash is not exclusive to Justin, as it represents a broader worry that the future may hold uncertainties and threats that are currently inconceivable. Amid these challenging times, community organizations and social enterprises in Saint-Ouen have risen to the occasion, aiming to create a sense of unity and understanding among diverse groups. By fostering an environment open to dialogue, these initiatives hope to dispel tensions and create opportunities for collaboration among members of society – all to ensure the city's long-term resilience in the face of potential backlash. Despite these commendable efforts, Justin's fears and uncertainty about backlash are not entirely unfounded. As history has shown, polarizing political climates and ideological conflicts can, and often do, result in devastating consequences. The pressing concerns of discrimination, unemployment, and social inequalities need to be addressed diligently at all levels, from local grassroots efforts to national policy implementation. As the inhabitants of Saint-Ouen continue to grapple with the uncertain future that lies ahead, it's crucial for community leaders, government authorities, and citizens alike to work collaboratively to address the issues at hand. Together, they can mitigate the adverse impacts of societal changes, quell the anxieties of young individuals like Justin, and ultimately prevent the specter of backlash from becoming a reality in their beloved suburb."},{"instruction":"Information: - MTV Hard Rock Live is a live album by Canadian rock band Simple Plan. - Alexandra Jean Theresa \\"Allie\\" DiMeco (born June 12, 1992) is a former American actress and multi-instrumentalist primarily known for playing the role of Nat Wolff's main love interest Rosalina in the musical comedy series \\"The Naked Brothers Band\\". - Polly Carey Draper (born June 15, 1955) is an American actress, writer, producer, and director.

Spray the surface with the solution, then scrub it with a clean, lint-free cloth. A powerful degreaser will cut through dirt, grime, mold, and other problematic residue without affecting the temperamental zinc coating. Proceed in small sections until you’ve cleaned the entire surface. Common household products like Comet, mineral spirits, and chlorine bleach can all be used to prepare galvanized steel for painting. If you’re attempting to paint siding panels, roof flashing, or other materials that have seen exposure to the elements, a thorough cleaning is necessary to eliminate any organic contaminants from the outer surface. Once you’ve finished cleaning the steel, let it rest until all traces of the degreaser have evaporated. That way, you won’t have to worry about the solution interfering with the action of the vinegar, which you’ll be using to rough up the smooth steel. If possible, do your prepping and painting indoors, or on a clear day when there’s little moisture in the environment. When working with an item that’s seen some wear, you may noticed a chalky or powdery film on parts of the surface. This can easily be buffed out with a high-grit sandpaper (120-grit or finer is preferable) and a little patience. Sand the steel using gentle circular motions until the exterior takes on a uniform appearance. Afterwards, wipe the surface with a cloth dampened with warm water to remove any lingering dust. This chalky substance is commonly known as “white rust.” It forms when the thin layer of zinc coating the steel begins to break down as a result of age or exposure to the elements. Wet a clean, dry cloth with distilled white vinegar and wring out the excess liquid. Go over the galvanized steel thoroughly, applying more vinegar as needed. To ensure an even paint job, it’s important that it come into contact with every part of the exterior. The acid in the vinegar will gently etch the slick zinc-coated finish, giving it a rougher texture that will allow paint to stick better. If you happen to miss a spot, you may end up with splotchy, peeling paint. This will give it plenty of time to eat away at the galvanized surface. The longer it sits, the more pronounced the etching effect will be, and the better your paint will adhere. You might even let it work overnight if the timeframe for your project allows. If you’re short on time, wait until the surface is dry to the touch before moving on to priming and painting. Summary:","output":"This article offers a guide on preparing galvanized steel for painting by cleaning with a powerful degreaser, buffing out white rust, roughing up the surface with vinegar, and allowing it to dry thoroughly for optimal paint adhesion."},{"instruction":"Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. Paragraph: Two farms were growing food for several nearby cities. Vole farm grew organic produce and produced organic milk, while Anthill farm did not possess the USDA organic certification. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm had more antibiotic resistant pathogens? A:","output":"Vole farm B: Anthill farm Based on the background information provided, organic farms have far fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens due to the restrictions on the use of antibiotics in organic practices. This means that Vole farm, which has the USDA organic certification, would have fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens compared to Anthill farm, which does not possess the certification.

Briggs is telling me I ran it with out oil. I checked the oil every time I added gas and it needed oil almost every time. Now Briggs wants me to pay for repairs. I think electric may be in my future. Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the review provided, it is highly unlikely that the user would recommend this product. The user has experienced multiple issues with the pressure washer, beginning with it not restarting after running for just two hours. The retailer replaced the carburetor as a solution, however, the pressure washer only ran for 5 minutes before losing all compression. The user is now engaged in an unsatisfactory interaction with Briggs (manufacturer), who are suggesting that the user operated the machine without oil. However, the user has explicitly mentioned checking oil levels whenever refueling and finding it required oil almost every time. This indicates that the oil consumption was abnormally high, which may suggest a fault with the product. As a result, the user is understandably frustrated with the manufacturer for not taking responsibility and instead pushing the repair costs onto the user. In addition, the user expressed that they are considering switching to electric pressure washers instead, implying their dissatisfaction with the current pressure washer as well as their decreasing trust in gas-powered pressure washers due to the negative experience they've had with this particular product.

The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

This reduced the mass of the rocket so that it could fly higher. Answer the question: What happens when you make a rocket heavier goes higher or falls down? A:","output":"A: When a rocket is made heavier, it generally requires more thrust to lift off and overcome gravity. If a rocket is too heavy and does not have enough thrust, it would struggle to gain altitude or might even fail to lift off. Thus, a heavier rocket with insufficient thrust will have difficulty going higher and may fall down instead of ascending. However, if a rocket is made heavier but has a proportionally increased thrust, it can still go higher. The key is to balance the rocket's mass with an appropriate level of thrust."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Jan applied themself to the homework and got a lot done.

Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Yes\\" correctly answer the question \\"Was the arrival of the Europeans a positive development for the Arawaks?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Yes\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Was the arrival of the Europeans a positive development for the Arawaks?\\" based on the given paragraph.

Part #2: Choosing the middle statement that makes the story incoherent/implausible. Usage: Middle 1: Stephen hated to see the ball drop. Explanation: Since the ending of the story says Stephen was amazed the entire time, it is less plausible for him to have hated seeing the ball drop. Hence, this middle statement makes the story less coherent. Part #3: Indicating your choice by selecting 1 or 2.

Let's go through these steps one by one: Step 1: Combine the terms with the variable s on one side of the equation. We will do this by adding 623 * s to both sides of the equation to remove the -623 * s term. This results in: 262 * s + 623 * s = -623 * s + 623 * s + 3540 Simplifying the equation, we get: (262 + 623) * s = 3540 Step 2: Isolate the variable s by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of s. The coefficient of s is the sum of 262 and 623, so we have: s = 3540 / (262 + 623) Step 3: Solve for s. First, calculate the sum in the denominator: 262 + 623 = 885 Now, divide the constant term 3540 by the sum 885: s = 3540 / 885 When you perform the division, you get: s = 4 So, the solution to the given equation 262 * s = -623 * s + 3540 is s = 4."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"and knew what to look for when you went shopping for a parakeet uh i had a parakeet many years ago that uh she got for me and it lived to be a a pretty old bird and was extremely friendly uh i i couldn't keep him in his own cage he just uh flew lose in the house all the time uh but uh more recent years they moved away and i've been buying parakeets at the local pet shop and they don't seem to be as healthy as uh one's you get from uh breeders\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"I had a parakeet that lived to be pretty old. \\" true?","output":"Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the premise.

Recent years, KFC has ever shocked us more than once because of its food safety, which made itself in severe trust crisis. Now it greatly surprised us again owing to the poultry incident. We could never believe it should have cheated us again and again. In fact, as a well-known restaurant chain, KFC's business records at China's is not very good. There's no doubt that the very incident has made things worse and worse. However, what surprised us is that although a series of misdeeds had reduced KFC's reputation, its business is increasing. What's more, KFC just made a so-called apology after what had happened, the content of which is not responsible at all for the public. As a matter of fact, this is not an ordinary chance incident. Recent years have seen so many food-safety problems in China, such as wasted oil, lean meat powder , melamine , which has done great damage to people's life. We don't know what can be eaten and how much harmful food we have eaten. Now it is not wars and natural disasters but everyday food safety that has been a great risk to human health. So what can be done to prevent our health from being damaged? To begin with, the related departments should strengthen laws to stop such illegal products from being produced. In addition, it would be a good idea to call on the media to perform its further function to monitor the businesses, factories and traders. Besides, everybody should be made aware of the risks of harmful food and only in this way can people improve their self-protection. In a word, everyone should play a role in making our food safer and better in quality. Meanwhile, the government and the related departments should take their responsibilities for people's health.

New experiments show that may not be true, even within a vacuum. Sometimes, light slows a bit. The new research is\\"very impressive work\\", Robert Boyd toldScienceNews.An optical physicist at the University of Rochester in New York, he did not work on the study. He speaks of the new finding:\\"It's the sort of thing that's so obvious; you wonder why you didn't think of it first.\\" Light travels as particles and as waves. Photons are the name given to those particles that represent the smallest possible amount of light. At their fastest, photons travel nearly 300 million meters (almost 1 billion feet) in a single second. That's fast enough to get to the moon and back in about 2.6 seconds. Scientists had long known, though, that they could slow light photons down by shining them through a material such as glass or water. Still, light moving through a vacuum has usually been assumed to move at a peak speed. That would seem to make sense. After all, a vacuum is a space with nothing in it to slow light down. In a new study, however, scientists show that even racing through a vacuum, light can slow. So the speed of light is more of a universal speed limit than an rule for how fast photons travel, the new data suggest. Miles Padgett led the new study. As an optical physicist, he works at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and his colleagues showed that the key to slowing light is to change the shape of a light wave. Padgett described how they did this in a paper published online January 22 inScience. His team raced a pair of photons. One traveled unchanged through a cable made from optical fibers. The other passed through a pair of devices that acted like lenses. A lens changes light: It can focus a spread-out beam of light on a point, for instance. The second photon passed through one device that changed the shape of its waveand another that changed it back to its original form. The first photon won the race.

Article: In the 1920s and 30s the airlines were just beginning. It was unusual for people to travel by air because it was expensive and dangerous. In those days, there were no flight attendants to look after the passengers. Young men ,or \\"stewards\\" helped the passengers onto the airplane and carried the passengers' luggage but they did not provide food and drinks. _ Ellen Church was born in 1904 on a farm in Iowa. She was a different child. She didn't want to work on a farm or marry a farmer --she wanted a more adventurous life. Ellen studied to be a nurse at the University of Minnesota and then got a job in a hospital. For the next few years she stayed at the hospital but also took flying lessons and got her pilot's license. Ellen was twenty-five years old when she first got in touch with Boeing Air Transport. She loved flying but she understood that airlines were a man's world. Although women like Emelia Earheart were becoming famous, she realized it was impossible for a woman to have a career as a pilot .But she had another idea. Most people were frightened of flying because. flying was still an unreliable way to travel. There were often delays ,many crashes and the bad weathers made many passengers sick. Ellen thought nurses could take care of passengers during flights and B.A.T. agreed. The young woman from Iowa and seven other nurses became the first air stewardesses. At first pilots were unhappy because they did not want stewardesses on airplanes, but passengers loved the stewardesses. In 1940 there were around 1000 of them working for different airlines. The early \\"stewardesses\\" had to be under twenty-five-year-old, single and slim. When a woman joined an airline, she had to promise not to get married or have children. It was hard job and not well paid. They worked long hours and earned 1 an hour. In the 1970s, stewardesses were unhappy in their job and airlines had to make some changes. Since the 1970s, \\"stewardesses\\" have been called flight attendants. They are well paid and work fewer hours than in the past.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding. Twenty-six months since I knew that somewhere in the deepest parts of who I am, I was slipping. Nine seasons since I begged Dr. Poe, “Remember me to myself!” I'm still recuperating. Yes. I have felt like I wasn't me. What does Julie think her problem is? - She's losing track of herself. - Mental illness. - She can't remember who she is. - not enough information A:","output":"Julie's struggle to recognize herself and her actions highlights the complexity of identity and the impact of mental health issues on one's perception of self. As she slides into mania in 2016, Julie feels an overwhelming sense of losing the self she has come to know and love. This is expressed in her plea to her therapist, Dr. Poe, when she asks him to \\"remember her to herself.\\" Julie realizes that she is acting out of character, engaging in activities and behaviors that are not typical for her. This change makes her question her identity and whether or not she is \\"okay.\\" She even seeks reassurance from a colleague, who unfortunately doesn't notice the underlying issues beneath her seemingly cheerful facade. This further fuels Julie's uncertainty, as she continues to grapple with her inexplicable behavior. The unraveling of Julie's life over the following months, including losing her job, scholarships, and valued friendships, ultimately leads to her hospitalization for her mental health. The fact that she has experienced such a dramatic change indicates that there is a significant problem at play. Julie's difficulties can be traced to mental illness, most likely bipolar disorder, as it typically features episodes of mania and depression. During manic episodes, people often exhibit behavior that is uncharacteristic of their usual selves. They may also feel elated and extremely energetic, which can sometimes manifest in impulsive and risky activities. As Julie starts to recover, her understanding of her problem deepens. She recognizes that her inability to remember who she is, amidst the chaos caused by her mental health issues, has had a significant impact on her life. Her journey toward healing and rebuilding trust in herself highlights the importance of self-awareness and the need for effective mental health care. In conclusion, Julie's problem lies in her struggle with mental illness, specifically bipolar disorder, which has disrupted her sense of self and challenged her ability to remember who she is. Her plea for help reflects her desperation to hold onto her identity while navigating the turbulent waters of her mental health journey. As she continues her recovery, she is gradually able to regain her footing, establish her sense of self once again, and work to rebuild the life she lost in the process."},{"instruction":"Q:Combine facts and answer this: Corey Snide graduated from a high school located in what state?

Many terms were transliterated directly and added to the Chinese vocabulary. Chinese words like 剎那 chànà (Devanagari: क्षण kṣaṇa 'instantaneous period') were borrowed from Sanskrit. Many Sanskrit texts survive only in Tibetan collections of commentaries to the Buddhist teachings, the Tengyur.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"In the given context, if you were to look up the word 'chana' in the middle of India, you would find its origin and significance in Sanskrit – an ancient, classical language of India that has contributed significantly to the development of several Indian and foreign languages. The relationship between Sanskrit and Sino-Tibetan languages is evident through the spread of Buddhist teachings and texts, which were translated into various languages. The word 'chana' (Chinese: 剎那; Devanagari: क्षण, kṣaṇa) refers to an 'instantaneous period.' This term is a lexical borrowing from Sanskrit and has been incorporated into the Chinese vocabulary. The adoption of Sanskrit words into the Chinese language was facilitated by the dissemination of Buddhism in China, primarily through Mahayana missionaries sent by Emperor Ashoka. These emissaries were instrumental in introducing Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit texts to China, which paved the way for the circulation and adaptation of Sanskrit terms. One significant aspect of this linguistic influence is the transliteration of Sanskrit words into Chinese. Terms like 'chana' were directly borrowed and absorbed into the Chinese linguistic space, showcasing the deep-rooted connection between the languages. Such linguistic exchanges were not limited to China alone but extended to other regions as well. For instance, many Sanskrit manuscripts are preserved only in Tibetan collections of commentaries relating to Buddhist teachings, known as the Tengyur. These texts demonstrate the pervasive impact of Sanskrit on the development of Tibetan culture and language. The extensive transmission and translation of Sanskrit texts into various languages have facilitated the sharing of knowledge and cultural expressions across vast geographical expanses. In summary, if you were looking up the word 'chana' in the middle of India, you would discover that the term is a Sanskrit word meaning 'instantaneous period.' You would learn about its significant influence on the development of Sino-Tibetan languages through the dissemination of Buddhist teachings and texts, especially in China and Tibet. This rich linguistic exchange highlights the importance of Sanskrit as a classical language that has profoundly shaped and inspired different languages and cultures over time."},{"instruction":"What songs are good when you have too many thoughts?

Break tasks into smaller steps: Divide each task into smaller, more manageable steps, making it easier to accomplish and see progress. 3. Take breaks and manage your time wisely: Schedule breaks during your day to rest and recharge. Practice good time management and avoid distractions to maximize your productivity. 4. Communicate with your family: Express your feelings of being overwhelmed and discuss how their expectations may be affecting you. It's possible that they don't realize the impact of their expectations. 5.

If the vase falls to the floor, it might break. She broke the vase.","output":"The word \\"break\\" has a slightly different meaning in each of the two sentences provided. Let's examine them closely: 1. If the vase falls to the floor, it might break. 2. She broke the vase. At a basic level, \\"break\\" refers to the act of causing something to be damaged, separated, or no longer in its original or whole form. However, the context and tense of each sentence adds a different nuance to the meaning of \\"break.\\" In the first sentence, \\"break\\" is used in the context of an event that might happen in the future: \\"If the vase falls to the floor, it might break.\\" This sentence refers to a potential outcome where the vase could be damaged or shattered if it were to fall to the floor. The meaning of \\"break\\" in this sentence conveys the potential state of the vase after a specific event occurs. It's a possibility, not a certainty, and it depends on whether the vase falls or not. In contrast, the second sentence, \\"She broke the vase,\\" refers to an action that has already occurred in the past. \\"Broke\\" is the past tense of \\"break,\\" indicating that the vase has already been damaged or shattered. The focus here is not on the potential outcome or future state of the vase but rather on the action that someone took, causing the vase to be in a broken state. The meaning of \\"break\\" in this sentence is more definitive and certain, as the act of breaking has already been completed. In summary, the word \\"break\\" in both sentences refers to the act of causing damage to the vase. However, the meanings slightly differ in terms of tense and context. In the first sentence, \\"break\\" refers to a potential future outcome if the vase were to fall, while in the second sentence, \\"break\\" definitively refers to a past action that has already caused the vase to be damaged."},{"instruction":"Read this: In March 1861, Victoria's mother died, with Victoria at her side.

Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection.

(AP Photo/White House) President Bush did not offer a \\"quid pro quo\\" linking relief for automakers to a Colombia Free Trade deal in his meeting on Monday with Barack Obama in the Oval Office, the president-elect's transition team leader said Tuesday. John Podesta said he wanted to clear up misreporting by newspapers that detailed a leak of the on-on-one meeting between the president and president-elect. \\"While the topic of Colombia came up ... there was no quid pro quo in the conversation,\\" Podesta said. \\"The president didn't try to link Colombia to the question of an economic recovery package going forward. They talked about both of them.\\" Podesta added that the reports were \\"not accurate\\" and the Obama team has \\"cleared up the confusion\\" after the White House complained that Bush was irked by news that the conversation had been cast as a trade-off between Bush signing a second stimulus package in exchange for congressional passage of the Colombia Free Trade Act. Senior aides to both men said the two issues were part of a long discussion about automakers and the ability of the trade deal to help not only the economy but also a key ally. Obama had asked Bush to help the sagging auto industry during their private meeting in the White House, senior aides to both men said. Bush stressed the need to work with Colombia, but said efforts to make it sound like a horse trade were unfair and inaccurate, an aide told FOX News. Bush aides said the president was also unhappy that the conversation between him and Obama was leaked to the media at all, and insisted the two leaders were not engaged in a trade-off. \\"President Bush did not suggest a quid pro quo. Both leaders discussed ideas for the economy. The president has long said free trade helps create jobs and opens markets to our businesses. We believe the free trade agreements can and should pass today on their merits,\\" said press secretary Dana Perino. A senior administration official suggested that Obama be careful to keep his counsel and perhaps is unfamiliar with the long-held tradition of keeping confidential conversations between presidents. Asked if the leak affected what appears to be a very smooth transition so far, the senior Bush aide said, \\"It won't affect what we have to do ... but it was disappointing. I think the Obama folks will be backing off this pretty soon.\\" Podesta did just that later in the day. \\"I think we've agreed to move forward in that same spirit that we have been working,\\" he said. An Obama transition team spokesman said the president-elect did raise the need for urgent action on an economic recovery plan that would create jobs and relieve the squeeze on families. Obama urged help for automakers, including accelerating the 25 billion Congress already passed, exploring other authorities that exist under current law and identifying someone who would have the authority to bring about reforms that would lead to an economically viable auto industry. The Bush administration, along with Congress, negotiated a 700 billion rescue package last month for the financial industry, but federal officials are resisting Democratic calls for a similar bailout for automakers, despite warnings that General Motors might not survive the year. Democrats want a second stimulus that would include aid to Detroit's big three automakers, unemployment benefits and infrastructure projects. The New York Times had reported Tuesday that neither Obama nor congressional leaders are willing to concede the Colombia pact to Bush and may choose to hold off on a new stimulus bill until Obama becomes president on Jan. 20. But aides to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday afternoon that she intends to seek legislation to provide relief to the auto industry, and wants it done in a post-election session of Congress that could be convened next week. The aides did not say how large the package would be. According to Bush officials, the administration has gone as far as it can when it comes to the 700 billion bailout. Under the bailout law, relief money is intended for financial services, not industrial sectors. Aides said if lawmakers on Capitol Hill want to rewrite the law, they will reconsider it, but they can not divert the money now. Deutsche Bank on Monday downgraded GM to sell from hold, with a price target of 0, saying the carmaker may not be able to fund its U.S. operations beyond December without government intervention, FOX Business Network reported. Deutsche Bank said it believes the U.S. government will be compelled to intervene through a capital infusion or loan. \\"Without government assistance, we believe that GM's collapse would be inevitable, and that it would precipitate systemic risk that would be difficult to overcome for automakers, suppliers, retailers, and sectors of the U.S. economy,\\" the broker said. Even if GM avoids bankruptcy, equity shareholders are unlikely to get anything back, it added. Meanwhile, Bush's desire to pass the Colombia Free Trade deal on its merits is no secret, a senior White House aide told FOX News. That deal has been frozen by the Democratic majority in Congress. The U.S. and Colombia are close allies, and the president wants to increase trade between the two countries. But Democrats say a deal would mean more jobs being exported, which is taboo for a party supported by a heavily unionized workforce that elected Obama. Democrats say they also object to the human rights climate in Colombia, which union leaders have described as seriously threatening to workers. Colombia's government says such claims are blown out of proportion and workers are protected. FOX News' Bret Baier contributed to this report.

Streep, who was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille award, accepted her trophy and gave a politically charged speech about President-elect Donald Trump and his tendency to target foreigners. Streep defended the press, Hollywood and immigrants, and called upon the late Carrie Fisher to help her close out her speech. \\"As my friend, the dear, departed Princess Leia, said to me, 'Take your broken heart, make it into art,'\\" she said.

In response, President-Elect Donald Trump made a series of tweets dismissing Meryl Streep as overrated. And thus the Hollywood vs. politics debate rages on, now perhaps in a discourse more churlish and on a platform more undignified than ever. Spurned by a petulant outburst by the incoming commander-in-chief, an obtuse tweet from John McCain’s daughter, teed-up yacking by Kellyanne Conway on Fox News, and a prevailing frustration over actors constantly espousing their politics in public arenas—a frustration that deserves to be validated—there is backlash over Meryl Streep’s acceptance speech at the Golden Globe Awards Sunday night. Enough. If we’re going to shine a spotlight on things that are tired, it is not the practice of celebrities talking about politics. It is the practice of complaining about that. Here’s a brief recap of the debate. Meryl Streep was given a lifetime achievement award Sunday night. Her speech commanded the room, with the Oscar winner eschewing the opportunity to express polite gratitude and toss off some witty quips to instead make a call to arms from her peers in Hollywood. She brought up the incident in which Trump appeared to mock a disabled reporter—something he denied doing again in an interview with The New York Times and in his tweet tirade, but which there is video evidence of—and used the anecdote as the catalyst for a plea for greater empathy, from the people in the highest position in the world to those sitting in the ballroom to us watching at home. Trump scoffed at the speech as pandering from a “Hillary flunky who lost big.” He called Meryl Streep, who was at the Globes to accept the Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award for a career that has included 3 Oscars, 9 Golden Globes, and the branding as the Greatest Actress of All-Time, “overrated.” (Perhaps, just perhaps, a person who purports to be in the business of uniting our nation could do better in that pursuit than disparaging Meryl Streep’s acting chops.) Trump’s message—that he was attacked unfairly—was amplified by his supporters, who continue to insist that politics should be kept out of the mouths of celebrities. Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

Meghan McCain, daughter of Senator John McCain and frequent TV commentator, tweeted earlier in the night that, “This Meryl Streep speech is why Trump won. And if people in Hollywood don’t start recognizing why and how – you will help him get re-elected.” Presumably she was referencing a sense of exhaustion over people in privileged positions presuming that their opinions merit public forums, and that Hollywood’s vocal support of Hillary Clinton irritated voters enough to flee in the other direction—that the optics of Clinton’s high-powered, rich and famous friends meant she was out of touch with the needs of everyday people. It’s always been a confusing notion, particularly in comparison to mogul and reality star Donald Trump. There’s also the idea that they’re “just celebrities,” that they don’t have any expertise on these issues and have no right to speak authoritatively on them. To that, as journalist Glenn Greenwald aptly inquired in a tweet that’s being circulated Monday morning, “Why are actors less qualified to comment on political issues than, say, cable TV or talk radio hosts? Never understood this rationale.” Sure, like anyone who has passionate feelings on an issue and a microphone to share them from, people in Hollywood—liberals or otherwise—hope their message is heard by people with opposing views, that they digest it and consider it. But the idea that Meryl Streep was unaware that she was speaking to a ballroom of friendly ears misunderstands what I gathered to be her intention. She was speaking to a room full of celebrities whose politics she knows, about a frustration she knew they felt. Assumptions from tweets like McCain’s insinuating that Hollywood liberals don’t realize they’re in a bubble, or that Trump voters don’t like them, are ridiculous. Streep made a plea to stand up against bullying, for dignity in power, and advocated for the arts. The catalyst for her plea was the election of Donald Trump. Of course it was. Streep, in addition to much of the Globes attendees, made no secret of her support of Hillary Clinton and her lack of respect for Trump and what he stands for. Why would anyone be surprised that a Hollywood liberal made such a plea at an event celebrating Hollywood liberals? “She didn’t change anyone’s minds” is the critique most commonly charged against her speech Monday morning. She wasn’t trying to change minds, or campaign for anything. She was calling to action people whose politics she already knew aligned with her own, whom she hoped she could motivate to take a stand for something meaningful. Maybe that’s what made Sunday’s awards telecast seem so tonally off. These events are typically characterized by cheerleading: for Obama, for their shared politics, for Hillary or against Trump, and, most often, for themselves. That kind of positive, unanimous energy is what made room for silly distractions and goofy bits like the ones host Jimmy Fallon tried to stage. But when the room no longer wanted to cheer—politically or otherwise—and instead set a more somber tone, the producers didn’t know how to reconcile that. But to make the case that politics shouldn’t have been a part of the show entirely? C’mon. People who continually say Hollywood and awards shouldn’t be platforms for politics and social justice need a new script. Have you seen an award show in the last 40-some years? It’s nothing new, and it’s not going to change. Stretch back to Marlon Brandon inviting Sacheen Littlefeather on stage in 1973 all the way up to Boyhood’s Patricia Arquette urging for gender pay equality in 2014, with stops at every Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave, Sally Field, Michael Moore, Leonardo DiCaprio, and George Clooney in between. If “know your audience” is a critique lobbied against Streep, “know your show” is applicable to those still upset about the confluence of Hollywood and politics. Hollywood and politics, by the way: a copulation that inseminated Donald Trump and birthed his public career, and a topic he seemingly can’t stop tweeting about. This is an industry that Trump has desperately wanted to be included in and welcomed by. There are the dozens and dozens of TV show and movie cameos he made, award shows he attended, and photos he took at parties with celebrities. He desperately wanted to win an Emmy and still complains that he didn't. All he has to show for his showbiz yearning is a Razzie award and an inauguration at which no one will perform. It’s no wonder he’s taken to calling Meryl Streep overrated. And it’s no wonder Meryl Streep feels compelled to speak out. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

And if people in Hollywood don't start recognizing why and how - you will help him get re-elected ||||| Conway accuses Meryl Streep of 'inciting people's worst instincts' Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes speech Sunday night was a disappointment, incoming counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway said Monday morning, stating that the actress offered a divisive message indicative of Hollywood’s “self-pity” instead of a unifying one. Streep, who was honored with a lifetime achievement award by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association at the Golden Globes awards show, devoted significant time in her acceptance remarks to criticizing Donald Trump. She accused the president-elect of bullying and said his speech last year in which he seemingly mocked a disabled person was the “one performance this year that stunned me.” Story Continued Below “She sounds like 2014. The election is over. She lost,” Conway said on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.” “Everybody in that audience, with very few exceptions, was of a single, myopic mind as to how they wanted the election to go and how they expected the election to go. They lost, and I really wish she would have stood up last night and said ‘Look, I didn’t like the election results, but he’s our president and we’re going to support him.’” Conway accused Streep of “inciting people’s worst instincts” with her speech. Trump’s incoming counselor said the time would have been put to better usesearching for common ground with the incoming administration, something Conway suggested the president-elect “has actually done from moment one.” “But this is Hollywood. I think where there is self-pity, a lot more self-awareness would do them some charm,” she continued. “Talking about how vilified poor Hollywood is, in their gazillion-dollar gowns. Can I borrow a couple of those for the inaugural, please?” Trump shot back at Streep as well, taking to Twitter to label her “one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood” and a “Hillary flunky who lost big.” As he has in the past, Trump disputed the notion that he had mocked the reporter, The New York Times’ Serge Kovaleski, insisting that he was mimicking the nervousness of a reporter backing away from a story years after the fact. Trump had used a 2001 story by Kovaleski as the basis for his fictitious claim that thousands of Muslims celebrated the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on rooftops in New Jersey. Trump insisted he had seen video of the incident, although none has ever been uncovered, and Kovaleski disputed Trump’s understanding of the event. On “Fox & Friends,” Conway wondered aloud why Streep had used her time on stage to attack Trump’s supposed mockery of a disabled individual and not to call attention to a recent case from Chicago in which four people were arrested last week for allegedly torturing a teenager with special needs and streaming the episode live on Facebook. Conway noted the races of those involved, four African-American suspects and a white victim, and said that if Streep is truly concerned about the disabled community, she should speak out about the incident in Chicago. “I’m glad that Meryl Streep has such a passion for the disabled, because I didn’t hear her weigh in and I didn’t hear her even use her platform last night, Ainsley, to give a shoutout to the mentally challenged boy who last week was tortured live on Facebook for half an hour by four young African-American adults who were screaming racial and anti-Trump expletives and forcing him to put his head in toilet water,” Conway told Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt. “So I’d like to hear from her today, if she wants to come and continue her platform on behalf of the disabled.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Tomi Lahren, a conservative political commentator of The Blaze TV network, tweeted her disagreement with Meryl Streep's Golden Globes acceptance speech, where Streep criticized President-elect Donald Trump's treatment of Hollywood, immigrants, and the press.

Context: WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem.

Eventually brandon ended up having to get glasses to correct his nearsitednes while Michael did not. Which of the brothers is nearsighted, Michael or Brandon? Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, the brother who is nearsighted is Brandon.

Article:","output":"Title: Connecticut Man Charged with Strangling Girlfriend, Sported Her Name Tattooed on His Neck In a shocking turn of events, a police mugshot released in Connecticut reveals a suspect with the name of his alleged victim tattooed on his neck. Authorities in Waterbury have recently charged 38-year-old Adam Plaeger with the murder of his girlfriend, Melanie Heuberger, after what is believed to have been a heated argument between the couple. Local media outlet WTNH News reports that Plaeger allegedly strangled the 40-year-old victim. According to a close friend of Heuberger, it is suspected that Plaeger \\"just snapped\\" during the altercation. The friend also provided additional information about the suspect's tattoos, stating, \\"As you can see (in) the pictures of him—he has a tattoo on his neck of her name, but he also has one on his arm, I believe.\\" She continued, \\"Basically he idolized her. She was like his queen.\\" This chilling mugshot and accompanying details have left the community in shock as family, friends, and residents attempt to come to terms with the horrific incident. The case has also attracted national attention due to the eerie tattoos linking the suspect to his victim. Although little is known about the motive behind the attack or the nature of the argument that led to it, the presence of Heuberger's name tattooed on Plaeger's neck and arm indicates a deep emotional attachment towards her. It is not uncommon for those involved in abusive relationships to display possessive and obsessive behavior, and the tattoos may be indicative of such tendencies in this case. As the investigation continues, it is important to acknowledge the warning signs of abusive relationships. According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, these can include extreme jealousy, strict control over one's partner, verbal or physical aggression, belittling, frequent criticism, isolation from friends or family, and manipulation. It is crucial for those experiencing any of these behaviors to seek help and support. In the meantime, Plaeger is being held on a 1 million bond, as reported by CBS News. The local community and law enforcement remain dedicated to seeking justice for Melanie Heuberger and ensuring her tragic story serves as a cautionary tale for others in potentially dangerous situations. The police, family, and friends continue to piece together the circumstances that led to this tragic crime in hopes of understanding the reasons for such a heinous act. The case is a stark reminder of the dangers of abusive relationships and highlights the importance of seeking support or speaking out when red flags present themselves. In the aftermath of this heartbreaking crime, the Waterbury community remains determined to honor the memory of Melanie Heuberger, whose life was tragically cut short by someone she trusted and loved."},{"instruction":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"This nice app does the job well✔. thank you for making it❤.

The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477.

Bicycles are vehicles designed for humans to ride, while spiders are small arthropods with eight legs that do not have the physical ability or cognitive understanding required to operate a bicycle. In contrast, Sentence A refers to Jerry and Michele, who are presumably humans, and it is logical for them to ride bicycles to the river."},{"instruction":"Mr Cameron said British agents had been given new guidance on how to behave. He was speaking after the publication of a Senate report on the \\"brutal\\" CIA interrogation of al-Qaeda suspects. It said the CIA had justified its techniques with \\"inaccurate claims of their effectiveness\\", including citing foiled terror plots against the UK. The CIA has defended its actions in the years after the 9/11 attacks on the US, saying they saved lives. But the UN and human rights groups have called for the prosecution of people implicated in the report, which looked at techniques including waterboarding and sleep deprivation. The report, a 480-page executive summary of the more than 6,000-page original, said the CIA had misled politicians and the public, wrongly claiming \\"enhanced interrogation\\" had produced \\"critical, otherwise unavailable intelligence\\". One of the eight most frequently cited examples was a thwarted al-Qaeda plot to hijack planes and attack Heathrow airport and Canary Wharf, the report said. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who planned the 9/11 attacks, had decided the two locations would be \\"powerful economic symbols\\", it said. But the report said the plot had \\"not progressed beyond the initial planning stages\\" when it had been \\"fully disrupted\\", saying the the CIA's claims that its techniques had thwarted it were \\"inaccurate\\". Another example was the capture of Dhiren Barot, who was jailed for life at Woolwich Crown Court in 2006, for plotting bomb attacks in the UK and the United States. Over the years, the report said, the CIA had used the thwarting of Barot's \\"urban targets plot\\" as evidence of the effectiveness of its techniques. Again, the report said this was \\"inaccurate\\" because his capture \\"resulted from the investigative activities of UK government authorities\\". The report also highlighted what it said were \\"inaccurate\\" claims of the CIA techniques' effectiveness in relation to shoe-bomb plotter Saajid Badat, who was sentenced to 13 years in jail in 2005 for planning to blow up a passenger plane. Badat had been arrested after \\"UK domestic investigative efforts, reporting from foreign intelligence services, international law enforcement efforts, and US military\\", the report said. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Cameron's spokesman said he was not aware of any request from the UK for redactions to the Senate Intelligence Committee report. Mr Cameron had been asked about the report during a visit to Turkey. He said some activities after the 9/11 attacks had been \\"wrong\\" and pointed to a UK inquiry, by retired judge Sir Peter Gibson. Last December Sir Peter said Britain had been inappropriately involved in the rendition and ill-treatment of terror suspects. He found no evidence officers had been directly involved in the torture or rendition of suspects but raised 27 questions the Intelligence and Security Committee was considering. Mr Cameron said: \\"I'm satisfied that our system is dealing with all of these issues. \\"And I, as prime minister, have issued guidance to all of our agents and others working around the world about how they have to handle these issues in future. \\"So I'm confident that this issue has been dealt with from the British perspective, I can reassure the public about that. \\"But overall, we should be clear, torture is wrong.\\" The former reviewer of terror laws Lord Carlile has said he does not believe there should be a fresh inquiry into allegations of complicity in torture in the UK after the US Senate report on the CIA. He told BBC News: \\"We don't want an industry of inquiries when there is an absence of evidence of any serious wrongdoing by the security services here.\\" Lord Carlile said he had been speaking to \\"well-informed sources\\" and believed there was \\"nothing like the American case to be made here\\". But speaking on BBC Breakfast, Prof Paul Rogers, a lecturer in international security at the University of Bradford, said the extent of Britain's involvement was not known. He said: \\"This was an American endeavour, but we still know very little about what Britain did, and I have to say I think that's very unlikely to come out, because we have a very much more closed system in this respect than the United States.\\" Human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC told BBC Radio 4's The World at One Mr Cameron had \\"made a very fine attack on torture\\". But he added: \\"He should ask for the material relating to Britain - which, at the request of his government, was withheld under the protocol that allies don't spill each other's secrets - he should obtain it and publish it so we will know whether there is material to show that intelligence services from Britain have collaborated.\\" US President Barack Obama banned harsh interrogation techniques after taking office in 2009. \\"I hope that [the] report can help us leave these techniques where they belong - in the past,\\" he said. The CIA has argued that the interrogations had helped save lives. \\"The intelligence gained from the programme was critical to our understanding of al-Qaeda and continues to inform our counterterrorism efforts to this day,\\" director John Brennan said. This article was about:","output":"This article discusses the publication of a Senate report on the CIA's \\"brutal\\" interrogation of al-Qaeda suspects, including techniques such as waterboarding and sleep deprivation.

The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to. Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited...

Tracy is a nasty person. Given the question \\"Why did Tracy do this?\\", is \\"Sneak up on Kendall\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","output":"No, \\"Sneak up on Kendall\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Tracy do this?\\" Instead, it explains the method by which Tracy tried to scare Kendall. A valid answer should provide an explanation or reason behind Tracy's actions. Based on the information provided, we can make some assumptions or speculate on possible reasons for Tracy's behavior. Here is a detailed and long answer considering multiple possibilities: Tracy might be a nasty person due to various reasons. One possible reason could be her upbringing or environment that may have fostered this type of behavior, where she developed a tendency to derive pleasure from causing discomfort to others. In this case, Tracy scared Kendall simply because she enjoys being cruel and causing distress. Another possibility is that Tracy might feel threatened or jealous of Kendall. These feelings of jealousy or insecurity could lead her to behave negatively towards Kendall in an attempt to belittle or undermine her. By scaring Kendall, Tracy could have been attempting to assert her dominance or establish a perceived sense of superiority. Additionally, Tracy's actions could be a reflection of her own internal struggles or insecurities. Sometimes, individuals project their own insecurities and fears onto others as a coping mechanism. In scaring Kendall, Tracy might have been trying to shift her negative emotions or gain a temporary sense of control over her own fears by triggering them in someone else. Lastly, Tracy's nastiness may have been a learned behavior from her experiences with others who have treated her similarly in the past. It's possible that Tracy herself has been a victim of nasty people trying to scare her, and as a result, she has adopted this behavior in her interactions with others, such as Kendall. In summary, \\"Sneak up on Kendall\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Tracy do this?\\" as it only explains the action but doesn't provide the underlying reason. A better answer should consider why Tracy wanted to scare Kendall in the first place, potentially exploring the different possibilities such as upbringing, jealousy, personal insecurities, or past experiences."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Marco Polo was from Venice, Italy.

You pull the tape or sticker off the glass, only to be left with a stubborn adhesive residue that doesn't wipe off easily. However, don't despair! With a variety of techniques and household items, you can safely and effectively remove adhesive residues from glass surfaces. Here are six methods to try, whether you need to get rid of sticky residue from tape, glue, or other adhesives. 1. Rubbing Alcohol or Nail Polish Remover These substances are capable of dissolving many adhesive residues. To use this method: - Soak a cotton ball or cloth with rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover. - Gently rub the adhesive residue with the soaked material until it starts to dissolve. - Wipe away the dissolved residue with a clean cloth or paper towel. - Rinse the area with water to remove any remaining residue or cleaning agent. 2. White Vinegar White vinegar is a natural, non-toxic solution that can effectively remove adhesive residue left by masking tape. To use this method: - Soak a cloth or paper towel with white vinegar. - Lay the soaked cloth over the residue and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. - Rub the residue gently until it dissolves. - Wipe the area with a clean, damp cloth to remove any remaining residue or vinegar. 3. Commercial Degreasing Agents There are various commercial degreasing agents available at most supermarkets and hardware stores, which can be effective at removing adhesive residues from glass surfaces. To use this method: - Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and proper use. - Apply the degreasing agent to the adhesive residue. - Allow the product to sit for the recommended time. - Gently rub the residue to dissolve it. - Rinse the glass with water to remove any remaining residue or cleaning agent. 4. WD-40 or Paint Thinner These multipurpose lubricants and solvents can be used to break down stubborn adhesive residues. To use this method: - Apply WD-40 or a small amount of paint thinner to the sticky residue using a cloth, cotton ball, or spray, if using WD-40. - Allow the lubricant or solvent to sit for a few minutes to dissolve the residue. - Rub the area gently until the adhesive residue dislodges. - Clean the area with water and a clean cloth to remove any remaining residue or solvent. 5. Lighter Fluid Lighter fluid is another option for dissolving adhesive residues, but it should be used with caution due to its flammability. To use this method: - Apply a small amount of lighter fluid to a cloth or cotton ball. - Gently rub the residue with the soaked material. - Once the residue dissolves, wipe the area clean with a damp cloth. - Rinse the glass with water to remove any remaining residue or lighter fluid. 6. Heat Using heat can help to soften adhesive residues, making them easier to remove. To use this method: - Direct a hair dryer or heat gun at the adhesive residue, maintaining a safe distance to avoid overheating the glass. - As the residue begins to soften, gently rub or scrape it off with a plastic scraper or cloth. - Clean the area with a damp cloth to remove any remaining residue. Conclusion Adhesive residues on glass surfaces can be unsightly and challenging to remove, but with these six techniques, you'll be able to tackle even the most stubborn residues. Remember always to use caution when employing these methods, especially when working with flammable solvents. By following these steps, you'll have a clean, residue-free glass surface in no time."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Did that.

Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Paragraph: Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person learned more about isostasy? Answer:","output":"Barry learned more about isostasy, as he is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor, which are directly related to isostasy and its effects on oceanic basins."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence which is either in the Swedish language or English language.

His first home was in a public housing project, the Fairfax Apartments (now demolished) at 1617 1st Street SW in the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood. Although one of the city's oldest neighborhoods, with many elegant Federal-style homes, Southwest was primarily a vast slum. Most buildings were small, in extensive disrepair, and lacked both electricity and running water. Following his return, Gaye and his good friend Reese Palmer formed the vocal quartet The Marquees. The group performed in the D.C. area and soon began working with Bo Diddley, who assigned the group to Columbia subsidiary OKeh Records after failing to get the group signed to his own label, Chess. The group's sole single, \\"Wyatt Earp\\" (co-written by Bo Diddley), failed to chart and the group was soon dropped from the label. Gaye began composing music during this period. Moonglows co-founder Harvey Fuqua later hired The Marquees as employees. Under Fuqua's direction, the group changed its name to Harvey and the New Moonglows, and relocated to Chicago. The group recorded several sides for Chess in 1959, including the song \\"Mama Loocie\\", which was Gaye's first lead vocal recording. The group found work as session singers for established acts such as Chuck Berry, singing on the hits \\"Back in the U.S.A.\\" and \\"Almost Grown\\". In 1960, the group disbanded. Gaye relocated to Detroit with Fuqua where he signed with Tri-Phi Records as a session musician, playing drums on several Tri-Phi releases. Gaye performed at Motown president Berry Gordy's house during the holiday season in 1960. Impressed by the singer, Gordy sought Fuqua on his contract with Gaye. Fuqua agreed to sell part of his interest in his contract with Gaye. Shortly afterwards, Gaye signed with Motown subsidiary Tamla. When Gaye signed with Tamla, he pursued a career as a performer of jazz music and standards, having no desire to become an R&B performer. Before the release of his first single, Gaye was teased about his surname, with some jokingly asking, \\"Is Marvin Gay?\\" Gaye changed the spelling of his surname by adding an e, in the same way as did Sam Cooke. Author David Ritz wrote that Gaye did this to silence rumors of his sexuality, and to put more distance between himself and his father. Gaye released his first single, \\"Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide\\", in May 1961, with the album The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye, following a month later. Gaye's initial recordings failed commercially and he spent most of 1961 performing session work as a drummer for artists such as The Miracles, The Marvelettes and blues artist Jimmy Reed for 5 (US41 in 2017 dollars) a week. While Gaye took some advice on performing with his eyes open (having been accused of appearing as though he were sleeping), he refused to attend grooming school courses at the John Roberts Powers School for Social Grace in Detroit because of his unwillingness to comply with its orders, something he later regretted. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What was Marvin Gaye's big break?","output":"Marvin Gaye's big break was when he \\"performed at Motown president Berry Gordy's house during the holiday season in 1960.

Within minutes of arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. They go to the run-down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. He doesn't have it so Emil stabs him and his wife to death as Oleg tapes it with the camera.

On the wall, there are some pictures of their family. Li Lei's green coat is on his bed, but his blue shoes are under his chair. Their books and pencil-boxes are on their desks. We can see some flowers and a clock on Li Ping's desk. Li Lei's schoolbag is behind his chair, but Li Ping's is on his chair. Where is their white cat? Oh, it's under Li Lei's bed. Their pencil-boxes are _ . A) on their desks B) on the table C) on their beds D) on Li Lei's desk Answer:","output":"A) on their desks To provide a detailed description of the picture, Li Lei and Li Ping's bedroom is a small yet bright and pleasant space for the twin brothers. The room is well-organized, with two identical beds placed next to each other, which not only saves space but also manages to create a sense of unity and harmony. There are two chairs in the room, each belonging to one of the brothers. Similarly, there are two desks, each allocated for one brother's personal use. Additionally, a table is present in the bedroom, which can serve various purposes, such as placing decorative items or using it for a casual meal. One of the significant features in the room is the cat, which can be found under Li Lei's bed. The presence of a pet in the room adds warmth and injects liveliness to the overall ambiance of the space. Meanwhile, each of the brothers has their own pencil-box, which can be found on their respective desks. The fact that their pencil-boxes are on their desks not only indicates that the brothers maintain a certain level of tidiness, but it also suggests that they have separate spaces to work on their school assignments or other personal projects. As a result, it underscores the importance of personal space and organization even among siblings who share a room. Furthermore, the wall of the bedroom is adorned with family pictures, which demonstrates the value of family and memories for Li Lei and Li Ping. These pictures serve as reminders of cherished moments spent with loved ones, adding a sentimental touch to the room. Clothes and footwear also have specific spots in the room. Li Lei's green coat rests on his bed, while his blue shoes are tucked neatly under his chair. Meanwhile, both Li Lei and Li Ping's schoolbags occupy different spots, with Li Lei's schoolbag positioned behind his chair, and Li Ping's placed directly on his chair. Lastly, the presence of flowers and a clock on Li Ping's desk brings a touch of nature, color, and time-management into the room. These elements help create a wholesome and inviting atmosphere in the bedroom. In conclusion, the bedroom of twin brothers Li Lei and Li Ping is a thoughtfully designed and organized space. It incorporates various elements that serve both functional and aesthetic purposes, making it a comfortable and enjoyable living space for the brothers. The answer to the initial question, the location of their pencil-boxes, is on their desks (Option A)."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Article: These days, most people in Britain and the US do not wear formal clothes. But sometimes it is important to wear the right thing. Many British people don't think about clothes very much. When they go out to enjoy themselves, they can wear almost anything. At theatres , cinemas and concerts you can put on anything you like: from beautiful suits and dresses to jeans and sweaters. Anything goes, as long as you look clean and tidy. But in Britain, as well as in the US, men in offices usually wear suits and ties and women wear dresses or skirts (not trousers). Doctors and business people always wear quite formal clothes. And in some hotels and restaurants men have to wear ties and women have to wear tidy dresses. In many ways, Americans are less formal than British people, but they are more careful with their clothes. At home, most Americans wear informal or sports clothes. But when they go out in the evening, they like to look nice. In good hotels and restaurants, men have to wear jackets and ties, and women have to wear pretty clothes. It is difficult to say exactly what people wear in Britain and the US, because everyone is different. If you are not sure what to wear, watch what other people do and then do the same.

Dies könnte darauf zurückzuführen sein, dass die Serben das Gefühl haben, dass sie in bestimmten Aspekten der Angelegenheit benachteiligt wären oder dass sie den Ausgang der Verhandlungen für unbedeutend halten. Ein weiterer Grund könnte historische oder kulturelle Differenzen zwischen Serben und Kroaten sein, die dazu führen, dass die Zusammenarbeit und das Finden gemeinsamer Lösungen erschwert werden. Da beide Gruppen unterschiedliche Hintergründe, Erfahrungen und Perspektiven haben, könnte es sein, dass sie unterschiedliche Prioritäten und Ansichten darüber haben, wie die Angelegenheit angegangen und gelöst werden sollte. Es ist auch möglich, dass es interne Konflikte oder Meinungsverschiedenheiten innerhalb der serbischen Delegation gibt. Diese internen Probleme könnten dazu führen, dass die Delegation geschwächt oder ineffektiv wird, was dazu führt, dass sie nicht in der Lage ist, konstruktiv zur Lösung des Problems beizutragen oder proaktiv Lösungen vorzuschlagen. In jedem Fall sollte das gemeinsame Komitee nach Wegen suchen, um effektiver zusammenzuarbeiten, die gegenseitige Kommunikation und das Verständnis zu fördern und ein Umfeld zu schaffen, in dem beide Parteien gleichermaßen dazu beitragen können, zu einer Lösung zu gelangen. Dies könnte beinhalten, die gegenseitigen Bedenken und Hürden zu identifizieren, die einer effektiven Zusammenarbeit entgegenstehen, und gegebenenfalls Vermittler oder Experten hinzuzuziehen, die bei der Navigation dieser Herausforderungen helfen können. Ziel dieser Bemühungen sollte es sein, die bestehenden Schwierigkeiten und Konflikte zwischen Serben und Kroaten zu überwinden und eine gemeinsame Lösung für das Problem zu entwickeln, das das Komitee abzuschließen versucht. Wenn beide Seiten bereit sind, offen zu kommunizieren und zusammenzuarbeiten, besteht die Möglichkeit, dass eine erfolgreiche Lösung gefunden werden kann, die sowohl für die Serben als auch für die Kroaten akzeptabel ist."},{"instruction":"What key details about morris cafritz can be extracted from the following bio?

These small-sized deer, native to China, Taiwan, and surrounding areas, were brought to the Woburn Abbey Estate in Bedfordshire in the early 1900s, under the collection of the then Duke of Bedford. The Reeves's Muntjac Deer is named after the British naturalist John Reeves, who first introduced this species to the Western world. Adult Muntjacs stand at around 16-20 inches high at the shoulder and weigh around 22-40 lbs. They are easily identifiable by their short brow tines, upward-pointing canine teeth in the males, reddish-brown fur, and a white patch on their throat. In the early 20th century, a few individual deer escaped or were intentionally released from Woburn, leading to an increase in their population across Britain. The species has since been able to establish itself in the wild, thanks to its ability to adapt to a range of habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, and urban areas. They are known to browse on different types of flora, such as shoots, herbs, and fruits, which has allowed them to thrive in their new environment. Muntjacs have had both positive and negative impacts on their new British surroundings. Their presence has diversified the British wildlife and added an intriguing new species to the local ecosystems. Additionally, they serve as a food source for native predators like foxes and birds of prey. However, their browsing habits can often be detrimental to the growth and regeneration of trees and other vegetation, and their presence has been found to contribute to a decline in bird species in certain woodlands. Moreover, the accidental release of Muntjac Deer has resulted in them being classified as an invasive non-native species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981. While they are not currently culled on a large scale, there are debates on the control measures and management required to mitigate potential environmental impacts caused by their growing population. In conclusion, the Reeves's Muntjac Deer was introduced to Britain at Woburn Abbey Estate in the early 20th century and has since established itself as a capable inhabitant of the British landscape. While their presence has provided some ecological benefits, there are ongoing concerns over potential negative consequences stemming from this introduced species."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Coins, as mentioned in 31 U.S.C. § 5112, are designated as legal tender for all transactions. However, there have been instances where certain coins, particularly pennies and nickels, might not be considered acceptable for certain types of transactions, primarily due to their low denomination and practicality issues. For example, it may not be practical to use a large number of pennies or nickels for transactions that involve high dollar amounts, such as purchasing a car or a house. Businesses may also have policies that limit the number of coins that can be used in a single transaction, particularly in cases where counting large quantities of coins would slow down the transaction process and inconvenience other customers. Such policies might not necessarily deem specific coins as illegal tender, but for practical reasons, businesses may choose to limit or restrict the use of certain coins for transactions. Additionally, coins that are damaged, altered, or deemed as unfit currency by the United States Mint are not considered legal tender. Counterfeit coins and coins from foreign nations are also not considered legal tender for transactions in the United States.

Available choices: + yes. + no.","output":"No, the given statement is not a comprehensive answer to the question, \\"What is the CAP?\\". It only provides a brief insight into how the Central Arizona Project Aqueduct is incorporated into the city's water supply. To provide a more detailed and long answer, consider the following: The Central Arizona Project (CAP) is an extensive water diversion system that transports water from the Colorado River to Central and Southern Arizona. The project, which began in 1973 and was completed in 1993, was initiated to address the water needs in the region due to the growing population and ongoing agricultural practices. The CAP plays a vital role in supplying water to residents and farmers in the state of Arizona while also assisting in groundwater recharge. The CAP consists of a series of canals, pipelines, pumping plants, and other facilities, extending over 336 miles from Lake Havasu on the Colorado River to its terminus south of Tucson. Throughout the system, water is lifted almost 3,000 feet in elevation through a series of 14 pumping stations before ultimately reaching its destination in Southern Arizona. The aqueduct system serves about 80% of the state's population, providing water for municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses. The major cities that benefit from the CAP include Phoenix, Tucson, and various Native American communities. The CAP ensures an adequate water supply for the cities it serves by allocating a certain amount of water to each recipient. The allocation is determined based on a variety of factors, including the water rights of the recipient and the overall demand for water in their region. In addition, the CAP is responsible for managing and delivering Colorado River water to the state under the laws and agreements governing the river. This involves working with other entities, such as the Bureau of Reclamation, which is responsible for storing and releasing water from major dams, and the Central Arizona Water Conservation District, which participates in the management and funding of the project. Moreover, the CAP plays a significant role in groundwater recharge initiatives. The statement you provided is an example of such initiatives, as it talks about incorporating CAP water into the city's water supply and replenishing groundwater by pumping recharged water back into the ground. This practice helps to mitigate the depletion of groundwater resources, ensuring a sustainable supply for present and future generations. In conclusion, the Central Arizona Project is a crucial water management system that serves the ever-growing needs of Central and Southern Arizona. By transporting water from the Colorado River and managing its allocation, the CAP not only provides an essential resource to the region but also ensures the long-term sustainability of the area's water supply through groundwater recharge initiatives."},{"instruction":"A movie theater charges 5 for matinee tickets, 7 for evening tickets, and 10 for opening night tickets.

Farm A produces only organic milk. Farm B does not but they are considering switching production to organic milk. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm likely has higher milk yields, farm A or B? Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had people with less hemoglobin clumping together? Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above.

Context: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: What did the actor do for a living after getting rejected for the play with the even larger theatre?

The Lenape (English: or ), also called the Leni Lenape, Lenni Lenape and Delaware people, are an indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands, who live in Canada and the United States. Their historical territory included present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River watershed, New York City, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley. Today, Lenape people belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Wisconsin, and the Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario. The Lenape have a matrilineal clan system and historically were matrilocal. At the time of sustained European contact in the 16th centuries and 17th centuries, the Lenape were a powerful Native American nation who inhabited a region on the mid-Atlantic coast spanning the latitudes of southern Massachusetts to the southern extent of Delaware in what anthropologists call the Northeastern Woodlands. Although never politically unified, the confederation of the Delaware roughly encompassed the area around and between the Delaware and lower Hudson rivers, and included the western part of Long Island in present-day New York. Some of their place names, such as Manhattan (\\"the island of many hills\\"), Raritan, and Tappan were adopted by Dutch and English colonists to identify the Lenape people that lived there. Based on the historical record of the mid-17th century, it has been estimated that most Lenape polities consisted of several hundred people but it is conceivable that some had been considerably larger prior to close contact, given the wars between the Susquehannocks and the Iroquois, both of whom were armed by the Dutch fur traders, while the Lenape were at odds with the Dutch and so lost that particular arms race. During the Beaver Wars in the first half of the 17th century, European colonists were careful to keep firearms from the coastally located Delaware, while rival Iroquoian peoples such as the Susquehannocks and Confederation of the Iroquois became comparatively well armed. Subsequently, the Lenape became subjugated and made tributary to first the Susquehannocks, then the Iroquois, even needing their rivals' (superiors') agreement to initiate treaties such as land sales. Like most tribes, Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases originating in Europe, mainly smallpox but also cholera, influenza and dysentery, and recurrent violent racial conflict with Europeans. Iroquoian peoples occasionally fought the Lenape. As the 18th century progressed, many surviving Lenape moved west--into the (relatively empty) upper Ohio River basin. Smallpox devastated Native American communities even located far from European settlements by the 1640s. The Lenape and Susquehannocks fought a war in the middle of the 17th century that left the Delaware a tributary state even as the Susquehannocks had defeated the Province of Maryland between 1642-50s.

If you want the dye to appear like it does on the packaging, you need to start with a white base. If you prefer a muted shade, however, you could start with gray linen instead. You can try dyeing a cotton-linen or rayon-linen blend, but be aware that the results may not be consistent or even. If you are working with yarn, wind the yarn around your hand and elbow to create a large hank. Loosely tie pieces of string around the hank to secure it. Use a funnel to fill a large jug with 1 cup (140 g) of soda ash. Add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water that is around 105 °F (41 °C). Close the jug and shake it to dissolve the soda ash. Open the jug and set it aside so that the water can cool. Use pure soda ash (sodium carbonate), not baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). You can find it online and in well-stocked craft stores. If you have hard water in your town or city, add some water softener. This will prevent the minerals from affecting the dye. Place your fabric or yarn into a plastic tub. Fill it with enough of the soda ash solution to completely cover the linen. Let the linen soak for at least 20 minutes. Save the rest of the soda ash for later. The soda ash solution can still be hot for this step. Each brand will be a little different, but in most cases, you will have to mix 2 teaspoons of fabric reactive dye powder with 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Mix the dye with a little bit of warm water to form a paste first, then add the rest of the water. Wear safety googles and rubber of plastic gloves to protect your eyes and skin. Wear a dusk mask approved for fine particles for this step. Powdered fabric reactive dye is dangerous to breathe in. Use less dye for a lighter shade and more dye for a darker shade. You don't have to use an applicator bottle if you won't want to, but many people find it easier to use than just pouring the dye from the container your prepared it in. How much more dye you prepare depends on how much linen you are dyeing; refer to the manufacturer's instructions for more advice. Take the linen out of the soda ash bath, and squeeze out the excess solution. Set the linen down onto a plastic tray or bag, then squirt the dye onto it. You can create an all-over solid color or a splotchy color. You can even use multiple colors to create a tie dye effect. Keep color mixing in mind. If you put 2 contrasting colors next to each other, they will form brown then they touch. Squeeze the linen after you apply the dye, then apply more dye if needed. If you dyed your linen multiple colors, be careful not to bundle it up. Arrange the linen so that no 2 colors touch or smoosh together. Zip or tie the bag shut, and leave it in a warm place for 12 to 24 hours. The place should be at least 65 °F (18 °C). The longer you leave the linen in the bag, the brighter and more vibrant the colors will turn out. Don't worry, fiber reactive dyes are non-toxic, so they won't harm the environment or waterways. The soda ash can also unblock clogs in your sink! Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. It would be a good idea to rinse the linen afterwards with Synthrapol, which helps set the dye into the linen better. You need to use Synthrapol with hot water; follow the instructions on the bottle. Make sure that no soda ash remains inn the linen before you start. Squeeze the linen with your hands until you get most of the water out. Spread it out on an old towel in a well-ventilated area away from sunlight. Allow it to air dry completely before using the fabric or yarn. Once the yarn is dry, snip the strings holding the skein together, then roll the skein into a ball. Summary:","output":"Dyeing linen is a fun and creative process. First, soak the linen in a soda ash solution for at least 20 minutes. Then, mix the fabric reactive dye powder with water to create the dye. After soaking, squeeze out the excess solution from the linen, and apply the dye onto it. You can use different colors and patterns. Put the dyed linen in a plastic bag and let it sit for 12 to 24 hours in a warm place to set the color. After that, rinse the linen until the water runs clear. Finally, let it air dry on an old towel away from sunlight.

Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge has been selected to serve as chair of the Democratic National Convention, which kicks off Monday. Democratic National Committee Vice Chair Donna Brazile will serve as Interim Chair through the election, a DNC spokesperson said on Twitter. As recently as Friday, there was no sign of trouble and Wasserman Schultz was set to lead the convention, according to sources. Wasserman Schultz spoke at two Hillary Clinton rallies in Florida Friday and Saturday, including the one where presumptive vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine appeared publicly for the first time. But opposition to Wasserman Schultz, both public and private, had been gaining steam following the publication late last week of leaked emails which seemed to show a plot by DNC officials to damage Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. The revelations created doubts from various sectors of the party about how Wasserman Schultz could oversee a convention meant to showcase party unity. By late Saturday, opposition inside the party \\"spread like wildfire,\\" according to a Democratic source close to the matter. It resulted in a tense confrontation Sunday when officials told Wasserman Schultz she had to go. Wasserman Schultz had become toxic to supporters of Sanders, who accused her of rigging the Democratic presidential nominating process in favor of Clinton. Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz Richard Drew / AP In a statement, Sanders said that Wasserman Schultz had made \\"the right decision\\" but repeated his criticism of the party for what he describes as the DNC putting its thumb on the scale during the primary contest. \\"Debbie Wasserman Schultz has made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party,\\" he said. \\"While she deserves thanks for her years of service, the party now needs new leadership that will open the doors of the party and welcome in working people and young people. The party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race.\\" But starting even before that, many Democrats had privately lost confidence in her leadership. \\"She's essentially a pariah in every corner of the party,\\" said one veteran Democratic strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal politics. \\"This has needed to happen for a long time.\\" For instance in late May, after a news report that Democrats were considering ousting Wasserman Schultz, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called her to say he would not put out a statement defending her. Wasserman Schultz also overrode the White House and the Clinton campaign in her choice of communications director for the DNC last fall. The key role went vacant for five months as the various parties tried to find a candidate acceptable to her, with some allies criticizing the process and outcome. Even Clinton allies questioned the DNC's heavy-handed approach to dealing with the Sanders campaign during a data breach incident in December, worrying that it would undermine the credibility of a nominating process they hoped to win. Wasserman Schultz had already effectively lost control of the DNC after Clinton's campaign inserted operative Brandon Davis to run operations on a day-to-day basis. The Clinton campaign also recently sent a second staffer, Adam Parkhomenko, from its Brooklyn headquarters to serve in a senior role on the committee. But internal DNC emails posted online by Wikileaks late last week became the catalyst for her official removal. One email showed the party's finance chairman suggesting the DNC use what they assumed to be Sanders' atheism against him in Kentucky and West Virginia, religious states where it might not play well. Others showed Wasserman Schultz criticizing Sanders for not being a member of the party and saying he would never be president. The emails were apparently stolen by hackers working for the Russian government, and Clinton officials have said their posting is an attempt to sway the election for Donald Trump. The emails implicate other DNC officials, including CEO Amy Dacey, a close Wasserman Schultz ally who is well respected by other Democrats, and communications department officials. Meanwhile, Wasserman Schultz is facing a surprisingly tough congressional reelection campaign back home in Florida against a primary candidate backed by Sanders. Wasserman Schultz, who began her tenure as chair in 2011, proved herself to be a prodigious fundraiser for fellow Delegates and an effective party surrogate and attack dog. \\"I want to thank my longtime friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the Democratic National Committee over the past five years,\\" Clinton said a statement accepting the chairwoman's resignation. Wasserman Schultz served as a co-chair of Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign and Clinton said Sunday that the Floridian will serve as \\"honorary chair\\" of her campaign's 50-state program and continue to serve as a surrogate for her campaign nationally and in Florida. Her detractors inside the party had resigned themselves to Wasserman Schultz's leadership through November, comforted by the fact that she had been marginalized by Clinton aides. Even some critics in the Clinton campaign and White House thought it would be better to keep Wasserman Schultz than to risk presenting an image of disunity by forcing her out. On Sunday, critics passed around a tweet Wasserman Schultz sent last week to her counterpart at the Republican National Committee, Reince Preibus. \\"Hey @Reince — I'm in Cleveland if you need another chair to help keep your convention in order,\\" she wrote. Priebus, who faced his own challenges managing a fractured party at the GOP's convention in Cleveland last week, told reporters Sunday that Wasserman Schultz's resignation was \\"inevitable,\\" adding \\"it shows what an uphill climb the Democrats are facing this week in unifying the party.\\" ||||| (CNN) The Democratic National Convention kicked off Monday without its outgoing Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, following a chaotic scene at a morning meeting where she was loudly jeered by Bernie Sanders supporters. \\"I have decided that in the interest of making sure that we can start the Democratic convention on a high note that I am not going to gavel in the convention,\\" Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel newspaper in an interview. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who is also the Democratic National Committee's secretary, handled the gaveling instead. \\"Delegates, alternatives, standing committee members and all of our honored Democrats and other guests here in Philadelphia and all of you who have joined us by television, radio and online, here in the United States and around the world,\\" she said, \\"I hereby call the 47th quadrennial Democratic National Convention to order.\\" Wasserman Schultz will also not speak tonight or throughout the duration of the convention, a Democrat close to her says. She will remain in Philadelphia until Friday when she formally steps down as leader of the committee. Wasserman Schultz changed her plans as the fallout deepened from leaked DNC emails that appeared to show the committee favoring presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Sanders during the primary. It became clear Monday that the convention floor could erupt in anger if she gaveled the convention into session or sought to speak. And the Democratic National Committee issued an apology to Sanders moments after the convention opened, likely hoping to help soothe tensions heading into the week. \\"On behalf of everyone at the DNC, we want to offer a deep and sincere apology to Sen. Sanders, his supporters, and the entire Democratic Party for the inexcusable remarks made over email,\\" the statement said. \\"These comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process. The DNC does not -- and will not -- tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates. Individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments, and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens again.\\" The morning Florida delegate meeting descended into chaos when Wasserman Schultz took the stage, with critics holding up signs with the word \\"emails,\\" and Sanders supporters booing the congresswoman loudly, even after she began speaking. \\"We have to make sure that we move forward together in a unified way,\\" Wasserman Schultz said during brief remarks. \\"We know that the voices in this room that are standing up and being disruptive, we know that is not the Florida that we know. The Florida that we know is going to make sure that we continue to make jobs.\\" The audience was roughly half supportive of Wasserman Schultz and half detractors, though the angry participants were louder than the other half. Those attendees began to chant, \\"Shame! Shame! Shame!\\" while Wasserman Schultz was speaking. Sanders tried to quell some of his dissatisfied supporters at a rally before his expected speech Monday. \\"We have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine,\\" Sanders said, which prompted some attendees to shout him down.

The drama reinforced concerns about Democratic party unity. Former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver tried to show a unified Democratic Party on Monday, the morning after Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation. \\"This happened, we knew it happened then, now is the time to go forward,' Weaver told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \\"New Day\\" on Monday. \\"Now is the time to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump.\\" Wasserman Schultz talked with both President Barack Obama and Clinton before making announcing her upcoming resignation, a Democratic source said. \\"Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals [which include electing Clinton president] is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention,\\" Wasserman Schultz said in the statement. \\"As party chair, this week I will open and close the Convention and I will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats, but for all Americans,\\" she said.

She had been a CNN political commentator, but CNN and Brazile have mutually agreed to suspend their contract, effective immediately, although she will remain on air during the convention week in an unpaid capacity, CNN said. CNN will revisit the contract once Brazile concludes her role. Separately, a Democratic operative said Hispanic leaders close to Clinton and her high command were discussing Housing Secretary Julian Castro as a possible successor to Wasserman Schultz at the DNC helm, among a number of other candidates whose name are being mentioned. Chants of \\"Debbie is done!\\" and \\"Debbie resigned!\\" broke out at a pro-Sanders rally Sunday in Philadelphia after the news was announced. Party officials decided Saturday that Wasserman Schultz would not have a major speaking role or preside over daily convention proceedings this week. The DNC Rules Committee has named Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, as permanent chair of the convention, according to a DNC source. She will gavel each session to order and will gavel each session closed. \\"She's been quarantined,\\" another top Democrat said of Wasserman Schultz, following a meeting Saturday night but before her announcement that she was leaving. Both sides of the aisle react Obama issued a statement, saying, \\"For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful.\\" And Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the party. \\"I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year's historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week's events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,\\" Clinton said. After slamming Wasserman Schultz as \\"highly overrated,\\" Trump, speaking at a rally in Roanoke, Virginia, knocked Clinton for being disloyal to the soon-to-be former DNC chair. \\"How about that for disloyalty in terms of Hillary Clinton. Because Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so much for Hillary Clinton,\\" Trump said. \\"These politicians. There's no loyalty there. No loyalty. None whatsoever.\\" \\"It gets a little heat and they fire her,\\" Trump said. \\"Debbie was totally loyal to Hillary and Hillary threw her under a bus and it didn't take more than five minutes to make that decision.\\" Wasserman's Republican counterpart, Reince Priebus, said, \\"I think the day's events show really the uphill climb Democrats face this week.\\" \\"The extreme left will not be satisfied by one person's resignation,\\" the Republican party national chairman added. Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz out the door. \\"Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned over her failure to secure the DNC's email servers and the rigged system she set up with the Clinton campaign,\\" he said in a statement. \\"Now Hillary Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz's lead and drop out over her failure to safeguard top secret, classified information both on her unauthorized home server and while traveling abroad.\\" Weaver called Wasserman Schultz's departure a win on CNN's \\"Erin Burnett OutFront\\" on Sunday. \\"I think what the signal was today is that the voices of Bernie Sanders supporters have been heard,\\" he said. \\"And other people, frankly, in the party, Hillary Clinton supporters, who felt this was the last straw, that she had to go, and this shows they have been heard and gives us opportunity to move forward toward November -- united to deal with the problem of Donald Trump.\\" Wasserman Schultz's stewardship of the DNC has been under fire through most of the presidential primary process, but her removal from the convention stage comes following the release of nearly 20,000 emails. One email appears to show DNC staffers asking how they can reference Sanders' faith to weaken him in the eyes of Southern voters. Another seems to depict an attorney advising the committee on how to defend Clinton against an accusation by the Sanders campaign of not living up to a joint fundraising agreement.

In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. In Los Angeles, career-focused lawyer Fletcher Reede (Carrey) loves his son Max (Cooper), but his inability to keep his promises and the compulsive lying he engages in for his career often cause problems between them and with his former wife Audrey (Tierney), who has become involved with another man named Jerry (Elwes). In court, Fletcher is willing to exaggerate the stories of his clients, and his current client, the self-centered, money-grabbing Samantha Cole (Tilly) has garnered the attention of Mr. Allen, a partner at the law firm in which Fletcher works. If Fletcher wins this case, it will bring his firm a fortune and boost his career. Fletcher calls and lies to Audrey about missing Max's birthday due to work, when he is actually having sex with his boss, Miranda, in order to get a promotion. Dejected, Max makes a birthday wish that for one day his father cannot tell a lie. The wish immediately comes true, and Fletcher accidentally tells Miranda he has \\"had better\\" after they have sex.The following day, Fletcher immediately realizes that he is unable to do anything dishonest. He cannot lie, mislead, or even deceive by withholding a true answer, often uncontrollably blurting out offensive and painful truths that anger his co-workers, and his car ends up in an impound for several parking violations. This comes to a head when he realizes that he is unable to even ask questions when he knows the answer will be a lie, which is inconvenient as Samantha and her alleged affair partner Kenneth Faulk are willing to commit perjury to win the high profile case and he cannot ask him the questions they have been given answers for.Realizing that Max had wished for this to happen, Fletcher tries to convince him that adults need to lie, but cannot give any type of answer at why he should continue to lie to his son. Fletcher also figures out that since Max wished for him to tell the truth for only one day, he tries to do what he can to delay Samantha's case since the magic wish will expire at 8:15 p.m., 24 hours after Max made the wish. Things only get worse for Fletcher as he loses his loyal assistant Greta after admitting he had lied about the miserly reasons for denying her pay raises and the \\"expensive\\" gifts he gave her, and Audrey tells Fletcher that she and Max are moving to Boston with Jerry in order to prevent any more heartbreaks from Fletcher's broken promises.Fletcher's erratic behavior in court leads to several questions of his sanity as he objects to himself and badgers and provokes his own witnesses into admitting they had an affair against Samantha and her husband's prenuptial agreement. He even goes so far as to beat himself up and claim that someone attacked him in order to try and avoid the case, but when asked if he feels like he can continue, he can't deny it and he says yes. During the case, Fletcher finds a technicality that Samantha lied that she was underage when she signed the prenup prior to her marriage, rendering it void and entitling her to half of Mr. Cole's estate, allowing him to win the case truthfully. But when Samantha decides to contest full custody of their children, who Mr. Cole dearly loves, just because she wants more money from the child support payments, Fletcher regrets mentioning the technicality after seeing Mrs. Cole pull the children out of their father's arms, and shriek her demands for more money. Realizing now that winning the case has punished the loving husband and rewarded the cheating wife, Fletcher has a crisis of conscience and shouts at the Judge demanding that he reverse the decision, but he is arrested for contempt of court. He calls Audrey from the prison's phone and pleads with her to bail him out and give him another chance, but she hangs up on him.Greta returns and bails Fletcher from jail, who forgives him and realizes that telling the truth has made him a better man and he rushes to the airport to stop Audrey and Max from leaving forever. He misses their flight, but he sneaks onto the tarmac by hiding in a piece of luggage, steals a motorized staircase, and manages to gain the pilot's attention by throwing his shoe at the cockpit window, forcing him to abort the flight. However, Fletcher's victory is cut short when he crashes into a barrier and is sent flying into a baggage tug, which causes a chain reaction that leaves Fletcher unconscious and with both of his legs broken. After waking up, he tells Max how much he cares about him and how sorry he was for breaking his promises. Despite no longer being under the wish's influence, Fletcher means what he says and adds that Max is his priority, and Max convinces Audrey to stay in Los Angeles.One year later, Fletcher is healed and is running his own law firm with Greta as his continued assistant. Max makes a wish with his birthday cake and the lights come on to reveal Fletcher and Audrey kissing, but explains he wished for rollerblades instead of them reconciling.

Each specially reinforced Cooper carries a heavy, illicit cargo of gold bullion, and each is having trouble giving the police-liveried Alfa Romeo Giulias the slip. Bursting out from a tunnel, the red, white and blue Minis are chased across the roof of a building. Yet this is no ordinary rooftop; the lads of The Italian Job have stumbled onto the four-storey-high racetrack atop the most famous structure in Turin. Three abreast, they loop through the steeply banked turns, switching position to keep the police from overtaking as the skyline of the city is laid out below. “Now as you go around, watch for that bloody exit,” Caine's Charlie Croker tells his driver. “We can't go around here all night.” The Minis spin up their buzzy little engines and make for the edge, leaving the Pista Lingotto in a triple jump across a yawning gap. The pursuing Alfa skids to a stop on the parapet, foiled by the aerial Brits: Pure fiction of course, but if there was one structure the cinematographers could ill afford to omit from their crime caper, it was Fiat’s Lingotto factory. Though obsolescence was only a few years away, the structure was then, and remains now, among the most important buildings in Europe. A reminder of its importance came in July 2014, when Fiat announced it would relocate its corporate headquarters from nearby the Lingotto factory to an interim office in Slough, England, with plans to open a London base shortly thereafter. It is a historic break with tradition, spurred by the conglomerate’s recent full merger with Chrysler Group. For all the news attending the move, the fact remains that Fiat is Turin and Turin is Fiat. The carmaker’s massive output is a symbol of the city's industrial wealth – never more so than during the early 20th Century, when the coffers of Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino overflowed with wealth earned from producing materiel for World War I. Fiat's patriarch, Giovanni Agnelli, made astute political alliances, and his son Gianni had recently returned from a trip to the US, impressed by the mass production lines of the Ford Motor Company. Given there was no facility in Italy that could house such operations, a purpose-built automobile factory was conceived, with building commencing in 1916. By 1923, Benito Mussolini was in power, and the Lingotto factory opened its doors for the first time. The architecture was the handiwork of Giacomo Mattè Trucco, and it would be his magnum opus. The largest automotive factory in Europe and the first one constructed with the sole purpose of producing cars, it embodied the relatively new philosophies of Futurism and Modernism. It was simply massive, a half-kilometre of reinforced concrete four stories high, looming on the horizon like a colossal multi-windowed ark. At the inauguration, King Victor Emmanuel III toured the facility, though it could be said that the black-clad Duce was more aligned with the school of thought behind the project. This gargantuan building was a Modernist rejection of the baroque, a break from the past and a celebration of an industrialised future. Its test track sat like an emperor's laurels, a sky-high celebration of the automobile, speed and power above all else. Even so, and despite all that concrete, it was beautiful. The twin ramps leading down from either end of the rooftop resembled lily pads from below. Taken in its entirely, the structure was a honeycomb of activity, with something of Dante's Paradiso in the way the cars progressed from base materials at the ground level to fully functioning machines by the time they emerged from the hive. An owner of a Fiat Spider, 124 or similar from the period before the late 1970s would have every reason to believe that the first few miles put on the odometer would have come high above Turin, as every car leaving the factory was so tested. While the banked sections are impossibly tight, rumours persist that concepts and racing engines were also tested here, including the one-off 1954 Turbina, with its projected 160mph top speed. However, the Lingotto factory built fewer cars than expected, putting out an average of 200 daily when Ford's lines were producing several thousand. It was soon caught and eclipsed by another Fiat factory, the Mirafiori plant, which sped its obsolescence. The last car Lingotto produced was a 1979 Lancia Delta. In 1982, the factory was officially shuttered, eventually to be converted into a combination hotel, convention centre and shopping facility. The conversion was master-planned by Renzo Piano, architect of “The Shard” in London, as well as the headquarters of The New York Times in Manhattan. So indelible was the building’s mark on the city that discussions containing the word “demolition” never gained a broad audience. The Lingotto factory remains, as does the imprint of Fiat on the Italian consciousness, colossal. Michael Caine’s band of thieves may have made off with the gold on screen, but for generations of torinese, the treasure remained behind.

Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Lingotto factory, once the largest automotive factory in Europe, played a crucial role in establishing Turin, Italy, as a center of automobile production during the early 20th century. The factory's iconic rooftop test track showcased the importance of speed, power, and innovation in the industry, and though it was eventually surpassed by other Fiat plants, its legacy as a symbol of Italian ingenuity and industrial prowess endures."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"Auditors should place their findings in proper perspective by providing a description of the objectives, scope, and methodology used to conduct the work.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Others' perception doesn't matter when it comes to an auditor's line of work.\\" is true?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise states that auditors should provide a clear description of their objectives, scope, and methodology when presenting their findings. This suggests that it is important for auditors to give context and clarity to their work, which may influence the perception of their findings by others. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states that other people's perception doesn't matter when it comes to an auditor's line of work, which implies that how others perceive or understand the auditor's work is irrelevant. Step 3: Compare the premise and the hypothesis By comparing these two statements, it appears that the premise emphasizes the importance of proper communication and context when presenting audit findings, while the hypothesis suggests that others' perception is irrelevant. Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis If the premise is true and auditors should indeed explain their objectives, scope, and methodology when presenting findings, then this implies that others' perception does matter in an auditor's line of work. Auditors should ensure that others understand their work and the context of their findings to enhance credibility and facilitate appropriate decision-making. Conclusion: Based on the premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Others' perception doesn't matter when it comes to an auditor's line of work.\\" is true.

How can I lose weight quickly? Need serious help. Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"While both questions center around the desire to lose weight quickly, their phrasing and context are slightly different. The first question specifically requests advice for losing weight rapidly within a 14-day period, while the second question is more general, focusing on the need for serious help regarding quick weight loss. Although these distinctions exist, the underlying theme in both questions is, indeed, similar. To lose weight rapidly within a 14-day period, a comprehensive plan to adjust one's diet, increase physical activity, and develop healthy habits is crucial. Here's a detailed plan of action: **1. Set realistic goals:** Determine how much weight is intended or deemed safe to lose during the 14 days. Generally, 1 to 2 pounds per week is considered a safe and manageable rate of weight loss. **2. Track calorie intake:** Begin tracking the foods consumed, and manage daily calorie intake, as burning more calories than taken in is essential for weight loss. The average woman typically requires around 1500-1800 calories per day, and the average man approximately 1800-2200. However, this may vary based on individual factors like age, weight, and activity level. **3. Create a caloric deficit:** A caloric deficit of 500 to 1000 calories per day can result in a weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week. Focus on eating nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods like green leafy vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats, while cutting back on processed and high-calorie foods. **4. Increase physical activity and exercise:** Engage in regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, or group exercise classes. Aim for a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity weekly. Include strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least 2 days per week. **5. Drink plenty of water:** Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining overall health and can help in weight loss by promoting satiety, increasing metabolism, and flushing out toxins. **6. Opt for smaller, more frequent meals:** Breaking daily food intake into smaller, more frequent meals or snacks can keep the metabolism active and help regulate blood sugar levels, reducing the likelihood of overeating at meal times. **7.

So the equation is asking us to find how many apples (u) we need when we add up these different amounts of apples. First, let's add up all the apples together, so we need to combine all the \\"u\\" terms: (105 + 113 + 162) * u This is the same as: 380 * u So now our equation looks like this: -21 = 380*u + 1499 Let's move the 1499 to the other side of the equation to isolate the \\"u\\" term. To do this, we'll subtract 1499 from both sides: -21 - 1499 = 380 * u Now our equation looks like this: -1520 = 380 * u Finally, to find the value of \\"u\\" (the number of apples), we just need to divide both sides by 380: (-1520) / 380 = u Now if we do this division, we get: u = -4 So our answer is -4. That means if we have -4 apples in each group, the equation will be correct.

I suspect that the first commenter has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death. I have had many such losses, and this movie spoke to me. One of the major themes is how we don't deal with questions/issues/stories with our loved ones until it's too late--they're too incapacitated or dead before that happens. Talk to your loved ones, listen to and record their stories, tell people you love them, resolve differences. I loved the message that there are no mistakes.

Answer: The 1969 moon landing, famously known as the Apollo 11 mission, has a tremendous significance in human history and ushered in a new era of advancements in space exploration. It marked the first time humans stepped foot on the lunar surface, fulfilling the pledge made by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to land a man on the moon by the end of the decade. The Apollo 11 mission featured three astronauts: Neil Armstrong, Edwin \\"Buzz\\" Aldrin, and Michael Collins. Armstrong and Aldrin performed the first moonwalk, while Collins orbited the moon in the command module. The 1969 moon landing had a profound impact on multiple aspects. Firstly, it heightened the national pride and morale for the United States and showcased the nation's technological prowess. The successful accomplishment of this mission demonstrated American superiority in the ongoing Space Race against the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. This victory not only fulfilled political objectives but also promoted international cooperation in space exploration. Secondly, the Apollo program and subsequent moon landings pushed technological boundaries and led to several innovations, some of which found applications in non-aerospace sectors, such as medical equipment, materials science, and communications technologies. For instance, the development of integrated circuits, improved satellite systems, and portable computers saw accelerated progress due to the investment and research driven by NASA's ambitious goals. Moreover, the 1969 moon landing brought forth valuable scientific discoveries. The Apollo missions provided new insights into the formation and geology of the moon by analyzing rock and soil samples returned to Earth. The lunar missions also enabled the observation of solar phenomena, such as solar wind and solar flares, which paved the way for a better understanding of our solar system and the space environment. Lastly, the success of the Apollo 11 mission inspired generations of scientists, engineers, and astronauts, leading to new achievements in human space exploration. The United States continued its exploration with the subsequent Apollo missions, the Space Shuttle program, and the International Space Station (ISS). Other nations such as Russia, China, and India have also pursued their respective space exploration goals, enabling collaboration and knowledge sharing on an international scale. In conclusion, the 1969 moon landing marked a monumental achievement for humanity, providing tangible proof of human capability to explore further into space. The mission's significance lies in its embodiment of ingenuity, technological advancements, scientific discoveries, and its ability to encourage collaboration and inspire future generations to reach for the stars."},{"instruction":"Here is a dialogue: Jack: Hey Allison, when can I expect you at the airport?

What is a very short summary of the above text?","output":"The U.S. State Department announced on Tuesday that it has extended a waiver of missile proliferation sanctions for specific activities conducted by the Chinese government. In order to provide a detailed and comprehensive understanding of this brief news item, it is important to first explain some of the key terms and concepts. A waiver in this context refers to an agreed suspension or relaxation of a rule or regulation. Usually, this is granted when compliance with the specified requirement(s) is deemed infeasible or unnecessary in a particular case or for a specified period. In this case, the U.S. has provided an extension, or prolongation, of an existing waiver. The missile proliferation sanctions mentioned in the news piece refer to penalties imposed by one or more countries on others for breaches in internationally agreed-upon standards for the development, testing, production, acquisition, transfer, deployment, or use of missiles, especially those capable of carrying nuclear, chemical, or biological warheads. These sanctions are typically intended to discourage countries from engaging in the spread (or \\"proliferation\\") of such weapons, which is considered a threat to global peace and security. This can include export control sanctions that limit the potential for sharing missile technology, as well as broader economic, diplomatic, or even military penalties. The reference to certain Chinese government activities suggests that those specific actions or operations conducted by China have been judged as not contravening the spirit of restrictions against missile proliferation, or that it's in the U.S.' national interest to refrain from enforcing such sanctions in those specific instances. What those activities are, however, is not specified in the provided text. The U.S. State Department is the national executive department responsible for the international relations of the United States. This means it's the entity that communicates and negotiates with foreign governments like China and decides how the U.S. interacts with them, including whether or not to impose or waive sanctions. Given the geopolitical significance of missile development and the ongoing competition between the U.S. and China in the military, economic, and technological domains, such decisions are typically based on extensive deliberations involving defense, intelligence, and foreign affairs experts. In summary, this brief news piece announces that the U.S., through its State Department, has opted to prolong a relaxations of certain missile proliferation sanctions against specific activities performed by the Chinese not specified in the text. This highlights an aspect of the complex and multifaceted relationship between the two major powers, while inviting questions about the exact nature of the exempted activities and the strategic considerations underlying the decision to maintain the waiver."},{"instruction":"Add spaces: Frankfurt(FRA)airport202Km","output":"To add spaces in the given string \\"Frankfurt(FRA)airport202Km\\", I will follow these steps: 1.

At a remote ranch in the Arizona Territory, homesteader Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six-year-old son Johnny (Lee Aaker) come upon a stranger (John Wayne) on foot, carrying only his saddle bags and a rifle. The man tells them only his last name, Lane, and that he was riding dispatch for the US Army Cavalry. He had lost his horse in an encounter with some Indians. Angie tells Lane her ranch hand had quit before he had a chance to break her two horses for riding, so Lane offers to break a horse himself. He asks where her husband is, and she says he is rounding up cattle in the mountains and should return soon. Lane deduces from the neglected ranch that her husband has been away for some time, a fact she confesses is true. When night falls Angie offers to let Lane sleep in her home. Angie sees his rifle is inscribed \\"Hondo\\" Lane, whom she knows had killed three men the year before. She attempts to shoot him, but due to the first chamber being empty, Hondo is not hurt.

Simple yet effective: Two inventors from Israel say this simple invention could protect millions of children--an earthquake-proof table. Designed to withstand downward impacts of up to one ton, the table is the brainchild of Israeli inventors Arthur Brutter and Ido Bruno. Lifesaving: \\"When something falls on the table, it absorbs the object's energy, and debris is forced to the side,\\" says inventor Arthur Brutter. Hailing from Israel, a country known for its seismic activity, Brutter and Bruno were inspired to create a solution for the millions of people living in earthquake-prone regions worldwide. The earthquake-proof table's design is simple yet effective, ensuring that occupants of a building can seek shelter beneath it during an earthquake without fear of it collapsing under the force. Ido Bruno explains that the key feature of the table is its ability to distribute the force exerted by falling debris across the entire surface, preventing the table from being crushed. \\"It's comparable to a car's crumple zones, which absorb energy in a controlled manner during a collision,\\" he says. The innovative table has already caught the attention of countries like Haiti, which has faced devastating earthquakes in recent years. Officials in these nations are eager to explore the possibility of utilizing the earthquake-proof tables in schools and other public institutions to protect their citizens.

They despair when they watch their beloved spend much money on extra baggage charge. Nearly half of these women admitted to lying about the weight of their case to their partner before leaving for the airport, in fear of being made to unload some unnecessary items. But it's a fact that women pack more than they need. On average, a woman needs around 57 items in suitcase for a two-week holiday, yet most women pack nearer to 150 items, ranging from skirts, tops, underwear and high heels. In addition, women pack more sun cream, make-up and hair appliances than they were likely to need. They all take up space in the suitcase, only a third of them will see the light of day once at the holiday place. 79 percent of women admitted to taking extra items with them, with the reason for this being \\"just in case\\". Women plan their holiday wardrobe months in advance. Packing enough clothes and other items to last a month is not enough for some women. They'd take a chance to shop for new items while holidaying abroad. So they'll return with even more luggage in their cases. Professor Karen Pine said: \\"Women are tempted to take familiar items with them on holiday, often everything except the kitchen sink. Some people find traveling stressful, particularly when they're unsure about the home comforts available at their holiday place. They over-pack to help cope with those feelings of stress and reduce the uncertainty.\\" This will come as no surprise to some men, who are used to trying to squeeze their partner's luggage into the boot of the car with their own, smaller case.

If you’ve been paying attention in recent weeks, you know that the Air Force is investigating nearly half of the 200-airman force that commands the 150 nuclear-tipped Minuteman III missiles at Montana’s Malmstrom Air Force Base for allegedly cheating, or tolerating those who did, on their monthly proficiency tests. These tests, no surprise, are tougher than driver’s ed. A launch officer and instructor who left the Air Force in 2011 has provided questions representative of those he says he asked his airmen about the missiles they were monitoring. To help you understand their language, you need to know that each launch-control crew is in a numbered Launch Control Center. So Foxtrot LCC is F-01. And all of the missiles the Foxtrot crew controls are numbered, 2 through 11 (F-02, F-03, etc). Number 2 pencil at the ready? Start! 1) An EMT-team [an electromechanical maintenance team consisting of enlisted missile maintainers] has penetrated L03 and L05 to clean a clogged drain in the sump system after a big spring storm. It’s been 15 minutes since your last authentication with the team and you receive a seismic alarm at L04. After referencing LF [Launch Facility] Faults, what will you do? B) Contact FSC [flight security controller] and have him get two authentications from the security guards at L03? C) Contact L05 and get 2 authentications from the EMT Team? D) Contact MMOC [Missile Maintenance Operations Control]? 2) If an OSR [Operational Status Response] is not received from an LF within the previous _____ the LF will report LFDN [Launch Facility Down]. C) All of the above? D) None of the above? 3) A team is at F10 to do a MGS R&R [flight computer removal and replacement]. The FSC and you have received good authentications from the team and have passed both the launcher combinations. Thirty minutes later F10 reports MOSR X [Missile Operational Status Response X]. What is the first thing you do? B) Contact FSC and have him request authentications since the MOSR was unexpected? C) Contact Team Immediately over SIN [dedicated phone network at the LF]? D) Emergency Launch LF Evacuation? The time allotted for this test is over. Please put your pencils down. (To see if you’re ready for a career underground, check out the answer to Question 1 here, Question 2 here, and Question 3 here.) These are not simple questions. In fact, two of the tests, involving missiles and the codes that would be used to launch them, are open-book exams, according to former launch officers, also known as missileers. But having thousands of pages of technical orders on Air Force intercontinental ballistic missile ops isn’t a lot of help, unless you know where to look. The third test—emergency war orders—is closed-book, given in a classified classroom known as “the vault,” and is the toughest of the lot. Most of the tests are multiple-choice, with some fill-in-the-blanks thrown in. They range from 20 to 30 questions, and take about 90 minutes, according to former ICBMers (and no, a #2 pencil is not required). Scoring 100% on these tests has been the only way to earn promotions within the missile force, and possibly escape from it, ex-Air Force missileers say. Most who serve in the underground bunkers overseeing the nation’s fleet of 450 Minuteman III missiles did not volunteer for the assignment, and many want to leave. Air Force officials say that the missiles’ security has never been jeopardized, and that the tests are a minor element of crew training. Yet integrity is supposed to be non-negotiable in a force that boasts “perfection is the standard.” The problems with the ICBM force, military and outside experts say, stem from the Cold War’s end and the pressures of the nation’s post-9/11 conflicts. Those twin challenges have dulled the glory and pride once associated with the nuclear mission. “Many current senior Air Force leaders interviewed were cynical about the nuclear mission, its future, and its true (versus publicly stated) priority to the Air Force,” a 2012 Air Force report said. The pressure to cheat can be intense: Some tests were scored to two decimal places—99.44%, for example, like the purported purity of Ivory Soap. “The cheating is pervasive,” says a former Minuteman crew operator who left the service in 2010. “It’s pervasive because the leadership places so much emphasis on rote test scores to advance.” In the wake of the recent scandal at Malmstrom, airmen retook tests under intense scrutiny to ensure there was no cheating; the average test score was 95.5%. “So they’re not cheating to pass —they’re cheating to get 100s because so much emphasis is placed on test scores to advance,” this former missileer says. Most tests are taken by groups of 30 to 40 airmen at the missiles’ home base. Three tests monthly per person means 36 of these tests annually, plus additional inspections and alert drills. Like any group that works together under unrelenting pressure, there is an ethos to help your comrades, former missileers say. “They’re a team in the capsule, and the five capsules together are a team out at the squadron,” says the officer who left in 2010. “When faced with the need to score 100% to advance in the missile career field, well, guess what, they’re going to bind together and act as a unit to meet that challenge together.” Early test-takers would share the answers with those taking the tests later. “Answer keys” were drafted, listing the precise answers, or a simple count—”the test has four As [answers], six Bs, eight Cs and two Ds,” says the ex-Air Force officer who left in 2011. The missileers shared such “gouge” via paper—tucked into flight-suit pockets for surreptitious glances during the test—or via cell phones. Cheating was encouraged by higher-ups. “The commander would sit down with you and say, \`These tests are ridiculous—you can try to do it all by yourself, which is noble, but you’ll but you’ll never be promoted,'” says the missiler who left the service in 2011. “There was times I was saved from failing by cheating. The testing got so ridiculous that it was no longer testing your ability to be a missile operator—it was testing your ability to take tests.” The higher-ranking squadron and group commanders played along. “Some of the colonels were so lazy they’d call and tell me to fill in the answers for them,” the ex-missileer said of their quarterly recertification tests. “I very rarely saw the colonels take the test honestly.” A second former missileer agrees. “The higher-ups generally don’t hold squadron and group commanders responsible,” he says. “The system is so ingrained with this poisonous mentality that your generals and colonels—all those who have succeeded and been promoted in nukes—are the ones who have excelled in this environment, and so they perpetuate it.” Some senior officers figured out what was happening. “The colonels caught on that there was some kind of cheating going on, so we started getting multiple test versions,” says the officer who left in 2011. “They’d tell us: \`Don’t cheat off your neighbor—we have different tests.'” But the changes were relatively modest—mostly, questions were just moved around—and cheating persisted. The cheating could be deduced when higher headquarters would send in their own tests and test-givers, and more airmen would flunk. This led to disillusion. “You get into a situation where being a good officer and being a good missileer are mutually exclusive,” says Tim Cerniglia, who served on a MX Peacekeeper crew at F.E. Warren in 1997-99 and says he remains in touch with currently-serving ICBM operators. What’s worse than the emphasis on perfect scores is what it hides, the officer who left in 2010 says. “Many missileers were bad test takers and thought to be bad missileers, but they were the best,” he says. “These tests are supposed to determine whether you’re fit to be a leader, an instructor or an evaluator, but it has nothing to do with real leadership.” Part of the problem may be the shifting responsibility for the care and feeding of the ICBM force. Over the past two decades, the Air Force has moved command of the missiles around like an unwanted child. They bounced from Curtis LeMay’s Strategic Air Command, where they had been since becoming operational in 1959, to Air Combat Command in 1992. Then they moved to Space Command in 1993, and finally to Global Strike Command in 2009, created as a mini-SAC following earlier nuclear snafus involving misplaced nuclear weapons and components. As a result of those mishaps, the pace and difficulty of testing and inspections picked up. “The inspections are so frequent,” a 2011 Pentagon report noted, “that the unit has neither enough time nor resources to correct deficiencies.” The cheating is the latest in a string of embarrassing revelations concerning the nation’s nuclear forces. The Air Force is investigating three Minuteman airmen, two of whom also are under investigator for cheating, for suspected drug use. Missileers have repeatedly left their capsules’ blast doors open, violating regulations designed to prevent unauthorized entry. The service fired Major General Michael Carey—in charge of all the nation’s ICBMs—last October after an official trip to Moscow where he drank excessively and cavorted with “suspect” women. During an en route layover at a Swiss airport, witnesses told Pentagon investigators that Carey “appeared drunk and, in the public area, talked loudly about the importance of his position as commander of the only operational nuclear force in the world and that he saves the world from war every day.” The Navy revealed Feb. 4 that it is looking into allegations that enlisted sailors cheated on tests involving the nuclear reactors that power its submarines and aircraft carriers. Back in the missile fields, former officers say there needs to be a wholesale shakeup in how missile commanders are selected and promoted. “This pressure-cooker environment has just grown so unhealthy,” says the officer who left in 2010 and believes the nation needs to maintain its ICBM force. “Squadron commanders aren’t expected to lead—they expect their people to get 100% on every test and every evaluation, and they expect perfection, but they’re not expected to meet those standards themselves,” he says. “They’d rather sit in their office reading emails on their Blackberries than leading from the front.” It has become a self-perpetuating caste. “It’s command incest—you get a bad leader who finds a subordinate who’s just as bad as he is, and he promotes that subordinate, and on and on. It’s been going on for four decades now and so you mostly get a crop of leaders who are more interested in their careers than they are in actually leading,” he says. “Leadership is a human endeavor, and the Air Force takes the humanity out of it.” In a world of city-killing ICBMs, and the 1 billion spent annually operating them, it’s the little slights that send big signals to the nation’s ICBM crews. “They perceive a lack of knowledge of, and respect for, their mission from within the larger Air Force,” that 2011 Pentagon report said. Service-wide education, recruiting and PR “seem to ignore the ballistic missile mission.” Their commander wears only three stars—a lieutenant general—unlike the four-star generals who command other fighting units. “This is widely noted in the strategic operating forces,” the Defense Science Board study said. A final indignity: “As a missile crew watches the computer display for their mission briefing before starting each period of duty, they see the official classified Air Force screen saver which features a single weapons system—an F-22” fighter (which, like the ICBM force, has never seen combat). “I believe that we do in fact have some systemic problems in the force,” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said Wednesday. “The need for perfection has created a climate of what I think is undue stress and fear among the missileers about their futures.” Her service is pondering how to restore a sense of mission to missile duty, including bonuses, medals and patching the “leaking roofs” that she saw on her recent visits to the nation’s ICBM bases at Malmstrom, Minot, N.D., and F.E. Warren, Wyo. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told missileers at F.E. Warren on Jan. 9 that the Pentagon plans to develop a Minuteman replacement “to keep that deterrent stronger than it’s ever been.” He has ordered a pair of investigations into the missile force’s culture and management to see what changes are needed to restore its sense of duty and pride. Given the missiles’ Cold War bloodline, it comes as no surprise in a post-Cold War world that ICBM backers don’t see their arsenal as a relic. “I don’t think we’re any more a Cold War force than an aircraft carrier, or Special Ops, or the UH-1 helicopter,” Lieut. General James Kowalksi, then-chief of Air Force Global Strike Command, said in July. A Russian attack has become such a “remote” possibility that it’s “hardly worth discussing,” he added. “The greatest risk to my force is an accident. The greatest risk to my force is doing something stupid.” Kowalski became the No. 2 officer in U.S. Strategic Command in October, overseeing the nation’s entire nuclear arsenal. He took the post after President Obama fired Vice Admiral Tim Giardina for allegedly gambling in an Iowa casino with counterfeit chips. The charge—a felony—happened at Horseshoe Council Bluffs Casino, a 15-minute drive across the Missouri River from the nation’s nuclear headquarters.

Then I found out the company was funneling portions of its proceeds to fight gay rights. Now I'm back to eating chicken, and not chikin. This is the U. S. Constitution at work -- freedom of speech meets freedom of expression. Chicago's mayor Rahm Emanuel, Boston's Thomas Menino and a handful of other mayors threatening to ban Chick-fil-A because of anti-gay marriage remarks made by its president, Dan Cathy? Not so much. Rahm and","output":"Menino may have good intentions in standing up for the LGBTQ+ community, but the way they are going about it raises concerns regarding the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Let's think about the best way to approach this issue step by step: Step 1: Identify the problem The issue in question is the public statement made by Chick-fil-A's president, Dan Cathy, opposing same-sex marriage and the company's contributions to organizations that fight against gay rights. Step 2: Understand the U.S. Constitution The First Amendment states that the government shall not prohibit the free exercise of speech, religion, or assembly. While Dan Cathy's remarks and the company's actions may be controversial, they fall within their rights under the Constitution. Step 3: Analyze the impact of banning Chick-fil-A Banning the fast-food chain in certain cities can set a dangerous precedent, as it could be interpreted as the government influencing or controlling private companies based on their beliefs. This move could be seen as a violation of the First Amendment. Step 4: Consider alternative solutions Instead of banning Chick-fil-A, the mayors and other officials can support the LGBTQ+ community through policy, education, and events that foster inclusion and acceptance. They can also encourage community members to express their opinions and make informed decisions about where they choose to eat. Step 5: Communicate and engage with the public To address the issue effectively, the mayors and other officials should engage in open dialogue with both Chick-fil-A representatives and the LGBTQ+ community. This can help to create a better understanding of each party's beliefs and possibly lead to a respectful, productive discussion. In conclusion, while standing up for the LGBTQ+ community is essential, banning Chick-fil-A due to the remarks made by its president and the company's financial support of anti-gay rights organizations might not be the best approach. It is important for public officials to respect the First Amendment, explore alternative solutions, and encourage communication between all parties involved."},{"instruction":"Question 1: What are the best online sites to learn computer programming?

Born in Prague, Czech Republic (then part of the Austro Hungarian empire) Friml showed aptitude for music at an early age. He entered the Prague Conservatory in 1895, where he studied the piano and composition with Antonin Dvorak. Friml was expelled from the conservatory in 1901 for performing without permission. One of the most popular theatrical forms in the early decades of the 20th century in America was the operetta, and its most famous composer was Irish-born Victor Herbert. It was announced in 1912 that operetta diva Emma Trentini would be starring in a new operetta on Broadway by Herbert with lyricist Otto Harbach entitled The Firefly. Shortly before the writing of the operetta, Trentini appeared in a special performance of Herbert's Naughty Marietta conducted by Herbert himself. When Trentini refused to sing \\"Italian Street Song\\" for the encore, an enraged Herbert stormed out of the orchestra pit refusing any further work with Trentini. Arthur Hammerstein, the operetta's sponsor, frantically began to search for another composer. Not finding any other theatre composer who could compose as well as Herbert, Hammerstein settled on the almost unknown Friml because of his classical training. After a month of work, Friml produced the score for what would be his first theatrical success. After tryouts in Syracuse, New York, The Firefly opened at the Lyric Theatre on December 2, 1912 to a warm reception by both the audience and the critics. The production moved to the Casino Theatre after Christmas, where it ran until March 15, 1913, for a total of 120 performances. After The Firefly, Friml produced three more operettas that each had longer runs than The Firefly, although they are not as enduringly successful. These were High Jinks (1913), Katinka (1915) and You're in Love (1917). He also contributed songs to a musical in 1915 entitled The Peasant Girl. Trentini was named as a co-respondent in Friml's divorce from his first wife in 1915, and evidence was introduced that they were having an affair.

What is the answer?","output":"Step 1: Identify the question The question asks to find a multi-billion cholesterol controlling drug, with a name derived from Greek that means 'causing to stand,' and is associated with the mentioned brand names: Pravachol, Lipitor, Mevacor, Altocor, and Zocor. Step 2: Research the brand names These brands are associated with a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins. To find the drug, research the individual brand names and determine the commonality between them. - Pravachol (pravastatin) - Lipitor (atorvastatin) - Mevacor (lovastatin) - Altocor (lovastatin, extended-release) - Zocor (simvastatin) Step 3: Identify the commonality We can see that all of these brand names contain the suffix '-statin,' which signifies that they are part of the statin class of drugs. This class of drugs is used to lower cholesterol levels. Step 4: Find the Greek origin of the word The term 'statin' originates from the Greek word 'stasis' which can be translated to 'causing to stand' (literally, \\"a standing still\\" in Ancient Greek). Answer: The answer is 'statin,' which is a multi-billion cholesterol controlling drug class with a name derived from the Greek meaning 'causing to stand,' and associated with the mentioned brand names."},{"instruction":"Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket. According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \\"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\\". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative. While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy. The so-called \\"Alexander Sarcophagus\\", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331. However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.

The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

It is also one of those countries which have many traditions which modern times fortunately have not affected. Thailand is famous for its unique culture. It is well worth noting that Thai culture handed down from one generation to the next. Thai Classical Dance The inspiring culture includes local music and wonderful Thai dances. The dances of course have something to do with its deep rooted Buddhist religion, fighting arts and beautiful clothing. Thai classical dance performances are generally performed by gracious Thai ladies wearing beautiful Thai local costumes. Most resort areas and many hotels frequently offer these Thai culture dance shows for foreign visitors. Thai Greeting The Thai unique gesture of greeting another person, the wai, is especially one of the great aspects of Thai culture. The wai is when a person joins both hands to either head or chest level while bending their head slightly towards their hands. This way of greeting is especially done when a younger person greets an older person and it indicates a sign of respect to their elders. Employees would also wai their managers even if the manager would be younger than themselves. Bangkok Bangkok is the culture center of Thailand and has been the Thai capital since the end of the eighteenth century. Observing Thai culture in Bangkok can be great experience as the combination of modern times and traditions have created a kind of unique atmosphere.

But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Nonetheless, elephant shrews are not classified with the superficially similar true shrews, but are instead more closely related to elephants and their kin within the newly recognized Afrotheria; the biologist Jonathan Kingdon has proposed they instead be called sengis (singular \\"sengi\\"), a term derived from the Bantu languages of Africa. - Eutheria (from Greek -, eu- \\"true/good\\" and , thríon \\"beast\\" hence \\"true beasts\\") is one of two mammalian clades with extant members that diverged in the Early Cretaceous or perhaps the Late Jurassic. Except for the Virginia opossum, from North America, which is a metatherian, all post-Miocene mammals indigenous to Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America north of Mexico are eutherians. Extant eutherians, their last common ancestor, and all extinct descendants of that ancestor are members of Placentalia. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - In terrestrial zoology, megafauna (Ancient Greek \\"mégalo\\" \\"large\\" + New Latin \\"fauna\\" \\"animal\\") are large or giant animals. The most common thresholds used are weight over , over , or over a metric ton . This includes many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such as white-tailed deer, red kangaroo, and humans. - Ground sloths are a diverse group of extinct sloths, in the mammalian superorder Xenarthra. The term \\"ground sloth\\" is used as a reference for all extinct sloths because of the large size of the earliest forms discovered, as opposed to the extant \\"tree sloths.\\" However, this is a historical convention and should not imply that all extinct sloths were strictly terrestrial in nature. Their most recent survivors lived in the Antilles, where it has been proposed they may have survived until 1550 BCE; however, radiocarbon dating suggests an age of between 2819 and 2660 BCE for the last known occurrence of \\"Megalocnus\\" in Cuba. Ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of North and South America for 10,000 years or more. Their later survival in the Caribbean correlates with the later colonization of this area by humans. Some insular sloth populations persisted 5,0006,000 years longer than their continental mainland relatives, in congruence with the global pattern of late Quaternary large vertebrate extinction due to human dispersal. - Placentalia (\\"Placentals\\") is one of the three extant subdivisions of the class of animals Mammalia; the other two are Monotremata and Marsupialia. The placentals are primarily distinguished from other mammals in that the fetus is carried in the uterus of its mother where it is nourished via a placenta, until the live birth of a fully developed offspring occurs. - Sloths are mammals classified in the families Megalonychidae (two-toed sloths) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloths), including six extant species. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem slow and lazy at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptations for conserving energy. Aside from their surprising speed during emergency flights from predators, other notable traits of sloths include their strong body and their ability to host symbiotic algae on their furs. - The superorder Xenarthra is a group of placental mammals, extant today only in the Americas and represented by anteaters, tree sloths, and armadillos. The origins of the order can be traced as far back as the Paleocene, as early as 59 million years ago in South America. Xenarthrans developed and diversified extensively in South America during its long period of isolation in the early to mid Cenozoic Era. They had invaded the Antilles by the early Miocene and, starting about 9 Mya, spread to Central and North America as part of the Great American Interchange. Nearly all of the formerly abundant megafaunal xenarthrans, such as ground sloths, glyptodonts, and pampatheres, became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Metatheria is a mammalian clade that includes all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals (such as sparassodontans). First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880, it is a slightly more inclusive group than the marsupials; it contains all of the living mammals with abdominal pouches (most female marsupials) as well as their more primitive ancestors and relatives. Metatherians are one of three main classes of extant mammals: monotremes (egg laying mammals like the platypus and the echidna), metatheria (or marsupials, which includes the three American orders (Didelphimorphia, Paucituberculata and Microbiotheria) and the four Australasian orders (Notoryctemorphia, Dasyuromorphia, Peramelemorphia and Diprotodontia)), and the eutherians (or placental mammals) consisting of twenty-one orders, divided into four superorders. Metatherians belong to a subgroup of the northern tribosphenic mammal clade or Boreosphenida. They differ from all other mammals in certain morphologies like their dental formula, which includes about five upper and four lower incisors, a canine, three premolars, and four molars. Other morphologies include skeletal and anterior dentition, such as wrist and ankle apomorphies; all metatherians share derived pedal characters and calcaneal features. - The aardvark (; \\"Orycteropus afer\\") is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa. It is the only living species of the order Tubulidentata, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. Unlike other insectivores, it has a long pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. It receives a \\"least concern\\" rating from the IUCN, although its numbers seem to be decreasing. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\". - In common cladistic usage, a monophyletic group is a taxon (group of organisms) which forms a clade, meaning that it consists of an ancestral species and all its descendants. The term is synonymous with the uncommon term holophyly. Monophyletic groups are typically characterized by shared derived characteristics (synapomorphies). - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - Anteater is a common name for the four extant mammal species of the suborder Vermilingua (meaning \\"worm tongue\\") commonly known for eating ants and termites. The individual species have other names in English and other languages. Together with the sloths, they are within the order Pilosa. The name \\"anteater\\" is also colloquially applied to the unrelated aardvark, numbat, echidnas, pangolins and some members of the Oecobiidae. - Euarchontoglires (synonymous with Supraprimates) is a clade and a superorder of mammals, the living members of which belong to one of the five following groups: rodents, lagomorphs, treeshrews, colugos and primates. - Golden moles are small, insectivorous burrowing mammals endemic to Southern Africa, where their Afrikaans names are gouemolle or kruipmolle (singular \\"gouemol\\" or \\"kruipmol\\"). They comprise the family Chrysochloridae and as such they are taxonomically distinct from the true moles, family Talpidae, and other mole-like families, all of which, to various degrees, they resemble as a result of convergence. - Afrotheria is a clade of mammals, the living members of which belong to groups that are either currently living in Africa or of African origin: golden moles, elephant shrews (also known as sengis), tenrecs, aardvarks, hyraxes, elephants, sea cows, and several extinct clades. They share few anatomical features but many are partly or entirely African in their distribution. This probably reflects the fact that Africa was an island continent through the early Cenozoic. Because the continent was isolated by water, Laurasian groups such as insectivores, rabbits, carnivorans and ungulates could not become established. Instead, the niches occupied by those groups were filled by tenrecs, hyraxes and elephants that evolved from the ancestral afrothere. This adaptive radiation may have occurred in response to the CretaceousPaleogene mass extinction. - A tenrec is any species of mammal within the family Tenrecidae, found on Madagascar and in parts of the African mainland. Tenrecs are widely diverse; as a result of convergent evolution they resemble hedgehogs, shrews, opossums, mice and even otters. They occupy aquatic, arboreal, terrestrial and fossorial environments. Some of these species, including the greater hedgehog tenrec, can be found in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests. - Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") and the Asian elephant (\\"Elephas maximus\\"), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (\\"L. africana\\" and \\"L. cyclotis\\" respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of and weigh . All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Laurasiatheria is a superorder of placental mammals that originated on the northern supercontinent of Laurasia 99 million years ago. The superorder includes shrews, pangolins, bats, whales, carnivorans, odd-toed and even-toed ungulates, among others. - Ungulates (pronounced ) are any members of a diverse group of primarily large mammals that includes odd-toed ungulates such as horses and rhinoceroses, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, deer, and hippopotami. Most terrestrial ungulates use the tips of their toes, usually hoofed, to sustain their whole body weight while moving. The term means, roughly, \\"being hoofed\\" or \\"hoofed animal\\". As a descriptive term, \\"ungulate\\" normally excludes cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), as they do not possess most of the typical morphological characteristics of ungulates, but recent discoveries indicate that they are descended from early artiodactyls. Ungulates are typically herbivorous (though some species are omnivorous, such as pigs), and many employ specialized gut bacteria to allow them to digest cellulose, as in the case of ruminants. They inhabit a wide range of habitats, from jungles, plains and rivers. - Atlantogenata is a proposed clade of mammals containing the cohorts or superorders Afrotheria and Xenarthra . These groups originated and radiated in the South American and African continents , presumably in the Cretaceous . Together with Boreoeutheria , they make up Eutheria . The monophyly of this grouping was supported by some genetic evidence . Alternative hypotheses are that Boreoeutheria and Afrotheria combine to form Epitheria ( as generally supported by anatomical and other physiological evidence ) or that Boreoeutheria and Xenarthra combine to form Exafroplacentalia or Notolegia . Updated analysis of transposable element insertions around the time of divergence strongly supports the fourth hypothesis of a near - concomitant origin ( trifurcation ) of the three superorders of mammals . - Armadillos are New World placental mammals with a leathery armour shell. The Chlamyphoridae and Dasypodidae are the only surviving families in the order Cingulata, part of the superorder Xenarthra, along with the anteaters and sloths. The word \\"armadillo\\" means \\"little armoured one\\" in Spanish. The Aztecs called them \\"ytchtli\\" , Nahuatl for \\"turtle-rabbit\\": \\"ytl\\" (turtle) and \\"tchtli\\" (rabbit). The Portuguese word for \\"armadillo\\" is \\"tatu\\" which derives from the Tupi language. Similar names are also found in other, especially European, languages. - Boreoeutheria (synonymous with Boreotheria) (Greek: \\"north\\" + \\"good\\" + \\"beast\\") is a clade (magnorder) of placental mammals that is composed of the sister taxa Laurasiatheria (most hoofed mammals, most pawed carnivores, and several other groups) and Euarchontoglires (Supraprimates). It is now well supported by DNA sequence analyses, as well as retrotransposon presence or absence data. - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping. - Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. Flint (a type of chert unique to chalk) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint). What is the relationship between 'atlantogenata' and 'magnorder'? A:","output":"Atlantogenata is a proposed clade of mammals that is considered to be a magnorder. A magnorder is a taxonomic rank above the order level, grouping together related orders of organisms. In the case of Atlantogenata, this magnorder includes the cohorts or superorders Afrotheria and Xenarthra, both of which originated and radiated in the South American and African continents."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following article and select the best answer.

Article: Growing mushrooms is probably the easiest thing you can do even if you are new to mushroom growing. It is becoming more common because restaurants are starting to create more dishes that include mushrooms. Mushroom growing is easy. To start, you need to have a space where you are going to grow these mushrooms. It does not have to be a huge space but just enough for you to grow as many mushrooms as you need. When you have found the space perfect for you, you can start researching what kind of mushrooms you want to grow. There are a lot of mushrooms to choose from and not all of them are suitable to eat. When you decide what kind of mushrooms you want to grow, you can start getting ready to plant the mushrooms. Sometimes you may want to hire some workers to help if you have a large mushroom farm, or if you are trying to start a professional mushroom growing business. Trying to have a business by yourself can be stressful. If you don't have enough time to spend taking care of everything yourself, dome helpers may be the best choice. After you have started the mushroom growing, you should regularly check that your mushrooms grow properly and that they are not being attacked by any pesticides or any other animals or something that could be dangerous to them. That is the worst part of mushroom developing. Protect your mushroom farm well with a fence or a gate so that only you and your workers can get in and out.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"If the premise is true (He will also visit Omagh), it implies that he will indeed be visiting Omagh at some point. However, the hypothesis (He will visit Omagh on Tuesday) provides a specific day on which he will visit Omagh. To determine whether the hypothesis is true, given the premise, we need to evaluate if there is sufficient evidence or information to support that he will visit Omagh on Tuesday. The premise only tells us that he will visit Omagh, but it does not provide any information regarding the day of the visit. As such, we cannot guarantee that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true as well. One possible way to ascertain the validity of the hypothesis is to gather additional information or evidence that might support or contradict the assertion that he will be visiting Omagh on Tuesday. This could include statements like: 1. He has a scheduled appointment in Omagh on Tuesday. 2. He mentioned that he would visit Omagh on his next trip, and his next trip is on Tuesday. If we have information that supports the hypothesis and no evidence contradicting it, then we can conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is likely true as well.

To provide a comprehensive response, it's important to note that this conclusion, while highly likely, is not always directly related to the suitability of a place for various outdoor activities like hiking, mountain-climbing or skiing. Let’s explore this further: 1. Favorable Topography: The fact that Courmayeur is a preferred base for both hiking and mountain climbing in summer, and for skiing in the winter, suggests that its topography and geographic features are varied and likely to be visually striking. Mountains, valleys, and slopes – which are necessary for these activities – usually create picturesque vistas, suggesting that the region probably offers beautiful views. 2. Unique Landscape in Each Season: The dual mention of summer and winter activities could suggest the presence of a diverse landscape throughout the year. In summer, hikers and climbers enjoy verdant valleys, blooming alpine meadows, and clear, sunny skies. In winter, skiers relish snow-blanketed slopes and frost-laden trees, creating a different kind of scenic beauty. So, irrespective of the season, the possibility of breathtaking views is high. 3. The Power of Assumption: Your conclusion assumes that suitability for outdoor activities equates to beautiful views. This is often, but not always, accurate. Some hiking trails may be challenging and thrilling, but they might traverse dense woodland with limited panoramic views, for example. Thus, while it's highly likely that the Aosta Valley's suitability for numerous outdoor activities indicates stunning scenery, it’s not a guaranteed result every time. 4. Known Beauty of Courmayeur: The Courmayeur region of the Aosta Valley, located in the Italian Alps, is renowned for its natural beauty. It is nestled at the base of Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in the Alps and the European Union, which delivers extraordinary panoramas. The region is also dotted with mythical alpine meadows, glaciers, and charming villages, heightening its visual appeal. 5. Testimonials and Reviews: To reinforce your conclusion, you could also rely on testimonials or reviews from individuals who have partaken in these activities at Courmayeur. User-generated content on travelers’ forums, blogs, and travel booking sites can often provide realistic insights into the scenery that one can expect while hiking or performing other activities there. So, in conclusion, while your assertion that \\"The hiking here has a beautiful view.\\" is quite likely to be correct given the data points provided and the generally acknowledged beauty of the region, it is not an irrefutable truth just based on Courmayeur's suitability for a variety of outdoor activities. It would help to verify this assumption with more explicit descriptions of the region's visual appeal or user experiences."},{"instruction":"Pick from: (i). Yes; (ii).

She has finished hanging streamers and now she has to fill the balloons. Having never used a helium tank before, she wants to test how much to fill each balloon. But I can use this background: All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire. What is an answer for this question: If one balloon is full and another is only half full does the full balloon have a higher or lower pressure? The answer to this question is:","output":"The full balloon has a higher pressure. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. When filling a balloon with a fluid (like helium or air), the fluid particles are moving and bumping into each other and the walls of the balloon, which causes pressure. 2. The pressure inside a balloon is a result of the amount of fluid particles contained within the enclosed space of the balloon and their movement. 3. If one balloon is full and another is only half full, that means the full balloon has more fluid particles within its enclosed space. 4. As a result, the full balloon will experience more collisions between the fluid particles and the walls of the balloon, leading to a higher pressure inside the full balloon."},{"instruction":"Q:Q: Sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels are what kind of organs? Choices: - animal - reproductive - marine - floral A: A:","output":"Sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels are floral organs. These organs are part of the reproductive structure of flowering plants, also known as angiosperms. Each of these organs plays a specific role in the reproductive process of the plant: 1. Sepals: Sepals are the outermost layer of protective structures surrounding the reproductive parts of a flower. They are usually green and leaf-like in appearance, serving as a barrier to protect the delicate floral organs inside. In some plants, sepals may also be brightly colored and resemble petals, aiding in the attraction of pollinators. 2. Petals: Petals are the colorful, showy structures of a flower that function to attract pollinators. Their brightly colored appearance and scent serve to catch the attention of insects, birds, and other animals that aid in pollination. Petals may also work as a landing platform for pollinators to facilitate the transfer of pollen from one flower to another. 3. Stamens: Stamens are the male reproductive structures of a flower, responsible for producing pollen. Each stamen consists of a filament (stalk) and an anther (pollen-bearing structure). The anther contains microsporangia, which generate pollen grains through the process of meiosis. Once mature, the pollen grains are released into the environment, where they go on to fertilize the female reproductive structures (carpels) of compatible flowers. 4. Carpels: Carpels are the female reproductive structures of a flower, responsible for producing ovules that develop into seeds upon fertilization. Each carpel is made up of an ovary (which contains the ovules), a style (elongated structure that connects the ovary and stigma), and a stigma (the receptive surface for pollen). When a pollen grain lands on the stigma, it germinates and forms a pollen tube that grows through the style to reach the ovules, allowing fertilization to occur. Floral organs are not found in animal or marine life forms, and therefore cannot be categorized under animal or marine organs. It is important to note that while sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels are crucial to the reproductive process in flowering plants, these organs cannot function independently of the flower and exist solely to support the plant's reproduction."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A young boy in a striped shirt is playing in a outside on a porch.\\", is the sentence \\"A young boy is inside playing freeze tag\\" a true sentence?

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: First Daughter Context: A domestic terrorist group make an unsuccessful attempt on the life of US President Jonathan Hayes (Harrison) and the group's leader, Michael Smith (David Wheeler), is subsequently captured. Some members of the group manage to evade capture and continue with terrorist activities. Eight weeks later, believing the threat is past, the President organizes an outdoors activity trip for his teenage daughter, Jess (Monica Keena), who has grown tired of the public life and constant Secret Service supervision. Jess, excited about the trip, is disappointed to learn a Secret Service agent she dislikes, Alex McGregor (Mariel Hemingway), will be accompanying her, despising her over a misunderstanding embrace between her father and Alex. Jess goes so far as to spread rumours about Alex during the trip, leaving an air of animosity between the two of them. Unbeknownst to the hikers, during their trip they are seen by members of the domestic terrorist group who have been hiding out in the same woods to evade capture. The terrorists initially believe they are witnessing a normal group of hikers, but soon notice bodyguards with guns. Eventually, one of the group recognises Jess, and identifies her as the daughter of President Hayes. They quickly form a plan to kidnap Jess in order to negotiate the release of Smith. They ambush the hikers, kill one of the bodyguards, and kidnap Jess. With the help of one of the river guides, Grant Coleman (Savant), Alex searches for Jess and attempts a daring rescue. The answer is:","output":"During the daring rescue attempt, it was Alex McGregor (Mariel Hemingway) who stopped the bullet that would have taken Alex's life. As a Secret Service agent, Alex was highly trained in protecting the people under her charge, in this case, President's teenage daughter, Jess. When the terrorist group targeted Jess to kidnap her in exchange for the release of their leader, Michael Smith, Alex used her skills and determination to save Jess from their clutches. As the movie unfolds, there is a tense moment when a terrorist fires a bullet aimed directly at Alex, which could have taken her life. However, Alex's quick reflexes and sharp instincts allow her to dodge the bullet just in time to avoid being hit. This showcases her extraordinary skills as a Secret Service agent and her relentless commitment to ensuring the safety of those she is assigned to protect. The turning point in the movie is when Alex manages to save Jess from the terrorists and thwarts their plans, thus securing the President's daughter's safety. As a result, the mutual animosity between Alex and Jess, which existed for most of the film, gradually transforms into a newfound respect and understanding for one another. In summary, it was Alex McGregor's exceptional abilities and dedication as a Secret Service agent that stopped the bullet that would have taken her life, ultimately allowing her to save Jess and foil the domestic terrorist group's plan to use her as leverage for their leader's release."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption IS footage purportedly shows a bulldozer merging the areas it has seized, as Frank Gardner reports Jihadist militant group Isis has said it is establishing a caliphate, or Islamic state, on the territories it controls in Iraq and Syria. It also proclaimed the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as caliph and \\"leader for Muslims everywhere\\". Setting up a state governed under strict Islamic law has long been a goal of many jihadists. Meanwhile, Iraq's army continued an offensive to retake the northern city of Tikrit from the Isis-led rebels. The city was seized by the insurgents on 11 June as they swept across large parts of north-western Iraq. In a separate development, Israel called for the creation of an independent Kurdish state in response to the gain made by the Sunni rebels in Iraq. Allegiance demand The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) announced the establishment of the caliphate in an audio recording posted on the internet on Sunday. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amateur footage captured gunfire and car horns being sounded in Raqqa, the stronghold of Isis in Syria, after the announcement was made on Sunday Image copyright Reuters Image caption Isis militants said they would now want to be known as \\"the Islamic State\\" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Kurdish troops clashed with Isis in Jalawla, in Iraq's northern province of Diyala Isis also said that from now on it would be known simply as \\"the Islamic State\\". The BBC's Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, says the declaration harks back to the rise of Islam, when the Prophet Muhammad's followers conquered vast territories in the Middle Ages. The Sunni-Shia split has its origins in a dispute over the succession to Muhammad. Analysis: The BBC's Paul Adams in Baghdad It's easy to dismiss the latest crop of Isis videos and statements as mere propaganda (however well produced), but the announcement of the establishment of a caliphate is rich with religious, cultural and historic significance. Generations of Sunni radicals have dreamt of a moment when, in the words of Isis spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, Muslims \\"shake off the dust of humiliation and disgrace\\" and a new caliphate rises out of the chaos, confusion and despair of the modern Middle East. Many Sunnis, and all Shia, will recoil in horror from the barbarism that has accompanied this moment, but the sight of old colonial-era boundaries being erased is a powerful statement, designed to attract new recruits to this whirlwind jihad. In one of the Isis videos uploaded on Sunday, a bearded fighter called Abu Safiyya guides the viewer around a newly demolished border post. The video, with its arresting imagery and impressive production values, is designed to electrify the group's followers. The fact that Abu Safiyya is described as being from Chile merely adds to what the authors hope is now the organisation's global appeal. Isis said the Islamic state would extend from Aleppo in northern Syria to Diyala province in eastern Iraq. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group said, would become the leader of the state and would be known as \\"Caliph Ibrahim\\". In the recording, the rebels also demanded that all Muslims \\"pledge allegiance\\" to the new ruler and \\"reject democracy and other garbage from the West\\". What is a caliphate? An Islamic state ruled by a single political and religious leader, or Caliph Caliphs are regarded by their followers as successors to the Prophet Muhammad and the leader of all Muslims First caliphate came into being after Muhammad's death in 632 In the centuries which followed, caliphates had dominion in the Middle East and North Africa The last widely accepted caliphate was abolished in 1924 by Turkish leader Kemal Ataturk after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire The Ahmadiyya sect of Islam has recognised a caliphate for the last century, but it is only this group that does so On Sunday, Iraqi government jets struck at rebel positions and clashes broke out in various parts of Tikrit, witnesses and officials said. \\"The security forces are advancing from different areas\\", Lt-Gen Qassem Atta told journalists. \\"There are ongoing clashes.\\" Troops had reportedly pulled back to the nearby town of Dijla as Saturday's initial offensive met stiff resistance.

The Kurds have long striven for an independent state but they remain divided between Syria and Turkey, Iran and Iraq. The international community, including neighbouring Turkey and the US, remains opposed to the breakup of Iraq. ||||| BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian activists say heavy clashes are underway between several rebel factions and an al-Qaida breakaway group over control of a border crossing with Iraq. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says Monday's fighting between rebel groups and rivals in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is concentrated in the town of Boukamal on the border between Syria and Iraq. The jihadist group, which on Sunday declared the establishment of an Islamic caliphate, controls much of northeastern Syria. In Iraq, it has recently captured cities and towns as well as border crossings, effectively erasing the frontier. The group says its Islamic state stretches from northern Syria to the Iraqi province of Diyala northeast of Baghdad, and has called on all Muslims worldwide to pledge allegiance to it. |||||","output":"The jihadist militant group ISIS announced that it was establishing a caliphate, or Islamic state, on the territories it controlled in Iraq and Syria in June 2014. They also proclaimed the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as the caliph and \\"leader for Muslims everywhere.\\" This move was aimed at setting up a state governed strictly under Islamic law, fulfilling a long-standing goal for many jihadists in the region. As the ISIS-led rebels reportedly seized control of a large part of north-western Iraq, clashing with Kurdish troops and skirmishing with the Iraqi army, the international community also expressed concern. Israel called for the creation of an independent Kurdish state in response to the advances made by Sunni rebels in Iraq. The desire for an independent Kurdish state has existed for some time, but integral divisions within the region have consistently hindered efforts to make it a reality. The declaration of a caliphate was of enormous religious, cultural, and historical significance given the associated links with the rise of Islam. In this context, the struggle for power between Sunni radicals and Shia factions echoed the Sunni-Shia split which originated in a dispute over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad. Thus, the ISIS caliphate sought to create a new Islamic state based on its own interpretation of Islam. However, its harsh methods and brutal tactics drew reactions of horror and rejection from a majority of both Sunnis and Shias. Baghdadi's declaration of the new Islamic state had many consequences for the region. The move effectively erased the borders of Syria and Iraq, heightening fears of regional instability. As violence erupted, numerous Syrian and Iraqi civilians were forced into refugee camps, further escalating the humanitarian crisis in the region. Despite the tensions and challenges posed by the new caliphate, the international community, including the United States and neighboring Turkey, remained opposed to the breakup of Iraq."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you're given four sentences of a story written in natural language, and one last sentence (Sentence5).

When we were kids, we dreaded accompanying her to Wal-Mart, or worse, the Cosco at the edge of town, where the echoing rafters and limitless aisles seemed to mock the confusion into which we were inevitably thrown when handed torn-off fragments of the list. Of course, it was easy enough to see in hindsight that \\"2dozjumHerbal Essences\\" was merely the bastard child of two drunkenly weaving columns--we had been supposed to get two dozen jumbo eggs and a bottle of my mother's favourite brand of shampoo (ever inventive in creating proprietary abbreviations--\\"TC\\" standing for, what else, thin crust pizza--my mother scrupulously wrote out brand names in full).

Article: Anna Riviere was one of the most admired of 19th-century English sopranos . She was also one of the most adventuresome. She was born in London on January 9th, 1810. She entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of 14. Seven years later, just after her first show, Anna married Sir Henry Bishop, who was 24 years her senior. Her reputation as a singer grew rapidly, based largely on her tours with Sir Henry and harpist Nicholas Bochsa. After a tour of Dublin, Edinburgh, and London, Anna Bishop deserted her husband and three children and ran away with Bochsa. From then on, Madame Bishop--as she continued to be known--traveled and sang as if her life depended on it. Between 1839 and 1843 she traveled to every major town in Europe, where she sang in 260 concerts. In the course of two years in Naples, she performed in 20 operas. In 1855 she and Bochsa sailed for Sydney, Australia. He died there the following year, and Anna went on to tour South America before returning to New York, where she married a diamond merchant. Then she began what proved her most dangerous adventure. After another American tour in 1866, she and her husband set sail across the Pacific. They were shipwrecked on a small coral reef, and for more than a month they drifted in a small boat before they finally reaching Guam. She had lost her music, her wardrobe, and her jewelry, but Madame Bishop was not to be stopped. She went on to Manila and began a concert tour that led to Hong Kong, Singapore, and India before she went back to England. After another two-year world tour she returned eventually to New York, where she gave her last public performance in 1883--at age 73. Meanwhile the husband she left behind, Sir Henry, had become famous for writing the music to lyrics that might eventually have been meaningful to Anna Bishop--\\"Home, Sweet Home.\\" Question: The best title for this passage is _ .

This will help you determine whether the turkey is cooked thoroughly and is safe to consume. Here's a step-by-step guide on where to put the thermometer in a turkey: Step 1: Identify the thickest parts of the turkey To get the most accurate temperature reading, you should insert the thermometer in the thickest parts of the turkey. These areas usually take the longest time to cook and reach the desired internal temperature. The thickest sections are typically the breast and the thigh. Step 2: Avoid touching the bone When taking the temperature of the turkey, it's essential to avoid placing the thermometer directly onto or against a bone. Bones heat up faster than the surrounding meat, which could lead to a false reading and an undercooked turkey. Step 3: Insert the thermometer in the breast To measure the temperature of the turkey's breast, follow these steps: 1. Position the turkey with the breast-side facing upwards. 2. Hold the thermometer so that the tip is at a slight angle, enabling it to pierce the thick part of the turkey breast without hitting the bone. 3. Insert the thermometer into the meat slowly, about 2 inches deep, until it reaches the thickest part. Ensure that the probe is fully submerged in the meat, without touching the bone or the bottom of the tray. Step 4: Insert the thermometer in the thigh To measure the temperature of the turkey thigh, follow these steps: 1. Locate the thigh by identifying the area where the leg connects to the body. 2. Hold the thermometer so that the tip is at a slight angle, enabling it to pierce the thick part of the thigh without hitting the bone. 3. Slowly insert the thermometer into the center of the thigh, about 2 inches deep, ensuring that the probe is fully submerged in the meat and not touching the bone or the bottom of the tray. Step 5: Obtain an accurate temperature reading Once you've correctly positioned the thermometer, wait for the temperature reading to stabilize. The recommended internal temperature for cooked turkey is 165°F (74°C). Make sure to check the temperature in both the breast and thigh to confirm that the entire turkey has reached this temperature. In conclusion, to ensure that your turkey is cooked to perfection and safe to eat, it is essential to use a meat thermometer and place it in the thickest areas of the breast and thigh. Make sure you avoid touching any bones, as they conduct heat more quickly than the meat itself, which could lead to a false reading. By following these steps, you'll enjoy a juicy, tender, and perfectly cooked turkey."},{"instruction":"one of the gershwin's greatest hits was his composition for piano and orchestra known as??","output":"Step 1: Identify the question The user is asking for the title of one of George Gershwin's greatest hits, specifically a composition for piano and orchestra.

Where might she be? Options: - street - in the usa - texas - every city - countryside Explain why a human would choose \\"texas\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human might choose \\"Texas\\" as the answer for a few reasons, each tied to the specific clues given in the scenario described in the input. And I am going to explain it elaborately to give a clear insight. First, let's contextualize the situation. Lisa is driving along a highway and sees a billboard informing her of proximity to a border. Therefore, we can deduce that she is in an area where states or regions distinguish their borders or are distinguished by a natural structure like a river or a mountain chain that can figuratively be referred to as a border. This let’s cross out the possibilities 'every city' and 'street' that are too vague and don’t particularly hint at any close proximity to a state or country border. Moving onto the next option: 'in the USA.' While this is a potential answer because the USA does have internal state borders and external country borders, it's a bit pinpointing a precise location within the country. Considering the USA’s vast expanse, it would be hard to determine which specific border Lisa could be nearing. Same goes for 'countryside.' While there's a reasonable chance that a highway passing through the countryside could be near a border, it isn't specific enough. Countryside areas exist in every state and country, so choosing such an option doesn't provide any genuinely definitive answer to the question. Finally, let us consider 'Texas.' Texas is a geographically significant state in the USA. Texas borders not only four other U.S. states (New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana), but also the country of Mexico to the south. Thus, a high concentration of highways in Texas would naturally lead to various state or country borders. The existence of billboards to notify drivers of their close proximity to a border is a plausible scenario in Texas due to its location, increasing the relevance of this option.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The controllers are available for PXI and PXI-Express systems. Here is an elaborated and detailed response: The statement informs us that controllers designed for compatibility with multi-purpose electronic systems can be obtained. These systems go by the name of \\"PXI\\" and \\"PXI-Express.\\" PXI is an abbreviated form, denoting \\"PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation.\\" It is an open, multi-vendor standard that defines a modular platform primarily used for test, measurement, and control applications. Although based on the older PCI standard, PXI is designed to be more robust, improving synchronization and signal quality, rendering it ideal for these purposes. Now, let us consider the updated counterpart, \\"PXI-Express.\\" As the name suggests, this second system is an adaptation of the more recent PCI Express standard. The advantage of PXI-Express over PXI is a substantial bandwidth improvement, as well as more streamlined communication among modules. This results in reduced latency and faster performance, making PXI-Express better suited for more demanding tasks and applications. Essentially, the translation highlights the availability of controllers for two different yet related modular platforms used in test, measurement, and control systems. By incorporating these controllers, the efficiency and functionality of the platforms can be effectively harnessed in various applications."},{"instruction":"Sentence: name = The Vaults, eatType = restaurant, food = Chinese, priceRange = moderate, familyFriendly = no Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","output":"Sure, buddy!

Area schools opened for the first time since the middle of last week, although school buses were kept off roads because of the heavy police activity. There was increased security throughout the Pocono Mountain School District, and students would remain indoors, according to the district website. \\"This is an extremely difficult situation for our community,\\" the school district website said in announcing schools reopened Tuesday. \\"Schools will be in session but, ultimately it is your decision as parents whether to send your children to school. The District will respect your decision and all absences will be excused and will not impact a student's perfect attendance.\\" For the moment, the reopening of schools and roads Tuesday provided a sense of relief to a community under virtual lock-down since Frein -- a 31-year-old self-styled survivalist and war buff -- allegedly killed a state police officer and shot another officer September 12 during an ambush outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. On Tuesday, attendance in the 9,800-student district was down about 30%, a school official said. After-school athletic practices were moved indoors, and home athletic competitions canceled. \\"It's a difficult time for our parents,\\" district spokeswoman Wendy Frable told CNN. \\"A lot of parents are still a little nervous.\\" The shooting unleashed a massive manhunt involving hundreds of local, state and federal law enforcement agents. Life in the otherwise quiet community in the Pocono Mountains was disrupted as thousands of residents were under lock-down, and schools and some roads closed near the densely wooded search area. On Tuesday, two days after authorities discovered an AK-47 rifle, some magazines and a small bag of ammo in the northeastern Pennsylvania woods where they believe Frein is hiding, the search moved slightly north, police said. \\"He's out in those woods right now,\\" Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett told reporters a day earlier. State Police Lt. Col George Bivens, who joined the governor, said, \\"I do believe that we are close to him at this point.\\" Tracking dogs had indicated \\"we're on the right trail,\\" Bivens said a day earlier, adding that thermal imaging technology was being used to find Frein, who authorities believe had been planning the ambush for months or possibly years. Investigators said the items they found were either abandoned or hidden by Frein, who is a skilled marksman and trained survivalist. Slaying planned for months? Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers, but not civilians. When asked why investigators concluded that, Corbett answered that the night of the barracks shooting, Frein had the opportunity to shoot civilians and didn't take it. As to the rifle that was found over the weekend, it was positioned in such a way that it could be seen, though the items were partially concealed, Bivens said. \\"Frein obviously knows we're there\\" searching, he said. Up to 400 law enforcement officers are searching for Frein, including members of the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They are combing about 200 to 250 square miles of wooded area not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, about 20 miles from where Frein allegedly shot the police officers.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: How many men ambush Emmet while he is sleeping in the isolated shack? Movie plot title: Silverado Movie plot: The story opens with a man sleeping in a remote cabin in the Old American West. The door to the cabin bursts open and a gunman enters, shooting at the sleeping man, who is barely able to grab his pistol and shoot back, killing his would-be killer. The man continues to aim at the sides of the cabin and shoots another man walking outside. Repeated shotgun blasts blow through the roof of the cabin but the man is out of shots for his revolver. He tosses the revolver at the wood burning stove in the cabin and distracts the roof shooter long enough to grab his Winchester rifle. He shoots upward and hits the roof shooter, who falls into the cabin. The man with the rifle, Emmett (Scott Glenn), walks outside and looks over the failed assassins. He also looks at the horses, seeing a familiar brand emblem. Emmett leaves the cabin and continues his journey.Far out in the desert, he comes across another man, lying on the ground in his long underwear. He gives the man some water and takes him along. Later, as they camp for the night, the man in the underwear tells Emmett that his name is Paden (Kevin Kline) and that he'd been riding with a group of men who looted him and stole his horse. The two stop at an Army outpost where Emmett gives Paden some money to buy proper clothing. Paden suddenly spots his horse and the man who stole it. He ducks into the nearby general store where he has an argument with the shopkeep. Paden wants to borrow a pistol but the clerk won't let him. Paden asks the man for a gun worth the money Emmett gave him and is given a rusty old pistol that the cylinder falls out of. Paden rushes out to the square and loads the gun; he is spotted almost immediately by the horse thief, who rides toward him, shooting. Paden takes quick but very careful aim and shoots the man off the horse. A few minutes later, while he kisses his horse, Paden is grilled by a US Army sergeant about the shooting. Paden tells the lieutenant to look at the underside of his saddle, where his name is etched. When the lieutenant asks...

OPTIONS: 1). 0 2). 1 3). 2 4). 3 5). 4 6). 5","output":"I would rate the textual similarity of the two sentences as a 5 on the scale of 0 to 5. Here's a detailed explanation to justify my rating: Both sentences involve a woman and fish as the main subjects. Additionally, the action being performed on the fish is the main focus. It is evident that in both cases, the woman is the one executing the action of cooking the fish. While the first sentence specifically mentions \\"frying\\" as the method of cooking, frying is indeed a type of cooking. In the second sentence, \\"cooking\\" is a broader term that encompasses the act of frying. Therefore, the meaning of the first sentence can be seen as a subset of the meaning within the second sentence, directly connecting the two statements. In summary, the two sentences share the same underlying meaning—the woman is preparing the fish using a heating process (cooking). Depending on the context of other surrounding sentences, there might be some minor differences, but it is adequate to consider these two sentences having a meaning overlap of 5 or \\"means the same thing\\" on the given scale."},{"instruction":"Most of the food consumed by people worldwide comes from Options: - (A) humans - (B) trees - (C) Energy - (D) animals - (E) plants - (F) vitamin C - (G) honeybees - (H) Earth Let's be accurate as possible.","output":"The most accurate answer would be (E) plants.

Question: Why do I eat just enough when eating breakfast? Options: A. gas B. full stomach C. feeling satisfied D. have energy E. bloated","output":"When selecting the option in line with common sense, we aim to identify the underlying reason that best explains the action in the given scenario. In this case, the scenario is eating just enough when having breakfast. Let's analyze each option and discuss why it could be the common sense choice. A. Gas: Eating breakfast does not necessarily result in gas production. Although consuming certain types of food might cause gas, it is not the primary reason people eat just enough at breakfast. B. Full stomach: A full stomach implies that you have consumed food to the point where your stomach's capacity has reached its limit. While this might make you stop eating, it doesn't sufficiently explain the behavior of eating just enough at breakfast. C. Feeling satisfied: Eating just enough means consuming the right amount of food to meet your needs and enjoying the meal without feeling too full. This option aligns with the concept of satiety - the sensation of feeling satisfied after eating. Feeling satisfied is important not only to meet your dietary requirements but also to promote general wellbeing and enjoyment in life. This option seems to be the most in line with common sense. D. Have energy: While having energy is essential after eating, it is not the sole factor that determines the amount of food you eat during breakfast. Having energy is indeed a result of a balanced meal; however, it is not the immediate explanation for eating just enough. E. Bloated: Eating just enough reduces the chances of experiencing bloating, but it's not the primary reason for eating this way. Bloating is an unpleasant sensation that occurs when the stomach is too full, yet avoiding this feeling doesn't directly explain the behavior of eating just enough at breakfast. Based on the analysis of the options above, the common sense answer to why you eat just enough when eating breakfast is: C. Feeling satisfied This choice reflects the concept of eating the right amount of food to meet your needs and enjoying the meal without overeating or feeling too full. Satisfaction maintains a healthy balance in your diet while promoting overall wellbeing and prevents overeating or undereating.

She made an immediate pitch to female voters, especially those who had supported Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries, saying that her selection \\"could help shatter the glass ceiling once and for all.\\" But she is also less than two years into her term as governor, and her only previous political experience came as mayor of the town of Wasilla, which has a population of about 6,700. Democrats immediately seized on her lack of political experience, noting that McCain, who turned 72 on Friday, will be confirmed next week as the oldest first-time presidential nominee in history. After a raucous rally here before what the campaign said were 15,000 supporters -- the largest gathering of McCain's campaign -- the two spent six hours together. They traveled by bus to Pittsburgh, ingratiating themselves to Ohioans as they bought Ohio State Buckeye paraphernalia and stopped for ice cream at a roadside stand. The trip provided valuable bonding time for two people who acknowledge they barely know each other. McCain met Palin at a governor's conference in February, and did not see her again until she secretly flew to Arizona on Wednesday night. After a phone interview with the senator on Sunday night, she arrived in the state three days later for a session with McCain's two top lieutenants. She met with McCain's wife, Cindy, on Thursday morning at the couple's Sedona ranch, then McCain joined them and offered her the job on the deck of the house around 11 a.m. Thursday. While Palin, pronounced PAY-lin, had been mentioned as a dark-horse candidate for the job, she was never described as being on the shortlist under consideration by McCain. Those who were -- including former presidential rival Mitt Romney, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) -- had spent months doing surrogate duty for McCain around the country, something Palin had not been called on to do. There were reports of bruised feelings, especially because the McCain campaign's ironclad resolve to keep news of the pick from leaking meant some of the finalists were not told they were not chosen until the last minute. McCain and Democratic rival Barack Obama, opposites in so many ways, took dramatically different paths in making their vice presidential selections. Obama, 47, a first-term senator from Illinois who is battling the charge that he lacks the experience for the job, chose 65-year-old Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., a 35-year member of the Senate and a foreign policy expert. McCain, a war hero and world traveler who has served in Congress for more than a quarter-century, selected a woman who has no national or international experience and is younger than two of his children, but who he said shares his belief in reform and relishes the role of outsider. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Senator John McCain selected Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate for the 2008 Presidential election, making her the first woman on a Republican ticket.

As clerk to President Circle, B Square wants to warn his big brother to stay home that afternoon while there is a meeting at the Senate of the Great Southern Republic of Flatland.The Senate session has been called to discuss the increasing hostilities between the Chromatist movement and the government. Senator Chromatistes is the irregular polygon who leads this rebellious movement that wants to legalize the right of Flatlanders to color their sides as they see fit. Traditionally a taboo practice, the laws were previously relaxed somewhat which emboldened the Chromatists to demand legalization against the will of the majority. The Great Southern Republic distinguishes itself from its enemy, the Northern Kingdom, by its stances on Chromatism and Irregulars along with a democratic government. Relaxing the laws has already been perceived as weakness by the Northern Kingdom who are massing on the borders.Unable to heed his brothers advice, A Square meets with his new client, the first female charged as a Chromatist and on his way home finds himself embroiled in the melee issuing forth from the Senate.

A:","output":"Based on the given information and the hint provided, Zack has a lower chance of developing type 2 diabetes compared to Vick. Here is a detailed explanation as to why this is the case: 1. Diet and Caloric Intake: The diets of the two brothers are significantly different. Vick's diet consists of foods high in fat, and he tends to overeat. Overeating can lead to consuming more calories than the body requires for energy, resulting in the excess calories being stored as body fat. On the other hand, Zack consumes an appropriate amount of calories, which indicates that his diet possibly consists of a balanced and moderate intake of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids without exceeding his caloric needs. 2. Metabolism: Zack has a higher metabolic rate and a faster metabolism, which means he burns calories more efficiently than Vick. This reduces the chance of unused energy being stored as fat and helps in maintaining a healthier body weight. 3. Body Mass Index (BMI) and Obesity: Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. As mentioned, obesity occurs when a person's BMI is 30.0 kg/m2 or greater. Vick's unhealthy dietary habits and overeating have a higher chance of causing him to become obese. On the other hand, Zack's healthier eating habits and appropriate caloric intake, combined with his higher metabolism, are less likely to result in obesity. 4. The risk of Type 2 Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Obesity, as well as the accumulation of body fat, particularly around the abdomen, has been associated with increased insulin resistance and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, Zack's healthier diet, appropriate caloric intake, and higher metabolic rate significantly lower his risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Consequently, Zack has a lower chance of developing type 2 diabetes compared to Vick, whose unhealthy diet and overeating habits increase his likelihood of obesity, leading to an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes. It's important for Vick to reconsider his dietary choices, portion control, and engage in physical activities to help lower his risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the long run."},{"instruction":"Math Problem Solve -132 = 5*u - 122 for u.","output":"Alright little buddy, let's solve this math problem together!

However, it has been nothing but a nightmare. The app's interface is very confusing and not user-friendly at all. Navigating through the menus often feels like wandering through a maze. To make matters worse, the performance of the app is agonizingly slow. When I tried to use it to browse websites, pages took ages to load, if they loaded at all.

Haley Barbour suspended their armed robbery sentences on one condition -- that one sister donate a kidney to the other. And","output":"so began a new chapter in the lives of Gladys and Jamie Scott, two sisters intricately entwined in a tale of crime, punishment, and redemption. The case of the Scott sisters captured national headlines and ignited debates around issues of race, crime, and the criminal justice system in the United States. The story of the Scott sisters began in 1993 when the two African-American women were accused and subsequently convicted of an armed robbery in Forest, Mississippi. The sisters, then aged 19 and 22, maintained their innocence but were found guilty and handed down extraordinarily harsh sentences -- both were to serve two life sentences for a crime that netted only 11. Throughout their trial and subsequent imprisonment, the Scott sisters garnered the attention and support of numerous civil rights and social activists who questioned the severity of their sentences. Their supporters argued that the harsh punishments were racially motivated and underscored a pattern of systemic racial bias in the criminal justice system. As years passed, the public outcry over the sisters' imprisonment grew, eventually catching the attention of Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour. Faced with mounting pressure, Governor Barbour decided to grant the sisters an indefinite suspension of their sentences on one condition -- that Gladys donate a kidney to her sister Jamie, who was suffering from kidney failure. This unprecedented move by Gov. Barbour was met with mixed reactions. Some saw it as a compassionate gesture that would help save the life of Jamie, while others viewed it as a coercive and ethically questionable use of the power of clemency. Nonetheless, the sisters accepted the condition and were released from prison in January 2011, reuniting with their mother in Pensacola, Florida. As observed by their mother, Evelyn Rasco, any thoughts of returning to Mississippi were swiftly dismissed, highlighting the deep emotional scars left by the sisters' harrowing experience. In their newfound freedom, the Scott sisters have become vocal advocates for criminal justice reform, lending their voices to the ongoing conversation on the impact of race in the U.S. justice system. Their story highlights the significant obstacles many minority individuals face, not only within the legal system but also in accessing adequate healthcare and organ transplants. As Gladys and Jamie Scott embark on this new chapter in their lives, their story serves as a poignant reminder of the need for a more equitable and just society. It underscores the importance of addressing racial disparities in the criminal justice system to ensure that all individuals receive fair treatment and sentencing commensurate with their actions. The Scott sisters' case highlights the critical need for a system that values compassion, rehabilitation, and ultimately, a chance for redemption."},{"instruction":"Upon the kingdom's establishment soon after World War I, the country suffered from economic decline, budget deficits, and high inflation as a result of the loss of economically important territories under the Treaty of Trianon, including Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia.

Prime Minister István Bethlen's government dealt with the economic crisis by seeking large foreign loans, which allowed the country achieve monetary stabilization in the early 1920s. He introduced a new currency in 1927, the pengő. Industrial and farm production rose rapidly, and the country benefited from flourishing foreign trade during most of the 1920s. Following the start of the Great Depression in 1929, the prosperity rapidly collapsed in the country, especially in part due to the economic effects of the failure of the Österreichische Creditanstalt bank in Vienna, Austria.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"When blood sugar increases, it potentially impacts the process both directly and indirectly. Directly Impacting a Step of the Process: When blood sugar levels rise, it triggers a response from the pancreas that is opposite to the process you described. In this case, the pancreatic beta cells secrete insulin, a hormone responsible for helping cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream. High blood sugar leads to an increased secretion of insulin, which in turn promotes glucose uptake by the cells of various tissues (such as muscles and adipose tissue), effectively lowering blood glucose levels. This directly impacts the process since the higher insulin levels suppress the secretion of glucagon by the pancreatic alpha cells. This means that the glucagon hormone, which is responsible for stimulating the liver to convert glycogen into glucose when blood sugar levels are low, is inhibited by insulin. As a result, the liver will not convert glycogen stores into glucose, preventing an overproduction of glucose and subsequent increase in blood sugar levels. Indirectly Impacting a Step of the Process: The indirect impact of higher blood sugar levels revolves around the long-term consequences of persistent hyperglycemia. Chronic high blood sugar can lead to insulin resistance in the cells, which makes them less responsive to insulin signals and less efficient at absorbing glucose from the bloodstream. This condition can further exacerbate the problem, as the pancreas tries to compensate by producing more insulin, leading to a vicious cycle that can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. In this scenario, the indirect impact on the process lies within the body's deteriorating ability to effectively regulate glucose levels, which affects the balance between insulin and glucagon secretion. The interplay between these hormones is crucial for maintaining proper blood sugar levels, and disruptions to this balance caused by insulin resistance can lead to impaired glucose metabolism, further exacerbating blood sugar fluctuations and reinforcing the issue. In conclusion, an increase in blood sugar levels can both directly and indirectly impact the process involved in regulating blood glucose levels. These effects can originate from the immediate suppression of glucagon secretion and the long-term repercussions of insulin resistance, ultimately contributing to disturbances in metabolic balance and overall glucose homeostasis."},{"instruction":"Translate the following.

One such example is the drone fly, which looks a lot like a bee, yet is completely harmless as it cannot sting at all. Another example of batesian mimicry is the io moth, (Automeris io), which has markings on its wings that resemble an owl's eyes. When an insectivorous predator disturbs the moth, it reveals its hind wings, temporarily startling the predator and giving it time to escape. Predators may also use mimicry to lure their prey, however. Female fireflies of the genus Photuris, for example, copy the light signals of other species, thereby attracting male fireflies, which are then captured and eaten (see aggressive mimicry). Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What does a female firefly look like, but isn't able to sting?","output":"A female firefly that looks like a stinging insect but isn't able to sting is an example of Batesian mimicry, where a harmless species resembles a harmful one to deter predators.

The premise states that there is an unfinished obelisk, which is lying prone (flat) but has not been fully separated from the rock surrounding it. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis suggests that there exists an obelisk of small size that is standing upright and is finished. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise. To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to check if the premise forces the hypothesis to be true. In other words, whenever the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. Step 4: Assess the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. The premise talks about a specific obelisk that is unfinished, while the hypothesis talks about another obelisk that is complete.

Phya Suriya was unable to find a suitable candidate in Europe, and notified Phya Akaraj Varathon, the Siamese Minister in Washington, that under the circumstances, he had decided to engage an American. In 1903, former US diplomat Edward Henry Strobel took a leave of absence from his position as the Bemis Professor of International Law at Harvard School of Law to represent the Kingdom of Siam in The Hague at the International Peace Court—which Rolin-Jaequemyns had been instrumental in founding. In 1906, Strobel moved to Bangkok to take the position of general advisor, where he died January 15, 1908. Among his successors were Jens Westengard, 1909-14, Wolcott Pitkin, 1915-17, Eldon James, and Francis B. Sayre—all but for Pitkin former Harvard law professors. \\"The Siamese government trusted the American Adviser in Foreign Affairs to act in the best interests of Siam. Authority and responsibility were delegated to him. He was permitted a considerable degree of freedom in his work. It was in his capacity as a lawyer, a jurist, an advocate, and a policy counselor that the American adviser contributed significantly to the successful conclusion of the treaty negotiations with the West.\\" An agreement on relations between the two countries was signed in Washington D.C. on December 16, 1920.

Therefore, Strobel died approximately two years after moving to Bangkok from the time of his relocation. It is not specified exactly when in 1906 Strobel moved, so the precise duration may be slightly under or over two years, but generally, it can be said that he died about two years after his move to Bangkok."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: \\"What undertones does the religion have?\\" Context: \\"Former members Heather and Gary Botting compare the cultural paradigms of the religion to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-four, and Alan Rogerson describes the religion's leadership as totalitarian. Other critics charge that by disparaging individual decision-making, the religion's leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience in which Witnesses abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives. Critics also accuse the religion's leaders of exercising \\"intellectual dominance\\" over Witnesses, controlling information and creating \\"mental isolation\\", which former Governing Body member Raymond Franz argued were all elements of mind control.\\" Answer: A:","output":"The religion mentioned in the context, though not explicitly named, seems to have undertones of authoritarianism, control, and suppression of individuality. These undertones are highlighted by the critical comparisons and claims from former members and critics of the religion. 1. Authoritarianism: Critics liken the religious organization's leadership to a totalitarian regime, with comparisons made to George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-four. This implies strict control over the lives of the followers, enforced through a rigid hierarchy. 2. Suppression of Individual Decision-making: Critics argue that the religious leaders discourage followers from making individual decisions, fostering a culture of unquestioning obedience. In this system, followers give up personal responsibility and rights over their lives, leaving them with little or no autonomy. 3. Intellectual Dominance and Control of Information: Another aspect highlighted by critics revolves around the control of information. The religious leaders are accused of exercising intellectual dominance over their followers and strategically manipulating information. This control creates a sense of mental isolation for the members, restricting their access to alternative sources of knowledge or perspectives. 4. Elements of Mind Control: Raymond Franz, a former Governing Body member, argues that these various mechanisms of dominance contribute to a form of mind control within the religion. By limiting decision-making, controlling information, and strongly guiding the thought processes of its followers, the religion seems to enforce a system where its adherents experience a lack of freedom to think or question independently. In summary, the religion in question has undertones of authoritarianism, suppression of individuality, intellectual dominance, and mind control, as noted by former members and critics. These elements reflect a rigid hierarchical structure, lack of personal autonomy, and controlled access to information, together resulting in a potentially harmful environment for individual growth and free thinking."},{"instruction":"Racha Dives & Courses - departing from Phuket every day Please remove spaces between words.","output":"RachaDives&Courses is a premier diving company offering a wide range of diving experiences for both beginners and experienced divers.

The equation given is: -1359 = -101*d - 955 Step 2: Move the constant term (-955) to the other side of the equation To do this, add 955 to both sides of the equation: -1359 + 955 = -101*d - 955 + 955 This simplifies to: -404 = -101*d Now, it looks like: -404 = -101*d Step 3: Solve for the variable (d) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable (-101) Divide both sides of the equation by -101: -404 / -101 = (-101 * d) / -101 Simplifying this equation gives: 4 = d So, the value of d that satisfies the equation -1359 = -101*d - 955 is d = 4."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers. Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her. He goes to the village where the Afghans live, walks around, meets an enigmatic cobbler, and ends up in the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard... Answer:","output":"In the Afghan village, Lateef meets an enigmatic cobbler who eventually leads him to the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard.

The Lascanx caves hold ancient colorful paintings. (D). Drawings of horses are on the walls of the Lascaux caves. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Imagine looking for your lost dog. You step into a cave . But instead of the dog, you find beautiful cave paintings. You see paintings of horses, deer, and bison that are drawn in black, brown, red and yellow. Your first question would probably be \\"Who did this?\\" This is what happened to four French boys in 1940. They found the Lascaux caves. The paintings the boys discovered in those caves are 17,000 years old. They were drawn by the ancient people called Cro-Magnons. Cro-Magnons looked much like people of today. They used tools, such as fishing nets. But their art was extremely good. The main cave at Lascaux is called the Great Hall of Bulls, which has a picture of bulls and horses in many colors. The largest animal is 18 feet long. There are smaller animals, such as bison, stags and a bear. There is also a strange spotted two-horned animal. To the left of the main cave are the most famous paintings that are the drawings of multicolored animals. One painting is called Little Horses. On the ceiling are horses and cows. The most unusual sight may be in the Shaft of the Dead Man where there is a thinoceros , a carefully drawn dead man, a wounded bison and a bird. Why did Cro-Magnon artists do these beautiful drawings on cave walls? Did the drawings call upon some magical power? Did the Cro-Magnon people hope that the drawings would bring good luck? There is one thing the paintings seem to tell us. The Cro- Magnons were interested in the world. They looked at beauty and they understood it. Question: What is the main idea of the passage? Answer: Answer:","output":"The main idea of the passage is the discovery and detailed description of the ancient cave paintings in the Lascaux caves in France. These paintings, discovered by four French boys in 1940 and estimated to be 17,000 years old, were made by the Cro-Magnon people. The large and colorful depictions of various animals including horses, deer, bison, and bulls, sprawling across walls and ceilings, showcase the artistic skill of these ancient people. The passage also reflects on the possible motives behind this artwork, like invoking magical power or bringing good luck, ultimately highlighting the Cro-Magnons' curiosity and appreciation of the world around them."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Where the Beat Meets the Street is the second studio album by Grateful Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir and his side - project , Bobby and the Midnites . The album reached number 166 on the Billboard 200 . - Mickey Hart (born Michael Steven Hartman, September 11, 1943) is an American percussionist and musicologist. He is best known as one of the two drummers of the rock band Grateful Dead. He was a member of the Grateful Dead from September 1967 to February 1971 and from October 1974 to August 1995. He and fellow Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann earned the nickname \\"the rhythm devils\\". - Robert Hall \\"Bob\\" Weir (born October 16, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist, most recognized as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, Weir performed with The Other Ones, later known as The Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, Scaring the Children, RatDog and Furthur, co-led by former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. In 2015, Weir, along with former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, joined with Grammy-winning singer/guitarist John Mayer to form the band Dead & Company. Weir continued to tour with Dead & Company in 2016. - Bobby and the Midnites was a rock group led by Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead. The band was Weir's main side project during the first half of the 1980s. They released two albums, but were better known for their live concerts than for their work in the recording studio. With a rhythm section that included jazz veterans Billy Cobham and, for a time, Alphonso Johnson, Bobby and the Midnites played rock music that was influenced by jazz-rock fusion. - Space rock is a subgenre of rock music; the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind, Gong, and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or outer space-related lyrical themes. - Philip Chapman Lesh (born March 15, 1940) is a musician and a founding member of the Grateful Dead, with whom he played bass guitar throughout their 30-year career. - The Other Ones was an American rock band formed in 1998 by former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with part-time Grateful Dead collaborator Bruce Hornsby. In 2000, Bill Kreutzmann, another Grateful Dead alumnus, joined the group, while Phil Lesh dropped out. In 2002, Lesh rejoined the band, and Hornsby left. At different times the shifting lineup of The Other Ones also included Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, John Molo, Dave Ellis, Alphonso Johnson, Jimmy Herring, Rob Barraco, Jeff Chimenti, and Susan Tedeschi. In 2003, The Other Ones changed their name to The Dead. - Deadhead or Dead Head is a name given to fans of the American psychedelic rock band the Grateful Dead. In the 1970s, a number of fans began travelling to see the band in as many shows or festival venues as they could. With large numbers of people thus attending strings of shows, a community developed. Deadheads developed their own idioms and slang. - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - John Clayton Mayer (born October 16, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubsrefining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia Records, which released his first EP, \\"Inside Wants Out\\". His following two full-length albums\\"Room for Squares\\" (2001) and \\"Heavier Things\\" (2003)did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland\\". - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - William \\"Bill\\" Kreutzmann, Jr. (born May 7, 1946) is an American drummer. He played with the Grateful Dead for its entire thirty-year career, usually alongside fellow drummer Mickey Hart, and has continued to perform with former members of the Grateful Dead in various lineups, and with his own bands BK3, 7 Walkers and Billy & the Kids. - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \\"Deadheads\\". \\"Their music,\\" writes Lenny Kaye, \\"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \\"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\\". The band was ranked 57th by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine in its \\"The Greatest Artists of all Time\\" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.

The young girls then live with their two aunts (Stockard Channing, Diane Wiest), who teach them the ways of being a witch and how to deal with the ridicule that comes with the family profession.

The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning.

As more international travelers discover Bolivia for its biodiversity, where they can explore the Andes, the Amazon basin and the world's largest salt lake in one visit, La Paz is their most likely point of entry. But to most, it's little more than that -- a place to spend a day or two sipping coca tea and adjust to life at 10,000 feet while planning adventures. The congestion and chaos quickly become apparent as you descend the Altiplano to the \\"bowl\\" of the downtown core, a tangled maze of steep and winding streets. The cultural legacy of Bolivia's largest indigenous groups, the Quechua and Aymara, permeate the busy urban landscape, where vehicles compete with pedestrians and sidewalk vendors. With elevations ranging from 9,800 to 13,450 feet, \\"the city that touches the sky\\" has plenty of distinctions that come in handy in bar trivia: home of the world's highest international airport and highest seat of government. Its elevation also makes for extreme temperature: sunny, hot days and cold, windy nights. But a closer look reveals some unexpected surprises that aren't spelled out in tour guides. Flanked by the Iglesia de San Francisco, a noisy thoroughfare and a busy side street, Plaza San Francisco is not the prettiest public space La Paz has to offer, but it's a great place to people-watch. Women dressed in traditional indigenous style of bowler hats and poofy petticoats, babies slung over their shoulders in colorful wraps, wait for buses alongside teens in skinny jeans and heavy eye makeup. Vendors in blue jumpsuits push around carts of ice cream which everyone seems to be eating. The San Francisco church is worth a visit in itself. Its stone-carved facade is in the intricate style of 16-century baroque and mestizo architecture. A tour of the basilica and cloister offers an overview of La Paz's founding and fight for independence, along with an opportunity to glimpse the city from the bell tower. The city's last remaining example of what a street looked like in colonial times could be considered one of the most touristy parts of La Paz, owing to the polish of its refurbished structures. But in a busy metropolis that doesn't go out of its way to cater to tourists, it's a peaceful stretch of cobblestone and colorful buildings that brings to mind other colonial cities like Antigua, Guatemala, or Campeche, Mexico. Step inside one of the dimly-lit bars or restaurants and you'll find quiet courtyards shielded from the bustle of the city. The street is home to four museums in colonial homes, noteworthy for their architecture as much as their exhibits. Museo de Casa Murillo -- former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, one of the martyrs of the La Paz Independence movement of July 16, 1809 -- features paintings, furniture and clothing from an era when La Paz was torn between loyalty to the Spanish viceroy and support for indigenous rights. At the Museo de Instrumentos Musicales, also a school and meeting place for aspiring musicians, visitors are likely to stumble upon a jam session of charango players or pan flutists. Students of the school often put on Saturday night performances, where you might catch a guitar duet performed by a 7-year-old prodigy and his Japanese instructor. Museo Nacional de Etnografia y Folklore If you're in Bolivia long enough, chances are you'll stumble on a parade or celebration where traditional Bolivian song and dance is the centerpiece (yet another reason to stick around La Paz on the weekend). The colorful costumes and masks, representative of dances from different regions and evocative of the film, \\"Return to Oz,\\" might leave the uninitiated wondering what the heck is going on. The Museo Nacional de Etnografia y Folklore offers some explanation for why horned devil masks and caricatures of African slaves figure prominently in folklore in an impressive display of masks and costumes. For extra trivia, check out the exhibit on the participation of transvestites in cultural celebrations of the late 20th century. Most Wednesdays, the museum keeps its doors open late for a show by the renowned Ballet Folklórico de La Paz, in which dancers decked out in full garb demonstrate customs from various regions, minus the drunken revelry of the street. Local markets, Witches Market, Calles Sagarnaga and Linares Most Western tourists will have little use for items at local markets. But they're good for getting a sense of how Bolivians shop and what seems to be popular: puffy corn resembling Styrofoam, exotic seeds, reams of multi-colored fabric, shoes and underwear, cell phone chips, kitchen accessories, a shoe shine, keys made by hand. Those who've never seen a dried llama or alpaca fetus would do well to check out Witches Market, which also offers charms and herbs that purport to prolong sexual encounters or attract secret crushes. Vendors down the street on Calle Linares down to Sagarnaga sell the traditional goods that tourists tend to look for in South America -- colorful hats and scarves made of alpaca and llama wool bearing images of alpacas and llamas, colorful rugs and textiles, jewelry with indigenous designs, all cheaper than you'll find similar items in Peru or Chile. At the local markets, tucked among the stalls of clothes and housekeeping products, foreigners can eat like a local at the same prices as a local, 1 to 2 on average. Eating in the street is not for everyone, especially those with sensitive stomachs, but it's worth for the risk for those willing to try. Bolivia is a meat and potatoes kind of country, with a knack for throwing fried eggs on the side and a few pieces of yucca if you're lucky. Women push around carts that double as kitchen counters from which they prepare full course meals, from lechon to empanadas to roasted pork sandwiches. At night, more roving carts appear, offering tripe or hamburgers and hot dogs and salchipapas (sausages and french fries). Fresh fruit juice stands are abundant, but should also be approached with caution. Cups of pear juice with a fuzzy pit resting at the bottom may remind you of the llama fetus at Witches Market, but drink it and you'll be treated to one of the sweetest drinks without artificial sweetener you'll ever try. Don't forget to suck on the pit when you're done!","output":"La Paz, Bolivia's largest city, offers a unique cultural experience for travelers who choose not to skip it on their journey through the country. With its indigenous influences, rich history, and bustling local markets, La Paz provides an authentic taste of Bolivian life. Visitors can learn about the city's founding and fight for independence at the San Francisco Church, while exploring its museums offers insight into the country's art, music, and folklore. Local markets and street food, featuring traditional Bolivian ingredients and dishes, provide a culinary adventure for the adventurous eater.

Consider potential context: Since there's limited information, I will make an educated guess based on the typical context of laughter. Generally, laughter is associated with happiness, joy, or amusement, so it's likely that the sentiment is positive. However, it is also possible for laughter to be a response to embarrassment, nervousness, or even maliciousness. Without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact sentiment, but it's more likely to be positive than negative. Based on these steps, the sentiment of this sentence is likely perceived as positive due to the presence of laughter, although the exact emotion relies on additional context."},{"instruction":"Complete the following sentence.

Playing a raw, primitive style of rock and roll, the band sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of self-mutilation by frontman Iggy Pop. After releasing two albums\\"The Stooges\\" (1969) and \\"Fun House\\" (1970)the group disbanded briefly, and reformed with a different lineup to release \\"Raw Power\\" (1973) before breaking up again in 1974. The band reunited in 2003 and was active until 2016 following the deaths of several original members. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band formed in London in 1975. Although they initially lasted just two and a half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, \\"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\\", they are considered one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music, having initiated the punk movement in the United Kingdom, and inspired many later punk rock, thrash metal and alternative rock musicians. - The Big Knockover is the Swedish punk group No Fun at All 's third album , released on July 13 , 1997 .

It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - Burning Heart Records is an independent record label formed in 1993 and based in Örebro, Sweden. It has a close affiliation with Californian label Epitaph Records, who own the rights to distribute Burning Heart's output in North America. It also started a German office in Berlin in the end of 2003. - Epitaph Records is a Hollywood-based independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. The label was originally \\"just a logo and a P.O. box\\" created in the 1980s for the purpose of selling Bad Religion records, but has evolved into a large independent record label. Gurewitz took the name from a King Crimson song of the same name. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most of the bands on Epitaph were punk and pop punk groups, while there are many post-hardcore and bands signed to the label as well. A large portion of the record label, known as Hellcat Records, is owned by Tim Armstrong, frontman of the punk rock band Rancid. Several sister-labels also exist, such as ANTI-, Burning Heart Records, Fat Possum Records, Hellcat Records and Heart & Skull Records that have signed other types of bands. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - No Fun at All (often abbreviated to just NFAA) is a Swedish punk rock band. The band formed in the summer of 1991 in Skinnskatteberg. The group initially consisted of Mikael Danielsson (guitar), Henrik Sunvisson (bass guitar) and Jimmy Olsson (vocals, drums). The name was inspired by a tongue-in-cheek version of The Stooges' song \\"No Fun\\" as covered by the Sex Pistols, and the name of the band Sick of It All.

His willingness to go out of his way and take time to help others would generate positive emotions such as happiness, warmth, and thankfulness. This gratitude could strengthen interpersonal relationships and in turn, create deeper bonds with his friends and acquaintances. 2. Inspired: Seeing Lee's altruistic behavior could inspire others to follow in his footsteps and become more caring and helpful themselves. This could create a chain reaction, resulting in a more kind-hearted and compassionate community. As people see the effect of Lee's actions, they might feel motivated to pay it forward and do good deeds for other people as well. 3. Secure: Individuals who know they can rely on Lee for help might feel safer and more secure, leading to increased self-confidence and well-being.

By assisting others, he would create a more cooperative and understanding environment, in which everyone would feel valued and appreciated. 6. Responsible: In situations where others might have been responsible for problems that required Lee's assistance, they would likely feel a sense of responsibility towards him.

Educated: By assisting others in need, Lee would also offer them an opportunity to learn from him. He could serve as a role model, teaching people essential skills, showing them how to solve problems, and providing guidance for various situations.

Czech grammar and pronunciation can be quite challenging for English speakers, as it features a complex case system, with seven cases and four grammatical genders. It also has a rich phonetic inventory, with many consonant clusters and a distinction between hard and soft consonants, which are important in grammatical inflections.

Specifically, he makes fun of the American two-party system. During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for president. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic incumbent, President Kellogg, and Republican U.S. Senator Mills. A parallel plot follows Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company in California called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the Presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices that the voting system does not work correctly and alerts the head of the company, James Hemmings (Rick Roberts) via e-mail. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously â perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, when, fed up with the other candidates' posturing, Dobbs shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains a distant third to Kellogg and Mills.

The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles.

In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

In the midst of it, Wilby's inhabitants attempt to maintain business as usual. Overbusy realtor Carol French is trying to sell the mayor her late mother-in-lawâs house while supervising the festival, trying to achieve her social ambitions while painfully trying to avoid her husband's efforts to discuss their marriage. Her police officer husband, good-natured Buddy, investigating the rumors of gay sex and drugs at the Watch with his partner Stan, is distracted by his burgeoning love affair with former high school classmate Sandra Anderson. Sandra just got back to the island and re-opened a coffee shop, her bad reputation as a promiscuous woman a painful fact in her life. Sandraâs teenaged daughter Emily resentfully observes her mother's doings; she's hoping for a serious romance different from her mom's history, but her boyfriend may have more basic intentions. After his wife has left him in the wake of the pending gay scandal, the new-to-town depressive video store owner Dan Jarvis keeps trying to kill himself and Duck MacDonald, the townâs handyman, keeps interrupting his attempts. Duck remains stoic in front of the turmoil, seemingly the only one (silently) recognizing everyone else's dramas while himself persistently seeking Dan's company.

Trump has said climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese to get the United States to suppress its manufacturing sector. That prompted a public rebuttal last week from a Chinese official attending a climate summit meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to back away from the strict climate-denier viewpoint embraced by many Republicans in an interview with The New York Times, saying that there was “some connectivity” between human activity and climate change. He also said he wanted to keep an “open mind” about whether to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the main global climate change accord. Mr. Trump’s opacity means it is unclear whether he will actually support policies to limit the effects of climate change after being sworn in as president in January. But officials from China, which has surpassed the United States as the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gas, have said they will move forward on climate policies without the Americans, if it comes to that. On Tuesday, Michael R. Bloomberg, the media tycoon and former mayor of New York City, said that American cities would continue to enact climate policies no matter what Mr. Trump and the federal government decided to do. Mr. Bloomberg made his remarks in Washington at a talk hosted by the China General Chamber of Commerce. They were adapted for an op-ed article published Tuesday by Bloomberg View under the headline, “Washington Won’t Have Last Word on Climate Change.” Mr. Bloomberg, a longtime advocate for action on climate change, praised Xie Zhenhua, China’s climate envoy, for saying China remained committed to tackling the issue. “That’s a responsible thing to do for the Chinese people and the world,” he said. Mr. Bloomberg added that if Mr. Trump decided to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, then he would urge the mayors of 128 cities in the United States who see the need to fight climate change to join the agreement. Following is a central passage from Mr. Bloomberg’s op-ed article: “I can’t tell you what Donald Trump’s administration will do — and in all fairness, they will need time to figure it out themselves. What’s said on the campaign trail is one thing; actually carrying out a specific policy is another. I hope they’ll recognize the importance of the issue. But I am confident that no matter what happens in Washington, no matter what regulations the next administration adopts or rescinds, no matter what laws the next Congress may pass, we will meet the pledges that the U.S. made in Paris. “The reason is simple: Cities, businesses and citizens will continue reducing emissions, because they have concluded — just as China has — that doing so is in their own self-interest. “The U.S.’s success in fighting climate change has never been primarily dependent on Washington. Bear in mind: Over the past decade, Congress has not passed a single bill that takes direct aim at climate change. Yet at the same time, the U.S. has led the world in reducing emissions. “That progress has been driven by cities, businesses and citizens — and none of them are letting up now. Just the opposite: All are looking for ways to expand their efforts. Mayors and local leaders around the country are determined to keep pushing ahead on climate change.” Mr. Bloomberg’s remarks dovetail with recent ones made by American mayors who say their cities will defy potential policies from Mr. Trump on critical issues. Among others, the mayors of New York, Chicago, Seattle, Philadelphia and Washington have said their cities will be immigrant sanctuaries that do not cooperate with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In his visit with reporters and editors at The New York Times on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said of the Paris Agreement: “I’m looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it.” In addressing the climate issue, he also said, “Clean air is vitally important.” Mr. Trump appeared to be confusing the issues of climate change and air pollution. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change do not cause smog. It is buildup of particulate matter that leads to toxic air, a severe problem in Chinese cities. Greenhouses gases and particulate matter can both come from the same source — in many cases, industrial coal-burning — so any policies to limit the use of coal helps with both issues. The United States and China have made pledges to curb the use of coal. Mr. Bloomberg concluded the op-ed article published Tuesday with this thought: “Washington will not have the last word on the fate of the Paris Agreement in the U.S. — mayors will, together with business leaders and citizens.”","output":"Regardless of the decisions made by President-elect Donald Trump, cities across the US will continue to pursue climate policies, according to Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City. In an op-ed for Bloomberg View, he wrote that cities, businesses and individuals will continue to reduce emissions because it also serves their own interests, at the same time bowing to the influence of China, which itself has said it will move forward on climate policies without the US if necessary. Bloomberg’s article backs the position of several American mayors who have stated that their cities will defy any adverse policies introduced by Trump on critical issues."},{"instruction":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? \\"In riverside is a Chinese restaurant called Blue Spice.

Meanwhile, the conductor, \\"Shack\\", makes his presence known to the other hobos hiding in the weeds with a menacing countenance. As they pull back onto the mainline, Shack spies an ambitious hobo hopping between cars and quickly makes him pay his fare by knocking him down between the rails to his death.

Answer:","output":"The new Catfish season, referring to the MTV reality show \\"Catfish: The TV Show,\\" premiered its seventh season on January 3, 2018. The show, hosted by Nev Schulman and Max Joseph, helps individuals who have developed relationships with people online but have yet to meet in person. The purpose of the show is to investigate whether these people are genuinely who they claim to be and if the relationships have any sense of reality behind them, often uncovering deception or fraud. \\"Catfish: The TV Show\\" initially aired in November 2012, following the success of the documentary film \\"Catfish\\" (2010). The film, directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, with Nev Schulman as the subject, unraveled a complex online deception involving a long-distance relationship. The show that was born from the documentary's success has the same aim. Various individuals approach the hosts seeking help in uncovering the truth about their online partners, whom they have never met in real life.

Imagine you have 46 apples with a minus sign (-46), and we want to find out how many times we should multiply these apples with a number (n) to get the same amount of apples in other baskets. Now, we have 3 baskets. The first basket has 189 apples with a minus sign (-189), the second basket has 92 apples with a minus sign (-92), and the third basket has just 5170 apples with a minus sign (-5170). Each of these first two baskets is also multiplied by the same number (n) as our -46 apples basket. Let's find out how to get the same apples in every basket! Here is what the math problem looks like: -46 * n = -189 * n - 92 * n - 5170 First, let's combine the apples in the first two baskets on the right side. If we add -189 apples * n and -92 apples * n, we would have -281 apples * n. Now, the math problem looks like this: -46 * n = -281 * n - 5170 Let's move all the apples to one side so we can see how much n is. We can do this by adding 281 * n to both sides of the problem. On the left side, -46 * n + 281 * n gives us 235 * n. On the right side, -281 * n + 281 * n gives us 0, and we still have -5170 apples. So our new math problem is: 235 * n = -5170 Now, we just need to find out what n is. To do that, we can divide both sides of the problem by 235. This gives us: n = -5170 / 235 Now, if we do this calculation, we find that: n = -22 So, the number we need to multiply the apples with (-46 apples) to have the same apples in all baskets is -22! And that's the solution to our math problem!"},{"instruction":"Translate the following.

The movie opens with Jack, a dedicated undercover cop, successfully infiltrating Demarkov's crime organization. Over time, he gains the trust of Demarkov and becomes one of his top lieutenants. Jack feeds valuable information about Demarkov's operations to the police regularly, helping them to dismantle the criminal empire piece by piece. However, Detective Sarah Simmons, a confident and ambitious officer, grows impatient with the slow progress of the operation. She devises a plan to precipitate a confrontation between Jack and Demarkov to force Demarkov into making mistakes. Sarah believes that by putting pressure on Jack and publicly revealing his undercover status, Demarkov will be caught off guard and expose himself. She arranges a highly publicized arrest of Jack for a supposed crime, making it appear as if he has turned against Demarkov. Demarkov sees the news and believes that Jack has betrayed him. Enraged, Demarkov sends his goons to kill Jack and anyone associated with him. Jack, realizing the gravity of the situation, reluctantly takes part in the confrontation. He is torn between following orders from the police and protecting innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire. Demarkov soon learns about the police's plan to pit them against each other and decides to use it against the police instead. Demarkov arranges a meeting with Jack, intending to take him out and expose the corrupt officers within the police force. During the meeting, Demarkov reveals that he knows about Jack's true identity, catching the police off guard. With both sides armed and wary, tensions escalate, and a ferocious battle ensues. As the bullets fly and the casualties rise, Jack must make a crucial decision: stay loyal to the police and risk everything, or side with Demarkov and ensure survival. In the heat of the moment, Jack chooses to remain loyal to the police, leading to a final showdown between him and Demarkov. Bruised and beaten, Jack finally manages to apprehend Demarkov. The police arrive and take him into custody, finally bringing his criminal reign to an end. Despite the collateral damage and the many lives lost, justice is finally served, and Jack's unwavering loyalty to the force is recognized. As the movie closes, Jack reflects on the sacrifices made in the pursuit of justice and grapples with the heavy consequences of the police's dangerous game.

Options: - rollerblade - helicopter - lawn mower - scissors - knife Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"1. The question asks about a blade helping in moving from one place to another, so we need to evaluate each option based on its ability to assist in movement or transportation. 2. Rollerblade: A rollerblade has wheels with bearings that help in movement or transportation. The blade here refers to the elongated structure that holds the wheels, and it facilitates movement by providing a stable platform for the wheels and the user's feet. This option seems to fit the criteria. 3. Helicopter: A helicopter has rotor blades that create lift and help the helicopter to move. The blades work by pushing air downward as they rotate, which generates lift. In this case, the blades directly contribute to movement and transportation. This option is also a good contender. 4. Lawn mower: A lawn mower has a blade that cuts grass, and its main function is to maintain and trim lawns. Although lawn mowers can move to fulfill their primary function, their blade does not assist in transportation. This option doesn't fit the criteria. 5. Scissors: Scissors have two blades that work together to cut materials like paper, fabric or hair, but they don't contribute to movement or transportation. This option doesn't meet the requirements. 6. Knife: A knife has a blade that is used for cutting and slicing, but it does not help in movement or transportation.

Translate to English","output":"Relying on developed countries to move in the right direction before we can return to the old norms is not a good strategy; placing bets on this is not advisable. It is important to recognize that waiting for developed countries to make decisions and take steps towards a positive direction may not always result in the outcomes that we desire. In order to thrive, it is crucial for all countries, including developing nations, to proactively contribute to global progress and find innovative ways to adapt to changing circumstances. By doing this, countries can avoid falling behind in the development race and ensure their citizens are equipped to face an ever-evolving world. As these developed countries are often seen as leaders in political, economic, and social spheres, they can undoubtedly influence global decisions. However, placing complete reliance on their actions can prove to be detrimental to other nations. This is because these countries have their self-interests and may not always consider the needs and concerns of other nations, particularly developing ones. Moreover, uncontrollable factors such as economic downturns, political upheaval, or natural disasters may disrupt their plans. This further reinforces the idea that relying solely on developed countries for guidance and direction may not be the best strategy. To foster growth and development across the globe, it is important for all nations, irrespective of their development status, to work together and collaborate on significant issues such as climate change, global health, and technology advancements. By actively engaging in these matters, countries can help shape global policies and create a more inclusive and efficient ecosystem that benefits everyone. Another crucial factor to consider is the acceleration of technological advancements and digital transformations observed in recent years. Rapid innovations in sectors like AI, robotics, and biotechnology have altered the way we work, live, and interact. As a result, the old norms may no longer be relevant or applicable in today's context. This calls for countries to adapt and create new norms by embracing new technologies, investing in research and development, and upgrading their infrastructures. By doing so, they can work together in shaping a better and more sustainable future. In conclusion, it is crucial not to place bets on waiting for developed countries to move in the right direction, but rather, for all countries to be proactive in their approach to development and global policymaking. By ensuring efficient collaboration and embracing new technologies, nations can build a stronger international community that is equipped to face the challenges of the future and create new norms that are sustainable and inclusive for all."},{"instruction":"If Her right eye had a ring of blood around the iris, thick and swollen., can we conclude that \\"Her eye was injured.\\"?

To the people of India, the Gangs is great, but it is also important for transportation; Ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeast Asia. The greatest of all for navigation , however, is the Amazon in Brazil. It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles upon it. Besides transportation, rivers give food, water to drink, water for crops , and chances for fun and entertainment for the people who live along their banks. In order to increase the supply of crops, engineers sometimes build a dam across a river and let a lake from behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located upon rivers often make problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials.

However, the phrase \\"they succeed\\" provides a clue for us to analyze. Generally, the word \\"succeed\\" implies that something has been accomplished or achieved, and in the context of a movie review, it often implies that the film has achieved its goals or has been successful in terms of storytelling, character development, or other aspects. This would suggest that the review is leaning towards a positive sentiment overall. However, without the full context or the complete sentence, it is not possible to provide a definitive assessment of whether the movie review is wholly positive or negative. More information would be necessary to make a more accurate judgment on the sentiment of the review."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -8*n - 4 = -10*n for n.","output":"To solve the equation -8n - 4 = -10n for n, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable (n) To isolate n, first we'll move all the terms with n to one side of the equation. Add 10n to both sides of the equation to eliminate n from the right side: -8n + 10n - 4 = -10n + 10n This simplifies to: 2n - 4 = 0 Step 2: Solve for n Now, let's isolate n on the left side. To do this, add 4 to both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the right side: 2n - 4 + 4 = 0 + 4 This simplifies to: 2n = 4 Step 3: Divide by the coefficient Divide both sides of the equation by 2, the coefficient in front of n: (2n) / 2 = 4 / 2 This simplifies to: n = 2 So, the solution for the equation -8n - 4 = -10n is n = 2."},{"instruction":"Test for natural language inference.

Question: Why did Kai do this? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: show off for Casey B: fight back against Casey C: take self defense lessons Answer:","output":"B: fight back against Casey The question seeks an explanation for Kai's actions in breaking Casey's arm. According to the context provided, Casey assumed that attacking Kai would be an easy task. This assumption could stem from either underestimating Kai's abilities or overestimating their own. However, it is clear that Casey initiated the intention to attack and did not anticipate the outcome that followed. When Kai broke Casey's arm, it was in direct response to the attempted attack. This action communicates that Kai felt the need to protect themselves, assert their boundaries, and prevent potential harm, all of which align with the notion of fighting back against Casey's aggression. Answer A, showing off for Casey, would not be the best choice given the context—Kai's behavior is not in a showing-off or attention-seeking manner, but rather a defensive one. Answer C, taking self-defense lessons, is a less relevant answer, as it does not provide any insight or link to the scenario presented. While it could be inferred that Kai may have had prior self-defense training, it doesn't directly address the reasoning behind their actions. Thus, the most suitable answer according to the context provided is B: fighting back against Casey.

But now the west London park has the deluxe marquee to end all marquees: the rippling rooftop of the £14.5m Serpentine Sackler Gallery, designed by Zaha Hadid, which opens to the public on Saturday. Dipping and diving in sinuous waves, the white canopy is a new permanent extension to the Royal Park's Magazine, a former 1805 gunpowder store, five minutes' walk from the existing Serpentine Gallery on the north side of the Serpentine Bridge. It does what marquees usually do, housing the catering facilities for the new gallery space – only here, tea and biscuits are supplanted by a 120-seat restaurant as souped-up as the architecture, which will be run by German celebrity sushi chef Oliver Lange. Like a wedding marquee battling with a stiff breeze, the structure billows and eddies, swooping down to meet the ground at three points along its perimeter, before shooting up again in improbable gymnastic leaps. It is not quite clear what function all this overwrought writhing serves. \\"It is one of the most complicated structures we have worked on in the office,\\" says project architect Fabian Hecker, describing the lengthy process of \\"form finding\\" with three sets of engineers to \\"push the limits of what the material can do\\". Hadid, a long-serving trustee of the Serpentine, designed the first of the gallery's annual temporary pavilions in 2000, and was again hired to build a canopy of PVC mushrooms in 2007. The Sackler building continues her ongoing pursuit of tensile structures, this time made of PTFE-coated glass fibre fabric (as used for the Millennium Dome), stretched between a twisting roller-coaster steel frame. Its edge is clad with a clunky fibreglass trim that juts out sharply like the peak of an Ascot hat, looming clumsily over the fine Georgian brickwork of the Magazine. Designing a building where the roof meets the floor in one continuous surface means you see things that would otherwise be hidden – the unfortunate result here being an edge of crumpled fabric, stuffed unceremoniously behind the gutter. It has the crudeness expected of the gallery's summer pavilion, not a multi-million pound permanent home. Entering the building feels like being swept under the voluminous swirling petticoats of a Toulouse-Lautrec dancer, although the lightness you would imagine from a floaty tent is strangely absent. Instead, the opaque roof feels heavy and smothering, hanging low over the curved glass wall that runs around the edge of the space, so you can't really see the surrounding park at all. The ceiling is held aloft on five soaring steel columns that puncture the open-plan room like great urinals, each rising to an ovular opening that funnels light down their concave shafts. Dotted with a kitchen pod and cantilevered bar in wipe-clean whiteness, the whole place has the look of a space-age sanitary wares showroom, a slightly naff prelude to what lies beyond. The understated star of the show is the gunpowder store itself, open to the public for the first time in the building's 208-year history, now converted into a series of gallery spaces with the help of conservation architect Liam O'Connor. Most recently used to store the Mall's flagpoles, the building is what Hecker describes as a \\"house within a house,\\" the 1805 store enclosed by outer walls in the 1860s, with a Palladian portico added on the front in the 1920s. Subtle acts of surgery have now stitched the pieces together, forming a layered sequence that echoes the classical form of the existing Serpentine Gallery across the lake. A top-lit ambulatory gallery wraps around the central store, lined with plasterboard walls, providing a jacket to the inner sanctum of the two brick barrel-vaulted gunpowder chambers, dimly-lit and grotto-like spaces left raw, with exposed beams overhead. A northern wing of services and staff offices has also been added to the building, in the same Georgian dress as the original. Not that much of this can be seen for now, as the artist of the opening show, Argentinian Adrián Villar Rojas, has shrouded the interior with a brilliant installation that transforms the space with a new sculpted facade. Featuring cracked clay walls and a floor of loose-laid bricks, the piece has an earthy quality that engages with the building's own history and materiality, throwing into relief the starched white prissiness of what stands next door. It also includes a gigantic clay elephant charging head-first at the crumbling building – an apt metaphor, perhaps, for the architect's approach.

An unnamed archivist (Pete Postlethwaite) is entrusted with the safekeeping of humanity's surviving store of art and knowledge. Alone in his vast repository off the coast of the largely ice-free Arctic, he reviews archival footage from back \\"when we could have saved ourselves\\", trying to discern where it all went wrong. Amid news reports of the gathering effects of climate change and global civilization teetering towards destruction, he alights on six stories of individuals whose lives in the early years of the 21st century seem to illustrate aspects of the impending catastrophe. These six stories take the form of interweaving documentary segments that report on the lives of real people around the year 2008 and switch the film's narrative form from fiction to fact. In addition to the framing narrative in 2055, the news clips and the documentary footage of the six personal stories, the films includes animated segments and brief interviews with Mark Lynas and George Monbiot, created for the film.[citation needed]","output":"What are the six personal stories from the early 21st century that the unnamed archivist (Pete Postlethwaite) discovers in the film, and how do they illustrate the aspects of the impending climatic catastrophe in a world ravaged by catastrophic climate change?"},{"instruction":"That John coughed bothers me. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To evaluate the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"That John coughed bothers me,\\" I will analyze its syntax, semantics, and pragmatics to understand if it is a well-formed sentence that conveys meaning effectively. Step 1: Syntax analysis The sentence follows an object-subject-verb (OSV) word order: - Object: \\"That John coughed\\" (a noun clause) - Subject: (implicitly) \\"it\\" or \\"the fact\\" - Verb: \\"bothers\\" In English, the most common word order is subject-verb-object (SVO); however, variations in word order can be seen in more complex sentences. In this case, the OSV word order is acceptable and grammatical. Step 2: Semantics analysis Let's analyze the meaning of the individual words and phrases: - \\"That John coughed\\": This noun clause conveys the idea of an event where John coughed. - \\"bothers me\\": This part of the sentence indicates that the speaker is disturbed or annoyed by something. When combined, the sentence's overall meaning is that the speaker is disturbed or annoyed by the event of John coughing. Step 3: Pragmatics analysis Understanding the context in which the sentence is used will determine its appropriateness in a conversation. If the speaker were discussing concerns about a cough during a pandemic, the sentence would be contextually appropriate. However, if the conversation were unrelated to health or well-being, the sentence might seem out of place. From this analysis, I conclude that the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"That John coughed bothers me\\" is acceptable. Its syntax is complex and less-common, its semantics are clear, and the pragmatics would be appropriate in a relevant conversational context."},{"instruction":"Read the below conversation.

In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the... Answer:","output":"The name who supported himself in England, with the help of George Grove and others, by giving recitals is Camille Saint-Saëns. He escaped to temporary exile in England during the Paris Commune, where he was able to support himself through the assistance of George Grove and other acquaintances by giving recitals."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Lance spotted a wet beaver in the river. Where might have lance been? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. dictionary B. books C. australia D. seaside E. countryside Answer:","output":"E. countryside Lance might have been in the countryside when he spotted a wet beaver in the river. This answer is the most suitable for several reasons. Beavers are typically found in forested areas near rivers, streams, and ponds because they create their habitat by building dams and lodges using tree branches and mud. These animals are known for their strong preference for these natural environments, which are conducive to their overall survival and wellbeing. The countryside generally boasts regions teeming with vegetation, forests, and bodies of water that provide ideal conditions for numerous species, including beavers. In this setting, Lance would have encountered an environment that not only fosters the presence of beavers but also supports their ability to thrive. Moreover, rivers and other water sources that meander through the vast countryside offer adequate spots from which he could observe this fascinating animal. Examining the other options: A. Dictionary - A dictionary is a reference book containing the meanings, pronunciations, and other information about words. While it might be possible to find an illustration of a beaver or learn more about the creature, Lance cannot spot a wet beaver within the pages of a dictionary. B. Books - Although books can provide information about wet beavers, including descriptions of their natural habitats, and possibly even include pictures of them, Lance cannot physically see a live, wet beaver by merely perusing a book. C. Australia - Beavers are not native to Australia, as their primary habitats are in North America and Eurasia. Thus, it would be highly unlikely for Lance to spot a wet beaver in a river in Australia. D. Seaside - Beavers are creatures predominantly found in freshwater environments, such as rivers, streams, and ponds. While the seaside can contain rivers, the presence of saltwater from the sea or ocean may create unsuitable living conditions for beavers and make it less likely for them to reside near the coast. In conclusion, taking all factors and available options into consideration, the most suitable answer to where Lance might have been when he spotted a wet beaver in the river is the countryside. This location presents the mammals with ample opportunities to build their homes and maintain their unique way of life, making it an ideal place for both beaver and human observers alike."},{"instruction":"Answer this question. Who was the trainer of the 2010 Grand National winning horse Don't Push It?","output":"The trainer of the 2010 Grand National winning horse Don't Push It was Jonjo O'Neill. Jonjo O'Neill is a former Irish National Hunt jockey-turned-horse trainer who has made a significant impact in the world of British jump racing. Born on April 13, 1952, in Castletownroche, County Cork, Ireland, O'Neill began his riding career at the age of 16. Over the years, he achieved great success as a jockey, winning the 1977–78 British jump racing Champion Jockey title and several notable races like the Cheltenham Gold Cup, Queen Mother Champion Chase, and the King George VI Chase. In 1986, his riding career was cut short due to a battle with cancer. However, O'Neill refused to stay away from the sport and transitioned into a training role shortly after. The early years of his horse training career were marked by a steep learning curve and it took time to establish himself as one of the premier trainers in the United Kingdom. Over the years, O'Neill has built a strong reputation thanks to his unwavering passion for the sport and the success of his training yard, Jackdaws Castle. The facility is located in the heart of the Cotswolds and has a fantastic track record, producing several champion horses including multiple Cheltenham Festival winners. The 2010 Aintree Grand National saw Jonjo O'Neill reach the pinnacle of his training career as the racehorse Don't Push It, ridden by renowned jockey Tony McCoy, claimed victory. The win marked the first Grand National victory for both O'Neill and McCoy, making it exceptionally memorable. Don't Push It, a 10-year-old gelding sired by Old Vic, showcased immense skill and endurance on the Aintree course in Liverpool, England, to claim the win over 39 other competitors. The victory at the 2010 Grand National solidified Jonjo O'Neill's status as one of the most accomplished and respected horse trainers in the world of British jump racing. Today, he continues to train and develop world-class racehorses, contributing significantly to the rich history of horse racing in the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Walt Disney World Basically Just Opened a Theme Park for Gourmet Food If you vacationed at Walt Disney World in the past few years, you probably wound up at Downtown Disney, grabbing a table at Planet Hollywood or eating dinner beside a larger-than-life dinosaur in a Mesozoic Era-themed restaurant. While the old classics still remain (yes, T-Rex is as busy as ever), so, so much has changed since your past visit. Not only does the dining, shopping, and entertainment district now have an entirely new name—Disney Springs—it’s essentially become a year-round food festival. Disney dis has unveiled a slew of new dining, drinking and dessert outposts with more to come in the next year—which, when combined with the pre-existing food trucks, vegan delights, and upscale restaurants makes for quite the grub festival on park grounds. The best part? Nearly all of it opened last week, meaning your next trip to Disney World will feel like you’ve fallen into a foodie paradise. Where else can you walk around on Disney property chowing on everything from taiyaki red bean cakes to traditional poutine? Start studying your menus and get ready to eat the wildest, weirdest and most wonderful food Disney World has to offer. Sorry, EPCOT—this is the place to eat your way around the world. A food kiosk called The Daily Poutine is now open, focusing on the Canadian fried favorite of thick-cut fries slathered in cheese curds and gravy. (And we thought we had it good with American-style cheese fries!) An Italian version with mozzarella and Bolognese sauce, a French-style poutine with mushroom cream sauce and Gruyere and even a Latin version done with fried yucca, queso fresco, black beans and pulled pork are all available. Yesake has unleashed sake slushies and hand roll burritos mixing Asian flavors with Mexican mainstays and Indian spices, and Morimoto Asia also welcomed Morimoto Street Food last week, a quick-service food stand and outdoor patio offering twists on traditional Japanese delights like donburi rice bowls, kimchi bao tacos, and even Takoyaki—an octopus-filled Tokyo street staple. If after all that, you’re still hungry for some worldly tastes, B.B. Wolf’s Sausage Co. offers Portuguese Sausages and Bavarian Sausage Sandwiches—not to mention a 3 Little Pigs sampler, which lacks in international flavors but makes up for it with a pun on a bun.

You can chow on pizza as quickly as your cupcakes, too, once Blaze Pizza opens in Disney Springs later this summer. Their signature “Fast Fire’d” pizzas and create-your-own pies are cooked up in just three minutes—perfect for picky eaters or when you time a pre-fireworks visit to Disney Springs a bit too close. Chow down on inventive versions of your old favorites The Disney-operated D-Luxe Burger opened on Sunday and is already putting inferior picnic favorites to shame with their unique menu. Not only are there homemade veggie burgers (vegetarians, rejoice!) and a chorizo-blend El Diablo burger, but the fries are where it starts to get interesting, with six different dipping sauces will be offered free of charge. Even their milkshakes are kicked up a notch, using gelato instead of ice cream and offering hard versions, like a smoked bourbon and beer flavor, that are well beyond what you’d get at the burger joint back home. And, of course, even the fanciest dessert you know gets a makeover at D-Luxe with a Red Velvet Burger Macaron, a tiny dessert hamburger that looks just like the real thing, right down to the last drop of ketchup—or, in this case, raspberry sauce. And, if that wasn’t enough, Aristocrepes will serve up a menu of both sweet and savory options of the thin French favorite when it opens this coming weekend. The s’mores and Key lime cheesecake crepes are somewhat straightforward, but rumblings of a beef with horseradish cream and cheddar option and a smoked salmon crepe with cream cheese, capers and an “everything bagel” topping are simply wild.

It is computed as the residual of all revenues and gains over all expenses and losses for the period, and has also been defined as the net increase in shareholders' equity that results from a company's operations. In the context of the presentation of financial statements, the IFRS Foundation defines net income as synonymous with profit and loss. The difference between revenue and the cost of making a product or providing a service, before deducting overheads, payroll, taxation, and interest payments. This is different from operating profit (earnings before interest and taxes). Can we conclude that are net earnings and net income the same?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that net earnings and net income are essentially the same. Both terms refer to the remaining amount of money a company has after subtracting its costs, expenses, and taxes for a specific accounting period. They are used interchangeably in financial statements and business discussions. To recap, net income, also known as net earnings, total comprehensive income, net profit, bottom line, gross profit, gross margin, sales profit, or credit sales, is calculated by taking an entity's total revenues and gains, then subtracting its cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and taxes. This calculation results in the net increase in shareholders' equity from the company's operations during the accounting period. Both net income and net earnings are important indicators of a company's financial performance, as they provide insights into its profitability. By comparing net income across different companies, industries, and time periods, one can better understand the sustainability and growth potential of a business. It is important to note that net income should not be confused with other financial metrics such as operating profit (earnings before interest and taxes) or gross profit. Operating profit measures a company's performance before accounting for interest and taxes, while gross profit focuses on profitability after only accounting for the cost of goods sold. In conclusion, net earnings and net income are the same and can be used interchangeably to describe a company's remaining profit after accounting for all costs, expenses, and taxes during a specific period. This metric is an essential tool for understanding a company's financial health and potential for future growth."},{"instruction":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"(2).\\" sentiment (Possible answers: (1). negative; (2). positive;).","output":"To write a short movie review with positive sentiment, I will follow these steps: 1.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

We present the discriminative recurrent sparse auto-encoder model, comprising a recurrent encoder of rectified linear units, unrolled for a fixed number of iterations, and connected to two linear decoders that reconstruct the input and predict its supervised classification. Training via backpropagation-through-time initially minimizes an unsupervised sparse reconstruction error; the loss function is then augmented with a discriminative term on the supervised classification. The depth implicit in the temporally-unrolled form allows the system to exhibit far more representational power, while keeping the number of trainable parameters fixed. From an initially unstructured network the hidden units differentiate into categorical-units, each of which represents an input prototype with a well-defined class; and part-units representing deformations of these prototypes. The learned organization of the recurrent encoder is hierarchical: part-units are driven directly by the input, whereas the activity of categorical-units builds up over time through interactions with the part-units. Even using a small number of hidden units per layer, discriminative recurrent sparse auto-encoders achieve excellent performance on MNIST.","output":"Task: Generate a headline (title) for the given article text, keeping it under 15 words.

She runs into her mysterious ex-boyfriend El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) at the Bone Shack, a BBQ restaurant owned by J.T. Hague (Jeff Fahey) and his sheriff brother (Michael Biehn). Meanwhile, a group of officials at a nearby US military base, led by the demented Lt.

These verses explicitly state that pork is forbidden for Muslims. 4.

Jan pulled herself out of the bed and stood up, looking around the dark room for anything. She needed something, something that she could grab onto, and hold, hold until it hurt, hold until blood made racing red lines down her arms, until her hands were raw. She left the room and walked quietly into the now guest room that had been Rob's. Opening the closet, she found the teddy bear that Rob had once confided in and held it in her arms tight as she slumped down on the bed. A quiet sobbing rang through the house accompanied only by the chime of the grandfather clock in the living room every fifteen minutes. As Jan lay on the guest room bed she soon resorted to deep gasps, knowing that meager tears would never be forceful enough to express her worry to those that listened. \\"Just bring him home, bring him home, bring him home,\\" she mumbled over and over, each time changing the tone slightly in a desperate attempt to make her pleading sound more real. She could hear the occasional snore of her husband and she hated him for it. What kind of person could find sleep at a time like this? Why wasn't he awake worrying? Why wasn't he with her? Her thoughts became dark like blood, evil little monsters eating at her sanity. If her son was crazy and not just a drug addict she could see how easy it was to fall over the line. \\"Please God, please God, please God, please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob.\\" Soon, a sleep came but it was peppered with demons. And as the sliver of sun peeked through the window, she held her false self-control tight and said little. Why did Jan need to hold the teddy bear? - not enough information - She had a nightmare peppered by demons. - She hated her husband for being able to sleep. - It belonged to her son and she wants him to come home. Answer:","output":"Jan needed to hold the teddy bear because it symbolized a connection to her son, Rob, who she was deeply worried about. Her anxiety and concern for him led her to seek comfort and solace in something that belonged to him and served as a reminder of his presence. Moreover, Rob had once confided in the teddy bear, which made it even more special and significant in Jan's heart. In the quest for emotional support and something physical to hold on to, Jan chose the teddy bear. Holding it not only provided her with a sense of security and connection but also allowed her to channel her emotions and pour her love and worry into it. As she clutched the bear tightly and let her tears flow, it became an emotional anchor, keeping her from completely falling apart in her time of need. Jan's intense feelings of agony and helplessness had deepened due to her husband's indifference. She felt isolated and abandoned, wondering how he could sleep while their son was missing or in trouble. This emotional turmoil made her detest him and amplified her need for the comfort that the teddy bear provided. Her dark, paranoid thoughts and fears for her son's safety and well-being invaded her dreams, tormenting her even in her sleep. This connection with the teddy bear was a desperate attempt by Jan to find hope, to plead for her son's return, and to wish for some divine intervention or a miracle to bring him back home. The teddy bear represented not only her son's innocent childhood but also Jan's longing to protect and care for Rob, despite the uncertainty of his situation. Clinging to the bear served as an emotional expression of her devotion and maternal instinct, as well as her desperate need to feel close to her son while battling her misery and despair."},{"instruction":"How does this story end?

The AP's obituary says Sulzberger \\"led the newspaper to new levels of influence and profit amid some of the most significant moments in 20th-century journalism.\\" It notes that he improved the paper's finances by making it more \\"reader-friendly\\" with the introduction of color presses and sections devoted to topics such as science, food, and entertainment. His son Arthur Jr. runs the paper today. Expand this summary.","output":"Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the former New York Times publisher who played a pivotal role in transforming the newspaper, has passed away at the age of 86. His grandfather had purchased the publication in 1896, and Sulzberger took the helm in 1964, guiding the paper for over three decades. During his tenure, Sulzberger focused on upholding journalistic integrity while ensuring financial stability to support the paper's operations. A key moment in Sulzberger's career came with the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971. This move sparked a significant Supreme Court case that ultimately reinforced freedom of the press in the United States. Under Sulzberger's leadership, the New York Times attained new heights of influence and profitability, shaping some of the most critical moments in 20th-century journalism. One of Sulzberger's strategic decisions was to enhance the paper's financial status by making it more reader-friendly. He achieved this by introducing color presses and creating sections dedicated to niche topics such as science, food, and entertainment. This attention to reader interests contributed to a broader appeal and increased revenue for the New York Times. Today, Sulzberger's legacy continues with his son, Arthur Jr., at the helm of the renowned newspaper, ensuring its ongoing presence as a prominent media outlet in an ever-evolving industry."},{"instruction":"If the products ordered are unavailable DYMO reserves the right not to ship products In that case DYMO will inform the customer that the products are unavailable and return any payment received Add punctuation.","output":"If the products ordered are unavailable, DYMO reserves the right not to ship the products.

One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face.

Here's a step-by-step analysis: Step 1: Identify the information in the premise. The premise tells us the following: - There are two dogs: one black and one white. - The dogs are wrestling. - They are wrestling next to a food dish. Step 2: Identify the information in the hypothesis. The hypothesis tells us the following: - There are two dogs: one black and one white. - The dogs are fighting. - They are fighting over a toy. Step 3: Compare the information from the premise and the hypothesis. - Both the premise and the hypothesis mention two dogs (one black and one white), which is consistent. - The premise mentions wrestling, while the hypothesis mentions fighting. Although these actions have some similarities, they are not the same. Wrestling could be playful behavior between the dogs, while fighting implies a more aggressive and possibly violent interaction. - The premise says that the dogs are next to a food dish, but the hypothesis says that they are fighting over a toy. There is no mention of a toy in the premise, and the presence of a food dish does not imply that there is a toy involved. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Based on the comparison of the information in both the premise and the hypothesis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The presence of a food dish does not imply that the dogs are fighting over a toy, and the difference between wrestling and fighting also suggests that the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."},{"instruction":"Solve -15*p + 50 = -40 for p.

Amusic people often cannot tell the differences between two songs. As a result, songs sound like noise to an amusic. Many amuics compare the sound of music to pieces of metal hitting each other. Life can be hard for amusics. In fact, most people cannot begin to understand what it feels like to be an amusic. Just going to a restaurant or a shopping center can be uncomfortable or even painful. That is why many amusics have to stay away from places where there is music. However, this can result in social loneliness. \\"I used to hate parties,\\" says Margaret, a seventy-year-old woman who only recently discovered that she was amusic. By studying people like Margaret, scientists are finally learning how to identify this unusual condition. Scientists say that the brains of amusics are different from those of people who can enjoy music. The difference is complex , and it is not connected with poor hearing. Amusics can understand other non-musical sounds well. They also have no problems understanding common speech. Scientists compare amusics to people who just can't see certain colors.

Article: Trying to recover from a devastating economic crisis, Spain is considering moving the country's clock back by one hour. Many people regard long afternoon naps and late dinners as perfect aspects of the Spanish way of life. Until the 1940s, Spain was on the same time as Britain and Portugal. In World War II, Spain and Portugal moved the clocks forward to align them with Nazi Germany. The same happened in Portugal. After the defeat of Hitler, Portugal returned to Greenwich Mean Time, but Spain did not. \\"The fact that for more than 71 years Spain has not been in its proper time zone means we sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization recommends,\\" lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament wrote in a proposal.\\"This has a negative effect on productivity, absenteeism, stress, accidents and school drop-out rates.\\" Last September, a parliamentary commission recommended that the government turn back the clocks by one hour and introduce a regular eight-hour workday. For the time being, the Spanish government is treating the campaign seriously but it hasn't taken any action yet. Spain's time zone issue explains why everything in Spain happens later, from meal times to broadcast entertainment (primetime doesn't start until 10 pm). Many urban Spaniards complain of a never-ending workday that begins in the morning but is interrupted by a traditional late-morning break and then again by the midday siesta--a two-hour long lunch and nap that usually start at 2 pm. If workers return to their desks at 4 pm, they end up working late into the evening. Under the proposed new schedule, the lunchtime break would be cut to an hour or less. The interruption-filled Spanish workday would be replaced by something closer to a 9-to-5 schedule. Ignacio Buqueras, president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours, told The New York Times that changing the Spanish schedule would be good news for working mothers. It would also allow families more free time together and boost Spain's economic... Question: Which of the following is the best title for the passage? Options: A: Lifestyle changes in Spain B: Time for Spain to turn back C: Spain's time zone issues D: Spain's work hour regulation Answer:","output":"B: Time for Spain to turn back This title best represents the passage because it captures the main topic of discussion: Spain's consideration to move the country's clock back by one hour. This decision is presented in the context of efforts to recover from an economic crisis and to address various socio-economic issues. These issues range from productivity and absenteeism to stress, accidents, and school dropout rates, which lawmakers believe are linked to Spain's non-alignment with its geographically corresponding time zone for over 71 years. The tile \\"Time for Spain to turn back\\" effectively encapsulates these themes, suggesting both the simple act of adjusting the clock and the broader societal changes and improvements that this could facilitate. Other options like \\"Lifestyle changes in Spain,\\" while they touch upon relevant aspects such as meal times and the traditional late-morning break, do not capture the essence of the article as effectively. \\"Spain's time zone issues\\" is on the right track but may be too narrow in scope, since the article also addresses economic and societal issues, rather than just the matter of time zone alignment. \\"Spain's work hour regulation\\" also fails to encompass all the themes addressed in the article, most notably the proposal to shift the country's time.

Basketball basics: Basketball is a sport typically played by two teams, each consisting of five players on the court at a time. The primary objective is to score points by shooting the ball through a hoop called the \\"basket.\\" However, in casual games or practice sessions, it's common to see just two people playing one-on-one. 3. Offensive and defensive roles: In a basketball game, players take on both offensive and defensive roles, usually switching back and forth as possession of the ball changes. The offensive player tries to score points, while the defensive player attempts to block or prevent scoring. 4. The given scenario: Considering that the sentence describes two young men playing basketball, it would involve one player having the ball (the offensive player) and trying to score points by making a basket, while the other player (the defensive player) would be trying to defend the basket and prevent the first player from scoring. 5. Conclusion: Given the nature of the basketball game and the information provided in the sentence, it is true that one young man would be defending while the other attempts to make a basket."},{"instruction":"Write a [b]. yelp review (Possible answers: [a]. negative.

From the moment I walked through the door, I could tell this dining experience was going to be a positive one. The beautiful, calming ambiance and the welcoming staff set the stage for what would be one of the most phenomenal meals I have ever enjoyed. Upon being seated, we were immediately greeted by our friendly and knowledgeable server, Jessica, who provided us with complimentary glasses of refreshing and crisp sparkling water. She was incredibly attentive and took the time to walk us through the diverse, ever-changing menu, making sure to share her recommendations and accommodate any dietary restrictions. We began our meal with a delightful assortment of appetizers: the perfectly seared scallops served atop a bed of succulent heirloom tomatoes and a drizzle of basil-infused oil, together with the crispy calamari tossed in a zesty citrus aioli. Both dishes were perfectly executed, leaving an explosion of flavors on our taste buds and creating a harmonious balance of textures that left us craving more. For our entrees, I chose the pan-seared Chilean sea bass, while my partner opted for the mouthwatering filet mignon. The sea bass, flaky and moist, was perfectly complemented by the rich and creamy lobster risotto and a vibrant saffron beurre blanc. The tender and juicy filet mignon, cooked to absolute perfection, was accompanied by a smooth and velvety potato puree and a generous helping of sautéed wild mushrooms. Without a doubt, The Culinary Oasis managed to elevate both dishes to new heights, showcasing the remarkable skills of the chefs. As if the meal itself wasn't enough, the dessert selection was just as impressive! We couldn't resist trying the decadent triple chocolate mousse cake and the refreshingly light lemon tart. Each dessert presented the perfect balance between sweetness and acidity – the ideal end to a beautiful meal. Throughout the evening, the service remained exceptional. Our server, Jessica, always made sure our glasses were full and our needs were met. The attentiveness of the staff, paired with the restaurant's tranquil atmosphere, allowed us to fully immerse ourselves in the dining experience. The Culinary Oasis is undoubtedly a unique restaurant with an enchanting charm in both its atmosphere and culinary offerings. If you are in search of a one-of-a-kind dining experience and are longing to indulge in a remarkable meal filled with passion and creativity, I highly recommend The Culinary Oasis. I know I'll definitely be returning soon!"},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What is another name for school?

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would zone B have less or more oxygen than zone A? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away.

NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said.

Lisaius, former crime reporter for KOLD News 13, and his wife, former KGUN 9 reporter and local journalist Krystin R. Lisaius, took their child to the Oro Valley Hospital, after observing that the child was “wabbly,” “became limp,” was “unable to wake up” and that her “eyes were rolling” into the back of her head. Krystin Lisaius described the child as “ragdoll-like,” according to the police report from the Oro Valley Police Department.While at the Oro Valley Hospital, the Lisaiuses refused to allow hospital staff to perform a blood draw on their child. Sometime later, the parents left with the child against medical advice, but agreed to have her transferred to Banner University Medical Center for further evaluation. The child was transported to Diamond Children’s Hospital via a Golder Ranch Fire District ambulance around 1 p.m.While at Banner, the parents were once again uncooperative and did not allow a toxicology screen on the child.After previously denying the use of cocaine, Krystin Lisaius admitted to using the drug by “snorting it” through her nose with Somchai Lisaius and a friend named \\"Thomas\\" on Saturday, May 14 while at their family home after hosting a barbecue earlier in the day. She also told a UMC social worker she had been breastfeeding the child. She stated that she didn’t think the baby would be affected after 12 hours had passed. She also refused all lab tests on the child except a heel blood stick, body scans and physical exams.In the presence of representatives of the Office of Child Welfare Investigations and Department of Child Safety, Banner UMC staff conducted a urinalysis as well as a toxicology screen that showed the presence of cocaine in the child’s system. An OVPD officer performed a blood draw analysis on Krystin Lisaius after obtaining a search warrant.OVPD detectives interviewed the couple, who both admitted to recent cocaine usage at their home and said that there was cocaine present at their home.Thomas, who is also the child’s godfather, was interviewed by OVPD and said he was “good friends” with the couple and was at the Lisaius’ home on that night for a party.According to the police report, Thomas stated, “I saw her (Krystin Lisaius) do one line, tops.” He also stated that he ingested cocaine with Somchai Lisaius through a rolled-up receipt from a bathroom countertop.During the course of investigation, Somchai Lisaius told OVPD detectives that on the same evening, he and his wife hosted a barbecue at their home for a birthday celebration, including family and friends. Somchai Lisaius eventually admitted that he used cocaine that night, having initially denied the act, and that he used the drug “every six weeks or so.” He also said that he has witnessed his wife using cocaine since having their child.Somchai Lisaius turned over a key to the residence to authorities for the purpose of searching the house. He also told the officers that there was cocaine in the home and where to find it. A voluntary search of his black, four-door BMW yielded no results.On May 16 at approximately 8:40 p.m., OVPD detectives served a search warrant on the Lisaius residence, at which they located “one clear baggie” containing a white powdery substance, a Hilton Hotel honor’s card belonging to Krystin Lisaius with white residue on it, several baggies of assorted sizes and a small black digital scale.All together, nearly 2 grams of cocaine was found in the residence.On June 1, the urinalysis and lab test results from Krystin Lisaius came back positive for the presence of cocaine, though a hair test came up negative. According to the police report, the hair report only came back negative because of “Ms. Lisaius having bleached hair.” Somchai Lisaius’s hair and urine tested positive for cocaine. The baby’s results for hair tested positive for cocaine.Somchai Lisaius first joined the Tucson reporting scene in 2000 after having worked in Michigan and attending Alma College for a bachelor’s degree in English and Boston University for a master’s degree in broadcast journalism.Krystin Lisaius attended Pima Community College before receiving a bachelor’s degree in broadcast journalism and met her husband when she was brought on as an intern into the KOLD newsroom in 2012.During the course of the investigation at the hospital, the child’s medical status was deemed “good” and is expected to make a full recovery.On Monday, June 27, Somchai and Krystin Lisaius both pleaded not guilty to possession of a dangerous drug, drug paraphernalia and child abuse after being indicted on June 9. The child is in the custody of the Department of Child Safety.According to KOLD-TV, Somchai Lisaius was terminated from employment.While speaking to thelocal attorney Michael Piccarreta, who is representing the Lisaiuses in court, called the whole thing an “unfortunate” and “isolated” incident that would never happen again.“Fortunately,” he said, “when you get to the underlying facts, the facts are that these are excellent parents.

Answer: On Day 3, there were 25 crickets remaining. Explanation: On Day 1, there were 70 crickets initially. The number of crickets decreased by 30% on Day 1. To find the number of crickets remaining at the end of Day 1, we calculate the decrease: 70 * 0.30 = 21 crickets. Now, we subtract that 30% (21 crickets) from the initial number: 70 - 21 = 49 crickets remaining at the end of Day 1. On Day 2, 6 crickets were lost. Therefore, we subtract those 6 crickets from the remaining number at the end of Day 1: 49 - 6 = 43 crickets remaining at the end of Day 2.

Available choices: i. yes. ii. it is not possible to tell. iii. no.","output":"Based on the description given, the lawsuit filed in the District Court articulates that the restrictions imposed on the use of LSC (Legal Services Corporation) funds were in violation of the First Amendment. The First Amendment references the United States Constitutional amendment that, among other things, ensures freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Considering these points, there isn't sufficient data to definitively conclude that \\"The suit insisted that the funds should only be used in limited ways.\\" Instead, the focus of the suit appears to center primarily around asserting that constraints on the utilization of LSC funds encroach upon rights secured by the First Amendment. It would, however, be judicious to access additional information to further clarify the exact nature, interpretation, and specifics of the restriction in question, before arriving at a conclusion. For instance, details about the kind of restrictions on the use of LSC funds, and precisely what the complainant's legal team argued regarding these restrictions could provide crucial context for interpreting the lawsuit's claims. Review of the primary court documents, legal briefs, and discussions from both the complainant's and defendant's sides could lend more understanding to the intent and specifics of the lawsuit. It would be especially useful to comprehend the concerns or violations the plaintiffs felt were significant enough to warrant invoking a First Amendment defense. Furthermore, gaining a broader understanding of how LSC funds are typically used and the historical, social, and legal contexts in which these funds operate could provide deeper insight into the complainant's motivations for bringing the lawsuit.

Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.

The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: To answer this question, let's first consider the various factors that influence the behavior of raindrops and the weather overall. We know that the formation of raindrops is the result of the condensation of water vapor, and their movement is subject to numerous atmospheric variables such as air temperature, humidity, air pressure, and wind patterns. These variables are intertwined and influenced by countless small-scale interactions and larger, complex weather systems. As we attempt to predict when a specific raindrop will fall on a particular spot, we encounter issues with the sheer unpredictability of the atmospheric conditions. For example, wind patterns can change rapidly and are influenced by temperature variations, air pressure differences, and the Earth's rotation, leading to a highly dynamic and chaotic system. Furthermore, the formation and movement of raindrops are also affected by turbulence in the atmosphere, which causes them to follow erratic paths and makes it difficult to track their movement precisely. Additionally, there are countless raindrops in a single rain event, and their interactions and collisions with each other can alter their trajectories in unexpected ways. When considering all of these factors, predicting the exact moment a specific raindrop will fall on a particular spot in a given location becomes extraordinarily complex. Modern weather models and simulations already struggle to provide accurate predictions for general weather conditions on short timescales, let alone pinpointing a specific raindrop's landing position. The inherent randomness and chaos of the atmosphere's properties push our current tools, technology, and understanding to their limits. Given all these reasons, it is not possible to tell when a specific raindrop will fall on a particular spot, as the vast number of interacting factors at play render it an immensely unpredictable and chaotic system."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I have a chronic illness, and so I received quite a few sterling gems in the months between onset and accurate diagnosis.

It should be said beforehand that few of these theories were embodied. He was sure it was something in my ladybrains that was preventing proper function of the rest of me. Dr Douche said so much weird, wild, and just-plain-unbelievable crap over the course of my diagnosis that someday I may create a novel that incorporates it all.

After a few probing questions — (only in the morning? — no, but it’s worst in the morning)… “Maybe,” he said sensitively, “you’re afraid.” “Of standing?” I asked, just to be sure. “You think I’m afraid of… standing up.” Maybe he meant there was some kind of existential fear, like, we’re all afraid, it’s a big old universe out there, and he wanted some comfort and reassurance.

Sen. Jon Kyl, R.-Ariz., says that Republicans are hesitant about extending the payroll tax holiday, a provision that many economists say will spur hiring. It’s also a provision that will pull money away from the Social Security trust fund if Congress doesn’t find a way to pay for it. “The payroll tax holiday has not stimulated job creation,” said Kyl while on “Fox News Sunday.” “We don’t think that’s a good way to do it.” Congress has until the end of the year to extend the payroll tax holiday. If it fails to act businesses will likely increase the amount of money that is taken out of your paycheck to pay for Social Security taxes. “I think that just defies logic,” said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., also on “Fox News Sunday,” in response to Kyl’s remarks.

The app has so much to offer - from its seamless user interface to its secure and robust messaging capabilities. Nonetheless, perfection requires dedication to constant growth, and while I give Telegram four stars, it's not without its quirks. Firstly, the app deserves appreciation for its impressive security measures. Utilizing end-to-end encryption, Telegram ensures that my messages and voice calls remain confidential. As a privacy-conscious individual, this is of utmost importance to me. I also appreciate that Telegram allows users to set self-destruct timers on messages, further enhancing the app's security feature-set. Secondly, the ability to create channels and groups with a large number of members is a major selling point for this app. I've witnessed first-hand how seamlessly Telegram handles communities of thousands of people, making it easier to disseminate information or coordinate group activities. Adding to the convenience, Telegram's cross-platform synchronization ensures that I can access my messages from multiple devices without issues. Moreover, the file-sharing feature is commendable. The 2 GB limit per file and compatibility with various file formats make it easy to share important documents and media among friends and colleagues. Consequently, it has eliminated the need to use third-party solutions for file sharing, and keeping everything under one platform has streamlined my communication needs immensely. The app, however, could improve in a few areas. For instance, the search functionality within chats can be cumbersome, making it difficult to locate a specific message or media file. As the platform continues to grow, refining the search feature will become increasingly important for users. Another room for improvement lies with video call quality. In comparison to other mainstream messaging apps, Telegram's video calls can be unstable at times, with seemingly random lags in audio and video. This is an area where the developers could focus their energy on optimization and stability, ensuring that this popular feature doesn't take a backseat in quality. Lastly, I believe adding the ability to customize fonts, chat backgrounds, and other visual aspects of the app could benefit user experience. While Telegram's current aesthetics are visually appealing, they could allow users more freedom in personalization. In conclusion, Telegram Messenger (org.telegram.messenger) is an excellent messaging app that excels in many areas, most notably security, group management, and file sharing. While there are a few aspects that could use improvements, such as search functionality, video call quality, and customization options, Telegram is well on its way to becoming the perfect messaging app. For now, I confidently give it 4 stars, knowing that with continued innovation in the face of its few shortcomings, Telegram is an app that users will continue to turn to for their communication needs."},{"instruction":"Israel #39;s parliament made a historic decision in backing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon #39;s plan to withdraw settlers from the Gaza Strip and four small West Bank settlements.

Instead of reaching for the roll of paper towels, use a hand dryer to save trees and water. To replace the paper towels that we discard on a daily basis, 51,000 trees have to be cut down every day. To produce one ton of paper towels, 17 trees are cut down and 20,000 gallons of water are required. Using hand dryers as opposed to paper towels cuts down significantly on waste. On a global scale, our discarded paper towels result in an estimated 254 million tons of trash every year. In the United States we consume over 13 billion pounds of paper towels every year. While thoroughly washing your hands is the best way to prevent the spread of germs, drying your hands also decreases the spread of bacteria. According to the CDC, germs are more easily transferred to and from wet hands. If you wash your hands and do not dry them, you usually end up with water stains all over your clothes. Use a hand dryer to prevent this from happening. While hand dryers can help reduce your carbon footprint, they still have an environmental impact. They require electricity to run, and thereby play a role in carbon dioxide emissions. Drying your hands with the typical 2,200 watt warm air-dryer three times a day for one year produces 26.61 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. To evaluate the carbon footprint of using hand dryers, also think about how your local electric company generates electricity. The more coal it uses, the more carbon the dryer produces. Researchers have concluded that paper towels are the more hygienic and sanitary choice. Here are some of the main reasons why hand dryers are less effective at decreasing the spread of germs: Dryers in public places are rarely cleaned. People often stick their hands in the dryers or on the rim, leaving bacteria on the surface. The dryers can blow bacteria onto other surfaces and onto people using them. In a study published in the Journal of Hospital Infection, researchers determined that jet dryers left 4.5 times more bacteria in the vicinity than warm-air dryers, and 27 times more bacteria than paper towels. Other researchers, however, have questioned the methods employed in the study. Summary:","output":"Using hand dryers instead of paper towels can help save trees and water, reduce waste, and potentially minimize bacteria transfer, though their environmental impact varies depending on the electricity source and hygiene concerns due to the spread of bacteria from unclean or high-powered dryers."},{"instruction":"Born in Dublin and reared on the south side of Dublin near Sandymount, he is a native Irish speaker and was educated at both Scoil Lorcáin and Coláiste Eoin.

This person appears to come from a creative and accomplished family deeply rooted in Irish culture. His father, Pádraig Ó Snodaigh, was a publisher and author who worked primarily in the Irish language, contributing to the preservation and promotion of native Irish culture and language. His mother, Cliodhna Cussen, was an artist, which shows a source of creativity in the family. He received his education at Scoil Lorcáin and Coláiste Eoin, which are both Irish-medium schools. This reveals his deep immersion in Irish culture and history since his school-years. Following this, he pursued higher education in an English-speaking institution, University College Dublin, where he completed a degree in Physiotherapy in 1988. His choice of a healthcare-related field shows his dedication towards societal welfare. Additionally, he has five brothers: Fergus, Aengus, Cormac, Rónán, and Rossa.

His great-uncle, Dennis Cussen, was a remarkable sportsman, holding a world record for fastest time over 100 yards on grass for a period of time. He was also a competitive athlete who represented Ireland in the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, participating in the 100 yards competition. But perhaps his most notable achievement was scoring a famous hat-trick of tries against England during a rugby match in 1926.

The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi....

Were the Great Pyramids built by a theocratic government?","output":"Before answering the question, let's analyze the key elements mentioned: the Great Pyramids and a theocratic government. The Great Pyramids, specifically the Pyramids of Giza, are a group of architectural marvels in Egypt constructed primarily as tombs for the pharaohs during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom (around 2580–2560 BC). The most famous of these pyramids is the Great Pyramid of Giza, built as the tomb of the Pharaoh Khufu. The construction of the pyramids was a monumental undertaking that required a well-organized workforce and a significant amount of resources. A theocratic government is a form of governance in which a divine entity or religious institution is recognized as the supreme authority, merging political rule and religious doctrine. In such governments, religious leaders often hold direct or indirect political power. Now, let's examine whether or not the Great Pyramids were built under a theocratic government: Ancient Egypt, during the era of the construction of the Great Pyramids, was characterized by a theocratic government. The Pharaoh, who commissioned the building of the pyramids, was considered to be both a divine and mortal ruler, with absolute power over both religious and secular affairs. The pharaoh was seen as the embodiment of the god Horus on earth and was responsible for maintaining the balance between the gods and humanity, known as the concept of Ma'at. Therefore, based on the fact that the Great Pyramids were commissioned and constructed under the rule of the Egyptian Pharaohs, who held both religious and political authority, we can conclude that the Great Pyramids were indeed built by a theocratic government."},{"instruction":"Question to you: Emphysema is often cause by exposure to: Options: - (A) high temperature - (B) fog - (C) Greenhouse gasses - (D) rays or beams - (E) hot steam - (F) tobacco smoke - (G) Pollution - (H) incendiary people.

The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention. I am facing a new situation today: Two neighbors Paul and Dean studied toghether often. this week they got together and Paul started studying about the Gaia hypothesis, while Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity.

As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert.

Jack Andraka from Crownsville, Maryland, developed a simple dip-stick test for levels of mesothelin, a biomarker for early stage pancreatic cancer found in blood and urine. It promises to revolutionise treatment of the disease, which currently kills 19 out of 20 sufferers after five years - largely because its so difficult to detect until its final stages. Prodigy: Jack Andraka speaks after receiving Smithsonian Magazine's first annual American Ingenuity Award for youth achievement in Washington, DC. last November. He has invented a new test for pancreatic cancer. Jack's invention, for which he was last month awarded the grand prize of 75,000 in scholarship funds at the 2012 Intel Science Fair, means that patients now have a simple method to detect pancreatic cancer before it becomes invasive. His novel patent-pending sensor has proved to be 28 times faster, 28 times less expensive, and over 100 times more sensitive than current tests. Thanks to the test, pancreatic cancer. patients could now get an early earning to seek medical help when it. still has a chance of working, which could, he claims, potentially bump. up survival rates to 'close to 100 per cent'. Deadly: Pancreatic cancer is the same form of the disease that caused late Apple CEO Steve Jobs' long decline and eventual death. The test works in a similar way to diabetic testing strips, with his paper strips using only a drop of blood to determine whether patients carry the mesothelin biomarker. It is said to be over 90 per cent accurate, practically instant - and costs only 3 cents. And what's more, his simple test can also be used to detect ovarian and lung cancer, and it could be easily altered to detect the biomarkers of a range of other conditions. 'What’s so cool about that is its applicability to other diseases…for example other forms of cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, environmental contaminants like E Coli, salmonella,' Jack told Take Part. 'All for three cents for a test that takes five minutes to run.' Jack was moved to come up with the. test after a family friend passed away from pancreatic cancer, but it. was as he surreptitiously read a journal article about carbon nanotubes. in a biology lesson that he had his 'epiphany'. But. that eureka moment was not enough; the persistent teenager was rejected. by 197 scientists he solicited for help with his research - with some. plainly telling him his idea simply would not work. A cluster of pancreatic cancer cells: The disease currently kills 19 out of 20 sufferers after five years - largely because its so difficult to detect until its final stages when patients are less likely to respond to treatment. To come up with his new pancreatic cancer test, Jack mixed human mesothelin-specific antibodies with conductive single walled carbon nanotubes. He used the mixture to coat strips of ordinary filter paper, making them conductive, and determined the optimal layering using a scanning election microscope. Cell media spiked with varying amounts of mesothelin was then tested against to the paper biosensor and any change in the electrical potential of the sensor strip (due to the changing conductivity of the nanotubes) was measured. Changes in conductivity occurred because the antibodies on the strips binded to the mesothelin and enlarge, spreading the nanotubes further apart and changing the electrical properties of the network. The more mesothelin applied, the more the antibodies would grow and the weaker the electrical signal would become. Andraka's sensor costs 3.00 and 10 tests can be performed per strip, taking 5 minutes each. The test is said to be 168 times faster, 26,667 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive than current testing methods. Finally Dr Anirban Maitra, a professor of pathology and oncology at Johns Hopkins University, agreed to give him space in the lab and mentored him through the process of developing the test. To create the test, Jack mixed human mesothelin-specific antibodies with single-walled carbon nanotubes used the product to coat strips of ordinary filter paper. The nanotubes make the paper conductive, but when mesothelin is applied the antibodies would bind to the biomarker and enlarge, spreading the nanotubes apart and changing the strips' electrical properties. The more mesothelin present, the more antibodies bind and grow, and the weaker the electrical signal becomes - allowing scientists to accurately measure the levels of the biomarker. Now the teenage prodigy has plans to mass-market the tests and make them widely available to the public, which he believes could alter the balance of power in medicine. 'Essentially what I’m envisioning here is that this could be on your shelf at your Walgreens, your Kmart,' he said. 'Let’s say you suspect you have a condition…you buy the test for that. And you can see immediately if you have it. 'Instead of your doctor being the doctor, you’re the doctor.'

Options are: [I] yes. [II] it is not possible to tell. [III] no.","output":"[III] no. The premise \\"A group of people surround a tree as someone places dirt to bury the roots.\\" presents a scenario where people are gathered around a tree, seemingly showing care and nurturing behavior by burying or replanting its roots. This suggests that they have a positive or protective attitude towards the tree. They might be planting a new tree or taking care of an existing one by ensuring its roots are properly covered with soil for better growth and stability. On the other hand, the statement \\"People chopping down a tree.\\" depicts an opposite scenario, where people are taking an action that could lead to the destruction or removal of the tree. Chopping down a tree usually involves cutting through its trunk, compromising its structural integrity and ultimately causing it to fall or be removed. This action is usually performed when a tree needs to be eliminated due to various reasons such as disease, danger, improper location, or harvesting its wood. These two scenarios are incompatible with one another. The first scenario shows people taking care of a tree by burying its roots while the second scenario has people destroying or damaging a tree by cutting it down. The actions and intentions behind both situations are contradictory, making it impossible for the premise to be true if the statement \\"People chopping down a tree.\\" is occurring.

People from underprivileged areas that suffer from poverty, unemployment, and lack of resources, are seeking new opportunities in more prosperous countries. Additionally, conflicts and political instability in certain regions have led to the displacement of people who are in search of refuge and safety. Countries receiving these immigrants face challenges in terms of integration, social cohesion, and the provision of public services. Consequently, both the source and destination countries are experiencing various impacts due to this cross-border movement. Hypothesis: Investing in comprehensive policies and targeted programs aimed at improving living conditions and promoting socioeconomic development in the source countries, as well as facilitating orderly and legal migration channels, can reduce the negative consequences of mass migration and promote regional stability and global cooperation. To support this hypothesis, the following points can be considered: 1. Addressing the root causes (economic, social, political) of migration in the source countries: By implementing sustainable development programs, improving access to education, and creating employment opportunities, the standard of living in these regions can be increased, making it less likely for people to seek a better life elsewhere. 2. Strengthening cooperation between source and destination countries: Through diplomatic efforts and cooperation on migration management, both parties can work together to better address the issue and identify mutually beneficial solutions. This can include sharing best practices, providing technical assistance, and engaging in joint projects. 3. Providing safe and legal migration channels: By establishing clear and accessible pathways for regular migration, the risks associated with irregular routes (such as human trafficking, exploitation, and xenophobia) can be mitigated. This can also lead to better integration and social cohesion, as legal migrants are more likely to have access to resources and support. 4. Enhancing support for refugees and displaced persons: By committing to international conventions and treaties on refugee protection and providing adequate resources for their reception and integration, countries can help alleviate the global refugee crisis and contribute to the stabilization of affected regions. 5. Promoting migrant integration and social cohesion: By developing and implementing policies that foster the inclusion of migrants in the receiving societies, the potential tensions between locals and newcomers can be reduced, and the benefits of diversity and cross-cultural exchanges can be realized. 6. Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of migration policies and programs: By continuously assessing the outcomes of implemented strategies, learning from best practices, and adapting policies as necessary, countries can ensure their migration management approaches are tailored to their specific contexts and needs."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the fact that: Developing nations will also increase demands on natural resources as they build more factories.

But while the Christmas lights may be switched on and shopping underway for most people, new research reveals that a staggering 6.7 million consumers will leave buying Christmas presents until Christmas Eve. And it appears that last minute present shopping won’t be the only festive faux pas made this year. Millions of Brits now leave their Christmas shopping to the last minute, some even have to recycle old gifts. The latest study found that nearly a quarter of Brits claim to have bought Christmas presents and later forgotten where they hid them, with women nearly twice as likely to misplace festive gifts around the house. And it seems we’re a bunch selfish shoppers with one in five of us claiming to have kept a present for ourselves, despite it being intended for someone else. Similarly one in seven have gone Christmas shopping and only bought gifts for themselves. Men are the worst offenders, with one in five claiming not to buy presents until Christmas Eve, compared to just one in ten 10 women. Men are the worst offenders when it comes to last minute shopping, with one in five claiming not to buy presents until Christmas Eve, compared to just one in ten 10 women. In addition, one in ten have bought last-minute gifts from petrol stations on their way to see loved ones, while one in ten have even wrapped up something used that they already own and given it as a present. Duncan Jennings, co-founder of VoucherCodes.co.uk, who carried out the research, said: 'There’s a lot to organise at Christmas but there’s no excuse for buying presents at a petrol station. 'With most retailers offering multiple ways to shop, online, in-store or even through a smartphone, picking up a gift has never been easier. 'Shoppers should consider writing a list of gifts they need to buy before they get started to keep them on track and help them avoid hefty last-minute delivery costs. 'We also tend to see huge discounts appearing in the lead up to Christmas, so getting organised and buying presents early will not only help consumers reduce seasonal stress, but can also save them a heap of cash.'

A significant number of consumers, estimated at around 6.7 million, will leave their Christmas shopping until Christmas Eve, leading to last-minute purchasing and various festive mishaps. 2. One-quarter of Brits admit to having forgotten where they hid their Christmas presents, with women being nearly twice as likely to misplace gifts in their homes. 3. Selfish shopping behavior is quite common, as one in five people have kept a present intended for someone else, while one in seven have dedicated their Christmas shopping exclusively to themselves. 4. Men rank worse in last-minute shopping, with one in five not buying presents until Christmas Eve, compared to only one in ten women. 5. Many last-minute shoppers turn to petrol stations for gifts, with one in ten having bought a present from a petrol station en route to visiting loved ones. 6. Co-founder of VoucherCodes.co.uk, Duncan Jennings, advises consumers to create shopping lists, shop early, and take advantage of discounts in the lead up to Christmas to help reduce stress and save money. 7. Other common festive mistakes include wrapping up used items from home as presents (10% of consumers) and leaving all shopping until Christmas Eve (15%)."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - Castleman disease, also known as giant lymph node hyperplasia, lymphoid hamartoma, or angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, is a group of uncommon lymphoproliferative disorders that share common lymph node histological features that may be localized to a single lymph node (unicentric) or occur systemically (multicentric). It is named after Benjamin Castleman. - Rhadinovirus (also known as \\"Rhadinoviridae\\" and gamma-2 herpesviruses) is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. Human and mammals serve as natural hosts. There are currently nine species in this genus including the type species Saimiriine herpesvirus 2. Diseases associated with this genus include: Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease, caused by Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). The term rhadino comes from the Latin fragile, referring to the tendency of the viral genome to break apart when it is isolated. - Neonatal conjunctivitis, also known as ophthalmia neonatorum, is a form of conjunctivitis and a type of neonatal infection contracted by newborns during delivery. The baby's eyes are contaminated during passage through the birth canal from a mother infected with either \\"Neisseria gonorrhoeae\\" or \\"Chlamydia trachomatis\\". Antibiotic ointment is typically applied to the newborn's eyes within 1 hour of birth as prevention against gonococcal ophthalmia. Most hospitals in the United States are required by state law to apply eye drops or ointment soon after birth to prevent the disease. If left untreated it can cause blindness. - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells. - Herpesviridae is a large family of DNA viruses that cause diseases in animals, including humans. The members of this family are also known as herpesviruses. The family name is derived from the Greek word \\"herpein\\" (\\"to creep\\"), referring to the latent, recurring infections typical of this group of viruses. \\"Herpesviridae\\" can cause latent or lytic infections. - A DNA virus is a virus that has DNA as its genetic material and replicates using a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The nucleic acid is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either \\"Group I\\" or \\"Group II\\" of the Baltimore classification system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although \\"Group VII\\" viruses such as hepatitis B contain a DNA genome, they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather reverse transcribing viruses because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. Notable diseases like smallpox, herpes, and chickenpox are caused by such DNA viruses. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Gammaherpesvirinae is a subfamily of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae. Viruses in \\"Gammaherpesvirinae\\" are distinguished by reproducing at a more variable rate than other subfamilies of Herpesviridae. Mammals serve as natural hosts. There are currently 32 species in this subfamily, divided among 4 genera. Diseases associated with this subfamily include: HHV-4: infectious mononucleosis. HHV-8: kaposi's sarcoma. - Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is inflammation of the outermost layer of the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelid. It makes the eye appear pink or reddish. There may also be pain, burning, scratchiness, or itchiness. The affected eye may have increased tears or be \\"stuck shut\\" in the morning. Swelling of the white part of the eye may also occur. Itching of the eye is more common in cases due to allergies. Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes. The most common infectious causes are viral followed by bacterial. The viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a common cold. Viral and bacterial cases are easily spread between people. Allergies to pollen or animal hair is also a common cause. Diagnosis is often based on signs and symptoms. Occasionally a sample of the discharge is sent for culture. Prevention is partly by handwashing. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. In the majority of viral cases, there is no specific treatment. Most cases due to a bacterial infection will also resolve without treatment; however, antibiotics can shorten the illness. Those who wear contact lens and those with either gonorrhea or chlamydia as the cause should be treated. Allergic cases can be treated with antihistamine or mast cell inhibitor drops. About 3 to 6 million people get conjunctivitis each year in the United States. In adults viral causes are more common, while in children bacterial causes are more common. Typically people get better in one or two weeks. If there is visual loss, significant pain, sensitivity to light, signs of herpes, or a person is not improving after a week, further diagnosis and treatment may be required. Conjunctivitis in a newborn, known as neonatal conjunctivitis, may also require specific treatment. - The Herpesvirales is an order of viruses all sharing the same overall morphology. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - Equine herpesvirus 2 ( EHV - 2 ) is a virus of the family Herpesviridae , originally known as equine cytomegalovirus due to its slow replication in tissue culture . However , complete sequencing of the EHV - 2 genome has demonstrated that it is a member of the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae , in the genus Rhadinovirus . . It has an uncertain role in respiratory disease in horses , but EHV - 2 has been isolated from cases exhibiting symptoms such as coughing , conjunctivitis , and swollen submaxillary and parotid lymph nodes . - A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.

Lib Dem Tim Farron says generations to come will not forgive that position. The Supreme Court will announce next Tuesday whether the government needs to seek Parliament's approval. Ministers say they already have enough powers under the Royal Prerogative to go ahead with Brexit. But campaigners argue that starting Brexit in this way would be undemocratic and unconstitutional. In June's referendum, 51.9% of voters backed leaving the EU, while 48.1% supported remaining in the 28-nation group. Mr Corbyn said he did not think it was right to block Article 50 in the wake of the referendum result. \\"It's up to us to use the opportunity that's provided to stop the Tories from doing this bargain basement, low tax haven on the shores of Europe,\\" he told the BBC. \\"What I'm saying to all of my MPs is we've supported the principle of holding the referendum, the referendum was held, it delivered a result - I don't think it's right to block Article 50 negotiations. \\"It's absolutely right that we're involved in these negotiations and making the case for a fairer and socially just Britain.\\" Asked if that meant he would be imposing a three-line whip - the strongest available sanction - on Labour MPs, requiring them to back Article 50, he said: \\"It means that all Labour MPs will be asked to vote in that direction next week or whenever the vote comes up.\\" However, a senior Labour source has told the BBC between 60 and 80 of the party's MPs might be ready to defy the leadership if there is a vote in Parliament. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis said the government's current position is \\"unacceptable\\" and he wants further assurances. Another Labour MP told the BBC there would be a \\"swathe\\" of resignations from the front bench if Mr Corbyn instructed his MPs to vote for Brexit. The MP said that for colleagues in constituencies that voted strongly for Remain it would be \\"suicide\\" to back Article 50. And Labour's Mike Gapes, who has been outspoken in his criticism of Mr Corbyn in the past, told the Ilford Recorder he would not be toeing the party line. \\"I am going to vote against triggering Article 50 and let me be clear, I am going to be as loyal to Jeremy Corbyn as he was to previous Labour leaders,\\" he said. \\"I will show the same loyalty he did when he voted, 500 times, against the Labour whip under successive party leaders. The people of Britain did not vote to become poorer and I will not vote in favour of any deal that would see us leave the single market.\\" BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said nobody expected Parliament to stop Brexit being triggered, but Mr Corbyn could struggle to keep his party's position coherent, whether he insists on a three-line whip or not. Lib Dem leader Mr Farron accused Labour of \\"lamely\\" giving up against the government's drive for a hard Brexit. He said he believed Mr Corbyn had put the party on the wrong side of the biggest political issue in a generation. \\"I think what Labour has done is to believe this is too difficult for them politically, let's just wait for it to go away, and the meeker we are, the quicker it will go away,\\" he told the Guardian. \\"I think that's the calculation they've made, and this and future generations are not going to forgive them for that. \\"It's not divisive to hold the government to account, and not just to lamely give up as we go over a cliff, and that is what Labour are doing - they are being the most ineffective opposition in living memory.\\" Mr Farron added that his party, which has just nine MPs, would not consider an electoral deal with Labour because Mr Corbyn is \\"electorally toxic\\".

The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements. Guess a valid title for it!

Campaign supporters feared the residential development would end the spot's lucrative sideline as a film and photo location, on which it relies to survive. As part of a breast cancer awareness campaign, Winehouse appeared in a revealing photograph for the April 2008 issue of Easy Living magazine. Winehouse had an estimated PS10m fortune, tying her for tenth place in the 2008 The Sunday Times listing of the wealth of musicians under age 30. The following year her fortune had dropped to an estimated PS5m. Her finances are run by Mitch and Janis Winehouse. It was reported she earned about PS1m singing at two private parties during Paris Fashion Week. as well as another PS1m to perform at a Moscow Art Gallery for Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. Winehouse loaned a vintage dress used in her video for \\"Tears Dry on Their Own\\" as well as a DVD to the British Music Experience, a new museum dedicated to the history of British pop music. The museum, located in The O2, opened on 9 March 2009. In January 2009, Winehouse announced that she was launching her own record label. The first act on her Lioness Records is Winehouse's 13-year-old goddaughter, Dionne Bromfield. Her first album, featuring covers of classic soul records, was released on 12 October 2009. Winehouse is the backing singer on several tracks on the album and she performed backing vocals for Bromfield on the television programme Strictly Come Dancing on 10 October. Winehouse and her family are the subject of a 2009 documentary shot by Daphne Barak titled Saving Amy. Winehouse entered into a joint venture in 2009 with EMI to launch a range of wrapping paper and gift cards containing song lyrics from her album Back to Black.

Muna Farah is a divorced Palestinian Christian mother raising her teenage son Fadi. She works for a bank in Ramallah, part of the West Bank, Palestinian territories. Each day after work, Muna picks up Fadi from school and crosses through an Israeli checkpoint in order to get to their home in Bethlehem. She lives with her aging mother and has occasional visits from her brother Samer. One day after arriving home, Muna discovers that she has been awarded an American green card through the lottery. Although she initially considered declining the offer, Muna reconsiders after she and Fadi are harassed at the checkpoint by Israeli soldiers. They arrive in the United States shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to stay with her sister's family in Illinois. After a difficult time with customs, Muna is reunited with her sister, Raghda Halaby, physician brother-in-law Nabeel and their three children Salma, Rana, and Lamis. Later, however, Muna discovers that a box of cookies was confiscated during the customs search and is horrified: the box contained all of her life savings. Muna thus searches for work, but is disappointed to discover that her multiple degrees and work experience do not guarantee the kind of employment she is seeking. She finally takes a job at White Castle. Too ashamed to tell her family the truth, she pretends to have been hired by the bank next door to White Castle. She maintains the facade through the help of an employee of the bank next door to White Castle and her blue-haired high school drop-out co-worker, Matt.

Imagine you're at the beach, and your favorite area where you love to play is surrounded by a big safety rope. This means you can't go and play there right now. Let's find out why. A little while ago, a man was visiting a beach, just like the one you might go to. Unfortunately, while he was there, something very sad happened. A big part of the cliff that was next to the beach broke away and fell down onto the sand below. This type of thing is called a \\"cliff collapse.\\" The man was hurt very badly by the falling rocks and dirt, and he didn't survive his injuries. Because of this sad accident, some grown-ups who are in charge of keeping everyone safe decided it would be best to block off a section of the beach. They did this so that they can study the area and figure out why the cliff fell down. They also want to make sure no more rocks or dirt fall and hurt anybody else while they're fixing the problem. So, when you go to the beach, and you see a place that's closed off with a big safety rope, it's really important to stay away from it. The grown-ups in charge have put it there for a very good reason. They want everyone to be safe and have fun, and they're working hard to make sure nothing like this happens again. Remember, kids, it's very important to obey the rules when you're at the beach, or anywhere else you might go. If an area is closed, it's for your safety, and you should always listen to the grown-ups who are looking out for you. In conclusion, cliff collapses can be very dangerous, and it's essential to stay away from any areas that have been cordoned off. Beaches can still be a fun and exciting place to visit, but keep in mind the safety rules and follow them to make sure everyone can have a good time without any accidents."},{"instruction":"Article: The point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically. The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators.

The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging.

It was traditionally shown every Thursday evening on BBC One, except for a short period on Fridays in mid-1973 before being again moved to Fridays in 1996 and then to Sundays on BBC Two in 2005. Each weekly programme consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, there was a special edition of the programme on Christmas Day (and usually, until 1984, a second such edition a few days after Christmas), featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year. By 1994, much of the 'Year Zero' revamp was quickly undone and the arrival of Ric Blaxill as producer in February 1994 signalled a return to presentation from established Radio 1 DJs Simon Mayo, Mark Goodier, Nicky Campbell and Bruno Brookes. Blaxill expanded the use of \\"via satellite\\" performances, taking the acts out of studios and concert halls and setting them against landmark backdrops. As a consequence, Bon Jovi performed Always from Niagara Falls and Celine Dion beamed in Think Twice from Miami Beach. The last remnants of the Year Zero revamp were replaced in 1995, when a new title sequence, logo and theme tune were introduced (the logo having first been introduced on the new programme Top of the Pops 2 some months previous), coinciding with the introduction of a new set. Blaxill also increasingly experimented with handing presenting duties to celebrities, commonly contemporary comedians and pop stars who were not in the charts at that time. In an attempt to keep the links between acts as fresh as the performances themselves, the so-called \\"golden mic\\" was used by, amongst others, Kylie Minogue, Meat Loaf, Des Lynam, Chris Eubank, Damon Albarn, Harry Hill, Jack Dee, Lulu and Jarvis Cocker. Radio 1 DJs still presented occasionally, notably Lisa I'Anson, Steve Lamacq, Jo Whiley and Chris Evans. TOTP was traditionally shown on a Thursday night, but was moved to a Friday starting on 14 June 1996, originally at 7 pm, but then shifted to 7.30 pm, a change which placed the programme up against the soap opera Coronation Street on ITV. This began a major decline in audience figures as fans were forced to choose between Top of the Pops and an episode of the soap. What happened in 1996","output":"In 1996, the Top of the Pops (TOTP) TV show, which played popular music, changed when it was moved from its regular Thursday night spot to Friday nights. This change made the show compete with a popular soap opera called Coronation Street. Because of this, fewer people watched Top of the Pops, so its audience became smaller."},{"instruction":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Platters is an American vocal group formed in 1952. They were one of the most successful vocal groups of the early rock and roll era. Their distinctive sound was a bridge between the pre-rock Tin Pan Alley tradition and the burgeoning new genre. The act went through several personnel changes, with the most successful incarnation comprising lead tenor Tony Williams, David Lynch, Paul Robi, Herb Reed, and Zola Taylor. Convinced by Jean Bennett and Tony Williams that \\"Only You\\" had potential, Ram had the Platters re-record the song during their first session for Mercury. Released in the summer of 1955, it became the group's first Top Ten hit on the pop charts and topped the R&B charts for seven weeks. The follow-up, \\"The Great Pretender\\", with lyrics written in the washroom of the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas by Buck Ram, exceeded the success of their debut and became the Platters' first national #1 hit. \\"The Great Pretender\\" was also the act's biggest R&B hit, with an 11-week run atop that chart. In 1956, the Platters appeared in the first major motion picture based around rock and roll, Rock Around the Clock, and performed both \\"Only You\\" and \\"The Great Pretender\\". The Platters' unique vocal style had touched a nerve in the music-buying public, and a string of hit singles followed, including three more national #1 hits and more modest chart successes such as \\"I'm Sorry\\" (#11) and \\"He's Mine\\" (#23) in 1957, \\"Enchanted\\" (#12) in 1959, and \\"(You've Got) The Magic Touch\\" (#4) in 1956. The Platters soon hit upon the successful formula of updating older standards, such as \\"My Prayer\\", \\"Twilight Time\\", \\"Harbor Lights\\", \\"To Each His Own\\", \\"If I Didn't Care\\", and Jerome Kern's \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\". This latter release caused a small controversy after Kern's widow expressed concern that her late husband's composition would be turned into a \\"rock and roll\\" record. It topped both the American and British charts in a Platters-style arrangement. The Platters also differed from most other groups of the era because Ram had the group incorporated in 1956. Each member of the group received a 20% share in the stock, full royalties, and their Social Security was paid. As group members left one by one, Ram and his business partner, Jean Bennett, bought their stock, which they claimed gave them ownership of the \\"Platters\\" name. A court later ruled, however, that \\"FPI was a sham used by Mr. Ram to obtain ownership in the name 'Platters', and FPI's issuance of stock to the group members was 'illegal and void' because it violated California corporate securities law.\\" The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in its inaugural year of 1998. The Platters were the first rock and roll group to have a Top Ten album in America. They were also the only act to have three songs included on the American Graffiti soundtrack that fueled an oldies revival already underway in the early to mid-1970s: \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\", \\"The Great Pretender\\", and \\"Only You (and You Alone)\\". Did they ever go on tour?","output":"Yes, The Platters did go on tours. They were a popular vocal group in the early rock and roll era, and they performed their hit songs like \\"Only You\\", \\"The Great Pretender\\", and \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" for their fans.

Justification: 1. Sun's heat enters the atmosphere: Sunlight reaches Earth and is absorbed by the surface, providing energy that warms the planet. 2. Greenhouse gases enter from the Earth: Human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. 3. Heat is trapped in the atmosphere: Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap some of the heat radiating from Earth's surface, preventing it from escaping back into space. This is known as the greenhouse effect. 4. Different things on Earth are hotter: Due to the trapped heat, Earth's average surface temperature increases, causing various effects such as melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events.

Q: For some backstory, my sister and I weren’t super close growing up. We argued and fought over just about everything, and honestly there were days when I couldn’t stand her attitude. When I moved away to college, we started getting closer because there was that distance between us and we didn’t see each other every day. We would still talk relatively frequently and did share quite a lot. Within the last few months, we both got really busy and haven’t been talking as much as we were before (cutting down from once or twice every couple weeks to once or twice a month). During this time, I found out I was pregnant. I knew it wasn’t the right time, my boyfriend and I are still in college and we want a family someday but we aren’t mentally, fiscally, or emotionally ready for a child. So I decided to terminate the pregnancy. I also decided not to tell my sister about this procedure before it was done. I was struggling with the decision that I had to make, and I was hurt and upset about even though it broke my heart, I knew it was the right decision. I didn’t want to talk to her about how I was feeling because I felt so guilty that I couldn’t let myself grieve, and I didn’t want to have to listen to her grieve over it while dealing with that. I told her after the procedure, and we talked about it a little bit but I didn’t go into detail. Lately people have been telling me (mainly her boyfriend, who is a friend of mine, and my mom) that she feels like I don’t ever want to talk to her and that she’s being replaced by the friend of mine who was living with me and was there when I found out I was pregnant. She never told me these things, I’m having to hear them from other people. I was angry about that, and reacted poorly by not reaching out for awhile after I heard how she was feeling. When I finally called, she and I got into a blow out argument about how she feels like she’s living on the outskirts of my life, and that she can’t believe I would be so shitty to not tell her beforehand and not reach out to her for support as I was going through all this. I understand she’s upset that I didn’t tell her, but I feel like I’m also entitled to my personal life and I’m not required to tell her about these things.

A guest, Lisolette Mueller, who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget. Duncan, aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey, directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe. Not heeding Duncan's directions, one last group takes an elevator to the ground, but are killed when it stops on the fire's floor. The fire also traps Bigelow and his secretary/mistress Lorrie in his 65th floor office, killing them. Security Chief Harry Jernigan and Roberts rescue Mueller and the family from 87. Jernigan gets the mother out safely but Roberts, Mueller and the two children are halted by a collapsed...

Choose fresh, in-season asparagus that has not gone limp or woody. Avoid asparagus that is brown or discolored; it won't taste good after freezing. Chop about one inch from the ends of the asparagus. The chewy texture of the ends is unpleasant, especially after freezing, so make sure you get rid of the entire dry or woody part. In order to retain its flavor, asparagus should be blanched before freezing. This is the process of boiling the asparagus for about 30 seconds and removing it from heat before it loses its crunch. The asparagus is plunged into ice water to stop it from cooking. Boil a large pot of water and prepare a large bowl of ice water. In order for the asparagus to blanch evenly, it's best to chop it into smaller pieces. If you'd prefer to leave the stalks intact, that's fine, but the flavor may be compromised. If your spears are extra-thick, boil them for longer; if they're thin, boil them for just thirty seconds. Monitor the asparagus carefully so you don't end up overcooking it. Use a slotted spoon to immediately transfer it to the ice bath so it can cool down and stop cooking. Leave it in the ice bath for the same amount of time you boiled it, then transfer it to a colander to let it drain and dry. Lay out the pieces on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place the sheet in the freezer. Freeze the asparagus for about one hour, until each piece is slightly ice. Flash freezing the asparagus before longer-term storage will keep the pieces from freezing together into a solid mass. Put the frozen pieces into a freezer bag or a plastic freezer container. Pack it as tightly as possible in order to remove most of the air. Label the container with the date. Frozen asparagus will keep for up to a year in properly cold conditions. There's no need to thaw asparagus before cooking; just add it to soups and other dishes frozen. Summary:","output":"To freeze asparagus, choose thick, fresh ones, and avoid brown or limp ones. Cut off the chewy ends and blanch the asparagus in boiling water for about 30 seconds to keep the flavor and crunch. Cool it in ice water, then dry it. Chop to smaller pieces, if you want. Freeze them on a baking sheet for an hour, then pack in a freezer bag or container. Label and store them for up to a year. You can cook frozen asparagus without thawing, just add it to your dish."},{"instruction":"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Use a mop and warm water to wet your tile flooring before using cleaning agents. Tile is porous and will absorb the water to prevent chemicals from penetrating the tile. You can loosen tough dirt before wetting the floor with a broom, or after the floor is wet using a plastic pot scrubber. Fill a bucket with warm water and a couple of drops of dish soap. Scrub the floor with a nylon or natural bristle brush. You can leave the cleaning solution on the floor for ten to fifteen minutes, as long as it you don’t let it dry on the tile. After scrubbing, rinse the flooring – twice, if possible – with plain water. Dry the flooring with terry cloth towels, if needed. If soap and water haven’t worked, try a household or commercial floor cleaner intended for ceramic tile. Find an inconspicuous area and make a small test spot with the cleaner. Use acid-based or chemical cleaner with caution, only if necessary and always following the manufacturer’s instructions. Make sure to thoroughly pre-wet the floor first, and completely rinse it afterwards. Acid-based cleaner may be necessary to remove lime or cement mortar staining. Never use abrasive cleaners like powdered cleansing agents, baking soda or even creams advertised as “mildly” abrasive. These can damage the tile’s surface and design. Fill a bucket with an ounce of Murphy Oil Soap, 1/2 cup white vinegar, and two gallons of warm water. Dip a toothbrush or other narrow brush into the bucket and gently scrub the grout. Avoid the tiling as much as possible. Since some contact with the tile is inevitable, perform a test first in a small area. Allow the diluted cleaner to air dry on the grout. Summary:","output":"This article provides a comprehensive guide on cleaning tile flooring using various methods, emphasizing the importance of pre-wetting the tiles, using appropriate cleaning solutions, and following specific techniques to protect both the tile and grout, while taking necessary precautions when using acid-based or chemical cleaners."},{"instruction":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: BEIJING--Heavy haze still covered north and east China on Saturday, with highways closed and flights delayed or canceled . The smoggy weather affected the country's land from north to south, including Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangxi and Guangdong, with visibility less than 50 meters in some areas. Cities like Shanghai and Nanjing have been enveloped in the grey sky for the past several days. Many walkers in the street had to wear masks. In the Lukou airport in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, more than 60 inbound and outbound flights were canceled on Saturday because of the hazy, which also forced primary and middle schools and kindergartens to stop classes on Thursday and Friday in Nanjing. The Ministry of Environmental Protection said earlier this week that there were several main reasons behind the widespread haze: unfavorable weather conditions making it difficult for pollutants to diffuse , motor vehicle exhaust , coal use for winter heating. The Chinese government now plans to clean up the air by cutting coal use, closing some factories and promoting cleaner production. \\"We must face up to the realities,\\" said Yan Naiqiang, a professor of environmental science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. \\"The treatment of smog will be a long battle.\\" A:","output":"Which of the following factors contribute to the widespread haze in China as mentioned in the article?

You can ask your boyfriend to refer you to reading materials, as he may know great places to read up on the conditions. People with ADD/ADHD may struggle to pay attention. Your boyfriend may zone out during conversations, for example, or struggle to sit still through a movie. People with ADD/ADHD may also be forgetful. If your boyfriend got the time wrong for a dinner date, he may have been listening to you earlier. He simply forgot the information. ADD and ADHD may cause poor organizational skills, so if you clean up after your boyfriend a lot, that's not necessarily because he's being rude. He just may struggle to keep up. People with ADD and ADHD may be more emotional and impulsive. Your boyfriend may suddenly blurt things out and may have a slight temper. It may be difficult to have a calm conversation with someone with ADD or ADHD. Talking with your boyfriend and asking him questions about his experiences with ADD or ADHD can also help you to gain valuable perspective. Some questions you might ask him to get a better sense of how ADD or ADHD affects him include: What is hardest about living with ADHD? Does it ever affect your emotions? Do you take medication? If so, how does the medication make you feel? Is there anything I can do to help? This is important to understanding your boyfriend's experience. When your boyfriend is frustrating you, pause for a second and consider his perspective. It is difficult to live with ADHD or ADD day in and day out. If your boyfriend is frustrating you, imagine how frustrated he must feel at himself. For example, you're angry because your boyfriend could not get out the door in time for a movie as he kept getting distracted along the way. While this is frustrating for you, think how your boyfriend must feel. He probably feels mad at himself for letting you down, and frustrated he's unable to manage his symptoms well enough for a simple movie date. You were probably drawn to your boyfriend for a reason. He is not completely defined by his ADD/ADHD. Try to remember why you like being with him when things get frustrating. Try making a mental list of everything you like about your boyfriend. Does he always make you laugh? Is he more tolerant of your grouchiness after work? Does he do nice things for you, like bring you coffee in the morning? If you remember why you're in the relationship, this can quell any feelings of resentment you have. You will be able to feel more empathetic for someone if you remember why you value them. Resentment can build up if you do not communicate regularly. Resentment can destroy empathy, so if something's bothering you, discuss it. Never make assumptions during a conversation. You do not understand why someone behaved the way they did without asking. Do not say, \\"You just don't care, which is why you never remember to take out the garbage. It's disrespectful.\\" Instead, say, \\"Is there a reason you're having trouble remembering to take out the garbage?\\" When your boyfriend talks, listen actively. Do not interrupt. If you need clarification, wait until your boyfriend's done talking and say something like, \\"I'm not entirely sure what you mean. Could you explain more?\\" Also, remember to laugh. Miscommunications are inevitable, and facing them with good humor can help reduce tension. If you're in a relationship with someone with ADD/ADHD, a lot of this person's actions can be read the wrong way. If your boyfriend interrupts you in mid-sentence, you may think he's not interested in what you have to say. If your boyfriend is 15 minutes late to a date, you may think he does not care about your time. These are symptoms of ADD/ADHD and do not necessarily speak to your boyfriend's character. It can take a long time for symptoms to be managed properly. There will be struggles along the way. In moments of frustration, say to yourself, \\"This is his ADHD. This is not him.\\" Remember, you're with this person for a reason. If he's struggling to manage his ADHD/ADD at the moment, this is not a permanent situation. Once symptoms are more under control, you'll be able to focus more on his good qualities. Summary:","output":"1. Research ADD/ADHD by browsing websites and reading pamphlets from local therapists to gain a better understanding of the condition. 2. Discuss the condition with your boyfriend and ask questions to understand his perspective and experiences. 3. Practice empathy by considering his struggles when dealing with the symptoms of ADD/ADHD. 4. Focus on the positive aspects of your relationship to remind yourself why you value each other. 5. Communicate openly and actively listen to each other to prevent resentment and miscommunications. 6. Remember that your boyfriend's actions related to his ADD/ADHD are a result of the condition, not a reflection of his character. 7. Be patient and supportive during the process of managing symptoms, knowing that improvement is possible."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a story, answer the question about the story.

(II) Place picture hanger hooks on the outside of the can and hook the handles of the trash bag inside those.","output":"OPT (II) Place picture hanger hooks on the outside of the can and hook the handles of the trash bag inside those makes more sense to accomplish this goal. Here is the justification for this choice: Step 1: Identify the problem - The problem is that trash bag falls inside the dust bin when it's not secured properly. Step 2: Compare both options - Consider the consequences and advantages of both options I and II. Option I: - Placing picture hanger hooks on the bottom of the can might obstruct the trash from being easily thrown into the bin. - It may also cause the trash bag to tear from the hooks due to the weight of the trash as well as the angle it's being pulled from. Option II: - Placing picture hanger hooks on the outside of the can allows for a more secure hold of the trash bag handles. - It does not obstruct the trash from being thrown into the dust bin. - It lessens the chances of the trash bag tearing, as the weight is uniformly distributed. Step 3: Determine the preferred option - From the comparison, Option II seems to be a better solution to the problem. Placing the picture hanger hooks on the outside of the dust bin allows the trash bag to be held securely without obstructing the process of throwing trash into the bin, resulting in a more practical and efficient solution.

Answer choices: - Organic compounds - Hair on the head - carbohydrates - Fast response time - The digestive system - Hair on the feet - deoxyribonucleic acid - organic molecules A:","output":"The body's growth and health are maintained through various factors, but considering the given choices, the best candidates would be organic compounds, carbohydrates, the digestive system, and organic molecules. 1. Organic Compounds: These are compounds mainly containing carbon and hydrogen, and they play a vital role in the body. They include proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. These compounds form the cells and tissues of the body, provide energy, help in the transportation of oxygen, and play essential roles in most of the biological processes. 2. Carbohydrates: Carbs are essential to the body as they provide energy for the body's various functions. They supply the body with the energy needed for the brain, kidneys, heart muscles, and other organs. 3. The Digestive System: The digestive system is crucial for breaking down food into nutrients, which the body uses for energy, growth, and cell repair. This system also helps to eliminate waste. 4. Organic Molecules: Organic molecules include proteins, fats, and carbohydrates; all of these are essential for body growth and maintaining health. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is also crucial as it carries the genetic information necessary for the body's growth and development. However, DNA, in and of itself, is not enough for the body to grow and remain healthy without the participation of other molecules and systems mentioned above. The other options -hair on the head, hair on the feet, and fast response time- do not directly contribute to the growth and health of the body in the way the others do. Hair (whether on head or feet) primarily acts as a protective barrier and doesn't contribute to body functions such as growth or maintaining health. A fast response time is more related to a person's reflexes and cognitive ability, but doesn't directly affect growth and health."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - \`\` She Looks Good in Velvet '' was Eighteen Visions ' second hit and first radio single .

Upon arrival, looks great, pond out front is a nice touch. Outdoor seating in the right weather looks like it could be really nice. Inside, its fine. Chips and salsa were delivered right away, and quite good to boot. Wife ordered chicken fajitas and I ordered beef fajitas. When they arrived, everything seemed OK, although both seemed overly greasy, and after a few bites, it was very greasy. The beef and the chicken had zero seasoning on them, they were both very bland. The sides they give to build the fajita are ok, but no sour cream? Seemed odd to have to pay for a side of sour cream when we were paying 18 per plate of fajitas. The house-made guac was very average. One last note about the beef - it was cooked to well done which made it quite tough. The portions were quite large. The service was good; offered informed suggestions and was prompt and polite. Overall, the experience was fun with the wifey. But the 18 fajitas left much to be desired.

President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does the investigative journalist group ProPublica think about separating children from their parents? Options: A. It disagrees with the policy B. It is not interested in the policy C. not enough information D. It agrees with the policy Answer:","output":"C. not enough information"},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the below context: English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create. Rusko said \\"She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of... Guess a valid title for it!

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. and the situation: Greg and Frank were two friends that studied natural sciences.

Ridden by Kieren Fallon, he stayed on strongly in the straight and finished third behind Nayef and the New Zealand gelding Hades with the other beaten horses including Marienbard and Tobougg. On 7 June, the colt was sent to England and attempted to become the first German-trained horse to win the Coronation Cup over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. Racing on soft ground, he started 4/1 third favourite behind Kutub (Preis von Europa, Gran Premio del Jockey Club, Singapore Gold Cup), and Storming Home. The other three runners were Marienbard, Zindabad (Yorkshire Cup), and Pawn Broker (Arc Trial). Fallon positioned the German challenger just behind the leader Zindabad before taking the lead entering the straight and tracking across to the stands-side (outside) rail. Boreal went clear of his rivals in the last quarter mile and won by three and a half lengths from Storming Home with Zindabad six lengths back in third.

But lawmakers remain split on passing a measure to overhaul former President Barack Obama's signature health law. Mr Trump vowed to repeal the law, known as Obamacare, during his 2016 campaign. Arizona Senator John McCain told CBS programme Face the Nation on Sunday that he believes the Republican bill is \\"probably going to be dead\\". But the Trump administration adopted an optimistic tone. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told Fox News Sunday the president expected the Senate to approve a healthcare bill either before the start of lawmakers' August recess \\"or maybe a little bit into\\" the summer break. Congress returned to Washington on Monday as a new survey highlighted the number of Americans without health insurance has grown by some two million this year, according to the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index. The Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, which would roll back parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act and cut the tax increases that fund it, has faced mounting challenges. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced late last month lawmakers would delay a vote on the measure until after the 4 July holiday recess. Liberal groups held protests to express their frustrations over the bill while lawmakers were home for the bank holiday last week. Eight Republican senators had announced they would oppose the bill and the party can only afford to lose two votes to pass it in the upper chamber. A version of the bill passed in the House of Representatives in May after facing a similar delay. Hardline conservatives like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have said they will not support the legislation, arguing the measure does not go far enough to dismantle the law, while moderate Republicans say the bill will harm some of their vulnerable constituents. The non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office (CBO) found the bill would strip 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade. The 142-page Senate draft phases out the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for low-income Americans, and imposes deep cuts to the policy. The bill also gives states more latitude in requiring insurers to provide essential health benefits guaranteed under Obamacare, including emergency and maternity care and mental health services. More than 20 million people gained healthcare coverage under Obamacare. Senator Cruz has proposed an amendment that would allow health insurers to sell cheaper, basic plans as long as at least one complies with Obamacare regulations, providing a loophole to the requirement that insurance companies charge sick and healthy consumers at the same rate. Mr Cruz and other conservatives argue it will help lower premiums for healthy Americans, but opponents say it strips protections for sick people and those with pre-existing conditions. A version of the bill with the Cruz amendment is being scored by the CBO. This article was about:","output":"This article is about the United States Congress trying to pass a new healthcare bill.
