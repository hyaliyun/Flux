Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Team Sky rider Froome - who led by 12 seconds overnight - broke away with 6.4km left of the first summit finish of this year's race to win emphatically in La Pierre-Saint-Martin. Richie Porte was second, 59 seconds back, with Nairo Quintana third. Tejay van Garderen lies second overall, two minutes 52 seconds behind Froome. Colombian Quintana, a highly regarded climber, had been widely expected to launch a major attack in an attempt to claw back time but he was overtaken by Porte in the final metres of a stage that was nigh on perfect for Team Sky. It was the fifth stage win of 2013 champion Froome's Tour de France career and puts the 30-year-old in a commanding position with 11 stages remaining. All of his main rivals lost significant time on a devastating afternoon, with Quintana now three minutes nine seconds behind in the overall standings, Alberto Contador four minutes four seconds back and defending champion Vincenzo Nibali a massive six minutes 57 seconds adrift of the Team Sky rider. \\"I'm lost for words,\\" said Froome, who was in the news overnight after it was revealed Team Sky believe their computers have been hacked by critics convinced he is using performance-enhancing drugs. \\"I could not believe it when I asked the guys to push on a bit and we were hearing on the radio about the big names being dropped. It was textbook from the team and I'm just over the moon to finish it off for them.\\" Froome could not have made a more decisive statement of his intent to claim his second Tour victory. He sat in with his Team Sky team-mates while Quintana's Movistar team made the early pace up the 15km climb towards the finish. A blistering rate soon saw riders disappearing out of the back of the leading groups, while at one point Froome appeared uncomfortable as he hung on at the back of a team-mate's wheel. But that proved to be nothing more than a ruse, and when Froome made his explosive move there was nothing anybody could do to stay with him - although Quintana's efforts were enough to see him take the white jersey worn by the race's best young rider. The only danger to the Briton appeared to come from fans as they closed in around him on some of the steeper sections of the climb up the Cote de Cauterets, but they soon cleared and he powered to a potentially decisive finish in this year's race. Media playback is not supported on this device Froome's Team Sky team-mate Geraint Thomas is now in fifth place overall after finishing sixth on the stage while fellow Briton Adam Yates crossed the line in seventh after a strong ride up the mountain. \\"The plan was to sit behind Movistar and see how many riders we had left,\\" explained Thomas afterwards. \\"We had four and we all felt good. Froomey said on the radio that he felt good so let's smash it. Personally I felt great and for the team it was even better.\\" It was Bastille Day in France and the first true day of racing in the mountains as the Tour resumed after Monday's rest day. There was a lengthy breakaway involving Cofidis's Kenneth Vanbilsen and Bretagne Seche Environment's Pierrick Fedrigo that lasted most of the 167km stage, but which was never going to make it up the final climb. Vanbilsen picked up all available points at the three category four climbs but with 50 points for the stage winner, Froome now tops the King of the Mountains classification, although second-placed Porte will wear the polka dot jersey on Wednesday. There was also a change in the points classification for the Tour's leading sprinter, with Andre Greipel overhauling Peter Sagan to reclaim the green jersey after the in-form German took third at the day's intermediate sprint. More drama could follow on Wednesday when the race continues in the Pyrenees with a 188km stage that includes the infamous Col du Tourmalet climb. BBC Sport's Matt Slater: \\"July 14 is when France celebrates the revolutionary storming of a notorious prison, the Bastille; today it was the moment Chris Froome's revolutions probably locked up the yellow jersey for a second time in three years. \\"This was a devastating win for Froome and Team Sky, with Grand Tour champions and challengers scattered all over the road up to La Pierre-Saint-Martin. We knew he and his comrades were going well but this was something else. \\"What that something is will of course now be the subject of fierce debate. Froome's critics are convinced he is cheating and they claim they have the data to prove it. \\"His supporters, however, say those numbers only prove he is a special athlete who has got even better with hard work, careful eating and great coaching.  As ever with cycling, absolute agreement is probably impossible.\\" Listen to 5 live sports extra commentary of Froome winning the stage See the full standings 1.

He was leading the race and then he got even farther ahead of everyone during one part of it. Richie Porte came in second place and Nairo Quintana was third. Froome is doing so well that it looks like he will probably win the whole big race. Some other riders fell behind a lot which makes it even easier for Froome. Some people were worried that Froome may be doing something unfair to win, but he said he's just happy and surprised to be doing so well. During the race, Froome had another racer from his team, Thomas, who came fifth overall. Thomas said they had a plan and it worked really well. Now all eyes are on the next stages where more exciting things can happen. Lastly, there's also a jersey that gets given to the quickest racer, and a man named Andre got to wear that one.

Passengers on board an easyJet flight from Gatwick, England, to Verona, Italy, on April 23 became the surprise audience for an inflight performance of Shakespeare's plays. Verona is a principal setting for Shakespeare's \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" The hour-long performance -- hosted by the airline as part of a campaign to have April 23 officially recognized as National Shakespeare Day -- was put on by actors from the Reduced Shakespeare Company. (Shakespeare fans argue over April 23 or April 26 as his exact birthday.) See a short video of the performance here. The plane had also been emblazoned with a portrait of the playwright. Armed with props and costumes, three actors paraded the aisle while running through abridged versions of every comedy and tragedy penned by the Bard. \\"We hope to set a new Guinness World Record ... for the highest ever theatrical performance,\\" said easyJet communications director Paul Moore in a statement. As a testament to the troupe's entertaining performance, no crotchety complaints seem to have appeared (yet) on social media about lost sleep. \\"Certainly, this was the most entertaining flight I have ever taken. It was a fabulous performance and great for the children,\\" passenger Simon Cureton told Portsmouth News. While the airline has taken its Shakespeare Day campaign seriously, throwing free performances at airports, emblazoning the playwright on plane livery and promoting the best Shakespearean destinations in its inflight magazine, the campaign has a long way to go. The petition had 729 signatures at the time of writing. If it hits 100,000, it will be considered by the House of Commons Backbench Business Committee. Highlights:","output":"1.

Article:","output":"Title: Rory McIlroy Chooses Ireland over Great Britain for the 2016 Olympic Games  Article: Four-time major champion, Rory McIlroy, has made the decision to represent Ireland instead of Great Britain at the upcoming 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. The Northern Irish golfer has been caught in a dilemma when it comes to choosing which team to play for, but McIlroy ultimately decided to represent his homeland, not wanting to disappoint his legion of fans from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. The decision made by the 32-year-old golfer has garnered considerable support, with one notable endorsement coming from Team GB's golf coach, Jamie Spence. According to Spence, McIlroy's decision to side with Team Ireland is a commendable one, as it showcases the golfer's loyalty and commitment to his roots. The Northern Irishman, who has spent a significant portion of his professional career on both the European and PGA Tours, had been weighing his options for quite some time. It was a persuasive argument made by his compatriot, Graeme McDowell, that ultimately swayed McIlroy's decision. McDowell highlighted the importance of representing their homeland, stating that it is an honor to don the national colors and showcase the talent that originates from their small island nation on the global stage. With McIlroy committing to Ireland, the current Team GB lineup will feature two of England's finest golfers, Justin Rose and Luke Donald. Rose, a former US Open champion and world number one, will lead the team with an impressive track record, having secured a victory at the 2013 US Open and a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, marking the first Olympic gold in golf since 1904. Luke Donald, on the other hand, is a five-time PGA Tour winner and former world number one, making him a strong contender to represent Great Britain in the upcoming games. While McIlroy's decision to represent Ireland has garnered support from his peers and golf enthusiasts alike, it also highlights the unique challenges faced by athletes from Northern Ireland when it comes to national representation in global events. With Northern Irish athletes being able to choose between representing Great Britain or Ireland, athletes often find themselves at the center of a delicate balancing act. Nevertheless, Rory McIlroy's choice to play for Ireland at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro should be seen as an opportunity for the golfer to connect with his roots and represent his homeland in one of the world's most prestigious sporting events. Golf fans across the globe will surely be keeping a close eye on McIlroy's performance, as he seeks to bring glory home to the Emerald Isle with a potential Olympic gold."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear.  When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect.

News article: You can bet left-wing activists are going to call for a boycott Under Armour now. On Tuesday, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank was effusive in his praise of President Donald Trump in an interview on CNBC. Plank commended the president, saying “To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country.” Going further, Plank alluded to Trump’s plan for the wall: “He wants to build things. He wants to make bold decisions and be really decisive.” The CEO liked this action, he said, because he is “a big fan of people that operate in the world of ‘publish and iterate’ versus ‘think, think, think, think, think.”      It won’t be long before liberals attempt to shame people into silencing Plank and his business. Since Trump was elected in November, they have gone after brands like New Balance and L.L. Bean for their support of the nation’s leader. We’ll have to see if any lefties post videos of themselves burning their Under Armour clothing, like they did with New Balance. For some reason, it seems unlikely that many of these social media warriors own much sports apparel to begin with.      This is a good time for people who don’t oppose our president to show their appreciation of Under Armour’s respect for President Trump.

Plank, in a CNBC interview on Tuesday, lauded Trump’s business acumen. His comments started a #BoycottUnderArmour trend on Twitter and surprised Warriors star Stephen Curry, one of the company’s primary athlete endorsers. Plank and Under Armour clarified Plank’s meaning.      “To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country,” Plank said. “People can really grab that opportunity.”      “At Under Armour, our culture has always been about optimism, teamwork, and unity. We have engaged with both the prior and the current administrations in advocating on business issues that we believe are in the best interests of our consumers, teammates, and shareholders. Kevin Plank was recently invited at the request of the President of the United States, to join the American Manufacturing Council as part of a distinguished group of business leaders. He joined CEOs from companies such as Dow Chemical, Dell, Ford, GE and Tesla, among others to begin an important dialogue around creating jobs in America. We believe it is important for Under Armour to be a part of that discussion.      “We have always been committed to developing innovative ways to support and invest in American jobs and manufacturing. For years, Under Armour has had a long-term strategy for domestic manufacturing and we recently launched our first women’s collection made in our hometown of Baltimore, MD. We are incredibly proud of this important first step in the evolution of creating more jobs at home.      “We engage in policy, not politics. We believe in advocating for fair trade, an inclusive immigration policy that welcomes the best and the brightest and those seeking opportunity in the great tradition of our country, and tax reform that drives hiring to help create new jobs globally, across America and in Baltimore.      “We have teammates from different religions, races, nationalities, genders and sexual orientations; different ages, life experiences and opinions.

His stance was much the same when his vague comments about the controversial North Carolina bill drew the ire of some in the LGBTQ community: where he stands is clear per his track record.      He thought he was sure where Plank stood based on his track record. So Curry, one of the most popular endorsers of Under Armour products, said he was surprised to see the CEO praising Trump.      “I spent all day yesterday on the phone,” Curry said, “with countless people at Under Armour, countless people in Kevin Plank’s camp, my team, trying to understand what was going on and where everybody stood on the issue. Based off the release that KP sent out this morning, and what he told me last night, that’s the Under Armour that I know. That’s the brand I know he’s built and one that, as of Wednesday afternoon, is something that I’m standing on.”      Plank explained his stance to Curry on Tuesday, how his comments were meant exclusively from a business perspective. He distanced himself from Trump’s controversial policies and comments that have enranged women, Muslims, Mexicans, African-Americans and the impoverished across the nation.

He is more concerned about Under Armour adopting Trump’s values, he said.      “It’s a fine line but it’s about how we’re operating,” Curry said, “how inclusive we are, what we stand for. He’s the President. There are going to be people that are tied to them. But are we promoting change? Are we doing things that are going to look out for everybody? And not being so self-serving that it’s only about making money, selling shoes, doing this and that. That’s not the priority. It’s about changing lives. I think we can continue to do that.”      But would Curry really leave Under Armour, the company that helped launch his empire, if he didn’t like the direction of the company?      “If there is a situation where I can look at myself in the mirror and say they don’t have my best intentions, they don’t have the right attitude about taking care of people,” Curry said. “If I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values, then there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off if it wasn’t in line with who I am. So that’s a decision I will make every single day when I wake up. If something is not in line with what I’m about, then, yeah, I definitely need to take a stance in that respect.”      Curry said he and Plank don’t talk politics and he doesn’t have interest in doing so. His relationship with Under Armour is a business relationship and his primary concern is carrying out his own mission. However, he made it clear he did not vote for Trump and is against several of Trump’s actions.      “I feel like if you know who I am, you know what I stand for, and I can live with that,” Curry said. “I feel when you see my name, when you see people wearing my stuff, when you see anybody attached to me, that they share that same passion for people that I do. And that’s what I’ve been really serious about using this platform to share. I don’t get in people’s faces and out in the streets with a bullhorn doing it that way. But every opportunity I have to show love, to show respect, to show just that positivity, I feel like that’s my job and that’s what I stand for.” ||||| Plank: We are a team that knows how to win 3:22 PM ET Tue, 7 Feb 2017 | 01:09      Wall Street critics should consider Under Armour's track record of success before counting it out, CEO Kevin Plank told CNBC. (Full interview below)      \\"You look in my eyes and tell me: Do you believe this is the team that's done this for 21 years, 11 years public and knows how to win?,\\" Plank said on CNBC's \\"Halftime Report.\\"      \\"You know, I think a lot of people bet against Tom Brady the other night, too,\\" he said.      Shares of Under Amour have taken a beating after the sportswear company reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales — its second disappointing quarter in a row. It also announced that its chief financial officer, Chip Molloy, will step down. The news initially wiped a quarter off the company's market value.      In midday trading Tuesday, Class A shares were little changed, while Class C shares were about 1 percent lower. Both sets of shares have declined more than 30 percent in the past three months.      (12-month performance of Under Armour Class A shares; Source: FactSet)      The company's sales were hurt by intense competition and slowing growth in North America. Under Armour's net revenue rose about 12 percent to 1.31 billion, its slowest sales growth in eight years.      Under Amour also said its CFO is leaving for personal reasons, but did not elaborate. Molloy had joined the company last January.      On Tuesday, Plank said even though the company lost one of its key players, he is confident in the progress of his executive team.      \\"We've got an executive team that is robust and full and the same people that got us here. One of the lessons that we learned and we know, you ask is this the end? No this is not the end,\\" he said.      In order for the company to progress it has to change its narrative, Plank said.            \\"We have a growth company. You'll never hear us not say that. Current outlook has double digit growth which is close to industry in the sector leading among the leaders there. Our business is so young, our business is really just getting started,\\" he said. \\"This company throws punches. That's what we do and it's how we continue to expect to be able to run again,\\" he said. \\"But there are tweaks. This is not to say the world is rosy.\\" Plank also mentioned his meeting with President Donald Trump to discuss jobs in U.S. Plank described Trump as \\"highly passionate\\" and a pro-business man who is a \\"real asset\\" for U.S. companies. Last month, Plank said in a speech that \\"We should be bringing jobs back, not just to America, but tightening supply chains all over the world. We have the ability to do it better. It's time for all of us to make an investment.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank has praised US President Donald Trump as a “pro-business” leader and a “real asset for the country”.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the fifteen-year-old who auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing? is inside the article: In March 1957, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool. They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \\"Raunchy\\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist.By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August shortened the name to The Beatles.Allan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg, but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired Pete Best in mid-August 1960.

Are coyotes getting high off hallucinogenic mushrooms? That is one possible reason for a number of encounters in the San Francisco Bay Area recently, where motorists in Stinson Beach and Bolinas have complained about coyotes chasing passing cars, snapping at tires, and even bringing traffic to a halt.      Some now believe that the behavior may be caused by the ingestion of the fly amanita mushroom.      “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold,” an anonymous commuter told The Pacific Sun.      The fly amanita is a poisonous mushroom with hallucinogenic properties that are commonly consumed by coyotes and dogs. Looking much like the classic toadstool, the fly amanita can cause a wide variety of psychedelic effects when ingested and is taken as a recreational drug in many countries. However, the mushroom must first be parboiled before it can be eaten safely. As a result, most dogs or coyotes that eat the mushroom suffer from the effects of poisoning, such as vomiting and nausea. In worst cases, canines who consume the mushroom will experience seizures, bleeding, liver failure, and ultimately death.      The psychedelic effects of the mushroom on canines are not well-documented, but experts say that they can be especially excitable after consumption. That fits with the accounts given by drivers on Highway 1, who say that the coyotes have been acting stranger than normal. Most healthy coyotes, as with any other animal with a keen self-preservation instinct, do not dart in and out of traffic trying to bite cars.      The psychedelic mushrooms are just one theory, and not exactly the most plausible. Since the hallucinogenic properties of the mushrooms only last temporarily, it may not explain why the coyote encounters have been reported for weeks. Experts with a local animal shelter said that alternate explanations include rabies, which is also unlikely, or that motorists have simply been feeding the coyotes. Feeding any wild animal, least of all a dangerous predator, is never advised.

The attacks are weird enough that one seemingly outlandish explanation, that the coyotes are eating hallucinogenic mushrooms and vision questing their way into interactions with drivers, is being considered.      A report in the Pacific Sun details the late-night encounters had by numerous motorists.      \\"A coyote has taken to staring down automobile drivers as they drive through this twisting, turning section of highway,\\" notes the paper, \\"before attacking the car and then skulking off back into the wilderness. The coyote runs up to the cars, usually at night, forcing drivers to stop as the beast stares and sniffs around the vehicle.\\"      “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold,” one driver told the Sun.      Experts aren't sure what's behind the abnormal behavior, but they are sure of one thing: It's not rabies. It seems that the attacks have been going on for a period of time longer than an animal infected with the virus could be expected to live. Lisa Bloch, director of marketing and communications for the Marin Humane Society, told the Sun that \\"[if] this is going on longer than a week or so, then it’s likely not rabies. And we don’t suspect rabies, just because it is pretty rare.”      The attacks have been reportedly occurring for the past three weeks.      “We are trying to figure this out,” Bloch helpfully informs us.      The Sun notes that the fly agaric mushroom (amanita muscaria) grows in the area and has hallucinogenic properties, and that Bloch recently warned residents about the possible side effects of their pets eating the wild fungus.      Bloch, for her part, suggested a more prosaic possibility: Drivers have been feeding the coyotes from their cars.      “It’s possible that someone was feeding him and thinking that it’s cool, and magical and mystical to have a coyote eating out of his hand,” she explained.      Which, when we consider that this is Bolinas we're talking about, seems in the end the likeliest of explanations.

It’s all the talk at Beth’s Community Kitchen in Bolinas and elsewhere: A coyote has taken to staring down automobile drivers as they drive through this twisting, turning section of highway, before attacking the car and then skulking off back into the wilderness. The coyote runs up to the cars, usually at night, forcing drivers to stop as the beast stares and sniffs around the vehicle.      The coyote “attacks” have happened a bunch of times, to enough people, to warrant calls to figure out what’s going on with the animal. Or, animals, as the latest grist out of Bolinas has it that there are now two coyotes acting a little weird, or a lot weird: Drive-by coyote stare-downs have now become part of the normative experience for a Bolinas-based individual who makes numerous nighttime airport runs every week. We are not identifying this individual, who fears retribution at the vengeful paws of these bushy-tailed beasts. He would only say, “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold.”      The Marin Humane Society has fielded at least one inquiry from a coyote-concerned citizen and is looking into the case of the aggressive coyote, says Lisa Bloch, director of marketing and communications for the society. “We are trying to figure this out.”      There are three possible scenarios to explain the behavior, ranging from least probable, kind of fun to consider and most probable. The least probable problem with the coyote, or coyotes, is rabies. This sort of “Old Yeller” type of aggression usually comes at the end-stage of the disease, the “terror stage” or “zombie stage” of rabies, at which point the animal is going to die, Bloch says.      These coyote attacks have been going on for at least three weeks. If it were rabies, Bloch says, the coyote would likely be dead by now. “If this is going on longer than a week or so, then it’s likely not rabies. And we don’t suspect rabies, just because it is pretty rare.”      Whew, it’s not rabies. It is possible, but not probable, that the coyote has eaten something—perhaps a fly agaric mushroom (amanita muscaria) which has hallucinogenic properties—and has subsequently been tripping its tail off. The cars would therefore be some sort of coyote vision, a dark vision of human interlopers, who must be stopped before the rents get any higher in West Marin. That would be kind of cool.      Bloch could not completely rule out the possibility that coyotes are having psychedelic experiences out on the feral fringes of civilization, and in fact she has been counseling dog owners of late on the dangers of poisonous mushrooms in our midst.      Coyotes hold a special, spiritual place for many a West Marin resident and Bloch urges those of a coyote persuasion to keep a safe distance from the beast of lore. The animals were eradicated in these parts through the 1950s because of their deleterious impact on cattle, but now that they’re back in force—yip-yip, you need to give the beasts some space. The state estimates that there are between 250,000 and 750,000 coyotes in California.      Bloch notes that while the animals are native to the county, “there were not coyotes in Marin for decades” because of a United States Department of Agriculture program that completely annihilated the Marin-based population. “When you indiscriminately kill predators, you are messing with the ecosystem.” Coyotes’ staple diet is mice, and that can get kind of monotonous, especially in a county of such rich, sustainable culinary pleasures.      Which brings us to the likeliest scenario to explain what the heck those coyotes are doing up there on Highway 1 attacking cars. Camilla Fox, who founded the organization Project Coyote (projectcoyote.org) is responsible for signs that pop up around West Marin trailheads that say: “A fed coyote is a dead coyote.”      The message is: Don’t feed the freaking coyotes. “If there are bad apples out there who are feeding the coyotes, they need to stop,” says Fox. “They can be cited—there’s a law that was specifically enacted to stop people from feeding wildlife.”      “One possibility is that the coyote has been fed, and this is a real problem for us in Marin,” Bloch says. “It’s possible that someone was feeding him and thinking that it’s cool, and magical and mystical to have a coyote eating out of his hand.”      Or, some dingbats might simply have thrown some baloney out the window in the direction of a coyote, who dutifully scarfed the meat and now wants more where that came from.      Animals start acting super-aggressive, Bloch says, once the food-proffering hand has been introduced. So don’t do that, and instead understand that a fed coyote is a dead coyote. “What this means is that basically we want the animals to be afraid of us naturally,” Bloch says. “If they are not afraid of us, they come close to our cars, get hit, fight with domestic dogs and can possibly become aggressive.”      The problem for coyotes is that if they turn aggressive, “the coyote is going to be blamed if a dog or, god forbid, a person is mauled.”      The only recourse then is to kill the coyote. Bloch is a Tam Valley resident who says the neighbors can and should do a better job at keeping their property coyote-resistant, to limit such unwelcome outcomes. “It’s very frustrating to me—there are lots of coyotes all around, but people are leaving pet food out, small animals are roaming off leash, the cats are out. It’s an easy meal for a coyote.”      The Humane Society is working the coyote-chase-car problem, Bloch says, and is asking for the public’s help—if anyone has seen the stare-down coyote near Slide Ranch, give them a holler. “We encourage people to report it right away if they see any kind of behaviors, any wildlife acting strangely, biting the tires of a car. We would go and check it out.”      If the Humane Society locates the coyote or coyotes and discovers that they are injured in any way, its next stop would be at the animal rescue operation WildCare in San Rafael. But the Humane Society prefers any option that helps them save the animal while not trapping it—such as when a deer recently found itself in Bolinas Lagoon, like so many DUI drivers before it. “We pulled it out of the lagoon and once we determined the deer was OK, we led it to a quiet place so it could recover on its own.”      That would be the preferred scenario for the coyote now menacing traffic on Highway 1. If the animal winds up at WildCare, “It’s not going back into nature,” Bloch says. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Coyotes in the San Francisco Bay Area have been displaying unusual behavior, such as chasing passing cars and snapping at tires.

The main subjects here are \\"the activated track,\\" \\"an application,\\" and the actions related with these subjects. Step 2: After breaking down the sentence, I noticed that an important action is that the \\"activated track\\" is doing something (leaves) which happens when the application does two things: warns acoustically and provides visual, turn-by-turn. This breakdown helps us understand the sentence better. Step 3: Now, to represent these actions more clearly, I need to use punctuation. The first logical break in the sentence comes after \\"acoustically,\\" and it needs a comma to separate it from the next part of the sentence. This comma helps to highlight that the application is doing two distinct things.     Step 4: Another place where punctuation is needed is after \\"visual.\\" This will create a pause needed before saying \\"turn-by-turn,\\" which in this context is used as an adjective to describe how the application provides visuals. The commas around \\"turn-by-turn\\" treat it as an appositive — additional, non-essential information — while also setting off the list of actions that the application does, which makes the sentence clearer.  Step 5: With these commas included, the sentence now reads as: \\"The activated track leaves once an application warns acoustically, and also provides visual, turn-by-turn.\\" The punctuation helps divide the sentence into more manageable segments, thereby making its meaning easier to understand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What did Moore do instead of using a machine when asked to reproduce The Virgin and Child?  After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing...

Answer:","output":"The text refers to \\"plant\\" as it describes Limnanthes, a type genus of herbaceous plants known as meadowfoams, which are native to western North America and typically grow in marshy habitats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Process:  - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose exercising more heavily happens, how will it affect \\"less oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\".  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Exercising more heavily does indeed have an effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the body's cells. When the body is engaged in vigorous physical activity, the demand for oxygen increases, as more energy is required to be produced by cells, specifically in the muscles. To meet this increased need for oxygen, several adaptations occur within the body's systems: 1. Breathing rate and depth increase: This ensures that more air rich in oxygen is taken in and more carbon dioxide is expelled from the body. The increased rate of breathing can help transport a larger volume of oxygen to the lungs than during a resting state. 2. Heart rate increases: The cardiovascular system responds to the increased demand for oxygen by increasing the heart rate. With an elevated heart rate, blood flow is accelerated, allowing more oxygen to be supplied to the working muscles and tissues in a shorter period of time. 3. Red blood cell delivery of oxygen is enhanced: When exercising, the red blood cells carrying oxygen are diverted to the working muscles, prioritizing their oxygen needs over less-active tissues. 4. Enhanced capillary density in muscles: Regular exercise can result in an increase in the number of capillaries in the muscles, allowing for more efficient oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscle cells as well as waste removal. This adaptation can better meet the increased oxygen requirements during heavy exercise. 5. Improved oxygen extraction: When exercising, the body can become more efficient at extracting oxygen from the blood, allowing for an increased amount of oxygen to be utilized by the cells. To summarize, when exercising more heavily, the body undergoes several adaptations to ensure that sufficient oxygen is provided to the body's cells, despite the increased demand. These adaptations involve changes in breathing, heart rate, blood flow, capillary density, and oxygen extraction efficiency. As a result, less oxygen being brought to the body's cells is not a direct consequence of heavy exercise — in fact, the body compensates to ensure that sufficient oxygen is supplied to meet increased energy demands."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Outside, the freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn, and despite Ashland's best efforts, collides with the cruise ship, sinking it.The next morning, a handful of survivors, including Marshall, his wife Margaret (Sally Ann Howes), their children Robin and Ben, a young officer named Nick (Nick Mancuso), his love interest Lori (Victoria Burgoyne), the ship's stand up comic Jackie (Saul Rubinek), and a passenger, Mrs. Morgan (Kate Reid), are adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby, and is brought aboard barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it is the ship which attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland.

Having grown tired of this assignment, Phil grudgingly gives his report during the festival and parade.After the celebration concludes, a blizzard develops that Connors had predicted would miss them, closing the roads and shutting down long-distance phone services, forcing the team to return to Punxsutawney. Connors awakens the next morning, however, to find it is February 2 again, and his day unfolds in almost exactly the same way. Connors can change his behavior, but other people do and say the same things they did and said the previous day, unless Connors changes something. He is aware of the repetition, but everyone else seems to be living February 2 for the first time. This recursion repeats the following morning and the one after that, and over and over again.

The actual dimensions of so-called Langstroth frames differ by region or manufacturer. These modern Langstroth hives have little in common with Rev. L. L. Langstroth's bee hive that was originally patented in 1852 and manufactured until approximately 1920.  - Clostridium botulinum is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic, spore-forming, motile bacterium with the ability to produce the neurotoxin botulinum. The botulinum toxin can cause a severe flaccid paralytic disease in humans and other animals and is the most potent toxin known to mankind, natural or synthetic, with a lethal dose of 1.32.1 ng/kg in humans.  - A honey super is a part of a commercial or other managed ( such as by a hobbyist ) beehive that is used to collect honey . The most common variety is the \`\` Illinois '' or \`\` medium '' super with a depth of 6 inches , in the length and width dimensions of a Langstroth hive . A honey super consists of a box in which 8 -- 10 frames are hung . Western honeybees collect nectar and store the processed nectar in honeycomb , which they build on the frames . When the honeycomb is full , the bees will reduce the moisture content of the honey to 17 - 18 % moisture content before capping the comb with beeswax . Beekeepers will take the full honey supers and extract the honey . Periods when there is an abundant nectar source available and bees are quickly bringing back the nectar , are called a honey flow . During a honey flow , beekeepers may put several honey supers onto a hive so the bees have enough storage space . Honey supers are removed in the fall when the honey is extracted , and before the hive is winterized , but enough honey is left for the bees to consume during Winter .  - Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion.  - A tablespoon is a large spoon used for eating or serving. In most English-speaking regions, the term now refers to a large spoon used for serving, however, in some regions, including parts of Canada, it is the largest type of spoon used for eating. By extension, the term is used as a measure of volume in cooking. In this capacity, it is most commonly abbreviated \\"tbsp\\" or \\"T,\\" and occasionally referred to as a \\"tablespoonful\\" to distinguish it from the utensil. The unit of measurement varies by region: a United States tablespoon is approximately 14.8 ml, a United Kingdom tablespoon is exactly 15 ml, and an Australian tablespoon is 20 ml. The capacity of the utensil (as opposed to the measurement) is not defined by law or custom and bears no particular relation to the measurement.  - A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Females in many areas of the world have a higher risk related to the more frequent use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people. Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part. Burns are generally preventable. Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection....  - Beekeeping is the maintenance of honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, by humans. A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive produces (including beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly), to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or \\"bee yard\\".  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin, produced by the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\". The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever. Botulism can be spread several different ways. The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. Infant botulism happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children less than six months old, as protective mechanisms develop after that time. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. In this situation, spores enter a wound, and in the absence of oxygen, release the toxin. It is not passed directly between people. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question. Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin, though not the organism, is destroyed by heating it to more than for longer than 5 minutes. Honey can contain the organism, and for this reason, honey should not be fed to children under 12 months. Treatment is with an antitoxin. In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months. Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people. Botulism can affect many other animals. The word is from Latin, \\"botulus\\", meaning sausage. Early descriptions of botulism date from at least as far back as 1793 in Germany.  - Interaction is a kind of action that occurs as two or more objects have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect. A closely related term is interconnectivity, which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising emergent phenomena. \\"Interaction\\" has different tailored meanings in various sciences. Changes can also involve interaction.  - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery.  - A wound is a type of injury which happens relatively quickly in which skin is torn, cut, or punctured (an \\"open\\" wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a \\"closed\\" wound). In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin.  - Aphids, also known as plant lice and in Britain and the Commonwealth as greenflies, blackflies, or whiteflies (not to be confused with \\"jumping plant lice\\" or true whiteflies), are small sap-sucking insects, and members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Many species are green but other commonly occurring species may be white and wooly, brown, or black. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions. They are capable of extremely rapid increase in numbers by asexual reproduction. The damage they do to plants has made them enemies of farmers and gardeners around the world. From a zoological standpoint they are a highly successful group of organisms.   - Honey is a sugary food substance produced and stored by certain social hymenopteran insects. It is produced from the sugary secretions of plants or insects, such as floral nectar or aphid honeydew, through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus \\"Apis\\") is the most well-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it to sugar and other sweeteners. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years. However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\", which can be dangerous to babies, as it may result in botulism. People who have a weakened immune system should not eat honey because of the risk of bacterial or fungal infection. Although some evidence indicates honey may be effective in treating diseases and other medical conditions, such as wounds and burns, the overall evidence for its use in therapy is not conclusive. Providing 64 calories in a typical serving of one tablespoon (15 ml) equivalent to 1272 kj per 100 g, honey has no significant nutritional value. Honey is generally safe, but may have various, potential adverse effects or interactions with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or drugs. Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity, depicted in Valencia, Spain by a cave painting of humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Flora is the plant life occurring in a particular region or time, generally the naturally occurring or indigenousnative plant life. The corresponding term for animal life is fauna. \\"Flora\\", \\"fauna\\" and other forms of life such as fungi are collectively referred to as biota. Sometimes bacteria and fungi are also referred to as flora, as in the terms gut flora or skin flora.  - A honey bee (or honeybee) is any bee member of the genus Apis, primarily distinguished by the production and storage of honey and the construction of perennial, colonial nests from wax. Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies, though historically, from six to eleven species have been recognized. The best known honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, including the stingless honey bees, but only members of the genus \\"Apis\\" are true honey bees. The study of bees including honey bees is known as melittology.  - Nectar is a sugar-rich liquid produced by plants in glands called nectaries, either within the flowers with which it attracts pollinating animals, or by extrafloral nectaries, which provide a nutrient source to animal mutualists, which in turn provide antiherbivore protection. Common nectar-consuming pollinators include mosquitoes, hoverflies, wasps, bees, butterflies and moths, hummingbirds, and bats. Nectar plays an important role in the foraging economics and overall evolution of nectar-eating species; for example, nectar and its properties are responsible for the differential evolution of the African honey bee, \\"A. m. scutellata\\" and the western honey bee.  - Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name \\"fructose\\" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a very sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.

Please answer a question about the following article about Middle Ages: Besides the schism, the western church was riven by theological controversies, some of which turned into heresies. John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers.

Housing issues arise over eviction actions, substandard housing, eligibility for public housing, mobile home purchases, housing discrimination, and mortgage foreclosures. Does it follow that \\" Housing issues arise over eviction actions\\"? OPT: *yes *it is not possible to tell *no","output":"Yes, housing issues arise over eviction actions as they are a major concern for both tenants and landlords.  Eviction actions occur when a landlord seeks to remove a tenant from their rental property, usually due to a breach in the tenant agreement or failure to pay rent. This process can lead to significant housing issues for several reasons. Firstly, eviction actions can cause immense stress and financial strain on tenants who may struggle to find new housing, especially if they have a history of eviction on their records. This can lead to homelessness, overcrowding in temporary accommodations, or tenants being forced to accept substandard living conditions due to a lack of available or affordable options. Secondly, landlords face challenges when carrying out eviction actions. They must adhere to the appropriate legal processes and provide sufficient notice to tenants before eviction can occur. Failure to do so can result in lawsuits, fines, or other penalties. Additionally, landlords may struggle to find new tenants, particularly if the eviction process leads to negative publicity or damaged property. Furthermore, eviction actions can exacerbate systemic housing issues that exist in certain communities. In areas where there is a lack of affordable housing or high rates of poverty, eviction actions may disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. Finally, eviction actions can also give rise to issues relating to housing discrimination. In some cases, landlords may evict tenants based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or other protected status. This not only infringes on the tenant's rights but can also perpetuate housing disparities within communities and limit access to safe, affordable, and stable housing for marginalized groups. In conclusion, housing issues do arise over eviction actions, as they can lead to homelessness, financial instability, legal challenges, and discrimination. It is essential for governments, landlords, and housing advocates to work together to address these issues, promote equitable housing policies, and ensure the protection of tenants' rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To use something other than cat litter for a litter box.","output":"Step 1: Determine the alternatives To use something other than cat litter for a litter box, start by researching alternative materials that could effectively control odor, absorb moisture, and be safe for the cat. Consider materials such as: - Paper-based litter - Wood-based litter - Corn or wheat-based litter - Coconut coir or other natural fiber-based litters - Sand or soil Justification: By finding alternative materials, you are expanding your options and choosing an eco-friendly and potentially cost-effective solution. Step 2: Assess suitability and safety Investigate each alternative by delving into customer reviews and researching the pros and cons. In particular, make sure that the alternative material is safe for the cat; it should be non-toxic and not pose any health hazards, such as respiratory problems or ingestion dangers. Justification: Evaluating the safety and effectiveness of each alternative ensures you provide the cat with a litter that doesn't compromise its well-being. Step 3: Test one or more alternatives After narrowing down one or more suitable alternatives, purchase a small quantity and test it in the litter box. Introduce the new material gradually by mixing it with the existing cat litter, allowing the cat to adjust to the change. Justification: Testing the alternative litter on a small scale allows you to evaluate its effectiveness and observe the cat's reactions before committing to a full switch. Step 4: Observe the cat's behavior Monitor the cat's response to the new litter material by observing whether it uses the litter box without reluctance and noting any changes in behavior. If the cat seems uncomfortable or refuses to use the litter box, try another alternative material. Justification: The cat's comfort and acceptance of the new material are essential to prevent litter box avoidance or other behavioral issues. Step 5: Make any necessary adjustments If the cat accepts the new litter material, continue to make adjustments to find the optimal amount or mix for best performance (odor control, absorption, etc.). You may experiment with different brands or blends of the alternative material if needed. Justification: Tweaking the litter mix is necessary to achieve the best results when using an alternative to traditional cat litter, ensuring both you and your cat are satisfied. Step 6: Dispose of the used litter responsibly Finally, when scooping or changing the litter box, make sure to dispose of the alternative material according to any specific guidelines outlined by the manufacturer. Some materials may be compostable or biodegradable, while others may not. Justification: Proper disposal contributes to a cleaner environment and ensures compliance with the guidelines provided by the manufacturer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Practical guidelines for performing alcohol interventions in trauma centers. Does it follow that \\"There are no interventions for alcohol at the trauma center. \\"?","output":"No, this statement is incorrect. There are practical guidelines for performing alcohol interventions in trauma centers, indicating that such interventions do exist. Here is a step-by-step approach to performing alcohol interventions in trauma centers. The steps are taken based on medical best practices and common approaches for effective intervention: 1. Identification and assessment: The first step is identifying patients who may have an alcohol problem. Screening tools like the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) or the CAGE questionnaire can help assess and identify individuals with potential alcohol use disorders or risky drinking habits. 2. Physician involvement: Once patients are identified, the involvement of the attending physician or a trained professional like a clinical nurse specialist or a social worker is vital to initiate the intervention process. They can discuss and evaluate the patients' alcohol consumption in the context of their trauma. 3. Motivational interviewing: Practitioners should adapt a non-confrontational and empathetic approach, such as motivational interviewing, to facilitate communication with patients. This helps patients understand the link between their alcohol consumption and trauma, enabling them to recognize the need to change their drinking behavior. 4. Brief intervention: A brief intervention should be provided after the assessment. It may consist of a short conversation about the risks of alcohol use and trauma, as well as discussing possible strategies to reduce or stop drinking. 5. Referral to treatment: If the patient is willing and requires further assistance, a referral to specialized treatment services such as outpatient therapy or addiction treatment programs can be made. It is essential to tailor the recommendation to fit the patients' individual needs and preferences. 6. Follow-up: Aftercare and follow-up are crucial elements in alcohol interventions. Continuity of care and regular check-ins can help ensure that a patient successfully adheres to their proposed change in alcohol use, thus minimizing the likelihood of future alcohol-related trauma. In conclusion, alcohol interventions do exist in trauma centers and following these practical guidelines can help healthcare professionals address the needs of patients with alcohol use disorders or risky drinking habits to prevent the recurrence of future trauma."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Reflections generally affect polarization. For radio waves, one important reflector is the ionosphere which can change the wave's polarization. Thus for signals received following reflection by the ionosphere (a skywave), a consistent polarization cannot be expected. For line-of-sight communications or ground wave propagation, horizontally or vertically polarized transmissions generally remain in about the same polarization state at the receiving location. Matching the receiving antenna's polarization to that of the transmitter can make a very substantial difference in received signal strength. Question: What reflector can change the waves polarization?","output":"The reflector that can change the wave's polarization, according to the given article, is the ionosphere.  The ionosphere, a layer of the Earth's atmosphere filled with ions and free electrons, has significant effects on radio wave propagation. One of these effects is the ability to change the polarization of waves. This means that it alters the plane in which the electric field of the radio wave vibrates.  This reflection-induced change in polarization is a critical consideration for radio signals that depend on ionospheric reflection, also known as skywave propagation. Such signals cannot retain a consistent polarization after their reflection off the ionosphere because the ionosphere's electron density varies both temporally and spatially, leading to these inconsistent polarization effects. Thus, the wave's polarization that was initially set when the wave was transmitted may not be the same when the wave reaches its receiving point after bouncing off the ionosphere. In contrast, for the line-of-sight communication or ground wave propagation where direct paths are involved, the original polarization of transmitted waves - whether horizontal or vertical - is generally maintained at the receiving location. This is due to the lack of reflection surfaces that could potentially alter the wave's polarization status.  Polarization is a significant parameter in antenna design and signal propagation, as the matching of the receiving antenna's polarization to that of the transmitter's can make a tremendous difference in received signal strength. Therefore, understanding the behaviour of polarization upon reflection, particularly from the ionosphere for radio signals, is significant in the field of telecommunications and radio signal propagation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed. Why does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels   at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene. When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals   and pour thick flour   over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \\"snow\\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \\"snow\\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair! These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat   but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \\"everyday\\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure   to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. Question: Most modern studios  _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"use computers for everyday sounds\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"use computers for everyday sounds.\\" Most modern studios have adopted the use of computers and technology to create everyday sounds, making the process more efficient and less time-consuming for Foley artists.

Bob could see how frustrated I was. \\"We'll just have to try to get on the flight tomorrow,\\" he said. \\"Let's enjoy the extra day.\\" My son Joe, a First Lieutenant   in the Army 82nd Airborne Division  , would be returning to Ft. Bragg in North Carolina for a short rest and recovery from his tour of duty in Baghdad, and we weren't sure we'd be able to see him in the little time he'd be stateside. Plus, the time was so up in the air! Back at our hotel, I checked my e-mail to see if our daughter-in-law Monica had any news on when Joe was due to arrive. Sure enough, there was a message. \\"Joe's been delayed again,\\" it read. The next morning we made it onto our flight back to the States. Unfortunately, we had to stop in Atlanta. Our connecting flight there was delayed because of bad weather. The hours passed. I felt the frustration building. \\"That's it!\\" I finally said. \\"I just want to get home!\\" That's when I saw a group of soldiers coming down the ramp  from one of the gates. I thought of Joe. They're coming back from a war, I reminded myself, while I'm coming back from vacation. What right do I have to be frustrated? Maybe the troops were God's way of reminding me to trust in his time. Bob grabbed my arm. \\"Look at those soldiers coming down the ramp.\\" \\"I see them,\\" I said. Bob persisted, \\"Do you see who's in front?\\" Suddenly, all those delays across all those miles made perfect sense. I rushed toward my son Joe's open arms. Question: Why did Bob say \\"Let's enjoy the extra day\\"? - To stay one day more. - To cheer his wife up. - To visit other attractions. - To meet his son there.

A former exotic dancer is suing the Dallas Cowboys and club's owner  Jerry Jones for 1million for sexual assault, claiming the 71-year-old business man groped her in a hotel bathroom. In an 11-page court document, Jana Weckerly of Ardmore, Carter County, Oklahoma claims she was sexually assaulted by Jones in either May or June 2009 and that the Dallas Cowboys should have done something to prevent it. The alleged assault is believed to have taken place in the bathroom of a luxury hotel.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You may want to start with a blog in a subject of your choice. In order to become an affiliate and participate in affiliate marketing, you need to have a website with significant traffic. Many affiliate marketers start by creating content and posting affiliate links on their page. You'll have to make sure the website is yours and doesn't ban affiliate marketing by agreement with the hosting service.  See how to make a website for more information. You will need to cultivate the ability to start new websites, buy domain names, host pages and make landing pages. These skills will become important as you begin CPA marketing. PPC advertising allows you to drive traffic to your site by placing ads on other, relevant websites. You pay the ad provider a small amount for each time a web user clicks through your ad to your website. You can learn how this works through YouTube videos, online tutorials or by trial and error. Set up an account in Google AdWords and Microsoft adCenter, and pay for some ads that drive traffic to your website, in order to practice while you learn. Pay-per-click advertising can get expensive quickly, especially in a keyword bidding war (when another website or websites also wants to advertise for the same keywords). You also run the risk of routinely paying for clicks that don't lead to sales for you. Always analyze these risk before getting started in PPC. The best way to become a CPA marketer is to learn how to drive traffic to websites. The following are ways that people learn to drive traffic.  Practice creating and promoting fan pages and groups on Facebook. If you know how to get \\"likes,\\" then you are on your way to driving traffic to a lead landing page. This usually takes a passion for staying in touch with followers and trying new creative social media strategies. Practice creating videos and YouTube channels. If you are an expert in a field or you can call on other people to create creative or instructive videos, this content grabs attention. Once you have traffic, you can post links to landing pages where you can gather lead information. Learn how to make and buy Internet ads. If you have graphic design skills and you don't want to create content on a blog or YouTube, then this may be the best option for you. You can find prime ad spaces, through services like BuySellAds, and purchase the ad space for a period of time. If the ad is targeted successfully, people will click on the link and type in their information, giving you leads. You will need to subtract the cost of the ad in order to figure out your return on investment. Become adept at using PPC advertising to get traffic to your landing page. Similar to buying ad space, you will need to bid on keywords in order to place the link to your landing page where you will get noticed. If you have a lot of experience with search engine advertising, this may be the best option for you. Use all of the methods you have learned to try to increase traffic to your website. You'll want to try to bring on a specific type of traffic that is marketable to CPA networks. This type of traffic, that you can turn into leads for your advertisers, is called \\"targeted traffic.\\" It involves targeting a certain need or type of person and offering what they need or or are looking for. You will not be able to gather leads if you don't know how to bring specific people to your website. For example, you might have a blog or website that reviews phone cases. You would want to target people searching for things like \\"best iPhone cases\\" or \\"durable phone cases.\\" Summary:","output":"This article talks about how to become a CPA marketer by making a website, creating content, learning skills like making ads and using PPC advertising, and trying different ways to bring people who want certain things to your website, so you can help advertisers find new customers."},{"instruction":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

The trio began playing together with the Cubs in 1902, and formed a double play combination that lasted through April 1912.

Original sentence: \\"A white dog is airborne whilst catching a green toy.\\" Components: \\"white dog\\", \\"airborne\\", \\"catching\\", \\"green toy\\" Step 2: Analyze the given sentence to see if it contains the same main components as the original sentence, minus any qualifiers that do not change the meaning.

You are given a new situation: Greg was studying behavior of different organisms. He noticed that some organisms were showing inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case A. Then he noticed some other organisms didn't show any inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case B. He was astonished by the complicated interactions among organisms.  and a hint : Ants form symbiotic associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.  Please answer this question : Would case A see greater or smaller opportunity for food sources than case B? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's first recap the information given: Case A: Organisms showing inquiline behavior Case B: Organisms not showing inquiline behavior Now, let's analyze the hint regarding ants and their symbiotic associations: 1. Ants form various symbiotic associations with other species, including inquilines. 2. Inquilines may bear close resemblance to ants and can access resources within the ant nests. 3. The nature of mimicry in inquilines varies, with some using it to reduce predation risk, and others exhibiting Wasmannian mimicry, which is specific to inquilines. Considering this information, we can make the following comparisons: In case A, organisms exhibit inquiline behavior and can gain access to the resources within ant nests, such as food and shelter. As a result, they would likely have more opportunities for food sources, as they can benefit from the resources within the nest. In case B, organisms do not show inquiline behavior and will rely on their own foraging and resource acquisition, without the added advantage of accessing ant nest resources. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that Case A, with organisms showing inquiline behavior, would see greater opportunities for food sources compared to Case B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Thus, when considering the hypothesis, \\"That is absolutely correct,\\" it aligns with the initial assertion made in the premise. Both phrases indicate a sense of agreement and affirmation regarding a particular statement or idea. However, it is important to consider that the premise provided is incomplete and lacks the full context of the statement it is connected to. As a result, it could potentially lead to different interpretations or conclusions depending on the nature of the conversation taking place, the statements being discussed, and the individuals involved in it. With this in mind, it is essential to acknowledge that in most cases, the hypothesis \\"That is absolutely correct\\" would likely be considered true, given that it mirrors the sentiment of agreement found within the premise. Nonetheless, without additional context or information, there could be certain specific scenarios where this may not be the case. For instance, if the second part of the premise and statement fundamentally contradict the first portion, it could potentially dispute the hypothesis' accuracy. In conclusion, based on the available information and the premise provided, it can be inferred that the hypothesis \\"That is absolutely correct\\" is generally true. However, lacking complete context and information might leave some room for potential discrepancies or alternative conclusions, so the certainty of the truth could not be definitively established.

Franklin's attempts to work alone prove disastrous such as a failed diplomatic mission to the King that pushes the colonies to open armed revolt.They finally reconcile in 1776 when Franklin begs Amos to return and agrees to sign a contract drafted by the mouse for more considerate treatment. Furthermore, as Franklin examines the agreement, Thomas Jefferson arrives to ask for help for the beginning of the Declaration of Independence he is writing.

Article:","output":"Title: Duchess of Cambridge Discharged from Hospital, Returns to Kensington Palace for Rest The Duchess of Cambridge, formerly known as Kate Middleton, left the King Edward VII Hospital in London today in great spirits, accompanied by her husband, Prince William. The Duchess was admitted to the hospital to receive treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. After a three-night stay, Kate was seen smiling and stated that she's \\"feeling much better.\\" Hyperemesis gravidarum is a rare and severe form of morning sickness, affecting only around 1-2% of pregnant women. It can lead to extreme nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, posing risks to both mother and baby. In some cases, it can last throughout the entire pregnancy, but for many women, the symptoms tend to subside after the first trimester. Prince William offered his unwavering support as he accompanied his wife on her exit from the hospital. Despite the London hospital falling victim to a prank call earlier in the week, St. James's Palace issued a statement expressing the couple's gratitude to the hospital staff. The statement read, \\"The Duchess of Cambridge... will now head to Kensington Palace for a period of rest,\\" as reported by the Telegraph. With her immediate engagements canceled, experts predict that Kate's next public appearance may not be until Christmas Day. Nonetheless, the Duchess made a strong impression with her stylish and immaculate appearance upon leaving the hospital. Her neatly styled hair, impeccable clothing, and a bouquet of roses tastefully concealing her tummy all showcased her resilience and poise during this challenging time. Despite some signs of fatigue, such as her slightly puffy eyes, Kate remained radiant. In the coming months, it is reported that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will face considerable time apart due to Prince William's commitments at the RAF base in Wales. The prince's military duties often require him to be stationed away from home, making it difficult for the couple to be together during much of Kate's pregnancy. The royal baby is rumored to be due in June, sparking anticipation and excitement across the nation and the world. As the Duchess returns to Kensington Palace for rest and recuperation, the world eagerly awaits the arrival of the newest member of the British royal family.

Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

Write an article based on this summary: A train struck a Land Rover on the railway line between Ely and Cambridge, prompting an investigation.","output":"Title: Investigation Underway After Train Strikes Land Rover on Railway Line Between Ely and Cambridge Introduction A shocking incident occurred on the railway line between Ely and Cambridge when a train collided with a Land Rover, causing significant disruption to rail services and calling for a thorough investigation. In this article, we will provide an overview of the situation, examine the consequences of the event, and outline the steps being taken in response. Incident Details The collision took place on a railway crossing, with a train coming into contact with a Land Rover that had somehow become stranded on the tracks. The exact circumstances remain unclear, but initial reports suggest that the vehicle had attempted to traverse the crossing when it became immobilized, effectively placing it in the path of the oncoming train. Luckily, no injuries were reported in the incident. Consequences and Disruption The force of the impact resulted in damage to both the train and the Land Rover. Passengers on board the train experienced a sudden, forceful jerk as the train came to an abrupt halt. Thankfully, emergency services were quick to respond to the scene and were able to assist the passengers safely disembarking the train. Rail services along the line were disrupted as the damage was assessed, and the removal of the wreckage commenced. Passengers traveling between Ely and Cambridge faced delays and cancellations, forcing many to seek alternative forms of transportation to reach their destinations. Investigation and Response An immediate investigation was launched by local authorities and railway operator to uncover the cause of the incident and determine whether any violations or failures contributed to the collision. Part of this investigation includes examining the state of the railway crossing equipment and signaling systems at the scene to ascertain whether they were functioning properly at the time of the incident. The authorities are also interviewing witnesses and reviewing available surveillance footage to reconstruct the events leading up to the collision. This information will be invaluable in determining whether any negligence or safety violations occurred on the part of the Land Rover driver, and if any measures can be implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future. Further, the railway operator, in coordination with local authorities, will be examining their own safety procedures to ensure that railway crossings remain secure and that appropriate warnings are provided to road users. This assessment may lead to improvements in railway crossing infrastructure and further safety investments. Conclusion While it is fortunate that no one was injured in this collision between a train and a Land Rover on the railway line between Ely and Cambridge, it serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers surrounding railway crossings. As the investigation continues, it is hoped that lessons can be learned and steps taken to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. The safety of passengers, motorists, and rail staff is of paramount importance, and all parties involved must work together to minimize risk and enhance safety protocols on our railways."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Process: - Dead organic material accumulates on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds or swamps, mixing with mud and sand - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms - It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas -   Question: suppose more sediments pile on top happens, how will it affect LESS oil.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"Less oil. The accumulation of more sediments on the already existing layer of organic material and kerogen can affect the production of oil in various ways. The process of oil formation is complex, and it depends on a delicate balance of factors such as temperature, pressure, and time. A deeper understanding of these factors and how they interact can help explain why piling more sediments on top of the existing layers can result in less oil production. 1. Temperature: The transformation of kerogen into oil requires a specific temperature range. This is generally between 90°C and 150°C (194°F and 302°F). When more sediments accumulate on the organic layer, the increased pressure and insulation can cause the temperature to rise beyond this range. If the temperature exceeds the optimal range, it can cause the kerogen to turn into natural gas or remain trapped as a solid, resulting in less oil production. 2. Pressure: Increased pressure due to more sediments can also negatively impact oil formation. The ideal pressure range for oil generation is typically 1-2 kilobars. Too much pressure can cause the organic material to not break down into the desired oil molecules. Under extreme pressure, the solid kerogen may convert directly into natural gas or become trapped within the rock, leading to less oil production. 3. Time: The process of oil formation requires millions of years to complete. The gradual buildup of sediments on top of organic material acts as a driving force for the transformation of kerogen into oil. However, if more sediments accumulate too quickly, it can disrupt the natural balance of temperature and pressure, ultimately influencing the rate at which the kerogen turns into oil. A shorter duration under optimal conditions can lead to incomplete conversion of kerogen, resulting in less oil production. 4. Migration: Finally, the ability of oil to migrate from the source rock to reservoir rocks is critical for the accumulation of oil and natural gas reserves. When more sediments pile on top of the kerogen layer, it can limit the ability of the oil to migrate upwards through porous rock layers. This trapped oil may remain within the source rock, causing less oil to accumulate in reservoir rocks. In summary, when more sediments pile on top of existing kerogen layers, it may result in less oil by changing the temperature, pressure, and migration conditions necessary for optimum oil generation and accumulation. These changes can cause incomplete conversion of kerogen into oil or a tendency for the organic material to turn into natural gas or remain trapped within the rock. This perturbation can significantly affect the quantity of oil available for extraction and commercial use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.  Two groups of scientists examined two fires. Group A put a large log on it, and group B made a fire with small twigs. They wanted to see which fire would last longer.  Which group had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction? The answer to this question is:","output":"Group B had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction because the small twigs provided a greater surface area, causing them to burn more quickly than the large log used by Group A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

Question: when did talk radio begin in the U.S.?","output":"The given answer does not provide a correct response to the question about when talk radio began in the U.S. To answer the question: Talk radio in the U.S. has its origins in the 1920s. The early days of radio broadcasting primarily featured news, music, and entertainment programs. However, by the 1930s and 1940s, some U.S. radio stations started to incorporate more talk-based content, such as interviews and discussions on various topics.  One of the pioneers in talk radio programming was Joe Pyne, whose show started in 1945 at local station WILM in Wilmington, Delaware. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, talk radio continued to evolve, expanding to address various political and social issues. The format gained more prominence in the mid-1960s due to the Fairness Doctrine, a now-defunct FCC policy that required broadcasters to present all sides of a controversial issue. This led to more debate and opinion-based programming.  In summary, the beginnings of talk radio in the U.S. can be traced back to the 1920s, but it developed and became more prominent over the next few decades, particularly in the mid-1960s."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Step 1: Understand the hypothesis - \\"You should never get in a car that has been stolen.\\" This statement suggests that it is not socially acceptable to be in a car that has been stolen under any circumstances. Step 2: Analyze the update - \\"you're taking it to get to safety.\\" This context introduces a situation in which someone might use a stolen car to escape from danger. Step 3: Evaluate if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis. In this case, the update presents a scenario where getting into a stolen car might be justifiable for personal safety reasons. This weakens the original hypothesis, which suggests that it is never acceptable to be in a stolen car. Step 4: Provide the answer - Based on the evaluation, the update weakens the hypothesis.

Hypothesis: Two men are playing chess. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise and the hypothesis describe two distinct and separate situations involving different games. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis to understand why they don't support each other: Premise: \\"Two men enjoying a game of pool.\\" In this statement, we learn that there are two men who are actively participating in and enjoying a game of pool, also known as billiards. Pool is a type of cue sport that involves hitting balls with a cue stick on a pool table. The objective of the game is to pocket all the balls in a predetermined order or ahead of one's opponent, depending on the type of pool being played. Some common variations of pool include eight-ball, nine-ball, and straight pool. Hypothesis: \\"Two men are playing chess.\\" In this statement, we are given a hypothesized situation where two men are engaged in a game of chess, which is not related to pool. Chess is a two-player turn-based board game that is played on a chessboard made up of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king, which entails positioning one's pieces in a way that the opponent's king is under threat of capture and there is no legal move available to prevent it. Now that we have a clear understanding of both the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes evident that they are describing two separate scenarios involving different games. The fact that the premise is true and the men are playing pool provides no evidence or support to conclude that they are also playing chess simultaneously or instead of pool. In sum, the truth of the premise does not have any bearing on the validity of the hypothesis, as the two situations described are unrelated and involve different games. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true simply because the premise is true."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"Title: The Cursed Call Genre: Supernatural Thriller Plot Summary: Natsumi Konishi, a young and ambitious journalist, receives a cursed voicemail while visiting her best friend Yumi's apartment, catapulting her into a race against time as she must uncover the terrifying truth behind the ominous message before it consumes her life and takes the lives of those around her. Act 1 - Setup: Natsumi Konishi is a diligent and ambitious journalist, working for a local newspaper in her city. She is known for her relentless pursuit of truth, and always goes above and beyond to uncover the hidden stories that affect the lives of countless individuals. Her best friend, Yumi, is a talented graphic designer working freelance from her apartment. The two friends have been inseparable since their school days and share a strong bond. One fateful evening, Natsumi visits Yumi's apartment after a long day of investigating an urban legend that has the city gripped with fear. The legend tells of a haunted voicemail that, once received, brings misfortune and death to those who listen to it. Natsumi's editor, believing the story to be sensationalist fluff, tasks her with debunking it and putting the citizens' minds at ease.  Act 2 - Confrontation: While Natsumi is catching up with Yumi over a cup of tea, her phone rings. Unaware of the caller, she hesitates for a moment before answering. The call goes to voicemail, and when Natsumi listens to the message, she realizes that it is the same cursed voicemail she had been investigating. The voicemail consists of a series of strange sounds, you can hear a faint, ghastly whisper repeating the words, \\"Seven days.\\" The urban legend claims that, after hearing the voicemail, the recipient's life spirals into chaos, and they die exactly seven days later. Shaken and concerned, Natsumi confides in Yumi. Together, they decide to embark on a desperate quest to unravel the truth behind the cursed message and find a way to break the curse. As Natsumi delves deeper into the origins of the cursed voicemail, she discovers a series of unsolved deaths all linked to the mysterious message. Disturbing connections emerge to a long-abandoned hospital, which once housed patients subjected to unethical experiments on the human mind, consciousness, and perception of fear. One of these patients, a young girl named Ayako, was a victim of these gruesome experiments, which ultimately led to her tragic and untimely death. In search of vengeance, Ayako's spirit is said to have cursed the voicemail sent to random residents of the city. Act 3 - Resolution: In an attempt to face her fears and disarm the curse, Natsumi convinces Yumi to join her in visiting the now-dilapidated hospital. They encounter unexplained supernatural phenomena as they gather more information about Ayako's tortured existence in the abandoned hospital. Eventually, Natsumi and Yumi find themselves face-to-face with the vengeful spirit of Ayako. Natsumi pleads with Ayako to end the curse, acknowledging the grievous wrongs committed against her and uncovering the truth about the illicit activities at the hospital. With Yumi's help, Natsumi offers to expose the story and bring justice to all those affected by the experiments, including Ayako herself. In a climactic and emotionally charged moment, Ayako's spirit accepts Natsumi's plea, breaking the curse and saving the lives of Natsumi and many unsuspecting victims. In the end, Natsumi's courageous pursuit of truth and her unwavering friendship with Yumi prevails. Natsumi writes an in-depth exposé on the hospital's dark history, bringing justice to the forgotten victims and exposing the horrors that took place within its walls. The friendship between Natsumi and Yumi is only strengthened by their harrowing journey, and together, they continue to push their limits and make the world a better place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Let's break down both statements and understand why there is no direct entailment between the two. Premise: \\"They continued their duel, piercing, parrying, dodging, spinning.\\" This statement describes an ongoing duel, presumably between two or more individuals. They are actively engaging in a battle, showcasing various combat techniques such as piercing (presumably with weapons), parrying (deflecting or countering an opponent's attack), dodging (avoiding attacks), and spinning (making agile body movements, possibly to confuse, avoid, or strike the opponent). The premise indicates an intense, active conflict between the subjects. Hypothesis: \\"They all decided not to fight.\\" In contrast, the hypothesis suggests a completely opposite scenario to the one described in the premise. Here, the individuals involved have made a conscious decision to cease fighting or engaging in combat. It could imply a peaceful resolution or an agreement to end hostilities between the parties. Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another statement. In this case, the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis; in fact, the two statements describe conflicting situations - one in which the individuals are engaged in a heated duel and another where they decide to stop fighting altogether. Thus, we can conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the ongoing duel described in the premise does not guarantee or imply the subjects' decision to stop fighting in the hypothesis.

They wanted to grow bigger and become even more powerful. To do this, they needed to take over a city called Constantinople. Constantinople had big, strong walls all around it to keep it safe. These walls made it very hard for anyone to get inside the city. The people in the Ottoman Empire, led by their very smart leader, Sultan Mehmed II, had to come up with a way to break through those strong walls. They knew they needed something big and powerful to do it.  One day, the Sultan heard about a man named Orban, who was very good at building big and powerful machines called cannons. Cannons were like giant metal tubes that could shoot huge, heavy balls really far and really fast. Sultan Mehmed II talked to Orban, and asked him to build a really really big cannon. Orban agreed, and he built the biggest cannon anyone had ever seen. It was so big that it took many strong men and horses just to move it! When the cannon was ready, the Ottoman Empire brought it to Constantinople and used it to try to break down the walls. They shot big, heavy balls at the walls over and over again. The people in Constantinople were scared, because they had never seen anything like it.  With the help of this huge cannon, the Ottoman Empire was able to make holes in the strong walls of Constantinople. Eventually, they were able to break through and take over the city! So, the key factor in the Ottoman Empire taking over Constantinople was the giant cannon made by Orban. This weapon helped them break down the strong walls and win the battle. And this is how the city of Constantinople became part of the Ottoman Empire, which grew even bigger and more powerful."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The GOP’s anti-Hagel crusade: Was it worth it? Chuck Hagel made the penultimate step toward becoming the next defense secretary Tuesday, with his nomination overcoming a procedural vote that it failed to get past two weeks ago. For all intents and purposes, that means Hagel will be confirmed shortly. But not for lack of trying by GOP senators, who invested plenty of time and political will in trying to upend the nomination of their former Republican colleague. So with the battle now all but over, it begs the question: Was it worth it? Former Nebraska senator Chuck Hagel. (Reuters) There are compelling cases to be made on both sides: Why it wasn’t worth it At the end of the day, any legislative maneuvering needs to be judged on whether it succeeded. And in this case, barring something out of left field before the final vote, Hagel will become the next defense secretary. In other words: The GOP lost. Republicans quite simply weren’t able to land that final knock-out blow that they were hoping for, and now they’ve got a guy they really don’t like headed for one of the top Cabinet posts in the Obama administration. In addition, by delaying Hagel’s nomination with a filibuster — something that had never been done to a defense secretary nominee (even if Republicans tried in vain to argue that it wasn’t actually a filibuster) — Republicans have set a precedent. If and when they return to the White House, Democrats now have a new weapon with which to hold up GOP Cabinet nominees, if they decide to use it. The reason senators are so reticent to alter their chamber’s rules is they know it will also apply when the majority/minority roles are reversed. That’s why we still have the filibuster, even though Democrats would love to legislate in the majority without it. And finally, Republicans failed to put up a totally united front against Hagel, with a couple senators supporting his nomination even before the filibuster, and several more voting with Democrats to override the filibuster. The administration can now credibly make the case that Hagel had bipartisan support — something Republicans would have liked to avoid. Why it was worth it Despite the unprecedented nature of the filibuster and the Democratic criticism of their effort against a decorated war hero, Republicans likely will pay no major political price for their tactics. This is for two reasons: 1) The American people quite simply weren’t all that interested. Even though the Hagel drama was big news in Washington, it was met by the American people with a collective yawn. Even as of last week, a Pew poll showed that half of Americans said they didn’t know enough about Hagel to rate him favorably or unfavorably. Despite the dicey electoral gambit to delay Hagel’s nomination, there has been little backlash against Republicans for doing it — at least as far as we can tell right now. And 2) Nobody is going to mourn much for Chuck Hagel. The fact is that this is a guy without a political home. He is a former Republican senator who alienated his own party with his vehement criticism of the Iraq war and also is seen as a political interloper who hasn’t built up a whole lot of good will with Democrats. His past criticisms of the “Jewish lobby” and a gay ambassador nominee, while not enough to derail his nomination, were enough to ensure that even his supporters weren’t all that enamored of him. And Republicans were able to bring his numbers down a little, with Pew showing his unfavorable rating rising from 18 percent in January to 28 percent last week (his favorable rating also rose slightly, from 18 percent to 22 percent, over that span). In the end, the Hagel nomination will amount to little more than an inside baseball political game. Republicans effectively registered their concerns and have, for the second time this year, either thwarted one of President Obama’s likely Cabinet picks (Susan Rice) or served notice that they won’t be steamrolled into supporting divisive nominees (Hagel). The battle isn’t over, and some Republicans are also making noise about holding up the nominations of Jack Lew for treasury secretary and John Brennan for CIA director. The Hagel situation suggests that, even though they may not succeed, there’s not a whole lot of downside to trying.","output":"The GOP's anti-Hagel crusade questions whether the Republican senators' time and political will was worth trying to upend the nomination of their former Republican colleague, Chuck Hagel, for defense secretary. There are arguments to be made on both sides as to whether it was worth it or not. On one hand, Hagel's nomination was not stopped, which means GOP lost, and by delaying the nomination with a filibuster, Republicans have set a precedent that could be used against them in the future. Furthermore, their failure to present a united front on the matter allowed the administration to claim Hagel had bipartisan support. On the other hand, Republicans likely won't face any significant political consequences for their tactics against Hagel's nomination. The American public wasn't fully engaged with the issue, and there seems to be little backlash against the GOP for their actions. Additionally, Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator with no firm political home, is not a widely popular figure. This nomination battle will not have a significant impact in the long run, but it did serve to show that Republicans won't be easily pushed into supporting divisive nominees."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Clarity: The sentence can be understood but seems slightly awkward due to the positioning of the relative clause.

The first statement: \\"Where codice _ 3 is a type qualifier, which the unqualified type of codice _ 27 is codice _ 28 and the qualified type is codice _ 29.\\" Versus the reformulated second statement: \\"codice 3 is a type qualifier with the unqualified type of codice 27 codice 28 , which is the qualified type codice 29.\\" Step 1: Observe the subjects in both the sentences are \\"codice _ 3\\", meaning that these sentences talk about the same thing, therefore giving points towards the sentences meaning the same. Step 2: Both sentences state that codice _ 3 is a type qualifier, contributing more towards the similarity in the meaning. Step 3: Ensure structural similarities. Both sentences declare an \\"unqualified type of codice _ 27 is codice _ 28\\". And, both denote the \\"qualified type is codice _ 29\\". So all these three steps indicate that there is a high degree of overlap in the subject and the information given about that subject in both the sentences. Therefore, the answer should be: (ii). yes.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. HTC's U11 flagship phone HTC      Smartphones have evolved to be controlled by touch. With its latest flagship device, HTC is taking this a step further by allowing the phone to be operated with a squeeze.      HTC Vive's £200 wireless upgrade kit launches spring 2017 VR HTC Vive's £200 wireless upgrade kit launches spring 2017      Advertisement      The Taiwanese firm has launched the HTC U11 with a feature dubbed Edge Sense. It says by giving the 5.5-inch phone a \\"squeeze\\", it's possible to use the phone's apps, camera, and more. The squeeze function, which works on the edges of the device, operates in two ways. Pressure sensors on the phone are located below the volume buttons on the sides of the device. A short squeeze can be configured to open an app, while a long squeeze can launch Google's Assistant or Amazon's Alexa.      HTC      Read next HTC launches a new platform for the Vive Standalone VR headset, no PC required HTC launches a new platform for the Vive Standalone VR headset, no PC required      We've yet to see the squeeze function in action but HTC is promising a wide range of customisation from the new phone interaction. Its promotional materials, published around the phone's launch, say it is possible to take photos with the 12MP rear camera and 16MP front camera; launch a text message with a squeeze, and use the phone's voice recognition to send messages. \\"Before, it was a hassle to reach these features, but we simplified it into a single motion,\\" HTC says.      HTC      Setting aside this apparent time-saving gimmick, the HTC U11 is being launched in five colours and measures 153.9 x 75.9 x 7.9mm, making it around 5mm shorter than the iPhone 7 Plus and 6mm shorter than the Samsung Galaxy 8 Plus. Four of the HTC's colours – silver, blue, black and white – will be available in the UK when the phone launches in June and the red variation will come later this year. The HTC U11 will go on sale for £649 at launch from Carphone Warehouse, EE, O2, Amazon, Very.co.uk, Argos and the Taiwanese company itself.      Advertisement      Inside the smartphone is a 3000mAh battery, 64/128GB of storage, a Snapdragon 835 processor (up to 2.45 Ghz), and 4/6GB of RAM, depending on the specifications you select. There's also the usual array of NFC, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi support as well as a fingerprint sensor, light sensor, proximity sensor, magnetic sensor, and gyroscope.      HTC      Four microphones built into the device are used for audio recording and a 'liquid glass surface' makes the silver HTC U11, at least from pictures, to be one of the shiniest, most reflective phones on the market.      Advertisement      At its launch, the device will run Android 7.1, the latest version of the Google-owned operating system. The version of Nougat has support for Google's Daydream VR and circular Android icons.      HTC also claims the U11 is the first smartphone to be able to use a \\"hands-free wake word\\" to access Amazon's AI assistant, Alexa. The 'always-on' voice commands allow the phone to be listening for the trigger word which then launches the digital assistant when called upon. Google and Apple both have similar features with their 'Okay, Google' and 'Hey Siri' commands.      Expand your mind with WIRED's pick of the best podcasts ||||| But this is all table stakes for a modern, high-end smartphone. With the U11, the real magic starts when you turn up the pressure.      The U11's hallmark feature is Edge Sense, which relies on pressure sensors embedded in the phone's sides. They can detect minute changes in how firmly you grip your phone, and -- more importantly -- can be used to trigger shortcuts and app actions. Let's say you're wearing gloves and feel the sudden, overbearing urge to take a selfie. You could give the U11 a quick squeeze to launch the camera, and another to snap a photo. With the \\"advanced\\" mode enabled, you can even set up different shortcuts for quick squeezes and longer squeeze-and-holds.      Having the pressure-sensitive equivalent of some convenience keys is neat, but after seeing more nuanced controls in the HTC Ocean videos leaked a while back, we're left with three words: \\"Is this it?\\" Don't get us wrong: the pressure sensing worked well enough, but we're not sold on its utility just yet.      HTC is also working on what could generously be described as \\"AI overload.\\" Check it out: the U11 will ship with Google's Assistant onboard, and will get Alexa via software update shortly after launch. HTC says that, thanks to the Snapdragon 835, the U11 can listen for and respond to different wake words -- that is, it should never confuse an \\"OK, Google\\" with a question for Alexa. Even better, you won't need an app running in the foreground like you did with the Alexa experiece on Huawei's Mate 9. We don't know when Motorola's Alexa efforts will be revealed, but it seems like Alexa on the U11 is the version to beat.      Beyond those two, the U11 will also come with HTC's own Sense Assistant, which is meant to chew on your schedule and behavior to offer suggestions like when to bring an umbrella to work. Yeah, that's right: the U11 can have up to three virtual assistants working at the same time. We weren't kidding about overload.      For some, though, the U11's audio chops might be the game-changer. There's more space inside the phone for a speaker chamber, which makes audio sound far louder and richer than on the HTC 10. (In fact, HTC product planning AVP Nigel Newby-House cranked up the U11's volume all the way outside a crowded conference room in our office, and the people inside were getting noticeably pissed by the din.)      And while there's no headphone jack, at least HTC is using Type-C to add to the audio experience. Remember how the U Ultra's USonic earbuds used a sonar-like pulse to intepret the contours of your ear and tune your tunes accordingly? The U11's earbuds do that too, but they also pack-in active noise cancellation without the need for bulky battery module. They draw power from your phone's battery, which is both good and bad: you'll never have to remember to charge your headphones before a flight, but you can bet it'll impact your battery life somewhat.      We'll withhold our judgment on the U11 until we've played with final US units, but we're cautiously optimistic about this thing's chances. The fact that it has a competitive set of guts is reassuring, especially when these slices of silicon are potent enough to deliver near-seamless performance. Still, when the marquee feature -- that pressure-sensing business -- seems to boil down into a minor convenience, we have to wonder if HTC's focus on thoughtful, clever features is starting to waver. ||||| You can’t really blame HTC for embracing a gimmick. A rough couple of years for the smartphone maker warrants some experimentation to help set its devices apart from myriad other Android manufacturers. Edge Sense, sadly, however, is not going to be that technology. The company teased the handset’s squeezable sides in a handful of short web videos, and now that the U 11 has been officially unveiled, we can confirm that the flagship’s most compelling feature isn’t really all that compelling in its current form.      The feature uses sensors built into the sides of the phone to detect pressure as the user squeezes the phone. At present, actual applications for the tech mean that it essentially doubles as something akin to the convenience key that BlackBerry has sported for ages. Basically, you assign functionality to it, so it can, say, launch your favorite app.      In a briefing ahead of this morning’s launch in Taiwan, VP of Product Planning, Nigel Newby-House suggested that this is just the first glimpse into future functionality for Edge Sense — and certainly there’s a lot to be done with a new set of on-board sensors. As it stands, however, Edge Sense is really much more than a glorified button with the addition of an actual new physical button like Samsung did with the devoted Bixby key on the S8.      It probably speaks a bit to the unfulfilled promise of the feature that Newby-House opted not to lead with this feature in our conversation. Most of the talk about the device centered around design decision. And it’s true — the U11 is a good-looking phone, borrowing some cues from the recently announced Ultra. In fact, the company seems to consider the Ultra something of a dry run for the new flagship — or at the very least, a way of introducing the new product line and design language. Probably something you don’t want to hear if you shelled out the 750 for the handset in the last couple of months.      The company calls it Liquid Design — a nod to the curvature and the notion that dipping it in liquid would fill in the sorts of gaps you usually get when two different surfaces are juxtaposed. Not the most straightforward idea, but it sounds nice, so fine. And while it looks pretty good, as well, it’s not exactly unique, bringing to mind other flagships like the S8, particularly given the use of a reflective metallic paint job.      The screen is 5.5-inches, the same size you’ll get on the iPhone 7 Plus. The company says it flirted with the idea of switching up the aspect ratio like LG and Samsung have with their newest flagships (and, according to rumors, like Apple is planning on the 8), but opted to stick with 16:9 for “software reasons” — in other words, it didn’t want to deal with having to rejigger everything on that end. That said, it’s still entertaining the possibility of jumping on the tall phone ship for future devices.      The company has already been on the anti-headphone jack train for a little bit. The Ultra found the company planting its flag on that beach. “The headphone jack is going away,” Newby-House told me matter-of-factly. “Let’s just get on with it.” Of course, not everyone concurs, and other companies haven’t aligned themselves with Apple as quickly as many analysts expected. Even Motorola, which joined the part with the Moto Z, appears as if it’s regretting that move.      That said, the company is still committed as ever to audio — a welcome change from most companies, for whom audio is a fifth- or sixth-tier priority. The phone features a new version BoomSound, one of the better audio systems presently on handsets — though, weirdly, the company opted against dual front-facing speakers in order to accommodate a fingerprint sensor, even as more and more companies are moving biometrics to the back of the device. The phone also ships with company’s proprietary USonic earbuds, which sport active noise canceling.      The most interesting piece of the audio puzzle, however, is the fact that there are four microphones in the handset. This is largely based on a newfound interest in other people’s smart assistants (though it’s got some positive implication for video recording, as well). HTC has worked directly with Qualcomm to design a device capable of responding to two different wake words for two different assistants — neither of which are the in-house one it announced along with the Ultra.      Instead, the company is embracing both Assistant and Alexa. The company says it sees advantages to both and doesn’t want to play favorites. Fair enough. There’s certainly a lot to be said for putting the ultimate decision in the hands of the user. That said, this doesn’t seem to bode well for the company’s faith in its own Sense Companion. And while it says this doesn’t preclude it from going full-on Bixby in the future, it currently views its own play as more of a supplement to Assistant and Alexa.      “We’ve never envisioned Companion as a wake word-type assistant,” says Newby-House. The company is more focused on using it to enhance its own software offerings, likely because it simply isn’t robust enough to be considered a standalone. That said, the company’s getting pretty close to a shit-or-get-off-the-pot moment here. The whole idea of a smart assistant has created a single unified experience — having an assistant designed to work with other assistants kind of flies in the face of all of that.      Oh, and Alexa isn’t shipping with the device out of the box. The company says the functionality should arrive within a month. This is kind of par for the course, at this point. Huawei ran up against a similar roadblock. Part of the issue is the fact that companies have to work directly with Amazon to customize the experience. When it does arrive, it will be in the form of an over-the-air update. It will also be in the box for devices later.      When that functionality does arrive, however, it will bring more traditional functionality. Calling, texting and the like will come down the road. ||||| Want to launch the camera on the HTC U11? Just squeeze.      When the phone's pressure-sensitive sides register your tightened grip, it'll open the app you've programmed in.      Say you've squeezed the camera app open. You can squeeze again to take a picture. A long squeeze might open and close the flashlight, or toggle Wi-Fi or a voice recording. Or another app of your choice.      What's going on is an entirely new way to interact with a phone. Called Edge Sense, this feature marks the first time any phonemaker has used touch like this. For HTC, a company that has itself felt the squeeze from larger rivals such as Samsung, Apple and LG, the U11's grippy new feature presents an opportunity to step out of others' shadows with an industry first.      Giving a phone pressure-sensitive sides is an incredibly interesting innovation, and one that raises a lot of questions: is this a natural way to open shortcuts, or is it better suited to some other task? Will it be accurate or will mispresses abound? Is it a useless gimmick, or the start of exciting things to come?      I don't have an answer to that yet, but after my brief time with the phone, I did try out many of the launch options, and I like that an animation of squeezed-in sides lets you know the feature's working. I found the motion easy to execute, but I did sometimes long-squeeze when I meant to short-squeeze.      I think muscle memory will take care of that down the road. I also think this method of app-launching would only be useful for the apps I open all the time (which takes that voice recorder out of the running).      The bigger question for HTC is if the U11's fresh look and feel, and high end specs are enough to make a dent in Samsung and Apple's overwhelming lead -- squeeze feature or no. From what I've seen of the U11 so far, its premium hardware stands the best chance of any HTC phone in quite awhile.      The rest will come down to performance, and how well HTC can gets its phone in front of buyers.      Price and release date      In the US, the HTC U11 sells for 649 -- you'll be able to pick it up in sapphire blue, amazing silver and brilliant black. Buy the unlocked version from htc.com, and AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon carrier versions from Amazon. The phone will arrive on your doorstep in June. You'll also be able to buy the blue and black HTC U11 from Sprint. The phone goes on sale June 9, but early preorders will also get you two Amazon Echo (129.00 at Adorama) Dot (29.95 at Amazon.com) speakers. It'll cost 0 down and29 per month for 24 months, for a grand total of 696.      It's too soon to say how the U11 performs compares to the Galaxy S8 (578.95 at Amazon.com) and LG G6, and if buyers connect with its glass design and squeeze effects.      Gorgeous glass design, advanced processor and everything else      The Big Squeeze sure is attention-grabbing, but it's really one small feature in what's shaping up to be a pretty good package.      Enlarge Image Josh Miller/CNET      You get a 5.5-inch display with a QHD, or 2,560x1,440-pixel resolution (same as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6), so there's plenty of screen to interact with.      Then there's the body itself. The U11 refines the gorgeous \\"melted\\" glass design of the U Ultra (390.00 at Amazon.com). It really does look like pools of liquid. It's striking.      It's also highly reflective and smudges up quickly. The phone meets a water-resistant rating of IP67, which helps keep water away for up to 30 minutes and 3 feet (1 meter).      I like that the 12-megapixel rear camera sits flush on the design; it's good that the lens doesn't poke out. If you follow camera specs, the U11 uses dual-pixel autofocus technology rather than laser autofocus (this should help it focus faster), and has an aperture of f1.7 (versus f1.8 on the HTC 10 (384.99 at Amazon.com)).      Your front-facing camera is a 16-megapixel wide-angle lens (150 degrees). Camera images seemed completely usable in my quick tests, but I didn't have the time to really dig deep into setting or image quality.      Other things to know going in:      There's no headset jack, so you'll need to plug the included earbuds into the USB-C port.      HTC includes an adapter if you prefer to use your own headphones.      Google Assistant is on board.      Amazon Alexa assistant will launch with a wake word. (HTC will add this about a month after the U11 goes on sale.)      Audio quality so far seems loud, clear and rich.      The Edge Sense squeeze feature is pressure sensitive and will work underwater and through some cases.      HTC will also make a model in solar red (expect it to sell in select regions). ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer HTC has unveiled its new flagship smartphone, the U11, a touch-sensitive device that can be operated with a squeeze.

It is too dangerous for any western journalist to enter Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, now under the brutal control of ISIS. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Syria  is a group so extreme in its use of violence that even Al Qaeda has distanced itself. But on Thursday I managed to reach Mosul’s outskirts and saw thousands of refugees streaming out along the highway towards the northern Kurdish city of Irbil. The other carriageway was desolate.

The ISIS militants appear to have no limits to their terror tactics, which have included mass executions, beheadings, and even public crucifixions. The world has watched in horror as videos of these brutal acts have surfaced, demonstrating the extent of their ruthlessness. As I spoke with the terrified refugees fleeing Mosul, their stories painted a harrowing picture of life under ISIS rule. The militants have imposed a strict version of Sharia law, leading to the brutal punishment of those failing to adhere to their regulations. Women who do not wear the full veil have been flogged, while men have been executed for simply watching soccer games. It is not just the appalling human rights abuses that make life in Mosul unbearable; the economic situation has also deteriorated significantly since the ISIS takeover. With strict controls in place, the once thriving marketplace has now become a shadow of its former self, as many traders have either fled or have been unable to operate due to the restrictive policies. The bravery of those willing to stand up against ISIS cannot be overstated. Within Mosul, there are secret networks of resistance fighters and activists working to undermine the group's stranglehold on the city. These individuals risk their lives daily, and in doing so, they provide the world with valuable information about the situation within Mosul's borders. For now, the fight against ISIS continues, as Iraqi forces and their allies work tirelessly to liberate the city and bring an end to the extremists' horrifying reign. The United Nations, NGOs, and other international actors will continue to do their best to provide assistance to those affected by this violence, but only through a concerted and united effort can the threat of ISIS be truly eliminated. It is in these times that the world must come together, to not only condemn the atrocities committed by this radical group, but actively work to ensure that it does not maintain a lasting foothold in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who directed Roujin Z? Movie title: Roujin Z Movie plot: Roujin Z is set in early 21st century Japan. A group of scientists and hospital administrators, under the direction of the Ministry of Public Welfare, have developed the Z-001: a computerized hospital bed with robotic features.[2][3] The Z-001 takes complete care of the patient: it can dispense food and medicine, remove excretory waste, bathe and exercise the patient lying within its frame. The bed is driven by its own built-in nuclear power reactorâand in the event of an atomic meltdown, the bed (including the patient lying within) would become automatically sealed in concrete.[4] The first patient to be \\"volunteered\\" to test the bed is a dying widower named Kiyuro Takazawa. He is an invalid who is cared for by a young nursing student named Haruko.[5] The electronic elements within the Z-001 somehow manage to transcribe Takazawa's thoughts through Haruko's office computer, and he uses the communication to cry for help.[4] Although she objects to such treatment of elderly patients, Haruko begrudgingly seeks the aid of a group of computer hackers in the hospital's geriatric ward to create and install a vocal simulation of Takazawa's deceased wife in the Z-001.[2][3] However, once Takazawa wishes to go to the beach, the Z-001 detaches itself from its moorings and escapes from the hospital with the man in its grasp.[2][6] Haruko's fears are then justified, as it is discovered that the bed is actually a government-designed, experimental weapons robot.[3][5] A:","output":"Hirotoshi Ishii directed the movie Roujin Z.

Frustration: The tweet seems to express a sense of frustration due to the inability to sleep at 4 AM. Having trouble sleeping, especially at such a late hour, indicates that the person may be experiencing difficulty in their life or struggling with their thoughts. The frustration could stem from knowing that they should be asleep and that this disturbance may affect their usual daily routine and productivity. 2. Restlessness: The mention of not being able to sleep implies a sense of restlessness. It is quite possible that the individual may be dealing with anxiety, stress, or other contributing factors that make it difficult for them to fall asleep or stay asleep. Moreover, the restlessness could lead to exhaustion, annoyance, and other negative feelings that can have a significant impact on their mood and overall well-being. 3. Despair: When viewed through a more emotional lens, the tweet might also convey a sense of despair or hopelessness. Not being able to sleep at 4 AM might mean that the person is dealing with overwhelming feelings or facing certain situations they do not know how to handle, which could lead to sleepless nights. Despair can manifest itself in such situations where the individual feels powerless or overwhelmed. Taking all these emotions into account, it is crucial to mention that the sentiment of the tweet is undeniably negative. It highlights a struggle the person is going through and offers a glimpse into their emotional state, which could be a cry for help or simply venting frustration. Regardless of the exact emotion, it is clear that the individual is experiencing a distressing situation that disrupts their sleep pattern, and consequently, their mental and physical well-being."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: How did the pamphlet leak to a newspaper editor ? Title: Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Movie plot: The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Navy diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter. Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could \\"pass the ketchup.\\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason. Meanwhile, the president sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency \\"Mind Makers,\\" where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys including a bumper sticker with \\"STP\\" for \\"Stop Tomato Program\\" on it, a satirical reference to both the real \\"whip inflation now\\" campaign with its widely ridiculed \\"WIN\\" slogan and STP motor oil decals and bumper stickers which were commonplace in the 1970s.

Background: During respiratory viral infections host injury occurs due in part to inappropriate host responses. In this study we sought to uncover the host transcriptional responses underlying differences between high-and lowpathogenic infections. Results: From a compendium of 12 studies that included responses to influenza A subtype H5N1, reconstructed 1918 influenza A virus, and SARS coronavirus, we used meta-analysis to derive multiple gene expression signatures. We compared these signatures by their capacity to segregate biological conditions by pathogenicity and predict pathogenicity in a test data set. The highest-performing signature was expressed as a continuum in low-, medium-, and high-pathogenicity samples, suggesting a direct, analog relationship between expression and pathogenicity. This signature comprised 57 genes including a subnetwork of chemokines, implicating dysregulated cell recruitment in injury. Conclusions: Highly pathogenic viruses elicit expression of many of the same key genes as lower pathogenic viruses but to a higher degree. This increased degree of expression may result in the uncontrolled co-localization of inflammatory cell types and lead to irreversible host damage.","output":"Task: Generate a suitable title for a research paper based on the given paragraph.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years passed between Mingyi Nyo declaring independence from Ava and Ava falling to the Confederation and Prome?","output":"Title: Journey Through Time: The Fall of Ava and the Rise of Independent Taungoo Introduction The fall of Ava and the rise of independent Taungoo were important events that shaped the political and historical landscape of modern-day Myanmar. However, understanding the timeline of these significant occurrences requires a deep-dive into history. In this article, we will explore the years that passed between Mingyi Nyo declaring independence from Ava and the eventual fall of Ava to the Confederation and Prome. Background Before we delve into the main question, it's crucial to lay down the historical context that led to these events. Ava, also known as Inwa, was a royal capital in Upper Burma from the 14th to 19th centuries. It served as the administrative center for numerous Burmese dynasties, primarily the Toungoo and Restored Taungoo Dynasties. Taungoo, on the other hand, was a small vassal state located in Lower Burma, which eventually became an important regional power in its own right. The rise of Taungoo allowed it to play substantial roles in the formation and expansion of the Burmese Empire. 1. Mingyi Nyo Declares Independence In 1510, Mingyi Nyo, then the ruler of Taungoo, declared independence from the kingdom of Ava. As a regional power, Taungoo had been under Ava's suzerainty for a long time. Still, its ultimate goal was independence and expanding its territories. Deciding it was time to stand on its own, Mingyi Nyo, the founder of the Taungoo Dynasty, set his sights on establishing a powerful and distinct kingdom. Step 1: Identifying the year Mingyi Nyo declared independence - 1510. 2. Fall of Ava to Confederation and Prome The downfall of the once-great Ava kingdom came several decades after Taungoo's independence. In 1527, the Confederation, an alliance of various Shan states, and Prome, a then-independent city-state, besieged and sacked Ava, which led to its eventual collapse. Step 2: Identifying the year Ava fell to Confederation - 1527. Calculating the Years Passed Now that we have the crucial dates – 1510 for Mingyi Nyo's declaration of independence and 1527 for Ava's fall to the Confederation – we can calculate the duration between these two events. Subtracting the year of independence from the year of Ava's fall gives us the number of years passed: 1527 - 1510 = 17 years Conclusion A total of 17 years passed between Mingyi Nyo declaring Taungoo's independence from Ava and the fall of Ava to the Confederation and Prome. This period signified a time of significant change within the landscape of the Burmese territories. It marks the beginning of the Taungoo Dynasty's rise to prominence and the decline of the powerful Ava Kingdom."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given an original reference as well as a system reference.

Begin by placing a pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven and preheating the oven to 550 degrees Fahrenheit. Take one ball of dough and lightly dust it with flour before gradually stretching it on a flat, floured surface, such as a cutting board, baking sheet, or peel. The dough should be stretched to approximately the size of the pizza stone, which is typically around 14 inches. A peel is a wide, flat tool used for handling pizza, characterized by its tapered front edge that allows for easy pizza transfer on and off the stone. Once the dough reaches the desired size, apply the sauce and cheese, followed by vegetables, meats, and seasonings of choice. Properly flouring the flat surface will ease this process. To transfer the pizza onto the preheated stone, place the tip of the flat surface at the stone's back and carefully slide the surface out of the oven, leaving the pizza on the stone. In case the pizza sticks, employ a jerking motion for assistance. The pizza will require 4-6 minutes in the oven and should be carefully monitored until the crust starts to brown. To remove the cooked pizza, slide the flat surface under it, taking caution as the pizza will be extremely hot. Let the pizza rest for a few minutes before cutting to prevent burns.

At a party one evening, Tom challenges Maggie's sister Lisa, a believer in paranormal activity, to hypnotize him. After putting him under, Lisa plants a post-hypnotic suggestion in Tom urging him to \\"be more open-minded\\". Tom then begins experiencing visions of a violent scuffle involving a girl who he later learns is Samantha Kozac, a 17-year-old that disappeared from the neighborhood six months prior. While Tom and Maggie attend a high school football game, Jake is overheard by his babysitter, Debbie Kozac, as he speaks with Samantha. Debbie gets upset and snatches Jake, running off with him in the night. Meanwhile, Tom senses Jake is in danger and rushes home but finds him gone. Tom then sees strange flashes of red light that eventually leads him to the 'L' station where Debbie is speaking with her mother about Jake. When Tom and Maggie confront her, Debbie angrily questions them about her sister Samantha, explaining that she had an intellectual disability: having the mental capacity of an 8-year-old and thus a child's tendency to trust strangers. Tom denies knowing her to Debbie but admits to Maggie that she is the girl in his visions. Tom becomes obsessed with Samantha and begins probing members of the community about her disappearance. This attracts the attention of his landlord Harry Damon, Tom's friend, Frank McCarthy and their respective sons Kurt Damon and Adam McCarthy, who all dismiss Samantha as a runaway teen. During an afternoon walk, Jake and Maggie encounter a funeral where Chicago policemen are saluting in a ceremony; here a policeman named Neil immediately recognizes Jake's unique talent and invites Tom to a private gathering of like-minded people to learn more about what is happening to his son.

Article: This image illustrates how the study participants learned about the habitat and the diet of eight animals, such as the cytar (not its real zoological name). The set of habitat brain regions (A-green) and diet (B-red and blue) regions where the new knowledge was stored. (L refers to left hemisphere of the brain.) Courtesy of Carnegie Mellon University      Cutting-edge brain imaging technology has offered the first glimpse into how new concepts develop in the human brain.      The research, carried out at Carnegie Mellon University and published in Human Brain Mapping, involved teaching people a new concept and observing how it was coded in the same areas of the brain through neural representations.      The \\"olinguito\\" -- a largely fruit-eating carnivore species that lives in rainforest treetops, newly discovered in 2013 -- was initially used as a concept. Marcel Just, a professor of cognitive neuroscience in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, commented: \\"When people learned that the olinguito eats mainly fruit instead of meat, a region of their left inferior frontal gyrus -- as well as several other areas -- stored the new information according to its own code.\\"      The findings revealed that this new knowledge of the olinguito was encoded in exactly the same parts of the brain by everyone who learned it, indicating that the brain may operate its own kind of universal filing system.      In the latest research, 16 study participants were taught information about the diet and dwelling habits of eight extinct animals, in order to study the growth of the neural representations of these concepts in their brains. Drawing on the previous findings, the team predicted where this new knowledge would be stored.      Just and Andrew Bauer, lead author of the study, then used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor these concepts emerging in the brain, and found that each new concept developed its own \\"unique activation signature\\". This allowed a computer program to effectively work out which of the eight animals a participant was thinking about at any given time -- essentially allowing the scientists to read their minds.      Don't miss      Interestingly, the animals with close similarities (such as habitat) had closely matched activation signatures, and once a property of an animal had been learned, it stayed intact in the brain even after new ones had been taught -- providing a new insight into the neural durability of the things we learn.      Bauer commented: \\"Each time we learn something, we permanently change our brains in a systematic way. It was exciting to see our study successfully implant the information about extinct animals into the expected locations in the brain's filing system.\\"      It's hoped that the research may be able to help shape future teaching methods in schools, and also give a clearer picture of how knowledge is \\"lost\\" as a result of serious brain injuries and conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. ||||| Thanks to Carnegie Mellon University advances in brain imaging technology, we now know how specific concrete objects are coded in the brain, to the point where we can identify which object, such as a house or a banana, someone is thinking about from its brain activation signature. Now, CMU scientists are applying this knowledge about the neural representations of familiar concepts by teaching people new concepts and watching the new neural representations develop. Published in Human Brain Mapping, the scientists have - for the first time - documented the formation of a newly learned concept inside the brain and show that it occurs in the same brain areas for everyone.This image illustrates how the study participants learned about the habitat and the diet of eight animals, such as the cytar (not its real zoological name).

Credit: Carnegie Mellon University Thanks to Carnegie Mellon University advances in brain imaging technology, we now know how specific concrete objects are coded in the brain, to the point where we can identify which object, such as a house or a banana, someone is thinking about from its brain activation signature.      Now, CMU scientists are applying this knowledge about the neural representations of familiar concepts by teaching people new concepts and watching the new neural representations develop. Published in Human Brain Mapping, the scientists have—for the first time—documented the formation of a newly learned concept inside the brain and show that it occurs in the same brain areas for everyone.      This novel research merges brain science and instructional innovation, two of Carnegie Mellon's university-wide initiatives—BrainHub, which focuses on how the structure and activity of the brain give rise to complex behaviors, and the Simon Initiative, which aims to measurably improve student learning outcomes by harnessing decades of learning science research.      Marcel Just, a leading neuroscientist, pointed to the Smithsonian Institute's 2013 announcement about the olinguito, a newly identified carnivore species that mainly eats fruits and lives by itself in the treetops of rainforests, as an example of the type of new concept that people learn.      'Millions of people read the information about the olinguito and in doing so permanently changed their own brains,' said Just, the D.O. Hebb University Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience in CMU's Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. 'Our research happened to be examining this process precisely at that time in a laboratory setting. When people learned that the olinguito eats mainly fruit instead of meat, a region of their left inferior frontal gyrus—as well as several other areas—stored the new information according to its own code.'      Just added, 'The new knowledge gained from the Smithsonian's announcement became encoded in the same brain areas in every person that learned the new information, because all brains appear to use the same filing system.'      For the study, Andrew Bauer, a Ph.D. student in psychology, and Just taught 16 study participants diet and dwelling information about extinct animals to monitor the growth of the neural representations of eight new animal concepts in the participants' brains.      Drawing on previous findings, the research team knew 'where' to expect the new knowledge to emerge in the brains of their participants. Information about dwellings and information about eating have each been shown to reside in their own set of brain regions, regions that are common across people.      Over the course of an hour, the study participants were given a zoology mini-tutorial on the diets and habitats of the animals, while the scientists used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor the emergence of the concepts in the participants' brains. As the new properties were taught, the activation levels in the eating regions and the dwelling regions changed.      One important result was that after the zoology tutorial, each one of the eight animal concepts developed its own unique activation signature. This made it possible for a computer program to determine which of the eight animals a participant was thinking about at a given time. In effect, the program was reading their minds as they contemplated a brand-new thought.      But even though the animals had unique activation signatures, the animals that shared similar properties (such as a similar habitat) had similar activation signatures. That is, a resemblance between the properties of two animals resulted in a resemblance between their activation signatures. This finding shows that the activation signatures are not just arbitrary patterns, but are meaningful and interpretable.      'The activation signature of a concept is a composite of the different types of knowledge of the concept that a person has stored, and each type of knowledge is stored in its own characteristic set of regions,' Just said.      Another important result was that once a property of an animal was learned, it remained intact in the brain, even after other properties of the animal had been learned. This finding indicates the relative neural durability of what we learn.      'Each time we learn something, we permanently change our brains in a systematic way,' said Bauer, the study's lead author. 'It was exciting to see our study successfully implant the information about extinct animals into the expected locations in the brain's filing system.'      Just believes that the study provides a foundation for brain researchers to trace how a new concept makes its way into the brain from the words and graphics used to teach it, foreshadowing a capability to assess the progress in learning a complicated concept like those in a high-school physics lesson. fMRI pattern analyses could diagnose which aspects of a concept students misunderstand (or lack), in a way that could guide the next iteration of instruction.      The results from this study also indicate that it may be possible to use a similar approach to understand the 'loss' of knowledge in various brain disorders, such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease, or due to brain injuries. The loss of a concept in the brain may be the reverse of the process that the study observed.

Summarize this article: Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Thylane Loubry Blondeau, a 10-year-old model with a sultry stare beyond her years, had the fashion industry drooling after posing for French Vogue. But photos of the Parisian preteen, whose lanky body and gap-toothed pout bring to mind full-grown size-zero magazine cover girls, have reignited the debate over the sexualization of young girls.      Wearing makeup, high heels and haute couture, Blondeau looks a far cry from a typical 10-year-old. Even in childish smocks and cotton tees, her expressions are oddly adult -- a product, perhaps, of living half her young life in the fashion world (she reportedly hit the runway for Jean-Paul Gauthier at age 5). And some say Blondeau's grown-up beauty is giving other young girls unhealthy ideas about how they should look.      \\"We don't want kids to grow up too fast,\\" said Shari Miles-Cohen, senior director of women's programs for the American Psychological Association. \\"We want them to be able to develop physically, emotionally, psychologically and socially at appropriate rates for their age.\\"      French Vogue provocatively poked at this principle, running photos of Blondeau and two other tweens playing designer dress-up captioned with, \\"Quel maquillage à quel âge?\\" -- What makeup at what age? But a shot of Blondeau wearing a red dress and stilettos lying on a tiger skin rug had critics crying foul.      \\"This isn't edgy. It's inappropriate, and creepy, and I never want to see a nine-year-old girl in high-heeled leopard print bedroom slippers ever again,\\" wrote Chloe Angyal, editor of Feminsting.com.      Sexualized images can have lasting effects on the young girls who see them. An APA taskforce found that sexualization by the media affects how girls think about femininity and sexuality, promoting \\"appearance and physical attractiveness\\" as key values. It's also linked to low self-esteem, eating disorders and depression.      \\"The research clearly shows that the fashion industry affects girls and women's images of themselves and their self-esteem if they do not meet the industry 'image' that is currently in vogue,\\" said Paul Miller, associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University in Phoenix. \\"Even the very young are quite conscious of media images of what is 'pretty' and desirable.\\"      In a photo not affiliated with Vogue, Blondeau poses topless on a bed with a young male playmate propositioning a pillow fight. And in another, she wears hip-slung jeans and no top with beaded necklaces covering her would-be breasts.      Many in the industry have defended the work as art. Others say it crosses a line.      \\"Any creepy child pornographer could plead 'artistic license,'\\" said Miller.            Thylane Loubry Blondeau's grown-up look is creating a stir.      Blondeau is not the first mini model to stir up the sexualization debate. In 2007, a 13-year-old Dakota Fanning posed in a controversial campaign for Marc Jacobs. Now 13-year-old Elle Fanning has followed in her sister's footsteps as the face of Jacobs' Fall 2011 campaign.      The controversy extends to pint-sized pageant queens and prospective pop stars, too. A YouTube video of 8- and 9-year-olds dancing to Beyonce's \\"Single Ladies\\" spurred a similar uproar last year.      \\"People have always admired young ballerinas in scanty costumes, but those performances weren't explicitly sexual,\\" Vivian Friedman, child psychologist and professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told ABC News at the time. \\"There was an aesthetic that didn't remind you of being in bed.\\"      Photos of Blondeau, some in pink tutus and others in bed, illustrate the disparity.      \\"[The photos] clearly create an image of the girl as an adult woman, both in the clothing, the postures and emotional content of the images,\\" said Miller. \\"The message is that very young girls can be dressed and viewed as young adult women.\\" ||||| Blonde lady from Romania mature on home alone cam.

Movie title: True Grit Movie plot: Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), the narrator and protagonist, explains that her father was murdered by Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) when she was 14 years old. While collecting her father's body in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Mattie asks the local sheriff about the search for Chaney. He tells her that Chaney has fled with \\"Lucky\\" Ned Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, not believing she has the money to hire him. She raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill. Texas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town after pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes to team up with Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn but he leaves without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward. After being refused passage on the ferry that conveyed Cogburn and LaBoeuf, Mattie crosses the river on horseback. LaBoeuf expresses his displeasure by birching Mattie with a stick, but Cogburn eventually allows Mattie to accompany them. After a dispute over their respective service with the Confederate States of America, Cogburn ends their arrangement and LaBoeuf leaves to pursue Chaney on his own. Cogburn and Mattie meet a trail doctor who directs them to an empty dugout for shelter. They find two outlaws, Quincy and Moon, and interrogate them. Quincy insists they have no information about the Pepper gang, but eventually Moon divulges what he knows; Quincy fatally stabs Moon, and Cogburn shoots Quincy dead. Before dying, Moon says Pepper and his gang will be returning for fresh horses that night. LaBoeuf arrives at the dugout and is confronted by the Pepper gang.

After joining forces with Deputy U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, Mattie relentlessly pursues Chaney in an attempt to bring him to justice for her father's murder. Mattie's determination and courage play significant roles in the story, as she overcomes numerous obstacles and challenges along the way. Towards the end of the movie, the trio of Mattie, Rooster, and LaBoeuf manage to track down the Pepper gang, with whom Chaney has been hiding. During a confrontation with the outlaws, Mattie manages to shoot Chaney, significantly wounding him. This gunshot dramatically alters the course of events, as it allows Rooster and LaBoeuf to gain the upper hand in their battle against the Pepper gang. The fact that Mattie is the one to shoot and wound Chaney is crucial to the movie's plot and her character development. It shows her relentless pursuit of justice and her determination to personally see that her father's killer is held accountable for his actions. Mattie's bravery and strong-willed nature ultimately propel the story forward and create a powerful connection between her and the audience. In conclusion, the person Mattie shoots and wounds in True Grit is none other than Tom Chaney, the man responsible for her father's murder. Through sheer determination and unwavering courage, Mattie becomes a key player in bringing Chaney to justice and avenging her father's death. This event adds depth to the film's narrative and highlights Mattie's strong character, making her one of the most memorable figures in cinematic history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Surprisingly, each of these carries the same risk, which is very low.However, what about flying compared to working in the chemical industry? Unfortunately, the former is 65 times riskier than the latter! In fact the accident rate of workers in the chemical industry is less than that of almost any of human activity, and almost as safe as staying at home. The trouble with the chemical industry is that when things go wrong they often cause death to those living nearby.It is this that makes chemical accidents so newsworthy.Fortunately, they are extremely rare.The most famous ones happened at Texas City (1947), Flixborough (1974), Seveso (1976), Pemex (1984) and Bhopal (1984). Some of these are always in the minds of the people even though the loss of life was small.No one died at Seveso, and only 28 workers at Flixborough.The worst accident of all was Bhopal, where up to 3,000 were killed.The Texas City explosion of fertilizer killed 552.The Pemex fire at a storage plant for natural gas in the suburbs of Mexico City took 542 lives, just a month before the unfortunate event at Bhopal. Some experts have discussed these accidents and used each accident to illustrate a particular danger.Thus the Texas City was caused by tons of ammonium nitrate, which is safe unless stored in a great quantity.The Flixborough fireball was the fault of management, which took risks to keep production  going during essential repairs.The Seveso accident shows what happens if the local authorities lack knowledge of the danger on their doorstep.When the poisonous gas drifted over the town , local leaders were incapable of taking effective action.The Pemex fire was made worse by an overloaded site in an overcrowded suburb.The fire set off a chain reaction of exploding storage tanks.Yet, by a miracle, the two largest tanks did not explode.Had these caught fire, then 3,000 strong rescue team and fire fighters would all have died.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet  (2 June 1857 - 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924. Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries \\"museum pieces\\". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvorak and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saens and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.  Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889-91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the repertory.  Elgar's principal large-scale early works were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were The Black Knight, King Olaf, The Light of Life, The Banner of St George and Caractacus. He also wrote a Te Deum and Benedictus for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of leitmotifs, but less favourably on the qualities of his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the Enigma Variations, appeared to be a sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade. by which titles?","output":"Elgar's best-known compositions are \\"orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Kimberley Ann \\"Kim\\" Deal (born June 10, 1961) is an American singer, songwriter and musician, best known as the former bassist and backing vocalist of the alternative rock band Pixies, and the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for The Breeders. Deal joined Pixies in January 1986 as the band's bassist, adopting the stage name Mrs. John Murphy for the albums Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Following Doolittle and The Pixies' hiatus, she formed The Breeders with Tanya Donelly, Josephine Wiggs and later introduced her identical twin sister Kelley Deal. The Pixies broke up in early 1993, and Deal returned her focus to The Breeders, who released the platinum-selling album Last Splash in 1993. Context: Deal became the bassist and backing vocalist for Pixies in January 1986, after answering an advertisement in the Boston Phoenix that said, \\"\\"Band seeks bassist into Husker Du and Peter, Paul and Mary. Please - no chops.\\" Deal was the only person to call them, even though her main instrument was guitar. She borrowed her sister Kelley's bass guitar to use in the band. To complete the lineup, she suggested they hire David Lovering as drummer, a friend of her husband, whom she met at her wedding reception. For the release of the band's first recording Come on Pilgrim (1987), Deal used the nom de disque \\"Mrs. John Murphy\\" in the liner notes. She chose the name as an ironic feminist joke, after conversing with a lady who wished to be called only by her husband's name as a form of respect.  For Surfer Rosa (1988), Deal sang lead vocals on the album's only single, \\"Gigantic\\" ( sample ), which she co-wrote with Black Francis. Doolittle followed a year later, with Deal contributing the song \\"Silver\\" and appearing on slide guitar. By this time, however, tensions began to develop between her and Francis, with bickering and standoffs between the two marring the album's recording sessions. This led to increased stress between the band members. Murphy commented that during the sessions, it \\"went from just all fun to work\\". Exhaustion, from releasing three records in two years and constant touring, contributed to the friction, particularly between Francis and Deal.  The tension and exhaustion culminated at the end of the US \\"Fuck or Fight\\" tour, where they were too tired to attend the end-of-tour party. The band soon announced a hiatus. Question: Why was this bad Answer:","output":"This was bad because when the members of the band, like Kim Deal and Black Francis, started to argue and not get along, it made it hard for them to work together and make good music. They were also very tired from making so many songs and going on tours, which made them feel even more upset. This led to the band taking a break, and the people who loved their music had to wait for them to come back together and make more songs. It's important for people in a band to get along and work well together, so they can make great music for everyone to enjoy."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang.

Take all of your calculated returns and add them together. Then, divide by the number of returns you are using, n, to find the mean return. This represents the average return over the time period you are measuring. Specifically, the mean, m, is calculated as follows: m =(R1+R2+...Rn)/(n). For example, imagine that you had 5 periods that had calculated returns of 0.2, -0.1, -0.3, 0.4, and 0.1. You would add these together to get 0.3 then divide by the number of periods, n, which is 5. Therefore, your mean, m, would be 0.3/5, or 0.06. For every return, Rn, a deviation, Dn, from the mean return, m, can be found. The equation for finding Dn can be expressed simply as Dn=Rn-m. Complete this calculation for all returns within the range you are measuring.  Using the previous example, you would subtract your mean, 0.06, from each of the returns to get a deviation for each. These would be: D1=0.2-0.06, or 0.14 D2=-0.1-0.06, or -0.16 D3=-0.3-0.06, or -0.36 D4=0.4-0.06, or 0.34 D5=0.1-0.06, or 0.04 Your next step is to find the mean variance of the returns by summing the squared individual deviations from the mean of the returns. The equation for finding the variance, S, can be expressed as: S=(D1^2+D2^2+...Dn^2)/(n-1). Again, sum the squares of the deviations, Dn, and divide by the total number of variances minus 1, n-1, to get your mean variance.  First, square your deviations from the last step. These would be, in order: 0.0196, 0.0256, 0.1296, 0.1156, 0.0016. Sum these numbers to get 0.292. Then, divide by n-1, which is 4, to get 0.073. So, S=0.073 in the example. The volatility is calculated as the square root of the variance, S. This can be calculated as V=sqrt(S). This \\"square root\\" measures the deviation of a set of returns (perhaps daily, weekly or monthly returns) from their mean. It is also called the Root Mean Square, or RMS, of the deviations from the mean return. It is also called the standard deviation of the returns.  In the example, this would just be the square root of S, which is 0.073. So, V=0.270. This number has been rounded to three decimal places. You may choose to keep more decimals to be more accurate.  A stock whose price varies wildly (meaning a wide variation in returns) will have a large volatility compared to a stock whose returns have a small variation. By way of comparison, for money in a bank account with a fixed interest rate, every return equals the mean (i.e., there's no deviation) and the volatility is 0. Summary:","output":"1. Calculate the mean return (m) by adding all the individual returns (Rn) and dividing by the total number of returns (n): m = (R1+R2+...Rn)/(n). 2. Calculate the deviation (Dn) for each return by subtracting the mean return (m) from each return (Rn): Dn = Rn - m. 3. Find the mean variance (S) by summing the squared deviations (Dn^2) and dividing by (n-1): S = (D1^2+D2^2+...Dn^2)/(n-1). 4. Calculate the volatility (V) as the square root of the variance (S): V = sqrt(S). In the provided example, the mean return is 0.06, the mean variance is 0.073, and the volatility is 0.270. Volatility represents the level of variation in returns and can be used to assess the risk of an investment. A stock with a higher volatility has more price fluctuation, while a lower volatility indicates more stable returns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Suede is variety of what?","output":"Suede is a variety of leather. It is a type of leather that is made from the underside of the animal skin, usually from calves, lambs, pigs, goats, or deer. Suede is created through a process that splits the hide to produce the soft, napped surface that is characteristic of this material. The name \\"suede\\" is derived from the French term \\"gants de Suède,\\" which means \\"gloves from Sweden,\\" as it was originally utilized for creating gloves. The distinct features of suede come from its unique production process. Compared to full-grain leather, which is made from the outer side of the animal hide and has a smooth surface, suede has a soft, velvety texture that is obtained after the hide is sanded or buffed to raise the fibers on the surface. This results in a plush, delicate surface that has a higher level of breathability as compared to other types of leather. While the softness and pliability of suede make it a popular choice for various items like shoes, gloves, handbags, jackets, and upholstery, it also has some drawbacks. Suede is more susceptible to stains, water damage, and wear than other leather types due to its porous nature and delicate surface. Therefore, suede products require additional maintenance and care to preserve their appearance and condition. To protect and prolong the life of suede items, it is important to follow proper care guidelines. These include: 1. Handling with clean hands: As suede can easily absorb oil and dirt, it is crucial to handle it with clean hands to avoid staining the material. 2. Using a suede brush: Regularly brushing suede items with a soft-bristle suede brush can help maintain the material's napped surface and remove dust and dirt. Always brush in the direction of the nap to prevent damage. 3. Protecting from moisture: Using a spray-on suede protector can help shield the material from water damage and stains. It is vital to follow the manufacturer's instructions and test a small, inconspicuous area of the suede before applying the product. 4. Storing in a cool, dry place: Suede should be kept away from direct sunlight, heat, and moisture to prevent fading, discoloration, and damage. 5.

(CNN) -- A nonprofit group founder became the third person to accuse San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of sexual harassment, telling CNN Wednesday that he tried to kiss her at least four times during a business meeting at a restaurant when he was a congressman. Filner couldn't be immediately reached for comment. He has recently responded to other accusations of sexual harassment in recent weeks by asserting he will eventually be vindicated, but he acknowledged he needs \\"help\\" and has been \\"clearly doing something wrong.\\" Morgan Rose met with Filner in April 2009 at a Marie Callender's Restaurant & Bakery across the street from Filner's congressional office in Chula Vista, California, she told CNN.","output":"Rose, who founded a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving child welfare, said she had arranged the meeting with Filner to discuss strategies for preventing child abuse, particularly in military families within Filner's congressional district. According to Rose, the then-congressman seemed genuinely interested in her cause at first, and they spent some time discussing the issue and potential solutions. However, the tone of the meeting shifted dramatically when Filner allegedly became increasingly insistent on his attempts to kiss Rose despite her clear discomfort and objections. \\"He tried to move my face towards his to intimidate me,\\" Rose said. \\"I kept pulling back and trying to focus on the discussion at hand, but he just wouldn't let up.\\" Feeling threatened and ashamed by Filner's inappropriate behavior, Rose managed to end the meeting and leave the restaurant. She later confided in friends and family about what had happened, but hesitated to come forward publicly for fear of retribution that might impact her nonprofit's work. The allegations against Filner have sparked widespread condemnation from both political parties and intensified calls for his resignation as mayor of San Diego. In addition to the three accusers who have come forward publicly, several other women have reportedly made anonymous claims of harassment against Filner. Members of the San Diego City Council have expressed concern over the mounting allegations and called for an independent investigation into Filner's conduct. \\"These allegations are deeply troubling, and an investigation is certainly warranted,\\" said Councilmember Barbara Bry. \\"We must ensure that such behavior has no place in the halls of government.\\" In response to the earlier allegations, Mayor Filner vowed to seek professional help for his behavior, stating, \\"I need help with my personal interactions, and I am seeking guidance from professionals on how to conduct myself properly and respectfully.\\" As the investigation into Mayor Filner's actions continues, the outcome remains uncertain. Should more evidence of harassment surface, Filner may face not only political backlash but also potential legal consequences for his actions. It is yet to be seen whether Filner's claims of eventual vindication will hold true. However, the growing number of accusations underscores the importance of addressing sexual harassment in the workplace and creating an environment where such behavior is not tolerated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Moulin Rouge! Context: In the year 1900, a British writer suffering from depression named Christian (Ewan McGregor) begins writing on his typewriter (\\"Nature Boy\\"). As Christian narrates, the film flashes back to one year earlier upon Christian's move to the Montmartre district of Paris to become a writer among members of the area's Bohemian movement. He soon encounters that his neighbours are a loose troupe of performers led by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo). Toulouse-Lautrec and the others ask for Christian's help, and his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\", that they wish to sell to the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent). The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his \\"Diamond Dog Dancers\\" perform for the audience (\\"Zidler's Rap Medley\\"). Toulouse arranges for Christian to see Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star courtesan, in her private quarters to present the work, unaware that Zidler is promising Satine to the wealthy and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), a potential investor in the cabaret (\\"Sparkling Diamonds\\"). Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke, and dances with him before retiring to her private chamber with him to discuss things privately (\\"Rhythm of the Night\\", \\"Meet Me in the Red Room\\"), but soon learns he is just a writer (\\"Your Song\\").

Summarize: An international team detected the light display around a brown dwarf about 18 light years away in the Lyra constellation. They say the luminous glow looks like the northern lights, but is up to a million times brighter and more red than green in colour. The findings are reported in the journal Nature. Dr Stuart Littlefair, an astronomer from the University of Sheffield, said: \\"This is the first time that we have confirmed we are seeing auroras on brown dwarfs.\\" Charged interaction Shimmering auroras are some of the Earth's most dazzling displays. This luminous glow can also appear around all the planets in our Solar System. They are caused when charged particles from the Sun interact with the atmosphere. But the illuminated brown dwarf, an object which is too small to have become a star but too massive to be a planet, lies further out in the galaxy. Called LSR J1835, it was observed using the Very Large Array radio telescope and the Hale and Keck optical telescopes. The scientists watched the object as it rapidly rotated, and observed how the light varied. \\"The brightness changes are consistent with what you would expect from auroras,\\" said Dr Littlefair. The dwarf's aurora is mainly red in colour because the charged particles are mainly interacting with hydrogen in its atmosphere. On Earth, the greenish glow is caused as the electrons from the Sun hit oxygen atoms. However, scientists are puzzled about how the light show is being generated. The brown dwarf is a sort of failed star itself, and has no other star like the Sun nearby to blast it with charged particles. \\"It is possible material is being stripped off the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons,\\" said Dr Littlefair. Another option is an as-yet-undetected planet or moon around the dwarf is throwing off material to light it up. Some of Jupiter's auroras are produced in this way, as charged particles are emitted from volcanoes on its moon Io. The discovery is also helping scientists to better understand brown dwarfs. There is some debate over whether they are more star-like in their nature, or whether they have planetary attributes. \\"If you are working in brown dwarfs, it matters whether you think of them as small stars or big planets,\\" said Dr Littlefair. \\"We already known from observations of brown dwarfs that they have clouds in the atmosphere. Now we know they also show auroras, it is yet more reason to consider brown dwarfs as scaled-up versions of planets rather than scaled-down version of stars.\\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter.

She wasn't out chasing butterflies or climbing a tree, but resting snugly in her basket. One morning, as the sun was just starting to wake up, Esther's owner was getting ready for work. He found her in her basket not feeling very well. It appeared that poor Esther was wounded. She had been hurt very close to her lung - so close, it was almost like the width of a game of darts! Darts are small pointed things that people throw at a target in a game. In this situation, 'Dart' is being used to explain how close the hurt was to Esther's lung. It simply means that the wound was very very close to hurting her lung.  Seeing Esther in pain, her owner quickly rushed her to those nice people who look after animals when they're ill - the veterinarians, or vets for short. These vets decided they needed to operate straight away to get Esther feeling better. Operating is just a fancy word for doing special doctor stuff to help fix Esther's hurt. The good news is, after the operation, the vets have said Esther should get completely better. That's what we call a full recovery. So, even though Esther had a big fright, she was very brave and is now on her way to feeling her old self again. Now, here comes the mystery part of our story. The Police in Kent - they're the people who make sure everyone is safe and following the rules - are looking into what happened to Esther on February 25th. They want to find out how she got hurt and make sure it doesn't happen to any other cuddly cats. So, let's all cross our fingers and toes, and send our warmest wishes to brave little Esther for a speedy recovery. Her adventure was very scary, but remember, she's going to be okay in the end. This tale reminds us to always be kind to our furry friends and take good care of them. They cannot speak like us, but they too feel pain and love, just like all of us."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Article: Beijing ---- A recent Chinese blockbuster   \\"A World Without Thieves\\" is based on the experiences of a young migrant worker  carrying 60,000 yuan on a train packed with thieves.But while the image of a warm-hearted but somewhat naive migrant worker may have made film fans chuckle, it's a sure bet that most of China's migrant workers are yet to step into a cinema to admire it.          \\"Forty yuan a ticket? I can't afford it,\\" said Shen Jie, a migrant worker at a construction site in Dongzhimen, east Beijing.          Shen found it hard to remember when he last watched a film, or what it was about.\\"It must be 10 years ago,\\" he said.          Though they are the builders of the nation's theaters and cinemas, a limited cultural life is common among China's 120 million migrant workers.          Shen arrived from East China's Zhejiang Province in1991.Life was better then; money seemed to come more easily.\\"Now, as more and more workers are rushing to the capital, it's too hard to earn money, and none of us dare think about watching films,\\" he said.          For many like Shen, the dream is earning enough to pay for their children's education so they can find jobs in the cities and say goodbye to the hardships of rural life forever.This drives them to work hard and save as much as possible.          With a monthly salary of less than 500 yuan, Shen has to send money home to his little son and silver-haired parents.          In Shen's small dormitory, which he shares with seven other co-workers, there is a well-thumbed copy of a magazine published in 1998.          A recent survey by local media revealed that 80 percent of migrant workers spent their spare time sleeping and chatting because of exhaust and a lack of income.The same survey found that 47 percent of migrant workers have to work for more than 10 hours a day.Around 40 percent do not even possess a book, and nearly 60 percent say they are dissatisfied with their cultural life.

You are presented with the question \\"Fall begins as deciduous trees lose their leaves when?\\" and the following answer choices:  - It becomes dormant  - Plant growth is reduced  - in the autumn season  - deforestation  - Physical weathering  - in the winter season  - in the spring season  - in the freezing season  Now knowing that the color of leaves on deciduous trees usually changes in the autumn season and fall colors begin as deciduous trees lose their leaves, choose the best answer. A:","output":"In the autumn season The process of deciduous trees losing their leaves primarily occurs during the autumn season. Deciduous trees, which include maple, oak, and elm, have evolved to shed their leaves as a survival mechanism in response to changes in their environment. As the daylight hours decrease and the temperatures begin to cool, certain cues trigger a chemical process in the tree to conserve energy and prepare for the upcoming winter. The cause of this foliage change can be attributed to several factors, primarily the reduction in sunlight and cooler temperatures. The tree's chlorophyll - the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis - starts to break down, revealing other pigments such as carotenoids and anthocyanins, which produce the signature hues of yellow, orange, and red. These pigments, along with a decrease in water and nutrient availability, play a part in the spectacular display of fall colors seen in deciduous forests. Once the chemical changes have taken place and the leaves have lost their connection to the tree, they eventually fall to the ground due to gravity and wind. This process is known as abscission, and it allows the tree to conserve energy and water over the winter months when resources are more scarce. The fallen leaves also contribute important nutrients back into the soil through the process of decomposition, providing a natural fertilizer for the tree when it starts growing again in the spring. Autumn, therefore, is the correct answer to the question \\"Fall begins as deciduous trees lose their leaves when?\\" because it is the season when this process predominantly takes place. The other options, such as dormancy, reduced plant growth, deforestation, physical weathering, and other seasons, do not accurately account for the specific time frame or the mechanisms behind deciduous trees shedding their leaves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  Paragraph: Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets.

As Mollett left the house he saw two men walking down the road away from the sweep before the hall door, and as he passed them he recognised one as the young gentleman of the house. He also saw that a horse followed behind them, on the grass by the roadside, not led by the hand, but following with the reins laid loose upon his neck. They took no notice of him or his car, but allowed him to pass as though he had no concern whatever with the destinies of either of them. They were Herbert and Owen Fitzgerald.  The reader will perhaps remember the way in which Owen left Desmond Court on the occasion of his last visit there. It cannot be said that what he had heard had in any way humbled him, nor indeed had it taught him to think that Clara Desmond looked at him altogether with indifference. Greatly as she had injured him, he could not bring himself to look upon her as the chief sinner. It was Lady Desmond who had done it all. It was she who had turned against him because of his poverty, who had sold her daughter to his rich cousin, and robbed him of the love which he had won for himself. Or perhaps not of the love--it might be that this was yet his; and if so, was it not possible that he might beat the countess at her own weapons? Thinking over this, he felt that it was necessary for him to do something, to take some step; and therefore he resolved to go boldly to his cousin, and tell him that he regarded Lady Clara Desmond as still his own.  What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. What did the man see as he left? 2. Where? 3. How many were there? 4. Did he recognize any of them? 5. As whom? 6. Did they see him? 7.

Question: Question: \\"Which compounds is used by cypress to be against insects, terpenes or rosin?\\"  Context: \\"Aside from the lignocellulose, wood consists of a variety of low molecular weight organic compounds, called extractives. The wood extractives are fatty acids, resin acids, waxes and terpenes. For example, rosin is exuded by conifers as protection from insects. The extraction of these organic materials from wood provides tall oil, turpentine, and rosin.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The compound used by cypress to protect against insects is rosin. Justification of steps: 1. I revised the question posed by the user, which is about the compound cypress uses against insects. 2. Next, I carefully studied the context provided. The context discusses several classes of organic compounds present in wood, including resin acids (such as rosin) and terpenes. The text specifically states that \\"rosin is exuded by conifers as protection from insects.” Since cypress is a type of conifer, it can be inferred that it uses rosin to protect against insects.  3.

Milo's dog, The Phantom Tollbooth's 'watchdog'? What is the answer?","output":"The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy adventure novel written by Norton Juster and illustrated by Jules Feiffer, which was first published in 1961. The story revolves around a young boy named Milo who is bored with his life and unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth that takes him on a journey to a fantastical realm. One of the key characters in this enchanting world is Tock, a dog commonly referred to as the 'watchdog.' Tock's name is a play on words, a pun of sorts, as Tock is not an ordinary dog, but a watchdog in the most literal sense. Along with having a dog's body, Tock has an alarm clock built into his torso, which signifies the importance of time to his character. This combination of features makes him unique and well-suited for his role in the story. As Milo embarks upon his magical journey, he meets Tock early on, and the two become close companions throughout their adventures. Tock joins Milo as they explore the various regions within the Kingdom of Wisdom, including memorable locations like Dictionopolis, where they learn about the power and importance of words, and Digitopolis, where numbers and mathematics reign supreme. Tock's purpose in the story is not only to assist Milo in navigating the kingdom but also to provide guidance, wisdom, and friendship throughout their journey. The character of Tock stands as a symbol of the importance of time and making the most of it. He frequently reminds Milo about the value of utilizing time wisely and not wasting it, which is a central theme within the novel. Through Tock, the novel teaches valuable lessons about the significance of time management, curiosity, problem-solving, and exploration. The adventures of Milo and Tock serve as an important reminder that imagination and learning can transform the mundane aspects of life into something thrilling and meaningful. In this way, Tock, the literal watchdog, is not only an entertaining character but also an educational figure that helps readers understand the importance of being present and maximizing their full potential. Overall, Tock from The Phantom Tollbooth is a purposeful and multidimensional character, representing the importance of time management, exploration, and intellectual discovery. As the watchdog in the story, Tock's unique physical appearance, as well as his role as Milo's companion and guide, make him an essential and memorable character in Norton Juster's classic children's novel."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

To further elaborate on this, let's analyze the context, factors, and reasons why this might be the case. Firstly, it is important to understand the context in which this statement is being made. The person might be referring to a specific market, region, or time period in which the real estate sector experienced a significant decline in value. For example, the period following the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 saw a significant drop in real estate prices in various regions. In some cases, property values still have not fully recovered to their pre-crisis levels. There are several factors and reasons which might explain why real estate hasn't fully recovered to its previous value: 1. Economic factors: The overall health of the economy has a direct impact on the real estate market. If the economy is experiencing slow growth, high unemployment, or financial instability, it could take longer for real estate values to recover. 2. Government policies: Government policies can have a significant impact on the real estate market. Some policies, such as regulations and taxes, can lower demand for property and keep prices from rebounding to previous levels. 3. Supply and demand: The balance between the number of properties available for sale and the number of potential buyers plays a crucial role in determining the market value of real estate. An oversupply of properties, or a lack of demand, could prevent real estate values from recovering fully. 4. Demographics and social trends: Shifts in population, such as a decline in the birth rate, lower immigration, or an increase in households downsizing, can lead to reduced demand for real estate and, consequently, stable or declining property values. 5. Psychological factors: Consumer sentiment and confidence in the real estate market are important factors in the recovery of property values. If people are anxious about the market's overall health or the potential for another downturn, they may be more cautious about investing, which in turn contributes to a slower overall recovery. 6. Market-specific factors: Local factors, such as changes in industry or employment levels, can have a significant impact on real estate values. If a region has experienced a decline in important industries or significant job losses, it may take longer for real estate values to return to previous levels. It is important to note that an overall statement, such as \\"real estate hasn't recovered to its previous value,\\" might not be accurate for every market, region, or property type. Some real estate markets might have experienced a complete recovery or even exceeded their previous value, while others may still be struggling. To conclude, the statement \\"Real estate hasn't recovered to its previous value\\" suggests that property values in the mentioned context have not yet returned to their previous level. Factors such as economic conditions, government policies, supply and demand, social trends, and local market dynamics might contribute to the slower recovery in certain regions or property types. However, it is crucial to recognize that this observation might not be universally accurate, as recovery rates and property values differ across regions and categories of real estate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean border guards arrested an American man who they believe was attempting to swim across the border into rival North Korea, a South Korean defense official said Wednesday.      The man was arrested Tuesday night at a river near the Korean Demilitarized Zone, part of a restricted military area, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to office policy. He said investigators are questioning the man about the purpose of his apparent attempt to enter North Korea but gave no further details.      Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified government source, reported the man was in his late 20s or early 30s and told investigators that he tried to go to North Korea to meet leader Kim Jong Un. He was caught by South Korean marines while lying on the shore of the river after swimming north, the report said.      Last year, South Korean soldiers shot and killed a man with a South Korean passport who officials said ignored warnings to return the South after trying to go to North Korea via a river that runs through the border.      There have been occasional cases of Americans being arrested in North Korea after allegedly entering the country illegally from China, but an American trying to go to North Korea from South Korea is unusual.      In 1996, American Evan C. Hunziker entered the North by swimming across the Yalu River, which marks the border with China. Hunziker, who apparently made the swim on a drunken dare, was accused of spying and detained for three months.      Hunziker, then 26, was eventually freed after negotiations involving a special U.S. envoy. The North Koreans wanted to slap Hunziker with a 100,000 criminal fine but eventually agreed on a 5,000 payment to settle a bill for a hotel where he was detained.      North Korea is currently holding three Americans and the country's Supreme Court on Sunday sentenced one of them to six years of hard labor for illegally entering the country to commit espionage.      The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea.      About 27,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea to avoid poverty and political suppression since the end of the Korean War. A few South Koreans have previously tried to defect to the impoverished, authoritarian country, but such cases are rare. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| A:","output":"Part #1: Summarize news articles separated by special token \\"|||||\\".

Movie title: Antichrist Context: Prologue[edit] A couple makes passionate love, as their toddler, Nic, climbs up to the bedroom window and falls to his death. Chapter One: Grief[edit] The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox that tells him, \\"chaos reigns.\\" Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)[edit] In the dark attic the man finds the womanâs thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest, and hidden fear. Through the autopsy and old photos, he becomes aware that she had been systematically putting Nicâs shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in pain and deformity. She attacks him, accuses him of planning to leave her, mounts him,...

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\".

Article: Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart, was born in Kingfish, Oklahoma on March 29, 1918. He was raised in Missouri where he worked in his father's store while attending school. This was his first retailing   experience and he really enjoyed it. After graduation, he began his own career as a retail merchant. He soon opened his first Wal-Mart store in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas. Wal-Mart specialized in name brands at low prices and Sam Walton was surprised at the success. Soon a chain of Wal-Mart stores sprang up across rural America. Walton's management style was popular with employees and he founded some of the basic concepts of management that are still in use today. After taking the company public in 1970, Walton introduced his \\"profit sharing plan\\". The profit sharing plan was a plan for Wal-Mart employees to improve their income dependent on the profits of the store. Sam Walton believed that \\"individuals don't win, teams do\\". Employees at Wal-Mart stores were offered stock options   and store discounts. These benefits are commonplace today, but Walton was among the first to implement   them. Walton believed that a happy employee meant happy customers and more sales. He also believed that by giving employees a part of the company and making their success dependent on the company's success, they would care about the company. By the 1980s, Wal-Mart had sales of over one billion dollars and over three hundred stores across North America. Wal-Mart's unique decentralized   distribution system, also Walton's idea, created the _ needed to further encourage growth in the 1980s during growing complaints that the \\"superstore\\" was stopping smaller and traditional stores from developing. By 1991, Wal-Mart was the largest US retailer with 1,700 stores. Walton remained active in managing the company, as president and CEO until 1988 and chairman until his death. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom shortly before his death. Question: Sam Walton first made a hit in retailing when   _  .

At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal.

The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation. In this version, the children \\"paired off\\", but one of the children, David (Thomas Dekker), loses his partner after she dies at birth.

Their ruthless leader, Mara (Lindsey Haun) (\\"daughter\\" of a local doctor, Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve); her mother, Barbara (Karen Kahn), commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff), considers him less important due to his expression of emotions. Because of his childhood loss, he understands what the other children do not: pain. He and his mother (Linda Kozlowski) (the local school principal) share a brief conversation about the meaning of the word \\"empathy\\", with David beginning to understand that if he feels pain, he can understand others' pain as well. When the other children experience pain, they simply use their powers to inflict the same pain on the adult responsible for the pain, for example forcing one of the mothers to put one of her arms in a pot full of boiling water, or forcing the local optometrist making...

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who tells the Narrator that he is beholden to consumerism?  The unnamed Narrator is an automobile recall specialist who is unfulfilled by his job and possessions, and has developed severe insomnia. He finds catharsis by posing as a sufferer of testicular cancer and other afflictions in support groups, remedying his insomnia. His bliss is disturbed by another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him he is attending these groups dishonestly. The two agree to split which groups they attend, but not before they exchange contact details on the premise of switching groups at short notice. On a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets and interacts with soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. Deciding against asking Marla for help, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. Tyler says the Narrator is beholden to consumerism. In the parking lot, he asks the Narrator to hit him, and they begin a fistfight. The Narrator is invited to move into Tyler's home: a large, dilapidated house in an industrial area. They have further fights outside the bar, which attract growing crowds of men. The fights move to the bar's basement where the men form Fight Club, which routinely meets for the men to fight recreationally. Marla overdoses on pills and telephones the Narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler picks up the phone and goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla get sexually involved, and Tyler warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. The Narrator blackmails his boss and quits his job.

Q: Who criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier?  A: Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the Encyclopédie and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire and Émilie du Châtelet.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"The answer provided does not directly address the question posed. The question asks about a critique of sciences for distancing man from nature and not contributing to people's happiness. The answer, however, speaks about the introduction of scientific theories by Philosophes and the popularization of Newtonianism, which is not relevant to the original question.  A more appropriate answer would be: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, an influential 18th-century philosopher, criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier. In his 1750 work, \\"Discourse on the Sciences and Arts,\\" Rousseau argued that the advancement of knowledge, arts, and sciences had led to moral decay. He believed that as people became more educated and cultured, they lost touch with natural virtues and their true selves. Known for his works such as \\"The Social Contract\\" and \\"Emile,\\" Rousseau emphasized the need for a simpler, less materialistic lifestyle. He maintained that individuals are inherently good but become corrupted by the complexities and demands of society. According to his view, an increased focus on science and intellectual progress led to vanity, envy, greed, and the decline of morality. In conclusion, Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the philosopher who criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier. He believed that people should return to a more natural state and focus on their inherent virtues, rather than devoting their energy to the advancement of knowledge and the arts, which he found to be detrimental to human happiness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, dozens of people remain unaccounted for, with the AP indicating around 40 individuals missing, while Reuters updates the figure to about 50. Canadian authorities are working diligently to identify the deceased; however, the identification process requires DNA samples from families of those missing. The Canadian Press reports that the coroner has requested these samples in order to ensure accurate identification and timely information for affected families. The devastating event occurred when a runaway train, carrying crude oil, derailed in the small town of Lac-Megantic, resulting in massive explosions and the destruction of approximately 30 buildings.

Scottish ministers announced the move following calls from the National Farmers' Union of Scotland (NFUS). The NFUS want the troubled IT system to be bypassed.

Background: Daniel Irvin Rather, Jr.  was born on October 31, 1931, in Wharton County, Texas, the son of Daniel Irvin Rather, Sr., a ditch digger, and the former Byrl Veda Page. The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian. Context: On October 4, 1986, while walking along Park Avenue to his apartment in Manhattan, Rather was attacked and punched from behind by a man who demanded to know \\"Kenneth, what is the frequency?\\" while a second assailant chased and beat him. As the assailant pummeled and kicked Rather, he kept repeating the question. In describing the incident, Rather said, \\"I got mugged. Who understands these things? I didn't and I don't now. I didn't make a lot of it at the time and I don't now. I wish I knew who did it and why, but I have no idea.\\" Until the crime was resolved years later, Rather's description of the bizarre crime led some to doubt the veracity of his account, although the doorman and building supervisor who rescued Rather fully confirmed his version of events.  The assault remained unsolved for some time, and was referenced multiple times in popular culture. The phrase \\"What's the frequency, Kenneth?\\" became a popular-culture reference over the years, such as in a scene in the graphic novel Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron by cartoonist Daniel Clowes. In 1994, the band R.E.M. released the song \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" on their album Monster. Rather later sang with R.E.M. during a sound check prior to a gig at New York's Madison Square Garden, which was shown the following night on the Late Show with David Letterman before their performance of \\"Crush with Eyeliner\\".  In 1997, a TV critic writing in the New York Daily News solved the mystery, publishing a photo of the alleged assailant, William Tager, who received a 12 1/2 -to-25-year prison sentence for killing NBC stagehand Campbell Montgomery outside The Today Show studio in 1994. Rather confirmed the story: \\"There's no doubt in my mind that this is the person.\\" New York District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said, \\"William Tager's identity as the man who attacked Mr. Rather was established in the course of an investigation by my office.\\" Tager claimed he thought television networks were beaming signals into his brain. When he murdered the stagehand, Tager was trying to force his way into an NBC studio with a weapon, in order to find out the frequency the networks were using to attack him, so that he could block it. Tager was paroled in October 2010 and is believed to be living in New York City. Question: when was he attacked?. Whats the answer?","output":"Daniel Rather was attacked on October 4, 1986.

I was making lunch when I saw my 6-year-old son, Billy, walking very slowly towards the woods. Minutes later he came running out again, towards the house. Soon after, I saw him walking towards the woods again. This went on for an hour. Finally I walked out of the house quietly and followed him. Billy cupped   both hands in front of him as he walked, careful not to drop the water he carried. Then I saw an amazing sight. Several large deer stood in front of him. Billy walked right up to them. I saw a baby deer lying on the ground. It was dying of thirst, and it tried to lift its head to drink the water in my boy's hands. When the water was gone, Billy ran back to the house. I followed him to the kitchen. Billy opened the tap and a small trickle   came out. He let the drips   slowly fill up his \\"cup\\". Now I understood what was going on. The week before, he tried giving water to our horses but I told him not to waste water. Now when he stood up and turned, I was there in front of him.

From Tokyo to Sydney, London to New York, thousands waited for hours – sometimes days – to get their hands on the third incarnation of the iPad. Some who didn’t like the idea of sleeping on a cold pavement paid as much as £300 to jump the queue. Scroll down to see video of Apple fans. Among the ordinary shoppers wanting to get their hands on the latest must-have product were profiteering gangs. They infiltrated queues to buy iPads and re-sell them at inflated prices abroad. Customers in Apple's Regent Street store, all bagged up with their purchases. Dozens of people were paid by 'agents' to join queues around London and grab iPads to sell on. However, there is no suggestion that those pictured had any part in this. Black market gangs in London paid people to join the queue and buy the new tablets so they could then be sold on at a profit. The frenzy – reminiscent of the scenes which greeted the launch of its predecessor this time last year – is all the more surprising given that the latest iPad represents only an evolution of previous designs rather than a revolution. Its key selling point is a so-called ‘retina display’, with a high-definition touchscreen boasting 3.1million pixels – more than an HD television. The new model, which costs from £399 to £659 in the UK, also comes with an improved camera and a faster processor, making it attractive to those who use it to play games. The wait for the pay-day paid off: 16-year-old Noah Green was fourth in the queue - but sold his spot for £300. Eager for a bite of the Apple: People sit in the queue for the new iPad 3 outside the company's flagship store on Regent Street in London. Noah Green, a 16-year-old student from Stanmore, North-West London, had been fourth in the queue at Apple’s flagship store in Regent Street, London, but said someone had paid him £300 to move back. Before going through the door, he said: ‘It is worth it. I am still 18th in the queue so I will be one of the first to buy an iPad. I am going to sell it though and earn some money.’ Many appeared to have been paid £10 or £20 to wait in line for hours on behalf of a third party. Some buyers had their hands full of shopping bags filled with products. One was even pictured wheeling items out on a trolley.

'With. its focus on the holistic experience rather than individual boasts. around its constituent parts, it’s the epitome of the Post-PC world the. Apple founder envisaged.' Tech Crunch said: 'Once you see and use the new iPad, there will be no going back.' One said: ‘We’re just buying and selling, we’re not doing anything illegal. We bought them and we sold them.’ At Covent Garden, men were seen handing over money, collecting receipts and organising scores of people queuing. One agent, who gave his name as Martin, said: ‘I hope to get around 70 iPads today. I will be sending them on to India.’ The new iPad will not be on sale officially in India for at least another week. Stores were given only a limited supply of the new device and many had sold out by mid-afternoon. This allowed buyers who did manage to get one the opportunity to make a quick profit by selling them via eBay. Sellers on the auction website were offering the 16GB version, which connects to the web via wifi, for as much as £562.79 – a mark-up of £163.79, or 41 per cent, on the official price of £399. The scenes were repeated around the world. In Paris, one customer, Athena May, said: ‘I don’t think it’s worth the price but I guess I’m a victim of society.’ Shares in Apple punched through the 600 barrier – a new record – briefly on Thursday pushing the value of the technology giant to 560billion (£354billion) and confirming it as the world’s most valuable company.

Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.  and the situation: John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Colorado theater shooting victims still waiting to see donations AURORA, Colo. — Their numbers were smaller than when they first gathered, but their anger was still raw, this time tinged with a weariness over a fight they say should never have happened. They are victims and families of those killed and wounded in the Aurora movie theater massacre, and they want to know what happened to 5 million in donations collected since the violence of July 20. \\"There have been two tragedies in Aurora. The first was the theater shooting. The second is how the victims have been treated by the powers that be,\\" said Tom Teves, the father of Alex Teves, who was killed in the rampage at a midnight showing of \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\" Teves has emerged as a spokesman for a group of victims of the attack that left 12 dead and 58 wounded. On Aug. 28, Teves and 17 other family members and victims crowded onto a tiny stage at an Aurora meeting hall for the first time to ask about the millions raised for their loved ones. They also charged that they had been shut out of the process to distribute the funds. Last week, only Teves and seven others gathered and far fewer reporters attended for what Teves has said will be the last news conference on the matter. One by one the eight stepped forward to pay tribute to those lost, repeating, \\"We will remember.\\" Reading from a prepared statement and taking no questions Thursday, Teves said his group had been repeatedly misled by the Community First Foundation, which oversees the Aurora Victim Relief Fund that has been flooded with donations from across the country. He said his group has also been misled by the 7/20 Recovery Committee about who gets final say in how the money is divided. The coalition, made up of 30 community groups, health professionals and Aurora city officials, is in charge of making distribution recommendations. Teves said he was first told the victims and their families would get final say but now is being told the foundation can override their wishes. Calls to Community First for comment were not returned. Instead, a news release was emailed to reporters that says in part: \\"The 7/20 Recovery Committee remains committed to a robust and inclusive process that honors the input of all victims, and not just the voices of a few.\\" It further states that meetings with family members will continue and so far there has been \\"a very wide variety of opinions on the work ahead.\\" After the Aug. 28 news conference sparked outrage, Community First leaders said they would allow victims to have a voice in the process. This month, victims were sent a three-page survey that promised \\"100% of the Aurora Victim Relief Fund will be used exclusively to help meet the needs of the victims.\\" The survey lays out two disbursement possibilities. One would evenly divide the money among the wounded and the families of those killed, as well as others in the theater the night of the shooting and those displaced from their homes as authorities dismantled the booby traps in the apartment of suspect James E. Holmes. The second would divide it according to an individual needs assessment. The letter accompanying the survey says the models are based on those used to distribute funds after other tragedies, including those at Columbine High School in nearby Littleton and at Virginia Tech. The foundation has said it hopes to have the distribution plan in place by early November. Immediately after the shooting, Community First, along with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's office, cofounded the Aurora Victim Relief Fund. In late August, each of the 70 families of those killed or wounded received a 5,000 check from the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance for immediate needs — totaling 350,000 — with a promise of more to come. An additional 100,000 was taken from the fund and divided among 10 community nonprofit groups to help victims. Summary:","output":"There was a very sad shooting in a movie theater in Colorado where 12 people died and 58 got hurt. People from all over the country donated money to help the families of the victims, and the total amount reached 5 million. But the families are upset because they haven't seen that money yet. They want to know what happened to it and why it hasn't been given to them. The organization in charge of the money is trying to figure out the best way to divide it among the families. The families hope they will receive the money soon to help them during this difficult time."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Rick  for the following movie plot:  In 1937, London music critic and composer Roderick \\"Rick\\" Fitzgerald (Ray Milland) and his sister Pamela (Ruth Hussey) fall in love with Windward House, an abandoned seaside house, during a holiday on Cornwall's rocky coast. They purchase it for an unusually low price from Commander Beech (Donald Crisp). Rick and Pamela meet Beechâs 20-year-old granddaughter, Stella Meredith (Gail Russell), who lives with her grandfather in the nearby town of Biddlecombe. Stella is deeply upset by the sale because of her attachment to the house, despite its being where her mother died. The commander has forbidden Stella to enter the house or to see Rick. However, she gains access to Windward House through Rick, who has become infatuated with her. The Fitzgeralds' initial enchantment with the house diminishes when they unlock an artist's studio where they feel an inexplicable chill. Just before dawn, Rick hears the eerie sobs of an unseen woman, a phenomenon that Pamela investigates whilst awaiting her brother's return with their Irish housekeeper, Lizzie Flynn (Barbara Everest). The superstitious Lizzie notices a peculiar draft on the stairs. Rick and Pamela must face the obvious: Windward House is haunted. When Stella comes to Windward for dinner, she senses a spirit. Rather than fearing it, she associates the calming presence with her mother. Also, the strong scent of mimosa is that of her mother's favorite perfume. Suddenly she dashes out towards the very cliff from which her mother Mary fell to her death seventeen years earlier. Rick catches her just before she reaches the edge. Stella professes to have no recollection of the near-fatal incident. The Fitzgeralds and the town physician, Dr. Scott (Alan Napier), investigate. They learn that Stella's father, a painter, had had an affair with his model, a Spanish gypsy named Carmel. Stella's mother, Mary Meredith, from all accounts a beautiful and virtuous woman, found out and took Carmel to Paris, leaving her there. Subsequently Carmel returned to England, stole the infant...

The explosion happened near the bullring, where animal rights activists were preparing to hold a march. Bogota authorities said at least 40 people were injured, including 28 men and 12 women. Many are believed to be officers deployed ahead of the protest. It is unclear if the blast was linked to the protests, which began after the city reinstated bullfighting this year. Gareth Lewis, a British traveller staying in a hostel in La Macarena, on the corner where the explosion took place, told the BBC: \\"I was sitting in my room in the hostel, the windows just came in, there was glass everywhere. \\"Quite a few police have been hurt, they're now sweeping up. They used tear gas and there's quite a bit of blood.\\" Mr Lewis, who has been advised to stay inside the hostel by officers, said he had witnessed protests \\"all week\\" and that \\"armed police have been everywhere\\". The protests began after a decision by the constitutional court, which ruled bullfighting was part of the country's heritage and therefore could be reinstated. The move angered animal rights activists, who have clashed with police during protests against the reopening. In January, demonstrators were arrested and officers fired tear gas to control groups physically attacking spectators. But the explosion was not necessarily linked to the protests. Jorge Restrepo, director of Colombia's Conflict Analysis Resource Center (Cerac), said the attack may have been targeting the police, taking advantage of the fact that many officers were gathered together due to the bullfight. He told the BBC it was possibly linked to a series of attacks against security forces in the capital that have taken place in recent months. Meanwhile, Bogota mayor Enrique Penalosa, who attended the scene, has announced he was convening a security council meeting for Sunday afternoon. \\"The terrorists won't intimidate us,\\" Mr Penalosa said on Twitter. \\"We are going to do all that's necessary to capture them.\\" He earlier tweeted one police officer had been killed, but has since removed the post. It has now been reported there were no fatalities. Two of the injured were said to be in a serious condition.

Context: Alona's persistent knocking at the door of room 412 went unanswered for three minutes as she nervously shuffled her feet. Her book bag was super-saturated with textbooks, notebooks, schedules, rough drafts, and various other forms of academic paraphernalia. It was getting heavier. She continued to knock, even though there had as yet been no answer, because the note card tacked to the right of the door indicated that these indeed were Prof. Turgy K. Sigger's office hours. She could see the light under the door and thought she had heard a groan. Just before she decided to give up, slow feet approached from the opposite side, then silence; with a dramatic turn of the knob, the door swung open. \\"Was this trip really necessary?\\" asked Prof. Sigger, blinking and brushing his oily, graying hair back into place. \\"These are your office hours,\\" Alona replied. She nervously smiled, feeling the corners of her mouth twitch. Somewhere in the darkened hall, a janitor coughed. \\"All right,\\" conceded Prof. Sigger. \\"Come in.\\" The carpet was smothered by leaning towers of textbooks. Papers lined the left side of the desk, above which was a small note card which read \\"To Be Graded.\\" On the right side, the oak finish gleamed of the mid-morning light piercing the Venetian blinds. \\"You've come about your final project,\\" Prof. Sigger stated. \\"It's only mid-term,\\" Alona reminded him. \\"Oh yes, yes,\\" continued Prof. Sigger, without conscious embarrassment. \\"Mid-term grade.

Furthermore, Alona was persistent in her knocking, leading Prof. Sigger to eventually respond to her request for a meeting. In fulfilling his role as a professor, Prof. Sigger recognized the importance of being available for students during his office hours, even if he might have been initially reluctant or disturbed.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Last week, I joined the board of a new organization to oppose marijuana legalization: Smart Approaches to Marijuana. The group is headed by former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy and includes Kevin Sabet, a veteran of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Obama. The new group rejects the \\"war on drugs\\" model. It agrees that we don't want to lock people up for casual marijuana use -- or even stigmatize them with an arrest record. But what we do want to do is send a clear message: Marijuana use is a bad choice. There are many excellent reasons to avoid marijuana. Marijuana use damages brain development in young people. Heavy users become socially isolated and perform worse in school and at work. Marijuana smoke harms the lungs. A growing body of evidence suggests that marijuana can trigger psychotic symptoms that otherwise would have remained latent. It's possible to imagine a marijuana rule that tries to respond precisely to such risk factors as happen to be known by the current state of science. Such a rule might say: \\"You shouldn't use marijuana until you are over 25, or after your brain has ceased to develop, whichever comes first. You shouldn't use marijuana if you are predisposed to certain mental illnesses (most of which we can't yet diagnose in advance). Be aware that about one-sixth of users will become chronically dependent on marijuana, and as a result will suffer a serious degradation of life outcomes. As yet, we have no sure idea at what dosage marijuana will impair your ability to drive safely, or how long the impairment will last. Be as careful as you can, within the limits of our present knowledge!\\" Yet as a parent of three, two exiting adolescence and one entering, I've found that the argument that makes the biggest impression is: \\"Marijuana is illegal. Stay away.\\" I think many other parents have found the same thing. When we write social rules, we always need to consider: Who are we writing rules for? Some people can cope with complexity. Others need clarity. Some people will snap back from an early mistake. Others will never recover. \\"Just say no\\" is an easy rule to follow. \\"It depends on individual risk factors, many of them unknowable in advance\\" -- that rule is not so easy. Richard Branson: War on drugs a trillion-dollar failure. Over the past three decades, and in area after area of social life, Americans have replaced simple rules that anybody can follow with complex rules that baffle large numbers of people. Consider, for example, the home mortgage. Once the mortgage was a very simple product. Put 20% down, then sign up for a fixed schedule of payments over the next 30 years. In the space of a single generation, these 30-year fixed-rate amortizing mortgages turned what had been a nation of renters into a nation of homeowners. For more sophisticated buyers, however, the standard mortgage was a big nuisance. For them, bankers developed more flexible products: no money down, no documentation, interest-only, adjustable rate. These products met genuine needs. But as they diffused down-market, they became traps for people who did not understand the risks they were accepting. Consider how we finance higher education. Once, state governments subsidized their universities to offer a low tuition fee to all comers. Fee increases at private universities were constrained by the lower fees at the public institutions: Duke can raise its price only so high above the University of North Carolina. The universities soon realized, however, that by setting their tuition fees low, they were forgoing revenues that might be collected from the most affluent students. Universities rapidly raised their tuition fees, then offered discounts and aid to students in need. Kevin Sabet: Legalize Pot? No, reform laws. But while anybody could understand a 500 per semester tuition bill, the new system of rebates confuses the very people who most need help. A few days before Christmas, Jason DeParle of The New York Times reported a depressing example of the toll modern financial aid exacts upon students from less sophisticated backgrounds. He told the story of three bright girls from poor families who had recently tried -- and failed -- to gain college degrees. One of them was admitted to Emory, a prestigious school with a full-ticket price of 50,000, but one that grants very generous financial aid -- if the student can figure out how to make the financial aid work for her. The trouble was that students who most need aid are often precisely those who have nobody around them who has ever successfully navigated a complicated bureaucratic institution like a university financial aid office. \\"Though Emory sent weekly e-mails -- 17 of them, along with an invitation to a program for minority students -- they went to a school account she had not learned to check,\\" DeParle wrote. \\"Angelica reported that her mother made 35,000 a year and paid about half of that in rent. With her housing costs so high, Emory assumed the family had extra money and assigned ... an income of 51,000. ... (Angelica) discovered what had happened only recently.\\" Unable to cope with the school's e-mail system or to decrypt its rules for imputing family income, Angelica finally dropped out of Emory, burdened by 61,000 in student debt. In 1943, Vice President Henry Wallace published a book celebrating the coming \\"century of the common man.\\" That century did not last very long. We have transitioned instead into the era of the clever man and clever woman. We have revised our institutions, our programs, our rules in ways that offer profitable new chances to those with cultural know-how -- and that inflict disastrous consequences on those who are overwhelmed by a world of ever-more-abundant and ever-more-risky choices. Opinion: The end of the war on marijuana. We're not going to uninvent the no-money-down loan. Universities that receive applications from all over the planet cannot finance themselves like an old-fashioned state land-grant college. But we need to recognize that modern life is becoming steadily more dangerous for people prone to make bad choices. At a time when they need more help than ever to climb the ladder, marijuana legalization kicks them back down the ladder. The goal of public policy should not be to punish vulnerable kids for making life-wrecking mistakes. The goal of public policy should be to protect (to the extent we can) the vulnerable from making life-wrecking mistakes in the first place. There's a trade-off, yes, and it takes the form of denying less vulnerable people easy access to a pleasure they believe they can safely use. But they are likely deluding themselves about how well they are managing their drug use. And even if they are not deluded -- if they really are so capable and effective -- then surely they can see that society has already been massively re-engineered for their benefit already. Surely, enough is enough? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A group called Smart Approaches to Marijuana is against making marijuana legal. They think it's a bad choice because it can cause problems for young people's brains, make people feel lonely, not do well in school and work, and sometimes cause illness. Even though some grown-ups might be able to use marijuana without big problems, the group believes it's best to protect everyone, especially kids, from making bad choices that may cause big problems in their lives. That's why they want to tell people, especially kids, that using marijuana is not a good idea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 3: Identify the best choice Now that we've eliminated the irrelevant options, the one remaining choice is \\"demonstration.\\" This option is the best fit since demonstrations are interactive presentations where people can view and sometimes touch or manipulate objects.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who has a daughter named Lisa?  Tom Stansfield is a researcher at a publishing company who works under the tyrannical Jack Taylor. Tom has a crush on his boss' daughter, Lisa, who is completely controlled by her overprotective father. She reveals to Tom that her father is making her house-sit the same night as a party she wants to attend, but Tom convinces her to stand up to her father and attend the party anyway. Lisa asks him to come to their house that night, leading Tom to think that she has invited him to the party; in reality, she just wants him to fill in for her - he reluctantly agrees. A comedy of errors ensues, including the return of Lisa's older brother, Red, on the run from drug dealers. Red dumps drugs into the toilet, and instead returns a bag of flour to the drug dealer. One of Tom's tasks is to guard their owl, O-J, which lives in an open cage (it has not been able to fly due to a deep depression, from the loss of a prior mate). When the bird drinks from the toilet polluted with drugs, it flies away. Jack's ex-secretary Audrey goes to the house to try to earn her job back. After fighting with her boyfriend, she stays over at the house. Lisa returns home after finding out that her boyfriend Hans is cheating on her. Tom hides from her everything that happened and she spends some time with her thinking he is homosexual. He clarifies to her that he's actually straight and she starts to like him. Audrey's friend thinks she has breast cancer and asks Tom to feel her breasts. Lisa walks in on them and is disgusted by the situation. The answer is:","output":"To complete the task, I will read through the paragraph and identify the relevant information that answers the question: Who has a daughter named Lisa?

When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby. Initially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake. When Carrie disobeys her father's rules regarding visits to the nearest town, Hank decides to punish Carrie by temporarily relocating Flicka to the farm of one of his ranch hands, Toby. After a midnight visit by Carrie, Flicka tries to follow Carrie home to Hank's ranch, but accidentally ends up on the ranch belonging to Amy's father HD Walker. Upon entering the Walker ranch, Flicka damages a fence and releases some of HD's prize cows. At Amy's request, HD asks for Flicka as payment for the damage, threatening to turn it into a lawsuit if Hank refuses. Amy then starts training with Flicka for a championship, but performs poorly during the actual competition because of Flicka's fear of the crowd and camera flashes from the audience.

It's revealed she lost her lover in the war, and every ghost \\"hunt\\" is an attempt to see if it's possible to bring him back. Every time she proves a hoax, the truth and pain hit her again. She receives a visit from Robert Mallory (Dominic West), a teacher from a boys boarding school in Cumbria. Robert explains to her that there have been sightings of the ghost of a child at the school, and that it may have been the cause of the recent death of a pupil there. Robert asks Florence for help to figure out why the supernatural events occur. Although Florence originally refuses, Robert's concern for the orphaned kids at the school causes her to change her mind since she is an orphan herself. Florence travels to the school, which was a stately home until 20 years earlier, to investigate the sightings and the recent death. She is welcomed by Maud (Imelda Staunton), the school's housekeeper and matron, who tells Florence that she has read her books and feels like she knows her. After investigation, the ghostly sightings are thought to be a prank led by two boys who have been bullying a lonely, redheaded boy into doing what they want for their approval. With regards to the recent death, Florence deduces that one of the teachers was the last person to see the boy alive and questions him, until he admits to making the young boy stand outside to \\"man up\\", after he claimed to have seen the ghost, thus scaring the young boy and causing him to have a fatal asthma attack.

These memories often serve as a form of mental escape from the current stressors, thereby helping individuals to relax. When one reflects on pleasant experiences, the mind is often swept up in those joyful moments which creates a soothing and calming effect on the body and mind.

Run a small, unobtrusive hose up the center of the fountain and into the water bowl. To do this, you can use a black 1/4 inch hose and drill 1/4-inch holes to route the hose. Make sure not to damage the fountain while drilling the holes, and take extra caution if the fountain materials are fragile. 3. Connect the hose to a nearby water source or an automatic timer valve that regulates the water flow into the fountain. To conceal the hose outside the fountain, you can bury it underground or cover it with decorative elements such as rocks or gravel. 4. Choose a water control system that best suits your needs. For example, you may consider using a float valve, which will maintain a constant water level, or an electronic control system that is programmable and can detect specific times and schedules for turning on and off the water supply. 5. Install the float valve or electronic control system according to the manufacturer's instructions, taking care to secure the appropriate connectors, cables, or fittings required for installation and operation. Be sure to select a location where the system will be protected from the elements as well as remain accessible for any maintenance or adjustments. 6. Test the automatic fill system by turning on the water supply and letting the fountain fill up. Observe the water level and adjust the float valve or electronic control system accordingly to maintain the desired water level. Ensure that the hose provides a steady flow of water and does not overflow the water bowl. 7. Once the system is functioning properly, replace the fountain components or decorations that were removed during the installation process. Make sure the pump is properly submerged under the water and that the hose does not impede the flow of water through the fountain's features. 8. Plug in the fountain's pump and turn it on to ensure that everything is working efficiently. Monitor the fill system over the next few days, making any necessary adjustments to the water level or water flow rate. 9. Maintain your automatic fill system by periodically checking for leaks, clogs, or any other issues that could disrupt the system's functionality. Clean the fountain and fill system components as needed to ensure optimal performance. By following these steps and considerations, you can easily create a reliable and efficient automatic fill system for your decorative garden fountain, saving you time and effort in maintaining the perfect water level. Remember to monitor and maintain the system regularly to ensure a long-lasting, hassle-free experience for you and a beautiful focal point for your garden."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Playlist: Bob Dylan’s New Song and Merle Haggard’s Final Recording Every Friday, The New York Times pop critics will weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing — in a new version of the Playlist column. You can listen to this playlist on Spotify here. Like the new format? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com. When Bob Dylan released an album last year of standards associated with Frank Sinatra, “Shadows in the Night,” it was an intriguing sidebar to his own enormous catalog of songs disrupting Tin Pan Alley’s principles: a ragged voice and a rootsy band in the ruins of long-gone youth and pop’s elegant past. A second standards album, the new “Fallen Angels,” just repeats the gesture with diminishing returns. But “Melancholy Mood,” which was the B-side of Sinatra’s debut single with Harry James and his Orchestra in 1939, executes the gesture convincingly. Over the gently swinging band — which, like James, starts with a full instrumental verse — Mr. Dylan’s voice certainly has the mileage and tatters to put across sentiments like, “All I can see is grief and gloom/Till the crack of doom.” JON PARELES Merle Haggard’s final recording, made in his home studio on Feb. 9 — he died on April 6 from complications of pneumonia — is a Jimmie Rodgers-style blues. This was one of Mr. Haggard’s favorite forms, a tight box that nevertheless encouraged freedom: A 12-bar structure that can accommodate changeable phrase lengths and unconventional patterns of lyric repetition. His website says the song is about “memories of leaving Bakersfield in the late ’70s” — Bakersfield, Calif., where he grew up. Like many Haggard songs, it’s about disappointment with the way things are going: The night life is gone, and the Kern River has dried up. “Somebody stole the water,” he sings in a clear but shaky version of his voice; “another politician lied.” It contains what he did best, condensed images and expressions of getting in motion and leaving: “breakfast in the sky,” “donut on a paper,” “kiss an old boxcar goodbye.” Available from merlehaggard.com. BEN RATLIFF The least compelling but most revealing videos captured by fans from the May 7 AC/DC show in Lisbon — the first with Axl Rose serving as frontman — are the ones shot from up close, with the camera fixed mercilessly on Mr. Rose, still hobbled by a broken left foot. In them, Mr. Rose (replacing Brian Johnson, who is suffering from severe hearing loss), is seated, and while Angus Young moves around him doing his signature bent-over kick-shuffle, Mr. Rose howls to the best of his abilities, which, it turns out, are in strong shape. He yelps. He shrieks. He holds notes for ostentatious stretches. The vocal flamboyance Mr. Rose needs in Guns N’ Roses is different from the more direct hollering he does here, but it’s prepared him well. The amateur clips — of songs like “Hell Ain’t a Bad Place to Be,” “Highway to Hell,” “Shot Down in Flames” — tend to underscore the directness of his voice and underdeliver the power of the rest of the band, which is a shame, because they’re rather effective as a unit. By “Whole Lotta Rosie,” Mr. Rose is up and about, and the unit looks and sounds like it’s in fifth gear. But it’s less fun when you can’t see the lightning bolt on the bottom of his cast. JON CARAMANICA The video clip for Grimes’s “California” isn’t just her latest self-directed costume extravaganza. It’s also an entirely different production of the song — farewell to new wave guitars and synthesizers, hello to keyboard arpeggios and a new, more introspective transparency, at least at first. The song, from her 2015 album “Art Angels,” is both a plaint and a taunt: to recording companies courting her, to fans hating any change, to her own ambivalent pop ambitions. “I get carried away/commodifying all the pain,” she sings. In the video, she dances around as, among other things, a cowgirl singer in red, white and blue; a glittery mermaid; and a figure in gauzy red who’s very overdressed on a multicolored basketball court. But most of the time she’s a woman in an art-girl beret, tending (and dancing through) an artist’s studio full of statuary, unfinished or unsold: “When you get bored of me I’ll be back on the shelf,” she sings. J.P. Guitar distortion wells up immediately in “All for One,” the first new music in 21 years from the Stone Roses, as the band gears up for its latest reunion tour, which comes to Madison Square Garden on June 30. The song barely updates the band’s 1980s “Madchester” sound, which drew on Merseybeat, psychedelia, the post-punk noisiness of the Jesus and Mary Chain and the dance-music beats of the wild 1980s club scene in Manchester, England. “All for One” leans psychedelic, not funky, with a seesawing guitar riff that soon spins off multiple overdubbed guitars, along with a foot-stomping shuffle beat and lots of 1960s-style effects on Ian Brown’s voice as well as the guitars and drums. The last chorus becomes an overdubbed, very-late-60s chorale before a final buzzy guitar note. It’s a band emulating its younger self emulating music from decades earlier. Meanwhile, in the current political climate, the jolly lyrics strike a jarring isolationist note: “All for one, one for all/If we all join hands, we’ll make a wall.” J.P. Pink hasn’t just been at home practicing her trapeze act for the last two years, since the end of her most recent arena tour. Or has she? “You just gonna hang around all day?” her husband, Carey Hart, says in the opening moments of her new video, for “Just Like Fire.” The joke is that she is literally hanging, by a harness, as she executes a series of acrobatic twirls. She made “Just Like Fire” for the soundtrack to “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” a fact that the rest of the video makes clear: There’s a mirror-portal, and a giant chessboard, and a Mad Hatter tea party. (Pink’s daughter, Willow Sage, stands in for Alice.) It’s all a nice distraction from the fact that the song — produced by Max Martin, Shellback and Oscar Holter — brings nothing new to Pink’s musical formula. The beat says hip-hop, the strummy guitar says folk-pop and the chorus says “hot adult contemporary.” It’s a sturdy, on-brand effort, and given how long it has been since Pink released a proper new single, that’s wonder enough for now. NATE CHINEN Two items in this week’s news involved the maintenance of two major repositories of folk music and culture, in the widest sense of the word “folk.” Last Tuesday Ben Sisario reported on Smithsonian Folkways’ acquisition of Arhoolie Records, Chris Strachwitz’s great label for traditional blues, gospel, and Mexican music. (More information at arhoolie.com.) Also this week, Maximum Rocknroll, based in San Francisco, the volunteer-only punk zine published monthly since 1977, began a successful crowdfunding campaign to raise money for the digitization of its archive and preservation of its physical holdings. That would include most of the records it’s reviewed or featured on its weekly radio show, which would be pretty much every punk single you can imagine. “With your support,” reads Maximum Rocknroll’s indiegogo project page, “we can make our record collection — the largest of its kind in the entire world — accessible to anyone with an Internet connection.” (More information at maximumrocknroll.com.) BEN RATLIFF Some genres go through constant cycles of rebirth, but New York hip-hop seems to be in a perpetual state of death, or at least a kind of cryogenic purgatory. When the Terror Squad was at its peak, circa 2004, it was part of the last wave of hardcore mainstream traditionalists. After a decade in the weeds, that sound has been having a comeback — a last gasp? — thanks to rappers like Dave East of Harlem. Here, he bridges the generation gap by adding a verse to “All the Way Up,” the unexpected hit collaboration by the old Terror Squad crewmates Fat Joe and Remy Ma. Over the woozy horn loop by producer Edsclusive, he remembers a time when Terror Squad was on top, and he was preoccupied elsewhere: “When Remy was Terror Squadding with Pun and them/We was in the back room rumbling, no one coming in/Homie kinda arrogant, bet this 40’ll humble him.” J.C. “Be kind to your bad self,” urges Sadie Dupuis on “Death Note,” a growly, propulsive affirmation by Speedy Ortiz, the ambitious but low-to-the-ground indie-rock band. The track was named after a Japanese manga and anime series, whose conceit involves a notebook with lethal magical powers. Ms. Dupuis twists this into a metaphor for the therapeutic act of writing in the face of depression: “These are all love letters to me,” she sings. And while the sound is thicker and heavier here than on much of “Foil Deer,” Speedy Ortiz’s standout 2015 album, it’s clearly of a piece; it will appear on “Foiled Again,” a four-song digital EP, on June 3. N.C. Joe Temperley, the gallant Scottish baritone saxophonist, died this week at the age of 86. A veteran of some of the great big bands of the postwar era, he will be remembered for his stint in the late-period Duke Ellington Orchestra — and a subsequent role with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, in which he was a founding member. Last spring that band performed a concert in honor of Mr. Temperley, featuring glowing testimonials, select Ellingtonia, and a five-part suite by Wynton Marsalis, “Joe’s Concerto.” The full concert was broadcast by the NPR program Jazz Night in America, and it now stands as a noble tribute, and a good distillation of everything that made Mr. Temperley special. Be sure not to miss his tender delivery of “The Single Petal of a Rose,” which ends the concert in all due finery. N.C. Avian polyphony, a true conference of the birds at first light.

A popular singer named Bob Dylan made a new song that sounds a lot like another song that a man named Frank Sinatra sang a really long time ago. Some people might find it a bit boring because Bob Dylan has done this before, but the song is still nice to listen to.  2. Another singer, Merle Haggard, sadly passed away recently, but he recorded one last song before he died. This song is about his memories, and it sounds really sad and beautiful. 3. There's a band called AC/DC, and they did a show with a new lead singer, Axl Rose, because their usual singer, Brian Johnson, is sick. Axl Rose did a really good job, even though he hurt his foot! 4. Grimes, another singer, made a new music video for her song \\"California\\". It's really colorful and fun to watch, and it's got her dancing in lots of different costumes! 5. The Stone Roses, a band that was big in the 80s, are back together for a new tour and they just put out a new song. Some people might think it sounds a bit out of date, or like it doesn't fit in with what's happening in the world today, but lots of other people are really excited. 6. Finally, a singer named Pink made a new song for a movie called \\"Alice Through the Looking Glass\\".

Given the question: Information:  - Shrubland, scrubland, scrub or brush is a plant community characterised by vegetation dominated by shrubs, often also including grasses, herbs, and geophytes. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire. A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing. Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term \\"shrubland\\" was first coined in 1903.  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.  - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.  - The Amazon basin is the part of South America drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries. The Amazon drainage basin covers an area of about , or roughly 40 percent of the South American continent. It is located in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela.  - Anthony 's nightjar ( Nyctidromus anthonyi ) , also known as the scrub nightjar , is a species of nightjar in the Caprimulgidae family . It is found in western Ecuador and north - western Peru . Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry shrubland .  - Caprimulgus is a large and very widespread genus of nightjars, medium-sized nocturnal birds with long pointed wings, short legs and short bills. \\"Caprimulgus\\" is derived from the Latin \\"capra\\", \\"nanny goat\\", and \\"mulgere\\", \\"to milk\\", referring to an old myth that nightjars suck milk from goats. The common name \\"nightjar\\", first recorded in 1630, refers to the nocturnal habits of the bird, the second part of the name deriving from the distinctive churring song.  - A nighthawk is a nocturnal bird of the subfamily Chordeilinae, within the nightjar family, Caprimulgidae. The term \\"nighthawk\\", first recorded in the King James Version of 1611, was originally a local name in England for the European nightjar. Its use in the Americas refers to members of the genus \\"Chordeiles\\" and related genera was first recorded in 1778.   - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas.  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.  - Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset.  - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - A plant community (sometimes \\"phytocoenosis\\" or \\"phytocenosis\\") is a collection or association of plant species within a designated geographical unit, which forms a relatively uniform patch, distinguishable from neighboring patches of different vegetation types. The components of each plant community are influenced by soil type, topography, climate and human disturbance. In many cases there are several soil types within a given phytocoenosis.   - The number and type of plants, how leafy they are, and how healthy they are. In places where foliage is dense and plants are growing quickly, the index is high, represented in dark green. Regions where few plants grow have a low vegetation index, shown in tan. The index is based on measurements taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Terra satellite. Areas where the satellite did not collect data are gray.  - Peru , officially the Republic of Peru, is a country in western South America. It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river.  - Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal or crepuscular birds in the family Caprimulgidae, characterized by long wings, short legs and very short bills. They are sometimes called goatsuckers, due to the ancient folk tale that they sucked the milk from goats (the Latin for goatsucker is \\"Caprimulgus\\"). Some New World species are called nighthawks. Nightjars usually nest on the ground.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - A population is the number of all the organisms of the same group or species, which live in a particular geographical area, and have the capability of interbreeding.

If any part appears to be damaged or faulty, replace or repair it to maintain optimal performance. 2. Removing the batteries (optional): If the flashlight will not be used for an extended period, it may be helpful to remove the batteries to prevent potential leakage or corrosion that could damage the flashlight's internal components. Store the batteries separately in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. 3. Cleaning the flashlight: Remove any dirt, debris, or fingerprints from the flashlight's exterior and lens using a soft cloth. Clean the contact points and battery compartment with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol, ensuring any residue is removed to maintain proper electrical conductivity. 4. Checking the waterproof seal (if applicable): If the flashlight is water-resistant or waterproof, check the sealing rings or gaskets, ideally replacing them if they appear worn or damaged. This will ensure that the flashlight's internal components remain protected from water ingress during future use. 5. Storing the flashlight: Store the flashlight in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources to prevent damage to the batteries, lamp, and other components. Ideally, the storage location should be easily accessible so that the flashlight can be quickly retrieved when needed. By following these steps, the flashlight will be properly stored and well-maintained, ensuring its continued functioning and reliability when needed for future tasks or emergencies. This attention to proper storage and maintenance ultimately prolongs the life of the flashlight, maximizing its benefits as a versatile and essential tool in various settings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Kozelsk and Starobelsk were used mainly for military officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers. Some prisoners were members of other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, landowners, and law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000-8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000-6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy).Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die. According to NKVD reports, if a prisoner could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude, he was declared a \\"hardened and uncompromising enemy of Soviet authority\\".On 5 March 1940, pursuant to a note to Joseph Stalin from Beria, six members of the Soviet Politburo — Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Mikhail Kalinin — signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish \\"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\\" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus.

A:","output":"The name of the massacre that Weinberg writes about, which took place in 1940 when approximately 25,700 Polish \\"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\\" were executed, is the Katyn Massacre. The incident is also often referred to as the Katyn Forest Massacre, because many of the executions took place in the Katyn Forest, near Smolensk, Russia. The massacre was carried out by the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, and was carried under the order of the high-ranking Soviet officials, including Joseph Stalin. The Katyn Massacre is considered as a major historical event showcasing the brutality of the Soviet regime towards Poland and its people during World War II."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Andrei Rublev Context: Director Andrei Tarkovsky shows the beautiful icons created by this famous iconographer only at the end of this long, long film. He shows that they were not just painted by a contemplative monk in a peaceful monastery. They were painted in the midst of the bustling life and terrible cruelty of medieval Russia, a land of ignorant peasants, cruel princes and Tartars invading thrice a year.Part I (86 mins.)Chapter 1 Hot-Air BalloonChapter 2 The Buffoon, 1400 AD. The opening image is of three monks who set off for Moscow across a harvested field: Kirill, Andrei and Danila. They take shelter from a rainstorm in a barn/inn. There, a buffoon is entertaining peasants with a song mocking the local boyar (lord). Then, some soldiers come and arrest the buffoon.Chapter 3 Theophanes the Greek, 1405 AD. This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel. An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him. Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years. I cant paint without you. I look with your eyes; I listen with your ears. Danila replies with tears in his eyes, You silly man, go with my blessing! Andrei kneels and kisses Danila's hand. Meanwhile, Father Kirill leaves the monastery in disgust, past a huge wall of logs, shouting You brood of vipers! You have made his temple a den of thieves.Chapter 4 The Passion according to Andrei, 1406 AD The chapter opens with Father Andrei walking through a forest with his apprentice, Foma.

Yes; b). No; Answer:","output":"Answer: b). No; The right answer to the question \\"name one kind of a protein that some viruses have inside their phospholipid envelope\\" cannot be \\"more abundant,\\" as \\"more abundant\\" is not a specific type of protein. The question is asking for a particular type of protein present in the phospholipid envelope of some viruses. Since some viruses have intrinsic proteins within their phospholipid envelope, the answer should be focused on a specific type of intrinsic protein that can be found in these viruses. Intrinsic proteins, also known as integral proteins, are proteins that are embedded within the lipid bilayer of the membrane. There are several types of intrinsic proteins, such as glycoproteins, ion channels, and receptor proteins, that play crucial roles in the viral life cycle. A better answer to this question might be: Matrix (M) protein: The M protein is an abundant and essential component of many enveloped viruses, including the influenza virus and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It serves as a crucial structural element in the virion by linking the lipid bilayer envelope to the underlying nucleocapsid core, which contains the viral genome. The M protein aids in the assembly, budding, and release of the virus particles from infected host cells, thus playing a key role in the viral life cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CONTEXT: Producción  Mientras estudiaban cinematografía en la Universidad del Sur de California, Dan O'Bannon, John Carpenter y Ron Cobb produjeron el filme de ciencia ficción y comedia Dark Star (1974). Años más tarde O'Bannon comenzó a escribir una historia similar a la trama de Dark Star pero con más elementos del cine de terror. Ronald Shusset escribía el libreto de Total Recall (1990) cuando miró Dark Star y quedó impresionado con la trama. Se puso en contacto con él y ambos accedieron a colaborar en sus respectivos guiones; coincidieron en que la película de O'Bannon habría de ser la menos costosa de producir así que trabajaron primero en dicho libreto. Para entonces O'Bannon ya tenía un borrador de veintinueve páginas titulado Memory, que describía cómo un grupo de astronautas despierta de un sueño inducido y se entera de que el trayecto de su nave ha sido interrumpido por una señal proveniente de un planetoide desconocido.

News article: Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto of Temple City, the man recently named by Newsweek as the mysterious creator of bitcoin, has hired a law firm and issued a statement late Sunday night in what he says was an attempt to \\"clear my name.\\"      The statement came in an email from Ethan D. Kirschner, a Los Angeles lawyer.      \\"This firm has been retained by Dorian S. Nakamoto, the subject of the recent Newsweek cover story on Bitcoin,\\" Kirschner said in an email. \\"He has issued the attached prepared statement. No further comment will be made by Mr. Nakamoto or the firm.\\"      In the statement, Nakamoto says:      \\"I did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin. I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report.\\"      According to Nakamoto, he heard the term bitcoin from his son only in February after he had been contacted by the reporter working on the Newsweek story.      When that story was published in early March, Nakamoto, 64, found himself at the center of a media circus as well as a raging online debate about whether he could in fact be the programmer who had created the virtual currency that has become a billion-dollar global phenomenon.      Part of the story pointed to the fact that Nakamoto of Temple City had programming skills. In the statement, Nakamoto says:      \\"My background is in engineering. I also have the ability to program. My most recent job was as an electrical engineer troubleshooting air traffic control equipment for the FAA. I have no knowledge of nor have I ever worked on cryptography, peer to peer systems, or alternative currencies.\\"      The Newsweek story also notes what appears to be a strange gap in his resume over the last decade, the time during which the bitcoin code was written and released. Nakamoto explains:      \\"I have not been able to find steady work as an engineer or programmer for ten years. I have worked as a laborer, polltaker, and substitute teacher. I discontinued my internet service in 2013 due to severe financial distress. I am trying to recover from prostate surgery in October 2012 and a stroke I suffered in October of 2013. My prospects for gainful employment has been harmed because of Newsweek's article.\\"      Nakamoto ends by asking to be left in peace:      \\"Newsweek's false report has been the source of a great deal of confusion and stress for myself, my 93-year old mother, my siblings, and their families. I offer my sincerest thanks to those people in the United States and around the world who have offered me their support. I have retained legal counsel. This will be our last public statement on this matter. I ask that you now respect our privacy.\\"      ALSO:      Reddit users launch fundraiser to help Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto            Is bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto living quietly in Temple City?      Did the real Satoshi Nakamoto just say Newsweek has wrong guy? ||||| Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, who Newsweek claimed was “the” Satoshi Nakamoto credited with the creation of bitcoin, has now issued a statement through his lawyer Ethan Kirschner completely denying his involvement in creating the digital currency.      “I did not create, invent, or otherwise work on Bitcoin. I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report,” Nakamoto said in the statement.      The Newsweek story, which revealed details about Dorian’s life including what town he lived in, sparked something akin to a modern tech manhunt as reports raced to chase the older man down. To be fair, Dorian denied everything then, too, and then again.      And now we have Dorian’s denial in written form as well. Reuters Blogger Felix Salmon first produced the statement, but, in this ongoing story of slippery bitcoin “facts,” we have also confirmed the text of the note directly with Kirschner.      “We have no comment beyond confirming that we’ve been retained by Mr. Nakamoto and that it is his statement that was released,” he told TechCrunch in an emailed statement.      The drama around Bitcoin’s creator fails to die, very much in line with the roller coaster ride the crypto-currency has been going through over past year.      This latest chapter is a particularly frustrating one, centred as it is not only on an individual who is claiming no involvement, but one who was already in difficult times.      Not only were there apparently no facts unveiled in the Newsweek story, but there has been quite a significant casualty resulting from it, in the form of an individual’s privacy.      Dorian writes in the letter that he had never heard of the word “bitcoin” before February 2014, when he was contacted by a reporter. (He does not name Leah McGrath Goodman in his letter.) It was his son who first mentioned the word bitcoin to him, he writes.      While the Newsweek story sets up Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto as a hidden-in-plain-sight mystery solved, Nakamoto’s letter paints a rather different picture of the person.      Here, we have a smart, but also struggling, individual. Someone who is very much on the other spectrum of the tech boom that is so often the subject of public discourse — and of bitcoin in particular.      Despite having a background in engineering, Nakamoto notes that he couldn’t find a programmer’s job for over a decade.      “I’ve worked as a laborer, polltaker and a substitute teacher,” he added in the statement. He says he has never worked on cryptography, peer-to-peer systems, or alternative currencies.      He also underscores some of the other problems he has had outside of this case of apparently very mistaken identity. They include several health issues and “severe financial distress.”      You can imagine that this letter, coming with legal backing, is a precursor to further legal action and claims for damages, either publicly or behind the scenes.      Despite Newsweek maintaining a solid stance on its story, the tech world has been skeptical of the evidence from the moment it came out. We’ve even seen one person, allegedly the “real” Satoshi Nakamoto (or at least posting on an account linked with the original manifesto), post on a message board to deny the Newsweek article. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A man named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto was said to be the creator of Bitcoin in a Newsweek article. But he says he did not create Bitcoin and he doesn't know how it works. He is an engineer, but hasn't had a job in that field for ten years.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who wants evidence of being on a Maine moose hunt? , can you please find it?   Clark and McCullough are Flash and Blodgett, a pair of \\"alibi photographers\\" operating a studio in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The pair cater to a clientele who require fraudulent tourist photographs using fake backdrops, which can later be used as evidence that the person in the photograph was at any location in the country. One day, a married couple (Bud Jamison and Constance Bergen) turn up separately in need of alibi photographs: the man wants evidence of being on a Maine moose hunt while the woman needs photographic proof of being in Washington, D.C. The photographers, unaware that the man and woman are married, decide to play matchmaker with the pair. By coincidence, the man and woman have rooms opposite each other in the same hotel. The hotel's manager and the staff detective become suspicious of what is transpiring when the photographers and the couple zigzag between the rooms. Eventually, the husband and wife discover the truth of their activities and leave the hotel together. The photographers, however, attempt to leave the hotel disguised as a moose, only to be chased amidst gunfire from the hotel manager. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person who wants evidence of being on a Maine moose hunt is Bud Jamison, as mentioned in the article you provided. The married couple who separately seek alibi photographs are Bud Jamison (who wants photographic evidence of the moose hunt) and Constance Bergen (who needs photographic proof of being in Washington, D.C.).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: I was thrown by the question. Sentence 2: I was surprised to be asked that. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The relationship between the first and second sentences raises some interesting considerations about the potential veracity and implications of each statement. However, before delving into the connections between the statements, it is essential to examine each sentence individually. 1. Sentence 1: \\"I was thrown by the question.\\" This statement communicates a feeling of being disoriented, taken aback, or momentarily confused by a question that was asked. The underlying reason for such a reaction might stem from the unexpected nature of the question, a lack of preparedness, or simply the surprising or novel content of the inquiry. Overall, the speaker suggests that they were unsettled or caught off guard, making it difficult for them at that moment to provide a coherent or thoughtful response. 2. Sentence 2: \\"I was surprised to be asked that.\\" The second statement similarly expresses the speaker's response to a question. In this case, the focus is on the feeling of surprise resulting from the experience of being asked a particular question. This implies that the inquiry was unanticipated or perhaps seemed irrelevant, intrusive, or otherwise out of place. The emphasis here is on the emotional reaction (surprise), and how it reflects the speaker's thoughts about why the question was asked or the context in which it occurred. Now, let's consider the question: if the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? On the surface, both sentences appear to describe a similar emotional state or reaction to a question. However, they differ in the specific emotional responses: the first sentence focuses on being \\"thrown,\\" whereas the second sentence highlights feeling \\"surprised.\\" It is possible for both emotions to be experienced simultaneously, as surprise can often lead to disorientation or confusion, as in being thrown off balance. In that sense, if the first sentence is true, it could suggest that the second sentence is also true, because the speaker may have experienced a chain reaction of emotions that began with surprise. However, it's important to note that the emotions or reactions described in the two sentences are not precisely identical, nor are they entirely dependent on each other. It is conceivable that one might feel thrown by a question without necessarily feeling surprised, or vice versa. In conclusion, it is plausible that if the first sentence is true, the second sentence might also be true, as the two emotional reactions might be experienced concurrently or in succession. However, given the nuanced differences between being \\"thrown\\" and feeling \\"surprised,\\" it is not absolutely necessary for the truth of the second sentence to follow automatically from the truth of the first sentence. The relationship between the two sentences depends on the particular context of the situation and the specific emotional reactions and thought processes of the speaker, which may ultimately determine the veracity of both statements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Article: As for older people, some of the applications are hard to use because they didn't grow up with them. They don't have simple models of how it should work. They don't know what to do when it doesn't work. I think there is huge potential, so I have designed some for them. The ability to connect to friends, who remember the same movies, news and music, is really important, especially as people get older. They end up in retirement homes and they aren't always close to their friends. Allowing the network to help them connect with friends  and family members is a really powerful thing. My wife likes using the Internet, although it took me years to get her to use e-mail. She was born with normal hearing, but lost it when she was three years old. She was totally deaf for many years until 53 when she got ear implants .They work really well. That is a big change for her. Before then, her friends couldn't call her on the phone, so they insisted that she use e-mails to communicate with them. The younger people don't even think of this as technology. It's just there, and they use it .There's been a very interesting change in communication styles between the old and the young .A woman named Sharryturkle wrote about this phenomenon .There are some kids who are now in their teens and are tending not to make phone calls. And they think of e-mail as old-fashioned and slow. The reason why teens don't make phone calls seems to be that they don't know what to say. When they call they often pause for a while. On the other hand, texting is considered proper, and it's OK if you don't answer. You might have been distracted .It's not considered rude, but it's considered unusual if you're in this kind of voice conversation and simply stop talling. Question: What is the best way for the teens to communicate with others? Options: A: Sending e-mail. B: Making phone call. C: Writing letters. D: Sending text messages. Answer:","output":"Based on the article, the best way for teens to communicate with others is D: Sending text messages. The article highlights that younger people, especially teens, tend to avoid making phone calls because they do not know what to say, and they have a preference for texting over other forms of communication. The article also mentions that teens consider emails to be old-fashioned and slow. Texting allows them to communicate in a format that they are comfortable with and find efficient. Additionally, it is not considered rude if a response is delayed, which may be a contributing factor to why teens prefer this method of communication. Text messaging provides them with a quick, informal, and unobtrusive way to connect with others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: There are two major parties in Britain today,the Conservative and the Labour,which have been in power by turns since 1945.The twoparty system of Britain was formed in the course of the development of the capitalist state and the political parties. To strengthen the state machine,the British bourgeosie have let it come into being and exist in one form or another since the 17th century. P.S.Tregidgo once said,\\"The more parties there are,the less likely it is that any one of them will be strong enough in Parliament to control all the others; but when there are only two,one of them is sure to have a majority of seats. This helps to ensure a strong and stable government.\\" This explains why the British have the twoparty system. The division into two parties grew out the establishment of a Protestant Church of England in the 16th century. Because of a purely religious difference of opinion,the Puritans were separated from the broad body of the Anglican Church. The non Puritan Anglicans were on the side of the King and Church,whose supporters were called by their opponents \\"Tories\\".The Puritans were for Parliament and trade,whose supporters are called by the \\"Tories\\" \\"Whigs\\".The Tories and the Whigs were in power by turns for a long time. In 1833,the Tory Party split into two and its name was changed to Conservative. In the 1860s the Whigs became Liberals. Since then,the Liberals and the Conservatives were in office by turns until 1922.They have some different opinions,but were both controlled by the rich. The working class became more and more unwilling to follow the Conservatives and the Liberals. They wanted to have their own party. So the Labour Party was formed by the trade unions. After 1922,the Labour Party gradually replaced the Liberal Party. The answer to this question is:","output":"Which factor played a significant role in the development and establishment of the two-party system in Britain? A. The influence of multiple trade unions B.

Question: How do Hunter and Corlie escape? Movie title: Warlords of the 21st Century Movie plot: All remaining reserves of petroleum have finally run out; forcing people to ration the few remaining containers of gasoline left on the earth against mercenaries and warlords. Straker and his men (accompanied by his daughter Corlie - played by Annie McEnroe) find a vast supply of diesel fuel in a compound once thought to be radioactive. When Corlie refuses to execute the previous owners, she runs away from base camp. Hunter (Michael Beck), on his amazing (possibly ex-future-military) motorcycle, rescues the girl and takes her to his farm. After keeping her on the farm on a temporary basis, Hunter sends her off to live in a walled city (known in-film as Clearwater Farm) governed by a strict old-fashioned democracy (similar to the Quakers) where she is quickly accepted by the community. However, she is soon discovered by the mercenaries commanded by her father, Colonel Straker (James Wainwright), who moves to attack the Clearwater community. In the chaos that ensues, Corlie manages to escape back to Hunter's remote hideout. Straker terrorises the residents of Clearwater, taking their weapons, medicines, and other supplies and handing the women over to his men. Within a short time, one of the residents of Clearwater betrays the Clearwater mechanic/fabricator, Rusty, who knows the secret location of Hunter's hideout. Straker &amp; Co. use torture to get the information out of Rusty, then move in to attack Hunter's base and recapture Corlie. Hunter and Corlie escape on his bike, Straker, in a minor rage, plows through Hunter's place with the truck. Hunter takes Corlie back to the Clearwater people and asks Rusty to build him an armored car to attack Straker's \\"battle truck\\". While Rusty and Hunter and a few others are thus occupied, the traitor who betrayed Corlie before knocks her out, puts her in a wagon and heads out to deliver her back to Straker. Hunter tries to stop him, but the traitor sets an ambush for him and wounds him with a crossbow. Believing that he has killed Hunter, he appears at Straker's HQ with...","output":"Based on the provided plot, Hunter and Corlie's primary escape method appears to be Hunter's ex-future-military motorcycle. Throughout the story, Hunter rescues Corlie using this high-speed vehicle and they manage to stay one step ahead of Colonel Straker and his mercenaries. The first escape occurs when Hunter rescues Corlie after she refuses to execute the previous owners of the diesel fuel supply and runs away from Straker's base camp. Hunter takes her to his farm before sending her to live in the Clearwater walled city, where the Clearwater community accepts her. Their second escape happens when Corlie is discovered by the mercenaries and Colonel Straker, who launches an attack on Clearwater. Amidst the chaos, Corlie manages to escape back to Hunter's remote hideout. The final escape occurs when Straker's men locate Hunter's hideout and attempt to recapture Corlie. Once more, Hunter and Corlie flee on his motorcycle, outrunning Straker and his mercenaries. Hunter then enlists the help of his ally Rusty to build an armored car for a counterattack against Straker's battle truck. In summary, Hunter and Corlie's main means of escape throughout the film is Hunter's advanced motorcycle, which provides them with the speed and agility necessary to evade their pursuers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Alejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky (Spanish: [ale'xandro xodo'rofski]; born 17 February 1929) is a Chilean-French filmmaker. Active since 1948, in seventy years of his artistic career Jodorowsky has experienced it in almost all creative forms: writer (in his five facets: novelist, storyteller, poet, playwright and essayist), film director and producer, actor of cinema and theatre, playwright, theatre director, screenwriter, film editor, comics writer, musician, soundtrack composer, philosopher, puppeteer, mime, psychologist and psychoanalyst, draughtsman, painter, eventually sculptor and spiritual guru. Best known for his avant-garde films, he has been \\"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\\" for his work which \\"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation\\". Born to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. Context: Jodorowsky spent almost a decade reconstructing the original form of the Tarot de Marseille. From this work he moved into more therapeutic work in three areas: psychomagic, psychogenealogy and initiatic massage. Psychomagic aims to heal psychological wounds suffered in life. This therapy is based on the belief that the performance of certain acts can directly act upon the unconscious mind, releasing it from a series of traumas, some of which practitioners of the therapy believe are passed down from generation to generation. Psychogenealogy includes the studying of the patient's personality and family tree in order to best address their specific sources. It is similar, in its phenomenological approach to genealogy, to the Constellations pioneered by Bert Hellinger.  Jodorowsky has several books on his therapeutic methods, including Psicomagia: La trampa sagrada (Psychomagic: The Sacred Trap) and his autobiography, La danza de la realidad (The Dance of Reality), which he was filming as a feature-length film in March 2012. To date he has published more than 23 novels and philosophical treatises, along with dozens of articles and interviews. His books are widely read in Spanish and French, but are for the most part unknown to English-speaking audiences.  Throughout his career, Jodorowsky has gained a reputation as a philosopher and scholar who presents the teachings of religion, psychology, and spiritual masters, by molding them into imaginative endeavors. All of his enterprises integrate an artistic approach. Currently, Jodorowsky dedicates much of his time to lecturing about his work.  For a quarter of a century, Jodorowsky held classes and lectures for free, in cafes and universities all over the city of Paris. Typically, such courses or talks would begin on Wednesday evenings as tarot divination lessons, and would culminate in an hour long conference, also free, where at times hundreds of attendees would be treated to live demonstrations of a psychological \\"arbre genealogique\\" (\\"tree of genealogy\\") involving volunteers from the audience. In these conferences, Jodorowsky would pave the way to building a strong base of students of his philosophy, which deals with understanding the unconscious as the \\"over-self\\", composed of many generations of family relatives, living or deceased, acting on the psyche, well into adult lives, and causing compulsions. Of all his work, Jodorowsky considers these activities to be the most important of his life. Though such activities only take place in the insular world of Parisian cafes, he has devoted thousands of hours of his life to teaching and helping people \\"become more conscious,\\" as he puts it.  Since 2011 these talks have dwindled to once a month and take place at the \\"Librairie Les Cent Ciels\\" in Paris. Question: Was there any statement he made about psychomagic? Answer:","output":"Yes, Alejandro Jodorowsky has made various statements about psychomagic. He believes it's a form of therapy that can heal psychological wounds we experience in life. He thinks that by performing certain acts or behaviors, we can directly influence our unconscious mind and free it from different kinds of traumas. Some of these traumas, he says, can even be passed down from one generation to the next. He has written books to share his theories and methods about psychomagic. In his view, these therapeutic actions are very important and he has spent a lot of his time teaching others about them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer. It was a relatively humble selection by Trump, a former Paris runway model who is frequently clad for public appearances in haute couture dresses and coats.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons. The answer to this question is:","output":"The old house, which was situated near the church in the garden of the present house, belonged to the manor of Belton and was sold to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Seoul-born, 71-year-old Japanese architect Toyo Ito is this year's recipient of the industry's most coveted prize. On Monday, the architect was announced the 2013 Pritzker Architecture Prize winner, joining past Pritzker Laureates that include Frank Gehry, Tadao Ando and Rem Koolhaas. \\"As I did not expect it, I felt really grateful and honored to be awarded the prize,\\" Ito told CNN. In addition to his abstract, beautiful buildings, the Tokyo-based architect is also known for his extensive work on communal centers as part of the reconstruction in Japan following the 2011 tsunami. Ito, whose family ran a miso (bean paste) factory following his father's early death when Ito was 12, has said he wasn't interested in architecture as a youth.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that performed on the Sound+Vision Tour? ?  Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust for Life. Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as \\"a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis\\"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, \\"It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book.\\" EMI complained of \\"lyrics that preach\\" as well as \\"repetitive tunes\\" and \\"minimalist or no production\\". The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, \\"I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate.\\" They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the...

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more whites are there than African American, in percentage?","output":"Title: Racial Demographics in the United States: A Comparative Analysis of White and African American Populations Introduction The United States, a diverse nation known as a \\"melting pot\\" of cultures, is comprised of various racial and ethnic groups. Among these groups are the White and African American populations, both playing important roles in shaping the country's history and society. This article aims to present a comparative analysis of these two racial groups and address the question: How many more Whites are there than African Americans, in percentage? Current Demographics According to data from the United States Census Bureau, as of July 2019, the country's total population was approximately 328 million people. Of this, Whites (including those of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origins) accounted for around 76.3%, while African Americans made up to 13.4% of the population. To determine the percentage difference between these two groups, the total population can be utilized as a basis for comparison. Calculating the Difference To compute the percentage difference of Whites and African Americans in the United States, we will consider the non-Hispanic White population in comparison with African Americans, as that is a more accurate representation of the distinct groups. As of July 2019, the non-Hispanic Whites accounted for approximately 60.1% of the total U.S. population. To determine the percentage difference, we can use the following formula: Percentage Difference = ((60.1 - 13.4) / 60.1) × 100% By plugging in the values, we obtain: Percentage Difference = (46.7 / 60.1) × 100% Percentage Difference ≈ 77.7% This calculation reveals that there are approximately 77.7% more non-Hispanic Whites than African Americans in the United States based on the 2019 demographic data. Changes in Demographics It's essential to note that racial demographics in the United States are continuously evolving due to factors such as immigration, birth rates, and social intermingling. This trend is expected to continue in the coming decades. Projections by the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that by 2045, the non-Hispanic White population will shrink to an estimated 49.7%, while the African American population is projected to grow slightly to 13.8%. As a result, the percentage difference between the two racial groups will continue to change as well, narrowing down over time. Conclusion The racial composition of the United States is an ever-changing landscape, which nevertheless remains an important aspect for understanding cultural dynamics and social issues. Currently, the non-Hispanic White population in the United States is about 77.7% larger than the African American population, but this difference will likely decline in the coming decades. As the country continues to evolve and embrace its diversity, it is essential for policymakers, educational institutions, and the general public to be aware of these demographic changes and their implications."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Based in Toronto, the band's original line-up consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Adam Gontier, drummer and backing vocalist Neil Sanderson, and bassist Brad Walst. In 2003, Barry Stock was recruited as the band's lead guitarist, making Three Days Grace a four-member band. In 2013, Gontier left the band and was replaced by My Darkest Days' vocalist Matt Walst, who is also bassist Brad Walst's brother. From March to August 2008, and from January to April 2009, Three Days Grace recorded their third album at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, and in Los Angeles, again with producer Howard Benson who had worked with them on their previous releases. The album, entitled Life Starts Now, was released on September 22, 2009. Critics as well as band members have noted the album's departure from the angry tone of the band's previous releases into a lyrical style that is perceived as more optimistic. This album reflects the maturity of the band members as they overcome problems such as sickness and death within their families in which they stated, \\"We had to be inspired by it, but the outcome is this: It's a new beginning. It's life starting over.\\"  According to guitarist Barry Stock, the album's theme centres around \\"a new sense of freshness\\" and the idea that \\"you don't have to be stuck in whatever it is you're dealing with. Whether it's good or bad, it's your choice to make a change\\".  Life Starts Now debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, Three Days Grace's highest chart position to date, and sold 79,000 copies in its first week. The album was met with mostly positive reviews. Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star gave the album a negative review, saying it possesses \\"no sound of its own, just a shallow range between Linkin Park and Nickelback\\". According to Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger, who gave the album three out of five stars, Life Starts Now \\"...continues the theme of One-X, Gontier's personal demons, but with a 'hint of sunlight'.\\" He complimented the album, saying it \\"...treats the well-worn metal themes of anger, isolation, heartache, and redemption with the kind of begrudging respect they deserve, pumping out a competent flurry of fist-bump anthems and world-weary, mid-tempo rockers\\".  The first single release from the album, \\"Break\\", was released on September 1, 2009. In support of the album, Three Days Grace embarked on a 20 date Canadian tour lasting through November and December 2009. They co-headlined a January-February 2010 tour of the U.S. with Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf.  Life Starts Now was nominated for \\"Best Rock Album\\" at the 2010 Juno Awards, but lost to Billy Talent III.

To provide a detailed explanation, let's break down the two sentences and compare their meanings: 1. \\"A computer on a desk.\\" This sentence describes the physical location of a computer, which is on a desk. There is no information about the operational status or functionality of the computer. 2. \\"A computer operating on a desk.\\" This sentence describes a computer that is functioning or working while it is located on a desk. The addition of the word \\"operating\\" adds more information about the computer's status, compared to the first sentence. Both sentences share the same core meaning, which is the location of a computer on a desk. However, the second sentence provides additional information about the computer's operational status. This extra detail in the second sentence does not contradict the first sentence but rather provides supplementary information. Thus, I rate the similarity at 4.5 since there is a strong meaning overlap between the two sentences, but they are not exactly the same due to the added information about the computer's operational status in the second sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Picking up a dachshund is different than the way you'd pick up other breeds, but it's not especially hard once you learn the right method. Start by slipping a hand under the dog's upper body to support his chest and ribcage. Spread your fingers out so that you support as much of the dog's upper body as possible (II). The wider the area you can spread his weight over, the gentler it will be on his spine. Then, place your other hand underneath the back of his neck (III). It's easiest for you to pick up one dachshund at a time with your hands in the way so you can remain stable. This two-handed technique allows you to distribute the dog's weight evenly, reducing the pressure on both his spine and your arms while ensuring a comfortable and secure grip. As you pick up your dachshund, it's essential to be mindful of their elongated shape and delicate spine. The combination of the support from your hand under the chest and your other hand under the neck helps in maintaining their stability and preventing any injury. Make sure to keep the dog close to your body while lifting to ensure better control and comfort. In any position, be it laying the dog on your chest or holding him upright, always focus on supporting the dog's spine and keeping it as straight as possible. Avoid twisting, bending, or placing sudden force on the dachshund's back, as these actions could lead to injury or aggravate existing conditions like intervertebral disc disease (IVDD), which is common in this breed. In conclusion, the key to holding a dachshund properly is by providing adequate support for their chest, ribcage, neck, and spine. Always be gentle and conscious of their unique shape and ensure that their weight is evenly distributed between both of your hands to avoid any injury and offer the utmost comfort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fung Ling and Lam are also in love, but do not acknowledge it. Emperor Tsao hires the Hons to capture the Nine-Tails Fox, whom he claims has made a major robbery of his household, including the rape and murder of his daughter and the murder of 41 servants. The Hons are distracted when they find the Fungs captured by Never Die and his brothers, who in spite of decapitation and loss of a hand, proceed to chase them (the severed hand grabbing at one of them) chase the Hons to the lair of Nine-Tails Fox, who has recently caused his wife, the apsara known as Flying Cat to walk out on him.

Never Die soon dissolves, and the four bounty hunters and Never Die's hand take him away. Flying Cat returns to find drawn images of what has gone on previously, including what she interprets as her husband's homosexual behavior, and chastises the old man who sends the drawings out through a slot for not intervening, which he says is not his place.

Since 2002 the line up consists of Chris Cheney (vocals, guitar), Scott Owen (double bass, vocals) and Andy Strachan (drums). The band rose to fame in 1997 after the release of their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. They have released six studio albums and two reached the No. 1 spot on the ARIA Albums Chart: self-titled album (12 October 1998) and State of Emergency (4 February 2006). In February 2002, The Living End's line up changed as Demsey left and was replaced on drums in April by Andy Strachan (ex-Pollyanna). Dempsey wanted to spend more time with his family, and had a dislike of heavy touring; in August that year he joined Fez Perez, and later joined a punk, folk rock group, The Currency. The Living End developed a side project, The Longnecks, to test out Strachan and new material for their third album, Modern ARTillery, without attracting wide public attention. The name is a reference to longneck beer bottles. The Longnecks name was re-used by the band to try out potential material for later albums. They have also played under other names: Glen Waverley & The Mentones, The Dovetones, Roller Toasters, Doncaster & The Dandenongs and Redwings; at various venues in regional Victoria.  In mid-2002 The Living End recorded four tracks, including \\"One Said to the Other\\", which were released as an EP in January the following year and reached the top 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Two of its tracks were re-recorded in Los Angeles with Mark Trombino (Blink-182, Jebediah) producing, together with new material for Modern ARTillery, which appeared on 28 October 2003. It peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart, top 50 in New Zealand, and top 40 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums Chart. \\"Who's Gonna Save Us?\\" was issued a month earlier, as the lead single, which reached top 40 in Australia, top 30 in New Zealand and on Billboard's Alternative Songs Chart. They followed with heavy touring (including Big Day Out) promoting their releases.  On 27 September 2004 the band released a compilation album, From Here on In: The Singles 1997-2004, early versions included a bonus disc, Under the Covers, which had six cover versions of other artist's tracks. The CD featured two new tracks: \\"I Can't Give You What I Haven't Got\\" and \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\". They also issued a compilation DVD, From Here on In: The DVD 1997-2004, which collated their music video clips and live performances of the groups at festivals: Splendour in the Grass and Big Day Out in Sydney, and from Summer Sonic in Japan. The DVD also documented the band's history by interviews and home footage. What else did the band do during this time?","output":"During this time, The Living End was also heavily involved in touring both within Australia and internationally. They maintained a steady pattern of conducting tours, often alongside other major artists and at popular music festivals, thereby increasing their fan base. Their consistent touring schedule allowed them to develop a strong reputation for their energetic and dynamic live performances. One of the significant moments during this period was when The Living End were invited to join the Australian leg of the Warped Tour in 1998. The Warped Tour was known for bringing together leading punk rock bands and the Australian leg of the tour served as an excellent platform for The Living End to expand their audience and form connections within the punk rock community. During this period, The Living End also actively worked on many philanthropic pursuits. The band often participated in charity concerts and benefit shows. For instance, they performed at the WaveAid concert in 2005, a fundraising event for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. This event highlighted their commitment not just to creating music, but also to using their platform to contribute to meaningful causes. The band also frequently collaborated with other prominent artists and bands. Notably, they joined forces with Jet, a fellow Australian rock band, for a national tour in 2006. This tour helped strengthen the alliance of Australian rock bands and further anchored The Living End's status within the local music scene. Furthermore, while continuing their musical career, members of the band used their success to delve into individual projects. Chris Cheney, for instance, made several guest appearances with other bands and continued to improve his songwriting and music production skills. Scott Owen and Andy Strachan also engaged in side projects, thus exploring their musical versatility. In terms of album production, The Living End was not just busy recording their music but also constantly trying to experiment and evolve their sound. During the production of their albums, they worked with various producers and experimented with various recording techniques, leading to the distinct sound featured in their two number one albums 'The Living End' and 'State of Emergency'. The band, true to their punk rock roots, were not afraid to take risks and push the boundaries of their genre. Finally, while keeping up with their heavy touring schedule and music production, the band also focused on connecting with their fans. They continually communicated with their followers through their official website and social media platforms. They made sure that they were accessible to their fans, often staying after shows for meet and greets and hosting Q&A sessions on their social media platforms. Remaining true to their roots while also embracing progress, The Living End became an important fixture in the Australian punk rock scene during this period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 2: Recognizing Emotional Words and Phrases The next step is identifying words or phrases that demonstrate emotion, such as \\"worst,\\" \\"awful,\\" \\"poor miserable excuse,\\" \\"takes the cake,\\" and \\"worse movie.\\"  To classify the sentiment as positive or negative, we need to consider not only the number of negative words but also the intensity of the prefix used with these words, like \\"worst\\" and \\"awful.\\" Step 3: Determine the Overall Sentiment Given the weight and repetition of negative words and phrases, as well as the context and relative intensity of the language, this text clearly conveys a very negative sentiment.

He’s one of those players for whom cheers are perhaps worse than boos, knowing as he must the irony that they carry. He was given what must have seemed to the uninitiated a nice reception when his place in Benfica’s starting line-up was announced. No-one else in his side came close to drawing such a reaction, and neither did any player in the Valencia squad. His £7million move to Manchester United in 2010, sight unseen, remains one of English football’s great curiosities. But here he is, recruited by a side who completed a domestic treble last season and who came within a penalty shootout of winning the Europa League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch United flop","output":"Bebe training with Benfica and Sir Alex Ferguson talking about his signing As the game commenced, the weight of expectations and past disappointments seemed to hang heavy on Bebe's shoulders. Every touch, every pass, every movement was closely scrutinized by both fans and critics alike. He knew that he had to prove himself worthy of being in this extraordinary team and of his past association with one of the greatest football clubs in the world. The pressure, amplified by the constant murmurs and anticipation that filled the stadium, was both a challenge and a motivation for him to rise above his tainted reputation. Throughout the match, Bebe exhibited a level of determination and resilience that was commendable, if not exceptional. He actively participated in the team's movements, made intelligent runs, and occasionally displayed flashes of brilliance that hinted at the dormant potential lying within him. However, his inconsistent performance and the occasional misplaced pass served as a stark reminder of the reason behind the derisive jeers that seemed to follow him in every footballing environment. The knowledge that he was the subject of mockery and ridicule did not seem to dampen Bebe's spirit, but rather strengthened his resolve to prove himself. As the minutes ticked away and the game progressed, he worked tirelessly to make a tangible impact on the field - in the hope of every once in a while hearing genuine cheers from the audience and allowing himself to steal a brief, precious moment in the limelight. But alas, despite his best efforts, Bebe could not tip the scales in his or his team's favor. The final whistle blew, and with it came the sobering realization that his journey to redemption was far from complete. As he walked off the pitch, the same ironic, mocking cheers and laughter that greeted him before the start of the game seemed to follow him like a remorseless specter. Time will tell whether or not Bebe finds his way back into the hearts of football fans, or whether he will forever be remembered for that ill-fated £7million transfer. Yet, amidst the cruelty and hardship that define the world of professional football, perhaps the most valuable lesson that Bebe's story can teach us is the importance of grit, determination, and the relentless pursuit of one's dreams - even when the odds are stacked against us, and the world seems to turn its back."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When did the students do the first self portrait?

The two most important men in Lewis Hamilton’s life left Singapore, one with a permanent smile, the other with a frown and a suitcase full of trouble. The first was Anthony Hamilton, Lewis’s father and backbone through his karting life. The second was Paddy Lowe, the Mercedes boffin trying to stop millions of pounds’ worth of technology from breaking. Whether a car that can last a race or a mind in top working order is more crucial to Hamilton is unclear. Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes celebrates with his team including Nico Rosberg of Germany, his father Anthony Hamilton and his step-mother Linda Hamilton In","output":"In Lewis Hamilton's journey towards greatness, both his father Anthony Hamilton and Paddy Lowe of Mercedes played indispensable roles. Anthony Hamilton had been Lewis's pillar of strength right from his early karting days, providing him constant support and guidance throughout his racing career. As a father, he instilled in Lewis the values of hard work, determination, and humility that, in due course, contributed to his astounding achievements in the world of motorsports. On the other hand, Paddy Lowe, the renowned Mercedes engineer, was instrumental in ensuring the cutting-edge technology of Lewis's race cars stayed on par with the fierce competition. With millions of pounds dedicated to every aspect of the car, Lowe was committed to making innovative breakthroughs while preventing crucial technology from failing during races. As the brains behind the team's advanced mechanical engineering, Lowe made sure that Hamilton was always equipped with the best machinery to help him ascend the podium. However, the question of whether a perfectly functioning car or a mind in top working order is more significant for Hamilton's success remains open to debate. While it is without a doubt that both these factors are vital, they might be construed as two sides of the same coin, inextricably bound together in the pursuit of victory. In the world of Formula 1, where every second counts, any mechanical failure, even a minor one, can have far-reaching consequences on a driver's position in race standings. Paddy Lowe's expertise and the reliability of his engineering played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Mercedes cars performed optimally, empowering Hamilton to maintain his upward trajectory in the intensely competitive world of motorsports. Simultaneously, having a supportive and grounding figure like his father, Anthony Hamilton, also helped Lewis maintain his mental fortitude and weather the various challenges he faced on and off the track. The toil, the camaraderie, and the comprehensive backing of his father contributed to Hamilton's mental strength, enabling him to remain focused and determined to win race after race and eventually cement his status as one of the all-time greats of Formula 1. In the end, it might be reasonable to say that both a car that can last a race and a mind in top working order were essential elements in Lewis Hamilton's success story. In the unforgiving world of Formula 1, where the stakes are high and the cars are speeding at breakneck velocities, these two factors worked in harmony to bolster Hamilton's impeccable performance on the racecourse. Through the unwavering support of his father, Anthony Hamilton, and the technical wizardry of Paddy Lowe, Lewis Hamilton was poised to etch his name among the legends of the racing world, celebrating victories with his team, including his fellow driver Nico Rosberg. And the indelible bond between Hamilton and his father, as well as his stepmother, Linda Hamilton, was forged even further as they shared the moments of triumph with him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What was agreed when Bermuda and Newfoundland were added? Context: In May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return. In September 1940, as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from Darrell's Island in 1943).

(Photo: Dallas County Jail)      DALLAS — A Dallas County magistrate judge increased the bond for a woman accused of forcing her 4-year old son to ingest poison to 500,000, according to court records.      Paw Eh, 31, was arrested in Northeast Dallas Saturday after she tried but failed to make her other two children, ages 7 and 12, ingest the poison.      Eh has been charged with attempted capital murder. Her original 150,000 bond was increased after her arraignment from the Dallas County jail on Sunday.      When detectives interviewed Eh's 7-year-old son, he told them, \\"my mom wants to kill us with poison powder that kills ants and stuff,\\" according to an arrest warrant. He said Eh put ant poison on a spoon, added water, then forced his brother to drink it. She had to slap the 4-year-old to get him to drink the poison.      Bail increased for mom who fed son ant killer      Eh's daughter told police that her mother said she planned to kill her children and herself, the warrant states.      Officers responded to the call in the 10000 block of Walnut Hill Lane Saturday night.      Child Protective Services seized custody of Eh's children. The 7 and 12-year-old are in foster care. The 4-year-old remained hospitalized in stable condition Sunday.      CPS spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner said it appears that Eh has no prior history with the agency and has no criminal background on her record.

CARDONA and KRISTEN TAKETA      Staff Writers      A Dallas mother forced her 4-year-old son to ingest ant poison after telling her three children that she planned to kill them and herself, according to police documents released Sunday.      Paw Eh, 31, was arrested Saturday and charged with attempted capital murder. Her youngest child had improved from critical to stable condition by Sunday afternoon, police said.      Eh’s 12-year-old daughter told investigators that Eh called the 4-year-old downstairs to the kitchen of a Lake Highlands apartment. The girl said she watched her mother open the poison and put a tablespoon into the container, according to the arrest warrant affidavit.      Eh put the poison on a spoon, added water, then tried to force her 4-year-old son to drink it, the affidavit states.      When the boy held his mouth shut, Eh slapped him on the cheek. The boy started to cry and Eh forced the spoon into his mouth, the affidavit states.      Police say Eh also tried to poison her daughter and 7-year-old son but was unsuccessful. The girl said her mother told them earlier in the day that she was going to kill them and herself, according to the affidavit.      The 7-year-old boy told authorities, “my mom wants to kill us with poison powder that kills ants and stuff,” the affidavit states.      KTVT-TV (Channel 11) reported that the older children ran to their grandmother’s apartment — which is in the same complex — to tell her what happened.      A witness called police to the apartment complex in the 10800 block of Walnut Hill Lane at 1:37 p.m. Saturday to report the incident. The 4-year-old was transported to Medical City Dallas Hospital, according to the affidavit.      Police said the two older children were released to family members Saturday night, but Child Protective Services spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner said the children were in CPS custody Sunday.      Meisner said Eh does not appear to have a CPS history, and public records show no criminal record in Dallas County.      A friend of Eh’s, Sharl Nie, told WFAA-TV (Channel 8) that Eh couldn’t sleep at night and frequently thought about suicide. Eh is from Myanmar, WFAA reported.      Other neighbors said they had little interaction with Eh because of a language barrier. The affidavit indicates officials used a Burmese translator to communicate with her.      One neighbor, who identified himself as Moogay, said Eh had medical problems and said she would sometimes get red in the face, pass out and fail to remember what happened when she woke up. The neighbor said a man who he thought was her husband often had to supervise her.      But he said he was surprised to hear of Eh’s arrest.      Eh is being held in the Dallas County jail. Her bail has been set at 500,000. She did not have a lawyer late Sunday. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A Dallas County magistrate judge increased the bond for Paw Eh, a woman accused of forcing her 4-year-old son to ingest poison, to 500,000.

Article: I used to watch her from my kitchen window. She seemed so small as she muscled her way through the crowd of boys on the playground. The school was across the street from our home and I would often watch the kids as they played during break. I remember the first day I saw her playing basketball. I watched in wonder as she ran circles around the other kids. She managed to shoot jump shots just over their heads and into the net. The boys always tried to stop her but no one could. I began to notice her at other times, basketball in hand, playing alone. One day I asked her why she practiced so much. Without a moment of hesitation she said, \\"I want to go to college. The only way I can go is to get a scholarship. I am going to play college basketball. I want to be the best. My Daddy told me if the dream is big enough, the facts don't count.\\" Well, I had to give it to her--she was determined. I watched her through those junior high years and into high school. Every week, she led her school team to victory. One day in her senior year, I saw her sitting in the grass, head in her arms. I walked across the street and sat down in the cool grass beside her. Quietly I asked what was wrong. \\"Oh, nothing,\\" came a soft reply, \\"I am just too short.\\" The coach told her that at 5'5\\" she would probably never get to play for a top ranked team--much less offered a scholarship--so she should stop dreaming about college. She was heartbroken and I felt my own throat tighten as I sensed her disappointment. I asked her if she had talked to her dad about it yet. She told me that her father said those coaches were wrong. They just did not understand the power of a dream. He told her that if she truly wanted a scholarship and that nothing could stop her except one thing -- her own attitude. The next year, as she and her team went to the Northern California Championship game, she was offered a scholarship and on the college team. She was going to get the college education that she had dreamed of. Question: Which word can best describe her father? - Encouraging. - Optimistic. - Stubborn. - Cruel.

Let's analyze each sentence to understand the reasoning behind this conclusion: Sentence 1: At low tide you can walk or wade out to the little island of Grand B??, with its simple, unadorned tomb of the locally born Romantic writer Ceteaubriand. This sentence tells us that it is possible to walk or wade out to the little island of Grand B?? during low tide. The presence of the tomb of Ceteaubriand is indicated, but it is not relevant to the main point of the sentence, which is that one can access the island during low tide by walking or wading through the water. Sentence 2: Even at low tide, the water is too crazy to get into. This sentence directly contradicts the first one. It suggests that the water is too dangerous or turbulent to cross even during low tide.  If we assume that the first sentence is true, meaning people can walk or wade out to the island of Grand B?? during low tide, then it is unlikely that the second sentence is also true. The second sentence states that the water is too dangerous or turbulent to enter, even at low tide, which would make it impossible to walk or wade through.

Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.

English: These remedies or treatments are employed in cases where individuals experience various symptoms or conditions, including nerve irritation, skin itching, hives, swollen legs, and rheumatic swelling. The purpose of using such remedies is to alleviate discomfort, reduce inflammation, and provide relief to those who are affected by these issues. Nerve irritation, also commonly referred to as neuralgia, is a condition where the nerves become inflamed and cause sharp, stabbing pain or a burning sensation. This can occur due to factors such as injury, infection, pressure on the nerves, or other underlying medical conditions. Utilizing appropriate treatments can aid in calming the nerves and minimizing the pain associated with this condition. Skin itching, also known as pruritus, can result from various causes, including dry skin, allergic reactions, bug bites, or certain skin conditions, such as eczema. Relief from itching can be achieved through topical creams, antihistamine medications, or other specialized treatments depending on the underlying cause. Hives, medically known as urticaria, are red, itchy, and raised welts on the skin that can develop as a result of an allergic reaction, exposure to sunlight, heat, cold, or other triggers. They can typically be treated with antihistamines or anti-inflammatory medications to reduce itching and inflammation. Swollen legs can be caused by numerous factors, such as prolonged standing, injury, infection, or underlying medical conditions like deep vein thrombosis, lymphedema, or heart failure. It is essential to determine the underlying cause to provide the appropriate treatment, which may range from compression stockings and elevating the legs to specific medications for managing fluid retention or addressing the root issue. Lastly, rheumatic swelling is associated with rheumatic diseases or conditions, such as arthritis, which is characterized by inflammation, pain, and stiffness in the joints. Various treatment options are available depending on the type and severity of the rheumatic condition, including anti-inflammatory medications, pain relievers, and disease-modifying drugs to slow the progression of the disease. In conclusion, these treatments and remedies play an essential role in managing and alleviating symptoms in individuals experiencing nerve irritation, skin itching, hives, swollen legs, and rheumatic swelling. Proper implementation of these treatments tailored to the specific condition can provide relief and improved quality of life for those affected."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Mr Abbas said Israeli \\"war crimes\\" in Gaza should be punished, but stopped short of saying he would take the issue to the International Criminal Court. His speech brought strong condemnation from Israel and from the US, which described it as \\"offensive\\". The 50-day conflict left about 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. Correspondents say the conflict has weakened Mr Abbas politically, with his rivals in the radical group Hamas, which dominates Gaza, seeing a surge of popularity among Palestinians for fighting Israel. The UN says that most of the Palestinian dead were civilians. Israel says the high civilian death toll was because of Hamas fighters launching attacks from residential areas, including schools and mosques, drawing return fire. Earlier this month Israel ordered a criminal investigation into five incidents in which civilians are believed to have died, and is investigating over 100 incidents in total. Mr Abbas said the scale of damage in Gaza was unprecedented and surpassed that of earlier wars. \\"This last war against Gaza was a series of absolute war crimes carried out before the eyes and ears of the entire world, moment by moment,\\" he told the UN General Assembly in New York. He added that it was \\"impossible\\" to return to negotiations with Israel that did not address what he called \\"fundamental questions\\". \\"There is no meaning or value in negotiations for which the agreed objective is not ending the Israeli occupation and achieving the independence of the State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital on the entire Palestinian Territory occupied in the 1967 war,\\" he said. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said it was a \\"speech of incitement filled with lies\\". He said Mr Abbas's remarks \\"highlight once again how he does not want and cannot be a partner for a reasonable diplomatic agreement\\". He went on to accuse the Palestinian leader of \\"diplomatic terrorism\\". US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said President Abbas's speech \\"included offensive characterisations that were deeply disappointing\\". \\"Such provocative statements are counterproductive and undermine efforts to create a positive atmosphere and restore trust between the parties,\\" she said. Mr Abbas has previously threatened to take Israel to the International Criminal Court, but did not mention the body in his speech. The Palestinian leader also said the \\"hour of independence of the state of Palestine\\" had arrived. He added that he would be seeking a UN Security Council resolution on a two-state solution, but gave no time frame. The Israeli delegation was not present in the hall during Mr Abbas's speech. Israel launched a major military operation in Gaza on 8 July, with the stated aim of stopping militants firing rockets and mortars at its territory. Following several short-lived ceasefires, both sides agreed to an open-ended truce on 26 August which has so far held.","output":"Mr. Abbas talks about Israeli \\"war crimes\\" in Gaza and wants them to be punished, but hasn't said if he will go to the International Criminal Court about it, which has caused strong reactions from Israel and the US."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The practice of spreading fast food litter and scraps on the street rather than in the dustbin--with young men the worst group--was behind the rise. According to the National Rodent Survey in 2005, Britain's rat population has grown by nearly one quarter since 2000 and is now estimated at 60 million, two million more than the human population. On average a rat can give birth every 24-28 days and just a single pair of rats can produce a family of 2,000 a year. Around 200 people a year get Weil's Disease -an infection which can lead to liver or kidney failure and eventually death and which is carried in rats' waste. To attract people's attention to the problem, Keep Britain Tidy produced a cinema ad with a title \\"How close do you want them to get?\\" The ad gave a shocking image of a young woman sleeping in a bed of rats--reminding people of the terrible scene from James Herbert's classic horror tale The Rats, in which rats begin to hunt for humans.

(CNN) -- Brazilian striker Robinho, the most expensive player in English football history after Manchester City paid Real Madrid 42.5 million euros for him two years ago, has joined AC Milan on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. The 26-year-old became the first big-name signing in City's recent revolution, but he failed to settle in the north of England -- going back home to join Santos on loan in January before eventually leaving Eastlands on a permanent basis for the San Siro.

Process:  - Forest fires burn forests - The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide - Predators can now find their prey eaiser - Birds will fly away from the area - Waters warm up which hurts the fish swimming in them.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose general climate change happens, how will it affect it will be harder for fires to start.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, which is general climate change, does have an effect on the process. The process described - \\"forest fires leading to changes in animal habitats and ecosystem dynamics\\" - is affected by climate change both directly and indirectly. First and foremost, climate change directly influences forest fires. Warmer temperatures and frequent drought conditions create a conducive environment for wildfires to ignite and spread. When a region experiences these conditions due to a changing climate, there can be an increase in vulnerability to forest fires, which ultimately exacerbate the problems being faced by animals living in these forests. As a result of the increased frequency and intensity of fires, habitat loss becomes more prevalent. The animals that depend on the forest for shelter, food, and mating grounds are placed under increased pressure to find alternative habitats, and may face a decline in available resources, making it more challenging for them to thrive. Moreover, the entire food chain can be disrupted by the changes brought about due to forest fires. Since predators and prey both face the consequences of climate change-driven forest fires, there can be a direct effect on their populations and relationships in the ecosystem. For instance, if a predator species becomes more abundant due to easier access to prey as a result of the canopy loss caused by fires, it may lead to the decline or extinction of the prey species. Additionally, as you mentioned, migrating birds may need to fly away from the area to find a more suitable habitat as a result of the forest fires. This can cause the bird populations in those areas to decrease, which can consequently impact the ecosystem because birds contribute significantly to seed dispersal and pollination.  The warming waters you mentioned due to forest fires can also have a direct effect on fish populations and the overall aquatic ecosystem. Higher water temperatures can change the metabolic rates of fish, alter their food availability, and shift their suitable habitat ranges. This exposes fish to new predators, decreases their ability to survive, and can ultimately lead to a reduction in species diversity in these ecosystems. Furthermore, climate change-driven wildfires can indirectly affect other processes in the environment, such as local weather patterns and water cycles. In fact, the smoke and particulates emitted from forest fires can contribute to climate change itself by releasing greenhouse gases and darkening the atmosphere, absorbing heat, and further exacerbating the warming effect. To conclude, the perturbation hypothesis you proposed highlights the interconnectedness and complexity of ecosystems. Climate change undoubtedly affects numerous processes, including forest fires, their impact on animal populations, and other environmental aspects. It is crucial to understand these intricate relationships and work toward mitigating the effects of climate change to preserve the health and diversity of our ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy.

In 1972, when President Marcos declared martial law, the family immigrated to the United States. After two years in Yonkers, New York, the family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where Santiago attended Longmeadow High School and graduated from Wilbraham & Monson Academy in 1983. His first experience with a musical instrument was playing a Hammond organ at the age of eight, but he never took on the instrument seriously because he had to share it with five brothers. Santiago first played a guitar at the age of nine after he noticed a classical guitar hanging on his oldest brother's wall for decoration. The first song he learned to play was The Velvet Underground's \\"Rock and Roll\\".As a teenager, Santiago became interested in computer programming, naming his first program \\"Iggy\\" and his second \\"Pop\\" after punk rocker Iggy Pop. He participated in a cycle ride across the United States in aid of charity, but on completing it did not bother to collect the sponsor's money.After graduating from high school in 1983, Santiago studied at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He remained without a major as long as the university would permit him to, but eventually chose economics. He met Charles Thompson, an anthropology student and the future Pixies frontman, after he heard Thompson and his roommate playing their guitars.  Santiago rushed home to collect his guitar, and was soon playing \\"non-blues-scale, non-cover-song rock\\" with Thompson.Santiago and Thompson shared a room at the start of the second semester. Santiago soon introduced his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: \\"Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm.

Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

Article: A woman's three-year battle with a government department has ended with a conviction, a fine and the death of a \\"lucky\\" 5000 fish.      The Asian arowana, considered in some Asian cultures to bring good luck, was seized by federal environment department officers from a Mount Gravatt pet shop in November 2011.      An Asian arowana fish.      It was then euthanised after a veterinary officer using a scanner failed to detect a microchip, which is usually present in Asian arowanas farmed overseas.      It was only after the fish was dead that the microchip was found.      Authorities suspected that the native South-East Asian specimen was brought in from overseas because they were not aware of Asian arowanas being bred in captivity in Australia.      Asian arowanas are considered threatened and are listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Trading the animal is banned unless there are exceptional circumstances.      Advertisement      In Australia, it is illegal to own an Asian arowana unless it is legally imported.      When officers grilled then Pet City Mount Gravatt aquarium manager Kelly Hsu, she said the fish was purchased for 5000 from a local supplier named \\"Justin Smith\\" who bred the animals in Australia.      However it later emerged that Mr Smith did not exist.      Ms Hsu, a US citizen in her mid-30s who holds science and arts degrees, was charged with breaches of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.      She pleaded guilty to possessing an endangered animal in the Brisbane Magistrates Court in May this year. But the federal environment department, not wanting to let her off the hook, appealed      Representatives argued the 500 fine and the lack of conviction was \\"manifestly inadequate\\".      In his findings handed down on September 29, District Court Judge William Everson agreed, fining Ms Hsu 800 and recording a conviction.      \\"The offence, whilst not overly serious, is far from trivial,\\" he said.      Judge Everson said the penalty needed to deter people \\"committing offences involving the commercial trade in endangered wildlife\\". ||||| Two men have been put on probation and ordered to pay fines after pleading guilty in San Diego federal court to a scheme to smuggle endangered Asian fish into the U.S. for sale.      Michael Loo of San Diego was sentenced to three years' probation and a 1,000 fine. Kiem Tran of Westminster was sentenced to two years' probation and a 1,000 fine.      The two were part of a scheme to smuggle the endangered Asian arowana fish, according to prosecutors.      The plan was discovered when Loo put an ad on Craigslist offering to sell one of the fish for 2,800. An undercover federal agent answered the ad, prosecutors said.      U.S. Fish and Wildlife agents seized 13 of the fish, which are found in the rivers of Southeast Asia and have long been on an international list of restricted species.      Known as \\"bonytongue\\" or \\"dragon fish,\\" the arowana can grow to 3 feet in length. Folk wisdom holds that they can bring luck, prosperity and long life to anyone who possesses one.      Tran owns Fish Warehouse in Westminster.      Loo pleaded guilty to the lawful sale of restricted fish; Tran to transporting merchandise illegally imported into the U.S.      The fish have been given to SeaWorld San Diego and the San Diego Zoo. ||||| The Dragon Behind the Glass CHAPTER ONE The Pet DetectiveNEW YORKOn a freezing Tuesday in March 2009, my alarm blared at 4:00 a.m. By 6:45, I stood shivering outside a housing project in the South Bronx with Lieutenant John Fitzpatrick and three junior officers, fresh-faced graduates of the Academy. The entire scene was gray—the potholed roads, the sooty snow, the late-winter sky—except the officers themselves, who provided the only glimmer of green. Rather than standard NYPD issue, they wore olive uniforms and trooper hats, à la Ranger Smith from The Yogi Bear Show. As they crunched across the unshoveled walkway, a passing teenage girl wisecracked, “Ain’t you supposed to be in the forest?”Fitzpatrick, who had been patrolling the same beat since 1996, ignored her, keeping his eyes trained on one of the brick high-rises lined up like dominoes. As a cop (of sorts) from Brooklyn, descended from a clan of cops from Brooklyn, he looked the part, a towering man of forty-one with a crew cut and dimpled chin. Tucked under his arm was a file containing a photograph of the suspect he was after—someone he believed could be armed and dangerous. Inside, the building’s lobby was dimly lit and gloomy. The elevator clattered open, and we crowded in, squeaking up to the eighth floor, where the officers’ boots echoed down the long hall before halting outside one apartment. Fitzpatrick pounded on the door. After half a minute passed and nothing happened, he raised his fist again, pounding harder and longer. A baby cried down the hall. At last, a male voice, gravelly with sleep, croaked, “Who is it?”“State Environmental Police,” Fitzpatrick announced.“Who?” said the voice, sounding genuinely confused.The door cracked open to reveal a stocky young man with full-sleeve tattoos wearing flannel pajama bottoms, his eyes squinting against the light. His name was Jason Cruz. Asked if he knew what brought the officers to his door, he shook his head no and said, “I don’t at all.”“We’re here,” Fitzpatrick enlightened him, “because of the alligator that you were offering to sell on Craigslist.”• • •I WAS REPORTING a story about exotic pets for a science program on NPR, and it had taken me six months to get permission to join Fitzpatrick, a detective with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, on one of his busts. When I’d first called him the previous summer, I’d found him brimming with bizarre tales from an urban bestiary. During his time policing the city’s illegal wildlife trade, he had encountered everything from gorilla-hand ashtrays to twelve hundred turtles crammed into a swank Tribeca loft, their owner left with no room for a bed. There was the Harlem man who kept Ming the tiger and Al the alligator in the apartment where his mother was raising eight small children; the wealthy Brooklyn family who treated their African Diana monkey, one of the rarest primate species on earth, like a second daughter—even threatening to barricade their home if marshals tried to take her away; and the proprietor of a popular curio store in SoHo who landed in prison for selling not only a chimpanzee skeleton and walrus tusks but also human body parts. From time to time, a notorious dealer called Mr. Anything Man surfaced in his jalopy advertising exotic live animals, dead or alive.Anything. It’s the theme of the city’s wildlife trade. Sure enough, when Fitzpatrick asked the pajama-clad Cruz how he came by the alligator he’d been trying to sell, Cruz shrugged and said, “This is the Bronx. You can get anything.”Inside his apartment, which was small and tidy with a black leather couch, flatscreen TV, and mirrored photograph of the Manhattan skyline, a dog barked from the bathroom. Birds tweeted in the kitchen. Fitzpatrick walked over to a trio of tanks and inspected a leopard gecko in one and, in the other, a teaspoon-size baby Nile monitor—a yellow-striped lizard with a blue, forked tongue fond of devouring cats when full grown. The third tank was empty, except for a few inches of stagnant water, which Fitzpatrick leaned in to sniff suspiciously. “So where is the alligator now?” he asked.“I gave it back,” Cruz said, claiming he’d bought the reptile from a stranger outside PetSmart on Pelham Parkway. Though it was only a foot long, his girlfriend had pointed out its likelihood of enlarging and insisted that it had to go for the sake of their two-year-old daughter. After this ultimatum, Cruz said he tried to unload the gator online, but Craigslist flagged the ad; so he returned it to the dealer who sold it to him in the first place. “He was a Puerto Rican dude,” he offered.Fitzpatrick jotted this on a notepad. “Now it’s down to just a few million people in the Bronx,” he said drily.I was as disappointed as Fitzpatrick to have narrowly missed the alligator. I’d been hoping for a scene like the time he taped up the snout of a three-foot-long caiman and drove it thrashing in his front passenger seat to the Bronx Zoo. What’s more, Cruz didn’t live up to Fitzpatrick’s billing of the typical alligator aficionado as an exemplar of machismo and aggression. Pet alligators were supposed to be particularly hot among gang members and drug dealers, but Cruz didn’t seem like either. Before his daughter was born, he used to keep pit bulls, as evidenced by black leather harnesses with metal studs hanging from the wall; but the dog barking in the bathroom turned out to be a poodle.“You can really get in trouble over, like, an alligator?” Cruz asked Fitzpatrick, still bewildered by what was happening.His pregnant girlfriend, who had emerged from the bedroom, yawning and looking unamused, added, “There’s a lot of people that sell alligators.”“It’s a criminal offense,” Fitzpatrick told them, explaining that New York State prohibits the commercial sale of live crocodilians, while the city goes further, banning just about every exotic pet from scorpions to ferrets to polar bears. The Nile monitor was illegal too and would have to be seized. Cruz looked crestfallen as his girlfriend found an empty shoebox, into which he gingerly lifted the tiny lizard, wrapping it in a T-shirt to protect it from the cold.“There’s not many animals you can keep here,” Fitzpatrick advised him, “except a dog, cat, goldfish, canary—”“I got like twenty lovebirds!” Cruz exclaimed.In the kitchen, Fitzpatrick inspected the stacked cages of small, green parrots with yellow chests and red beaks, deeming them permissible.“If I didn’t have kids or nothing, I would’ve had cobras here, vipers, all types of stuff,” Cruz said wistfully, explaining that he had loved animals since he was a child, particularly after escaping the Bronx to visit his aunt in Florida where alligators sunned themselves in the backyard and took dips in the swimming pool. While waiting for the officers to write up a court summons, he called his mother and told her that he was going to be on Animal Planet. “NPR,” I mouthed, then frowned, recalling how my producer had requested high drama—something along the lines of a wildebeest in Queens.After hanging up, Cruz turned to me and grew philosophical: “You know what it is? You like animals, and you get tired of seeing the same animals over and over. You go to the pet store, and they have this and that—and you know everybody’s got it. So you try to get something different.”“Honestly, that’s part of the problem,” Fitzpatrick said as he handed over the summons. “Then you get into endangered species.”But Cruz, marveling at how easily he could acquire a fifteen-foot anaconda rumored to be for sale, didn’t seem to hear.• • •MORE EXOTIC ANIMALS are believed to live in American homes than in American zoos. Yet the desire of someone like Cruz to keep an alligator in his living room defies classic theories of pet-keeping, which hold that humans keep pets for unconditional love, for example, or because a misdirected cute response (the scientific term) compels us to care for other species the way we do our own offspring. Alligators are neither affectionate nor cute, at least not in the sense of being cuddly and having large eyes, a round face, and an oversize head like a human infant or a pug dog. Rather, the appeal seems to lie in the opposite direction—the alligator’s ferocity, its wild and untamable nature.In a way, what Cruz had assembled in his Bronx apartment could be seen as having a long historical precedent. It was a menagerie, a collection of exotic creatures kept in captivity for exhibition. Menageries first appeared with the advent of urbanization, when contact with wild animals became rare, and the keeping of exotics was almost exclusively the privilege of royalty and nobility. Mesopotamian kings, who received foreign beasts as tribute, created elaborate gardens to house them called paradeisoi, later to serve as the model for the biblical Garden of Eden. Egyptian pharaohs collected baboons, hippos, and elephants from sub-Saharan Africa and had them mummified to take into the afterlife. In the classical world, the Greeks brought back wild animals from military expeditions, a tradition their Roman conquerors continued, slaughtering the beasts in public arenas, a popular entertainment for nearly five hundred years. The Tower of London gained its famed royal menagerie in 1204. Across the Atlantic, Lord Moctezuma dazzled the first conquistadores with his magnificent pleasure gardens, replete with rare aquatic birds and wildcats tended by their own physicians. With the European discovery of the New World, the desire to own exotic animals intensified, and the Renaissance saw the invention of the private “cabinet of curiosities.” By the eighteenth century, the aristocracy was clamoring for monkeys and parrots as novel playthings.The human species is unique in its compulsion to tame and nurture nearly all other vertebrate animals. In his 1984 classic, Dominance & Affection: The Making of Pets, the cultural geographer Yi-Fu Tuan characterizes this proclivity as an exercise in power—a kind of playful domination stemming from our desire to control the unpredictable forces of nature. According to Tuan, the keeping of pets reflects our hunger for status symbols, for what the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called the “carnal, clinging, humble, organic, milky taste of the creature,” which underlies all luxury goods.The modern pet shop first appeared in American cities in the 1890s; and with it began the mass importation of exotic animals from Asia and South America. Pet-keeping in the United States exploded in the economic boom following World War II and, since the 1970s, has more than tripled. For the first time in history, more American households have pets than don’t, including some 86 million cats and 78 million dogs. But no one knows how many “exotics” there are, not least because no one agrees how to define an exotic pet. Does a native but wild animal like a skunk count? What about a potbellied pig? Further complicating matters, much of the trade operates underground, flouting state and federal laws.In the 1980s, wild birds comprised the hottest segment of the black market. Next to take off was the “herp trade,” short for herpetoculture, which is the keeping of reptiles and amphibians such as turtles, lizards, and salamanders. “That’s where you have the big-buck items,” Fitzpatrick told me. He described how he once went undercover posing as a reptile collector to buy a critically endangered 18,000 radiated tortoise from Madagascar with a brilliant star pattern on its shell. As he was making the purchase, the dealer showed him a picture of a one-of-a-kind turtle—an albino river cooter, its entire body a pale jade white—and said he’d been offered 101,000 for the animal but was holding out for more.On that occasion, wary of being searched, Fitzpatrick had slipped his gun into a drawer in another room, and when his backup team was delayed, he began to sweat. Though the dealer didn’t resist arrest, high-stakes turtle trafficking can be tied up with all sorts of unsavory behavior. Interpol warns that organized-crime networks use the same routes to smuggle animals as they do weapons, drugs, and people—that environmental crime goes hand in hand with corruption, money laundering, even murder.• • •IT WAS FITZPATRICK who first told me about the Asian arowana. At the time, I still thought of pet fish as one step up from potted plants. Had someone informed me that fish comprise the vast majority of exotic pets—that they are the most common pet, period, with more than 100 million swimming in aquariums across the United States—I would not have cared one bit. If there was anything appealing about them, it was their comic irrelevancy and their association with childhood.When I was little, my parents got a tank of goldfish as a sorry substitute for a dog or cat. One day when I was about six, I noticed bubbles escaping from the fish’s puckering mouths and wondered if they were talking to each other. Retrieving my Fisher-Price stethoscope, I pushed a chair next to the aquarium and climbed up to listen for tiny voices rising from the water’s surface. All I heard was silence. After that, I ignored them, and they continued to ignore me.Not everyone, however, shared my dispassion. “One thing we deal with here in the city is a fish,” Fitzpatrick told me. “Arowana.” I misheard this as “marijuana,” and the association proved surprisingly apt. Protected by the Endangered Species Act, the Asian arowana cannot legally be brought into the United States as a pet. Yet trafficking is rampant across the country. Fitzpatrick recounted a bust at a dingy Brooklyn sweatshop, where women sat hunched over sewing machines, scraps of fabric strewn about the floor—a front for running fish. Another time, acting on a tip, he caught a Malaysian-born Queens man smuggling arowana through JFK Airport in water-filled baggies packed in a suitcase. Fitzpatrick noted that even the cheapest specimens sold for thousands of dollars, and prices went up from there, depending on coloration, the most desirable being red. “In certain Asian populations the arowana is considered good luck or a sign of prosperity or a status symbol,” he explained. “And it’s something that’s been overharvested for the pet trade for those reasons.”The obsession with the fish, however, wasn’t limited to Asian cultures. There was, for example, the Wall Street banker who broke down crying after he was arrested for possession of the species, confessing he couldn’t resist its dark-alley appeal. “In recent years, we’ve seen more cases involving non-Asians—white people,” Fitzpatrick said. The previous summer, two Long Island men had been caught at the Canadian border, driving back from Montreal with four specimens swimming in the spare-tire well of their SUV. Then a young man was busted running arowana from his family’s home in the suburbs. Fitzpatrick theorized that selling black-market fish was considered safer than dealing in other high-value contraband such as drugs and guns—especially in New York, where just twenty environmental conservation officers cover the same territory as some thirty-four thousand NYPD.The way he saw it, wildlife traffickers were motivated by pure greed, participating in what may well be the world’s most profitable form of illegal trade. But the collectors were driven by a passion he found easier to relate to. “I think that a lot of the people who have these animals are interested in nature, and that, in and of itself, is not a bad thing,” he said. “It’s just they’re going about it the wrong way.”As a young graduate student in biology, Fitzpatrick had spent two months studying birds in the jungles of Venezuela, where he lost thirty pounds, grew “a full Grizzly Adams beard,” and got all sorts of weird skin infections before realizing he was really a city person. He still loved tropical animals—from afar. His only pet was a pint-size Maltese with a name he refused to disclose. “Like Snowball?” I asked.“Something along those lines,” he said.“Flufferbutter?”“You get the picture.”• • •THAT EVENING AFTER I got home, I looked up the Asian arowana to see what more I could find. Fitzpatrick had mentioned that the species was officially called the Asian bonytongue—“very unsexy name”—for a long bone of a tongue, bristling with prickly, pinlike teeth, which the fish uses to seize and crush prey against teeth on the roof of its mouth. The bonytongues, I learned, are among the most ancient living fish on earth. The oldest fossils date to the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous and reveal giant creatures with ferocious fangs that roamed the prehistoric seas, preying on ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. Today the family Osteoglossidae (from the Greek osteo meaning “bone,” and gloss meaning “tongue”) no longer inhabits the oceans but rather the rivers and lakes of the earth’s tropical midsection, where it traditionally includes one of the largest of all freshwater fish: the Amazonian arapaima, which can grow nearly fifteen feet long and weigh some 450 pounds. With the exception of this giant, the rest of the family—all long, thin creatures armored in a mosaic of large, heavy scales—are commonly known as arowanas.The most formidable among them (or at least the most acrobatic) is the South American silver arowana, also known as the water monkey for its ability to leap six feet into the air to snatch bugs, birds, snakes, and bats from overhanging branches. (Do not google arowana eats duckling.) In 2008, when a New Jersey man reached into a tank at Camden’s Adventure Aquarium to touch a silver arowana, the fish tried to make a meal of his hand. In his subsequent lawsuit, the victim alleged “painful bodily injuries” and that his three-year-old son suffered “severe emotional distress, headaches, nausea, long continued mental disturbance and repeated hysterical attacks” after witnessing the incident.Despite or perhaps because of its ferocity, the silver arowana is a popular pet in the United States—and a perfectly legal one—with young fry selling for as little as 30 to 50 apiece. In all, there are seven recognized arowana species (with three more disputed among scientists) in South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Australia. Only the Asian variety is banned in the United States.Overseas, however, the Asian arowana is an openly coveted commodity in a legitimate luxury market. “Forget oil and diamonds, the next big thing in Southeast Asia is fish,” I read in the hobbyist magazine Practical Fishkeeping, which described how fifty specimens collectively valued at a million dollars had been placed under twenty-four-hour guard in Jakarta, Indonesia. “While these fish may be disappearing in the wild, their popularity amongst Asia’s richest is ever increasing.”In some instances, the species was reared on farms that could pass as prisons—facilities protected by nested walls, watchtowers, and rottweilers that prowled the perimeters at night. The reason for the heavy security became clear as I dug deeper into an international news archive that chronicled a spate of fish thefts across Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, five arowana stolen from a woman’s house were worth more than all her other possessions combined. Singapore, which boasts one of the lowest crime rates in the world, once reported four such heists in a single week. One thief punched out an elderly woman who chased him as he made off with her prized fish in a sloshing bucket. He was sentenced to three years in prison and twelve strokes of a wet cane.As for who was taking the fish, some surmised that the thieves were fish lovers who could not afford the astronomical prices. Others suspected that a crime syndicate was behind the thefts—a sort of shadowy “fish mafia.” Bolstering this theory was a harrowing case in Indonesia, where an arowana dealer and his heavily armed cronies allegedly kidnapped and held for ransom a Japanese buyer.Despite all this criminality, however, the trade in the farmed fish was legal not only in Asia but throughout most of the world, including Canada and Europe—the one major exception (other than the United States) being Australia, which bans the species to protect its own tropical fauna. A few years back, a forty-five-year-old housewife was arrested at the Melbourne Airport trying to enter the country with fifty-one fish, including an Asian arowana, hidden beneath her poufy skirt. “We became suspicious after hearing these flipping and flapping noises,” a customs official later told the press.Such absurd tales of smuggling kept me up late as I poured through the hundred-some articles I’d printed out and spread across my living room floor. The picture that gradually emerged, however, looked less like the illegal drug trade and more like a parody of Manhattan’s overheated art scene, complete with record-breaking prices, anonymous buyers, stolen specimens, unsavory dealers, and even clever fakes. Whatever the best metaphor, it seemed the Asian arowana had a long history of driving human beings to dangerous extremes.One summer in college, I’d read Jane Goodall’s In the Shadow of Man, and ever since, I’d dreamed of venturing into the jungle to write a great story about wildlife. Around the time my curiosity in the arowana began, I’d been awarded a fellowship intended to fund a reporting project abroad. Now I knew how I’d use it: I would go see for myself where all these smuggled arowana were coming from and what made the species so irresistible. Goodall had her noble, tool-wielding primates—I would have a bad-tempered, bony-tongued fish.It was obvious where to start. At the center of the glamorous world of Southeast Asian aquaculture reigned a flamboyant Singaporean tastemaker known as Kenny the Fish, a chain-smoking millionaire fond of posing nude behind strategically placed aquatic pets. The Fish’s real name was Kenny Yap, and he was the executive chairman of an ornamental-fish farm so lucrative that it was listed on Singapore’s main stock exchange. Recently, the Singaporean press had dubbed him one of the city’s most eligible bachelors and called for him to host a national spin-off of Donald Trump’s reality show, The Apprentice. To enter his website, I had to click on his belly button.I’ve since come to think of this navel as the rabbit hole into which I fell, not to emerge for some three and a half years. ||||| One January evening as the tepid winter heat was beginning to subside across Singapore, a stranger walked into the Lam Hong Aquarium Shop. The owner, a bespectacled woman named Tay Chai Eng, knew most of her patrons, but she had never seen this man before. He was in his early thirties—young enough to be her son—and carrying a bucket of water. He was also concealing a six-inch knife.      The moment Tay turned her back, the man plunged his hand into a tank, then raced out the door and into the parking lot. The older woman took off in frantic pursuit, catching the thief and latching onto his free arm like a barnacle. He dropped the bucket to punch her. It was just what she wanted—not the broken glasses or sliced cheek, but the five tiny young fish that spilled onto the asphalt, glinting like gold in the low rays of the sun.      These were Asian arowana, the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. In Chinese, they’re known as lóng yú, the dragon fish. Four of them died that day. The one that survived is now two feet long, its sinuous body plated with large scales as shiny and round as coins. A pair of whiskers juts from its lower lip, and two gauzy pectoral fins extend from its sides, suggesting a dragon in flight. This resemblance has led to the belief that the species brings prosperity and good fortune, that it will even commit suicide by jumping out of its tank to prevent the death of its owner. Across Asia, tycoons boast of dropping six figures on the finest specimens. In the United States, the fish is protected by the Endangered Species Act—though a thriving black market persists. One Wall Street banker wept when authorities confiscated his illegal fish.      How did a primitive predator from the swamps of Southeast Asia become such a coveted commodity? When I first began researching the fish, I expected to hear much about feng shui. I did. Ultimately, however, my reporting pointed me toward a more surprising story—the history of the species as a test case in conservation. In the mid-’70s, when the Asian arowana was still eaten more often than kept as a pet, its population was found to be declining due to overfishing and habitat loss. Consequently, the fish landed on the first Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Today CITES is one of the largest conservation agreements in the world, regulating the movement of some 35,000 species across the borders of 186 member states. The animals and plants on Appendix I are considered the rarest of the rare and generally banned from international trade. In the case of the Asian arowana, however, the listing seemed to backfire, propelling the species into the spotlight as a limited edition.      Paradoxically, “declaring a species endangered may make it more desirable and thereby increase the likelihood of exploitation,” according to a study led by French conservation biologist Franck Courchamp, who elsewhere has pointed to the example of rhinos: After rhinos were moved to Appendix I, the value of their horn quadrupled in Korea, which led to a sharp spike in poaching. A similar phenomenon afflicts reptiles and amphibians in the exotic pet trade, where animals listed on CITES fetch a premium price.      Economic theory has long held that trade alone is unlikely to drive a species to extinction, because of the rising cost of finding the last individuals of a dwindling population. Courchamp, however, proposes a new model that integrates a basic facet of human behavior well-known to economists since Adam Smith—the “paradox of value,” otherwise known as the “water and diamonds paradox.” While water has tremendous practical value, it’s worth nothing in exchange. Rare animals are the opposite, like diamonds. Their inflated value drives their exploitation, causing them to become ever rarer and hence more desirable until they’re sucked into an “extinction vortex.”      One solution is to scrub species of the sheen of rarity, scrapping bans in favor of sustainable trade. This approach produced one of the greatest conservation success stories of the 20th century: the resurrection of crocodilians, which were rescued from the brink through ranching programs in which eggs are collected from the wild and reared in captivity for skins. Some biologists such as Courchamp argue that this model is the best way to save rhinos whose horns could be harvested like wool. Others warn that for ranching to work as a conservation tool it must place a value on the preservation of wild populations. Without that link, we’re likely to be left with an oxymoron like the Asian arowana: a mass-produced endangered species. Bred by the hundreds of thousands on high-security farms protected by nested walls, barbed wire, and rottweilers that prowl the perimeters at night, the fish has all but disappeared from nature.

It was only after the fish was dead that the microchip was found. The fish's owner, Kelly Hsu, claimed to have purchased the fish for 5,000 from a local supplier, but as Asian arowanas are considered threatened and listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, trading the fish is banned unless under exceptional circumstances. Hsu pleaded guilty to possessing an endangered animal and was subsequently fined 800."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He is studying atoms and discovers that the electrons that are farther away from the nucleus are moving less. or more? The answer is:","output":"More. Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking whether the electrons farther away from the nucleus of an atom are moving less or more compared to the electrons closer to the nucleus. Step 2: Recall the relationship between electron energy levels and distance from the nucleus As the distance from the nucleus increases, the electron energy levels also increase. This means that electrons occupying higher (farther) energy levels have more energy than those in lower (closer) energy levels. Step 3: Relate electron energy to electron movement Electron energy is directly related to the movement of electrons. With higher energy, electrons are likely to move more. In contrast, electrons with lower energy tend to move less. Step 4: Apply the knowledge to the given scenario In Lonnie's observations, the electrons farther from the nucleus are situated in higher energy levels. Based on the relationship between electron energy and electron movement, these electrons should be moving more compared to the electrons closer to the nucleus.

It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

An annual footrace named the Gate River Run accepts 18,000 participants who travel a course along and over the river twice. The largest kingfishing tournament in the U.S. is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus) and Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri). The home stadium for the Jacksonville Jaguars faces the river, as does most of the commercial center of downtown. Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.Tides cause seawater to enter the mouth of the St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.Although freshwater invertebrates inhabiting and comprising algae and periphyton make the foundation of food webs in the middle and lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat.

Betty (Beatrice Manowski), Rob's ex-girlfriend from the previous film, is then briefly introduced as she discovers, to her disappointment, that Rob's grave has already been robbed. Monika fails to have an orgasm and the sex scene ends with her running to the bathroom. She is disgusted, and about to vomit.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through the stomates by diffusion - Water is transported to the leaves in the xylem - Energy harvested through light reaction is stored by forming ATP - Carbon dioxide and energy from ATP are used to create sugar - Oxygen exits the leaves through the stomata by diffusion - The plant reuses the water or the water exits through the stomata as water vapor.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose humans were unable to get oxygen from plants to produce carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect More carbon dioxide is released into the air.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Step-by-step breakdown of the effects: 1. If humans were unable to get oxygen from plants and produce carbon dioxide, the overall concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would be affected. This would result in an imbalance between carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere. 2. As a direct effect, higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to increased absorption of CO2 by plants through the stomata in the leaves. This may actually improve the rate of photosynthesis in the short term, as higher CO2 levels are known to boost plant growth. 3. However, the indirect effect of this perturbation involves the reduced availability of oxygen necessary for human life. This would negatively impact humans and other oxygen-dependent organisms, ultimately affecting the entire food chain and ecosystem. 4. Moreover, another indirect effect is the potential exacerbation of climate change, as higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming. This can cause increased temperatures, extreme weather events, and other negative impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. In summary, the proposed perturbation of humans not being able to produce carbon dioxide from oxygen derived from plants would directly affect the photosynthesis process by increasing the amount of CO2 absorbed by plants. However, the numerous indirect effects, such as the reduced availability of oxygen for humans and other organisms as well as the exacerbation of climate change, could have significant negative implications on the ecosystems and the planet as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Milk is such a presence in our lives we probably take it for granted. Thank goodness, then, for today, World Milk Day — one of those weird food holidays which are sometimes invented by interest groups to push a certain product. Regardless of the so-called holiday's origins, let’s take this opportunity to delve into some of the ways people appreciate milk in their daily lives.      The Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy conducted a survey of more than 1,000 adults 18 and over in April of this year. They uncovered some shocking facts about how people think about – and drink – milk.      First off, 48% of respondents said that they aren’t sure where chocolate milk comes from. Um, guys, it comes from cows – and not just the brown kind.      Still, 7% of people – and remember, this survey talked to actual, grown-up adults – still think that chocolate milk only comes from brown cows. Actually, chocolate milk gets its flavor and color from cocoa beans.      Now that you know what milk-myths are still floating around out there, what about the ways people drink their milk?      A fair chunk of people are still hanging on to their taboo kitchen habits: 37% secretly drink milk straight out of the container, while another 29% use their kids as an excuse to buy chocolate milk for themselves.      And despite the fact that healthy lifestyle diets are all the rage right now, only 5% of people abstain from drinking milk altogether, making it a continued staple in most people’s homes.      In fact, it seems to still be one of America’s favorite beverages: One quarter of participants reported taking a trip to the grocery store before 6 in the morning just to buy milk.      We just can’t seem to escape dairy in any of its forms: An additional 95% of people surveyed currently have some type of cheese in their refrigerator.      So there you have it. Even though an unfortunate number of people can't seem to figure out where it comes from, milk is still beloved by Americans. ||||| Seven percent of American adults believe chocolate milk comes from brown cows, according to a recent online survey commissioned by the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy. Here are a few other things Americans get wrong. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)      Seven percent of all American adults believe that chocolate milk comes from brown cows, according to a nationally representative online survey commissioned by the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy.      If you do the math, that works out to 16.4 million misinformed, milk-drinking people. The equivalent of the population of Pennsylvania (and then some!) does not know that chocolate milk is milk, cocoa and sugar.      But while the survey has attracted snorts and jeers from some corners — “um, guys, [milk] comes from cows — and not just the brown kind,” snarked Food & Wine — the most surprising thing about this figure may actually be that it isn’t higher.      For decades, observers in agriculture, nutrition and education have griped that many Americans are basically agriculturally illiterate. They don’t know where food is grown, how it gets to stores — or even, in the case of chocolate milk, what’s in it.      One Department of Agriculture study, commissioned in the early ’90s, found that nearly 1 in 5 adults did not know that hamburgers are made from beef. Many more lacked familiarity with basic farming facts, like how big U.S. farms typically are and what food animals eat.      Experts in ag education aren’t convinced that much has changed in the intervening decades.      “At the end of the day, it’s an exposure issue,” said Cecily Upton, co-founder of the nonprofit FoodCorps, which brings agricultural and nutrition education into elementary schools. “Right now, we’re conditioned to think that if you need food, you go to the store. Nothing in our educational framework teaches kids where food comes from before that point.”      Upton and other educators are quick to caution that these conclusions don’t apply across the board. Studies have shown that people who live in agricultural communities tend to know a bit more about where their food comes from, as do people with higher education levels and household incomes.      But in some populations, confusion about basic food facts can skew pretty high. When one team of researchers interviewed fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders at an urban California school, they found that more than half of them didn’t know pickles were cucumbers, or that onions and lettuce were plants. Four in 10 didn’t know that hamburgers came from cows. And 3 in 10 didn’t know that cheese is made from milk.      “All informants recalled the names of common foods in raw form and most knew foods were grown on farms or in gardens,” the researchers concluded. “They did not, however, possess schema necessary to articulate an understanding of post-production activities nor the agricultural crop origin of common foods.”      In some ways, this ignorance is perfectly logical. The writer and historian Ann Vileisis has argued that it developed in lockstep with the industrial food system.      As more Americans moved into cities in the mid-1800s, she writes in the book “Kitchen Literacy,” fewer were involved in food production or processing. That trend was exacerbated by innovations in transportation and manufacturing that made it possible to ship foods in different forms, and over great distances.      By the time uniformity, hygiene and brand loyalty became modern ideals — the latter frequently encouraged by emerging food companies in well-funded ad campaigns — many Americans couldn’t imagine the origins of the boxed cereals or shrink-wrapped hot dogs in their kitchens.      Today, many Americans only experience food as an industrial product that doesn’t look much like the original animal or plant: The USDA says orange juice is the most popular “fruit” in America, and processed potatoes — in the form of french fries and chips — rank among the top vegetables.      “Indifference about the origins and production of foods became a norm of urban culture, laying the groundwork for a modern food sensibility that would spread all across America in the decades that followed,” Vileisis wrote, of the 20th century. “Within a relatively brief period, the average distance from farm to kitchen had grown from a short walk down the garden path to a convoluted, 1,500-mile energy-guzzling journey by rail and truck.”      The past 20 years have seen the birth of a movement to reverse this gap, with agriculture and nutrition groups working to get ag education back into classrooms.      Aside from FoodCorps, which worked with slightly more than 100,000 students this year, groups like the National Agriculture in the Classroom Organization and the American Farm Bureau Foundation are actively working with K-12 teachers across the country to add nutrition, farm technology and agricultural economics to lessons in social studies, science and health. The USDA Farm to School program, which awarded 5 million in grants for the 2017-2018 school year on Monday, also funds projects on agriculture education.      For National Dairy Month, which is June, NACO has been featuring a kindergarten-level lesson on dairy. Among its main takeaways: milk — plain, unflavored, boring white milk — comes from cows, not the grocery case.      Nutritionists and food-system reformers say these basic lessons are critical to raising kids who know how to eat healthfully — an important aid to tackling heart disease and obesity.      Meanwhile, farm groups argue the lack of basic food knowledge can lead to poor policy decisions.      A 2012 white paper from the National Institute for Animal Agriculture blamed consumers for what it considers bad farm regulations: “One factor driving today’s regulatory environment ... is pressure applied by consumers, the authors wrote. “Unfortunately, a majority of today’s consumers are at least three generations removed from agriculture, are not literate about where food comes from and how it is produced.”      Upton, of FoodCorps, said everyone could benefit from a better understanding of agriculture.      “We still get kids who are surprised that a french fry comes from a potato, or that a pickle is a cucumber,” she said. “... Knowledge is power. Without it, we can’t make informed decisions.”      Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that the survey in question was commissioned by the National Dairy Council. It was actually commissioned by the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy, its sister organization.      Read more:      What is “natural food”? Even the people who make it aren't sure.

Paragraph :  If blood volume in the body decreases, blood pressure decreases. A:","output":"If Jim experiences a significant amount of blood loss from a cut he sustains, his blood pressure will become lower. According to the information provided in the paragraph, a decrease in blood volume within the body will lead to a decrease in blood pressure. Blood volume and blood pressure are directly proportional to each other; when one decreases, so does the other. Blood pressure is the force exerted by the blood against the walls of blood vessels. It is necessary to maintain a certain level of blood pressure to ensure that blood can circulate effectively throughout the body, delivering essential oxygen and nutrients to the cells. When blood volume decreases due to blood loss, there is less force exerted against the blood vessels, resulting in lower blood pressure. The body has various mechanisms to try to compensate for this drop in blood pressure, such as increasing the heart rate or constricting blood vessels, to get the blood pressure back to a normal range and maintain proper blood flow to vital organs. However, if the blood loss is too severe, the body may not be able to adequately compensate, which can lead to shock and potentially life-threatening complications. In Jim's case, if the blood loss is substantial and his body cannot effectively respond, his blood pressure would indeed become lower, and he may require medical attention to prevent further complications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After his death, friends found a detailed suicide note at his office and police discovered a letter with contact numbers in his black Toyota Prius, but the contents of the notes were never made public. ABC News reported that the director was suffering from inoperable brain cancer, though there were no public reports of health problems. On Monday, chief coroner spokesman Craig Harvey said Scott had no underlying health problems and there was “no anatomic evidence of neoplasia [cancer] identified.” The results of the coroner’s autopsy will not be available for two more weeks.      Scott, who was known for his trademark red baseball cap, and his 74-year-old brother, Prometheus director Ridley Scott, had been producing the hit CBS drama The Good Wife at the time of his death. The two men were also working together on Killing Lincoln, based on the bestseller by Bill O’Reilly.      Just two days before he plummeted to his death, Scott had met with Tom Cruise to discuss a sequel to their 1986 hit Top Gun. The men toured the Fallon U.S. Naval Air Station in Nevada, where the real Top-Gun pilots train.      Cruise, who was reportedly devastated by Scott’s death, said at the time in a statement: “Tony was my dear friend and I will really miss him. He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable. My deepest sorrow and thoughts are with his family at this time.”      Around 12:35 p.m. on Aug. 19, Scott drove onto the Vincent Thomas Bridge, which spans the port city of San Pedro and Terminal Island, and parked at the bridge’s highest point, officials said. Witnesses reported that the director got out of his car and climbed the 10-foot fence on the south side of the bridge before plunging 185 feet into the cold murky water below. Los Angeles harbor patrol, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Los Angeles port police were able to pinpoint Scott’s location by using underwater sonar equipment regularly used to find explosives, and after they discovered his sneakers floating in the water.      Scott was no stranger to the Vincent Thomas Bridge, the fourth largest suspension bridge in California. In a 2009 interview with Rotten Tomatoes about his plans to do a remake of Warriors, Scott spoke about why he planned to switch the movie location from New York to Los Angeles. “It’s a city which is horizontal,” he said. “New York is vertical, all skyscrapers, and Los Angeles is horizontal. I’m hoping to get 100,000 real gang members standing on the Vincent Thomas Bridge for one shot.”      Scott had recently finished shooting the drama Out of the Furnace, starring Christian Bale. He had risen to fame after directing his debut film, 1983’s vampire movie The Hunger, starring Catherine Deneuve and rocker David Bowie. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Director Tony Scott had no serious underlying medical conditions, including cancer, at the time of his suicide, according to chief coroner investigator Craig Harvey. Scott's cause of death was determined to be multiple blunt-force injuries after he jumped from the Vincent Thomas Bridge. Toxicology tests showed therapeutic levels of sleep aid Lunestra and anti-depressant Mirtazipine in his system. Despite investigations and interviews with Scott's family, the precise reason for his suicide remains a mystery."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What does Sarah use to pull the cloak off Mater Lachrymarum? Title: Mother of Tears Movie plot: The film begins with members of the Catholic Church digging up the body of a 19th-century church official, whose casket has a box-shaped urn chained to it. Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly. The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an American studying art restoration, works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce, a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator, Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save her boss (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum's familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \\"Mater Lachrymarum\\". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building. Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city. Sarah continues her own research only to be summoned by Michael to his apartment. The witches have kidnapped his young son and won't...

Question: While getting drunk the body can only process so much at a time, go too fast and your belly might just make you what? Options: - getting arrested - throw up - staggering - fall down - explode  Explain why a human would choose \\"throw up\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"throw up\\" to answer the question above because it is the most accurate and biologically plausible response among the given options when considering the effects of alcohol on the human body.  Drinking alcohol introduces it into the bloodstream, which then travels to the liver to be broken down and metabolized. The liver can only process a certain amount of alcohol per hour, and if a person consumes more than the liver can handle, the excess alcohol builds up in the bloodstream, leading to intoxication or even alcohol poisoning. Among the given options, here's a detailed explanation for each: 1. Getting arrested: Consuming alcohol quickly might lead to increased intoxication, which could result in poor decision-making and risky behavior. This increases the likelihood of getting arrested, but getting arrested is not a direct physiological effect of excessive alcohol consumption on the body. 2. Throw up: When alcohol is consumed too quickly, the body may respond by inducing vomiting as a protective mechanism to protect itself from potential harm by expelling the excess content. Throwing up helps to remove some of the unabsorbed alcohol from the stomach and it also serves as a signal to the person to stop drinking. This is the most accurate answer for this question. 3. Staggering: Staggering refers to the loss of balance and coordination that may occur due to alcohol intoxication. While this outcome is a common effect of excessive alcohol consumption, the question implies a more immediate reaction to consuming alcohol too quickly. Staggering is not a direct response to alcohol overwhelming the stomach and liver. 4. Fall down: Falling down is another common effect of excessive alcohol consumption influenced by the central nervous system. However, this is not the most accurate response in this context, as it does not directly refer to the body's inability to process alcohol at a fast rate. 5. Explode: This option is a hyperbolic and unrealistic response. The human body does not explode from consuming too much alcohol too quickly. It is not a valid answer in this context. In conclusion, \\"throw up\\" is the most accurate and biologically plausible answer to this question because it addresses the body's need to protect itself from the harmful effects of excessive alcohol intake. It explains the immediate physiological response to the overconsumption of alcohol that cannot be processed quickly enough by the liver, whereas the other options do not focus on the body's limitations directly or are exaggerated and unrealistic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: - sing - play games - start fighting - fiddle - spread  The answer is \\"sing\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"sing\\" because singing is a direct and natural way for children to express their happiness and emotions. When children are happy, they tend to sing spontaneously, often incorporating their own lyrics or tunes, as a means of sharing and celebrating their joy. Step-by-step justification: 1. Analyze the given options: sing, play games, start fighting, fiddle, spread. 2. Eliminate the options that are not directly related to expressing happiness: start fighting, fiddle, spread. 3. Among the remaining options (sing, play games), singing is the most direct and natural way for children to express happiness as it is an immediate, vocal response that can be done anywhere and anytime. 4. Playing games, while enjoyable, does not inherently imply happiness, as it could also be done to alleviate boredom or to socialize with others. 5.

Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", based on the article. Q: Article: A punctual person is in the habit of doing a thing at the proper time and is never late in keeping an appointment. The unpunctual man, on one hand, never does what he has to do at the proper time. He is always in a hurry and in the end loses both time and his good name. A lost thing may be found again, but lost time can never be regained. Time is more valuable than material things. In fact, time is life itself. The unpunctual man is for ever wasting and mismanaging his most valuable asset   as well as other's. The unpunctual person is always complaining that he finds no time to answer letters, or return calls or keep appointments promptly. But the man who really has a great deal to do is very careful of his time and seldom complains of want of it. He knows that he can not get through his huge amount of work unless he faithfully keeps every piece of work when it has to be attended to. Failure to be punctual in keeping one's appointments is the sign of disrespect towards others. If a person is invited to dinner and arrives later than the appointed time, he keeps all the other guests waiting for him. Usually this will be regarded as a great disrespect to the host and all other guests present. Unpunctuality, moreover, is very harmful when it comes to do one's duty, whether public or private. Imagine how it would be if those who are put in charge of important tasks failed to be at their proper place at the appointed time. A man who is known to be habitually unpunctual is never trusted by his friends or fellow men.   Question: What does the author think is the main difference between a punctual person and an unpunctual person?

Given the question: I have a new situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms.  But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  What is an answer for this question: Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm? The answer is:","output":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm.  The explanation for this answer is based on the background provided and understanding the chain of events related to the usage of fertilizer and its impact on nearby water bodies. It all starts with the amount of fertilizer used by the farmers. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes and, as a result, has increased the amount of fertilizer he uses on his farm. On the other hand, Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. When it rains, the rainwater dissolves the fertilizer in the soil, and the runoff water carries it away, eventually depositing the fertilizer in bodies of water, such as ponds, rivers, and oceans. In this case, Bobby and Kenny's farms have ponds located downstream, which are directly impacted by the fertilizer runoff. The nitrogen content in the fertilizer stimulates the growth of algae in water bodies, causing an algal bloom. The overgrowth of algae is harmful to water ecosystems because it uses up the dissolved oxygen that other aquatic life depends on.  As the algae population increases, they use up more and more carbon dioxide in the water, and after they die, decomposers break down the dead algal tissue. These decomposers consume oxygen during decomposition, creating a dead zone within the water body where nothing can grow due to low levels of oxygen.  Given the background provided, it is clear that Bobby is using more fertilizer on his farm due to the increased demand for potatoes. Consequently, there will be more nitrogen-containing runoff entering the nearby ponds and causing the overgrowth of algae. The higher volume of algae, in turn, will contribute to a greater depletion of oxygen in the water, resulting in larger dead zones in the ponds. On the other hand, Kenny is using less fertilizer since tomatoes are not in season. This means that there would be less runoff carrying nitrogen into the ponds, leading to a smaller growth of algae and therefore smaller impacts on the oxygen levels in the surrounding ponds. In conclusion, based on the quantities of fertilizer used by the farmers and the resulting impact on the algae population and oxygen levels in the nearby ponds, Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

B). no.","output":"B). No. The sentence \\"Predation can be heightened during migration: Eleonora's falcon Falco eleonorae, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young.\\" does not answer the question, \\"What makes birds prone to parasites and pathogens?\\". Rather, the sentence highlights a specific example of increased predation during bird migration. In this case, Eleonora's falcon is using the migration of southbound passerine migrants as a food source for its young during their late breeding season. To answer the question about what makes birds prone to parasites and pathogens, we need to consider several factors that can contribute to their susceptibility: 1. Environmental factors: Birds' susceptibility to parasites and pathogens can be affected by various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and contaminants in water and food sources. For example, higher temperatures and humidity can create favorable conditions for parasite growth and transmission. 2. Migration: During migration, birds face numerous challenges, including long-distance travel, limited food sources, and exposure to new environments with different parasite and pathogen strains. These factors can increase their susceptibility to infection. Additionally, birds often congregate in larger numbers at specific stopover sites during migration, which may facilitate the transmission of parasites and pathogens among individuals. 3. Stress: Birds experience various stressors throughout their lives, including from predation, competition for resources, social interactions, and environmental changes. Stress can weaken a bird's immune system, making it more susceptible to parasites and pathogens. 4. Breeding: Breeding activities, such as nest-building and territorial defense, can increase stress levels and reduce the availability of resources for self-maintenance, leaving birds vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Breeding colonies may also create suitable environments for parasite and pathogen transmission, with many birds in close proximity to each other. 5. Host factors: Birds have evolved various defenses against parasites and pathogens, including immune and physiological responses, as well as behavioral strategies for avoiding infected habitats and conspecifics. However, previous exposure, age, and genetics can influence a bird's susceptibility to infection. For example, young birds with immature immune systems are generally more susceptible to parasites and pathogens than older, more experienced individuals. In conclusion, while the given sentence does not address birds' vulnerability to parasites and pathogens, multiple factors can contribute to their susceptibility, including environmental conditions, migration stressors, and host characteristics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the following context:  The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater (at 152 Bleecker Street, above the Cafe au Go Go) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a \\"gook baby\\".Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? where is the integration center located for most autonomic reflexes?","output":"The integration center for most autonomic reflexes is primarily located within the central nervous system, specifically in the brainstem and spinal cord. These structures are responsible for receiving, processing, and coordinating automatic or involuntary responses to stimuli. Within the brainstem, key components such as the medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain play crucial roles in the regulation of autonomic reflexes. The medulla oblongata, in particular, is responsible for controlling various vital functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. It also houses several important nuclei that regulate autonomic reflexes related to the cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems.  The pons and midbrain contribute to the coordination and control of autonomic reflexes as well. The pons is involved in the regulation of respiratory rhythm, while the midbrain contains regions responsible for controlling eye movement and pupil size, which are also part of the autonomic nervous system. In the spinal cord, a series of sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are organized into segments called the lateral horn. These neurons receive input from various regions of the brain, such as the hypothalamus, and other sensory receptors throughout the body. They subsequently transmit this information to peripheral ganglia by releasing neurotransmitters, ultimately resulting in a coordinated autonomic response. In addition to the brainstem and spinal cord, other structures within the central nervous system are also involved in the regulation of autonomic reflexes. For instance, the hypothalamus is a critical component of the autonomic regulatory system. It maintains homeostasis by integrating sensory information and hormonal signaling to modulate autonomic activities. The hypothalamus regulates various physiological processes, such as body temperature, water balance, and food intake, by influencing both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, regions of the limbic system, like the amygdala and hippocampus, play a role in regulating autonomic reflexes related to emotional processing and memory. For example, the amygdala is directly involved in the \\"fight or flight\\" response, which coordinates a range of autonomic and endocrine responses to perceived threats or stressors. In summary, the integration center for most autonomic reflexes is primarily located within the central nervous system, particularly in the brainstem and spinal cord. Other regions, such as the hypothalamus and limbic system, also contribute to the regulation of autonomic responses. Together, these structures work in concert to maintain the body's homeostasis and enable appropriate responses to various stimuli."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Allan crouched over his desk once more, pen in hand and mind blank. He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago. He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture. He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward. Arthur looked up from the results of a night's frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye. \\"What is this?\\" he queried, indicating the pages he held in his left hand. \\"I decided that… since I wasn't having much success with more – traditional – stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely,\\" Allan replied, somewhat less self-assured than he had been the previous night. \\"What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing,\\" cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice. \\"After all I said the day before, why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self-indulgent fantasy?\\" He shook the papers at Allan, raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son. \\"This is nothing but a glorified Grimm's tale, a miscarried child of Stoker, a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!\\" He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat. \\"Do you hate the modern system of literature? Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare?\\" For a moment, Allan could hardly do more than shake his head. \\"No, of course not… I– \\" \\"Then why,\\" Arthur barreled on, \\"do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble, this morbid, paganistic drivel?

It doesn't matter if you're a tourist or a long-time local, the fountains at Bellagio are a must see.  The show happens every half hour starting at 3pm and and goes well into the evening.  Each half hour has a different song usually something classy (Sinatra), dramatic (Bocelli), romantic (Dion) or fun (Pink Panther).  Each song has it's own special water choreography making use of the entire faux lake in front of Bellagio.  Even though the show starts in the afternoon, you must come back at night.  The lit up water with the backdrop of the strip might be the most beautiful thing you see in Vegas.  For five minutes your mind can take a break from the artificial city and take in this awesome free work of art.  And since Bellagio attracts an international crowd, it's really cool to see people of all walks of life come together to appreciate it.

Article: Andy Steele lives just a few blocks from the campus of Black Hills State University in Spearfish, S.D., so commuting  to class isn't the problem. But he doesn't like lectures much, isn't a morning person, and wants time during the day to restore motorcycles. So Steele, a full-time senior business major, has been taking as many classes as he can from the South Dakota State system's online offerings. He gets better grades and learns more, he says, and insists he isn't missing out on the college experience. \\"I still know a lot of people from my first two years living on campus, and I still meet a lot of people,\\" he says. But now, he sets his own schedule. At least 2.3 million people took some kind of online courses, according to a recent survey by The Sloan Consortium, an online education group, and two-thirds of colleges offering \\"face-to-face\\" courses also offer online ones. But what were once two different types of classes are looking more and more alike and often falling into the same pool of students. At some schools, online courses originally intended for non-traditional students living far from campus have proved surprisingly popular with on-campus students. A recent study found 42 percent of the students enrolled  in its distance education courses were located on campus at the university that was hosting the online courses. Numbers vary depending on the policies of particular colleges, but other schools also have students mixing and matching online and \\"face-to-face\\" credits. Motives range from lifestyle to adapting a job schedule to getting into high--demand courses. Washington State had about 325 on-campus undergraduates taking one or more distance courses last year. As many as 9,000 students took both distance and in-person classes at Arizona State last year. \\"Business is really about providing choices to their customers, and that's really what we want to do,\\" said Sheila Aaker, extended services coordinator   at Black Hills State.

She blu-tacked page threes above her bed-head and had me snap topless Polaroids till they littered the floor. She told me to imagine she had 36DDs and peroxide blonde hair. I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were. Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right. Keith wasn't rolling in spare change so Trisha's step-dad took the Cortina as payment in lieu of her getting herself fixed up. Trisha got me to stash the Cortina up the lane at the back of Boyes' farm. Weekend nights, I drove her out to the dual carriageway truck-stop where she found a faster way to make her fortune in the fogged-up cabs.
