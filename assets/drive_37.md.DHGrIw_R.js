Ben's hand was sore and he had to pull out all of the needles..","output":"2). Ben's hand was sore and he had to pull out all of the needles. As soon as Ben realized what had happened, a sharp, stinging pain surged through his hand. He glanced down and found it covered with tiny cactus needles, some barely visible and others protruding from his skin at various lengths. Panicking, he rushed to the bathroom, trying to minimize the movements of his injured hand to avoid pushing the needles in any deeper. He grabbed a pair of tweezers from the medicine cabinet, gritted his teeth, and began the painstaking process of removing each cactus needle. One by one, he carefully pulled them out, wincing at the soreness and rawness of his hand. He quickly found that keeping the pressure as close to the entry point as possible was the most effective way to remove the needles without causing additional pain or breaking them off in the process. The minutes ticked by as Ben continued to work on his hand, systematically removing the needles. He took a break periodically to wash the affected area, ensuring that no debris or dirt remained. The faucet's cold water also provided some temporary relief from the inflammation and swelling. As the number of needles dwindled, Ben noticed that a few had broken off beneath the skin, leaving only a tiny surface bump as evidence of their presence. Wincing, he took a deep breath and gently used the tweezers' tip to pick at the skin, trying to expose the broken needle fragments. Each time he successfully removed one, he felt a mix of relief and trepidation, knowing that any damage to the skin increased his risk of infection. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Ben removed the last visible cactus needle from his hand. He examined his work, scrutinizing each swollen and punctured area. He cleaned his hand one last time, applying a gentle antiseptic solution before wrapping his hand in a soft, sterile bandage. Over the following days, Ben treated his injury with care, cleaning it regularly and watching for any signs of infection. His hand remained sore and tender, a constant reminder of his encounter with the cactus and a lesson to pay more attention to his surroundings in the future. As the swelling subsided and his hand heal, Ben chalked up the experience as a harsh lesson learned. He moved the cactus to a safer location, ensuring that he would not unintentionally repeat the painful ordeal. From then on, he made a point to be more aware of his surroundings, avoiding any further incidents with the many plants he cherished in his home."},{"instruction":"Кухня в доме и сэкономить еще больше, чем когда вы едите в дешевых ресторанах.

The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on the holiday isle on September 15. A bloodstained garden hoe, believed to be the murder weapon, was found nearby. In the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation into their brutal deaths, police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped saying they were 'confident' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15. The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament. 'Two of the suspects raped and killed Witheridge while another one witnessed the murder,' Pol Lt Gen Panya Mamen, commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8, said yesterday. 'We're confident we have a very high chance of finding the suspects,' the senior police officer said. 'I'm not worried [about high public expectations] because I know how much the probe has been progressing. We just have to follow forensic results.' Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims. Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers. A group of Thai footballers are the latest people to be questioned by police amid fears that the hunt for the killers has stalled. A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police confirmed that DNA samples were taken from 'more than eight' footballers - who reportedly threw a late-night party at the AC nightclub where the victims spent their final hours - and officers were awaiting the results. The amateur footballers were allegedly at the nightclub celebrating the end of a tournament while the British backpackers were there. Police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 - for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits. The murders – and Ms Witheridge's suspected rape – were the work of a group of at least three 'attackers', two of whom are Asian men, police have claimed, citing analysis of DNA and other evidence. Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder. Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth in the early hours of September 15. A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. Police have already said that DNA recovered from her body has shown that two men took advantage of her on the morning of her death. 'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' Her recently-met friend David Miller, 24, from Jersey died when he was attacked after - it is believed - he went to her aid when he found her in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach. The movements of David Miller and Miss Witheridge are not known afterwards though some locals claim to have seen them in a bar arguing with an Asian man. DNA found on a cigarette matches a sample taken from Miss Witheridge and police say they are hoping that matching it with a suspect would 'open the door' to finding who else was involved. 'There is no doubt the murder of Miss Witheridge was sexually motivated because none of her belongings or those of the English man were missing,' said General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Yes, the motivation for the attack is rape.' He said the attackers might have been smoking when they saw Miss Witheridge walking back to her guest house alone along the beach. Miss Witheridge's family said they are 'broken' by her death and revealed several days ago that they have returned to the UK with her body. In a statement, they said: 'As a family we feel enormous relief to have Hannah back at home where she belongs. 'We continue to work closely with officers to assist in the investigation and bring those responsible to justice. 'Our family is broken and require time to grieve in private - as do Hannah's many friends.'

How to canter a figure eight Put out cone markers (optional). Imagine a figure eight shape in your practice area. Position two markers, one on either end of the figure eight.","output":"The most logical next event for \\"How to canter a figure eight\\" after putting out cone markers is practicing and perfecting the canter transitions, turns, and proper riding techniques while performing the figure eight pattern. This involves several steps to ensure both the rider and the horse are in sync during the exercise. Here is a detailed breakdown of the steps involved: 1. Warm up: Begin by warming up your horse with a walk, trot, and then canter on both reins. This will help your horse and you to get in the rhythm and prepare for the figure eight exercise. 2. Start with circles: Before attempting the full figure eight pattern, practice riding large circles in both directions at a walk, trot, and canter. This will help you get comfortable with the lateral aids, balance, and control required for the figure eight. 3. Canter on a straight line: Canter in a straight line between the two cone markers. As you approach the first cone marker, prepare to turn onto a circle in the direction that you want to start the figure eight. 4. First circle: Begin the first circle by turning your horse towards the first cone marker. Keep your inside leg at the girth to maintain impulsion and bend, and your outside leg slightly behind the girth to prevent the hindquarters from swinging out. Use your inside rein to help guide the horse's nose in the direction you want to go, while the outside rein maintains a steady contact, keeping the horse from falling inwards or outwards. 5. Second circle: As you approach the second cone marker, prepare to change the bend in your horse's body to perform the second circle in the opposite direction. Shift your inside and outside aids accordingly to maintain a smooth transition between the two circles and change the direction of the figure eight. 6. Centerline: Ride a straight line across the middle of the figure eight while continuing to canter. Ensure both you and your horse are balanced and properly aligned for the upcoming change in direction. 7. Repeat the circles: Continue performing the circles on both sides, connecting them in a figure eight pattern, and remembering to switch the inside and outside aids each time you change direction. 8. Canter transitions: Work on incorporating smooth down and up canter transitions within the figure eight pattern as you go from one circle to the next. This may include transitioning from a canter to a walk or trot and then back into the canter as you enter the next circle. 9. Troubleshooting: If you or your horse are struggling with any aspects of the figure eight pattern, it's important to break down the exercise into smaller components and address any problems. This could include working on maintaining a balanced and even rhythm, practicing better transitions, or improving overall communication between rider and horse. 10. Gradual progression: As both you and your horse become more comfortable and proficient with cantering the figure eight, gradually increase the speed, complexity, or size of the exercise to challenge you both and improve your skills further. Remember that practice and patience are key when mastering any equestrian skill. With consistency and dedication, both you and your horse will successfully perform a smooth and controlled figure eight pattern at a canter."},{"instruction":"If But if nothing was a vacuum, this was an extremely hard and heavy one., can we conclude that \\"This was a hard and heavy vacuum. \\"?","output":"Yes, we can say that \\"This was a hard and heavy vacuum.\\" It means that even though it was empty like a vacuum, it was very difficult and heavy to deal with."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence in English.","output":"The cat is playing with a ball.

In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685.

Dimple piercings are fairly risky since you are dealing with an area more prone to infection than most. If done right, though, dimple piercings can partially mimic the look of dimples. Keep the piercings if you want to permanently highlight the dimple area or take them out eventually so that the skin eventually heals, leaving behind a dimple-like indentation. Due to the risks involved with dimple piercing, some professionals do not offer them at all. Others may offer them but often refuse them to anyone under the age of 18, even if that individual has the permission of a legal guardian. Dimple piercings cut through muscle and usually cause some mild form of nerve damage. This nerve damage can help hold the dimples in place even after the piercing closes up, but it can also be risky and could do unforeseen harm. The professional piercer should clean the outside of your cheek and should also instruct you to clean the inside of your mouth before making the dimple piercings. The needle and jewelry should also be sterilized. The piercer will puncture both cheeks symmetrically, right at the spot where natural dimples would fall. Afterward, he or she will place a straight barbell or other piece of piercing jewelry into each hole to prevent it from closing immediately. Your dimple piercings will need to be cleaned multiple times a day with a saline solution to prevent infection from setting in. You can keep the dimple jewelry in permanently if desired, but you can usually take them out after three months have passed. If the piercing did the expected nerve damage, you should have an indentation in your cheek even after the skin heals over the original hole. If you want something that looks more natural and will last for the rest of your life, learn about a plastic surgery procedure that will create dimple-like marks in your cheeks. Cosmetic surgery can be costly and does come with its own set of risks, but this option will give you fake dimples that look more natural than many other methods can. A plastic surgeon will use local anesthesia for the procedure. He or she will make a small incision on the inside of the mouth and into the inner surface of the cheek. Using specialized tools, the surgeon will make an indentation in the cheek muscles and mucosal tissues. Afterward, the dimple divot will be held in place with internal stitches, and external stitches will be used to close the wound in the inner mouth. For larger dimples, a plastic surgeon may perform a punch tissue excision. During this procedure, a portion of the cheek muscle is completely removed, creating a deeper and more obvious indentation. In either case, the procedure will take an hour or less. You should expect some pain, swelling, and bruising immediately after the procedure. The area is also weak to infection afterward, so you will need to carefully and thoroughly follow any instructions provided by the surgeon concerning proper wound care and cleansing. For the first few weeks, your dimple-like indentations will be present at all times. Once your cheek muscles partially heal, though, you should only notice the marks when smiling.

It's important to note that as an AI, I don't observe stars directly but rather provide information based on pre-existing astronomical knowledge. Here is a statement that describes a relationship between the distance from Earth and a characteristic of a star: \\"The brightness (or apparent magnitude) of a star as observed from Earth is directly related to its distance. Stars that are closer to the Earth tend to appear brighter than those that are far away, assuming their luminosities (intrinsic brightness) are similar.\\" Explanation: 1. Brightness or apparent magnitude: This is a measure of the amount of light received from a star at the location of an observer, such as Earth. The closer a star, the higher the amount of its light reaches us, thereby appearing brighter. 2. Distance: This is the space between Earth and the star. When a star is farther away, its light has to travel a longer distance to reach us. During this journey, the light rays disperse and weaken, so by the time it reaches us, the star appears less bright or fainter. It's worth mentioning that this is a simplified view. Other factors, like the star's size, temperature, and stage in its lifecycle also play key roles in its apparent brightness. Astronomers often use more complex techniques, like standard candles and redshift, to determine cosmic distances more accurately.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness.

We were excited to try their seafood dishes, and I'm happy to report that our experience was nothing short of amazing! Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the warm and inviting atmosphere. The decor had a subtle nautical theme, with tasteful pieces of aquatic art placed strategically around the dining space. The restaurant was also impeccably clean and well-maintained. As for the food, it was scrumptious! We ordered an appetizer platter featuring calamari, coconut shrimp, and crab cakes. Each item was cooked to perfection and presented beautifully. For our main courses, we tried the Grilled Mahi Mahi, Seared Scallops, and Lobster Thermidor. The flavors were rich and satisfying, and the portions were just right - not too overwhelming while still leaving us feeling satisfied. To accompany our meal, we chose a bottle of their recommended white wine, which paired wonderfully with the seafood dishes. The dessert, a Chocolate Molten Lava Cake, served as a fantastic end to an already delightful meal. Ocean's Delight also excelled in the service department. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu items, attentive to our needs, and patient with our questions. He made sure we had everything we needed throughout the evening. In conclusion, Ocean's Delight Seafood Restaurant provided us with an unforgettable dining experience, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to fellow seafood enthusiasts.

There was much public debate, before and after the abortive sale, as to whether Manchester Corporation ought to buy Trafford Park, but the corporation could not agree terms quickly enough, and so on 23 June Ernest Terah Hooley became the new owner of Trafford Park, for the sum of £360,000 (£40.9 million as of 2019).On 17 August, Hooley formed Trafford Park Estates Ltd, transferring his ownership of the park to the new company – of which he was the chairman and a significant shareholder – at a substantial profit. The initial plans for the estate included a racetrack, exclusive housing and a cycle works, along with the development of the ship canal frontage for \\"all types of trade including timber\\". By that time the ship canal had been open for two years, but the predicted traffic had yet to materialise. Hooley met with Marshall Stevens, the general manager of the Ship Canal Company, and both men recognised the benefit that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to the ship canal, and the ship canal to the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates. He remained with the company, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director, until 1930. The company initially chose not to construct buildings for letting, and instead leased land for development. But by the end of June 1897 less than one per cent of the park had been leased, and so the park's existing assets were put to use until more tenants could be found. Trafford Hall was opened as a hotel in 1899, to serve prospective industrialists considering a move to the park, along with their key employees. It had 40 bedrooms, available to \\"Gentlemen only\\". The hall's stables and some other outbuildings were used for stock auctions and the sale of horses, from 1900 to 1902, and the ornamental lake was leased to... contains an answer for the question: What failed to reach its reserve price at auction?, what is it ?

A. back yard B. hen house C. storybook D. natural habitat E. bathroom The best answer is The answer is:","output":"D. natural habitat Foxes are primarily found in their natural habitats. They are adaptable creatures and can be found in various environments across the northern hemisphere. While some foxes are known to venture into human settlements in search of food, they mostly prefer to remain in their natural habitats. The natural habitat of a fox depends on the species. Some of the most common species are the red fox, the arctic fox, and the fennec fox. Here's a deeper look into the natural habitats of these specific species: 1. Red fox (Vulpes vulpes): Red foxes are the most widespread and commonly found species of fox. They primarily inhabit mixed and deciduous forests, but they can also be found in grasslands, deserts, and urban areas. Red foxes are versatile and occupy a wide range of habitats to ensure their survival. 2. Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus): As the name suggests, the natural habitat of the arctic fox is the cold Arctic region. This species is adapted to life in the extreme cold and can be found across the Arctic Circle in northern Europe, Asia, Greenland, and North America. Tundra regions and coastal areas, where food sources are readily available, are the primary habitats of arctic foxes. 3. Fennec fox (Vulpes zerda): Fennec foxes are native to the arid Sahara Desert and parts of North Africa and the Sinai Peninsula. Their small size and unique physical adaptations, such as large ears and fur-covered soles, enable them to withstand extremely hot and dry conditions. They primarily reside in dune areas, sandy deserts, and semi-deserts. Addressing the other options: A. Back yard: While foxes may occasionally venture into back yards, particularly in urban areas, their primary habitat is not the back yard. They may visit human settlements in search of food, but they usually return to their natural habitats. B. Hen house: Foxes are known to prey on chickens, making hen houses a potential food source. However, this is not their natural habitat, and it is a location they may visit only occasionally when looking for food. C. Storybook: Although foxes are often depicted as cunning creatures in storybooks and folklore, this is not a real-life habitat for foxes. E. Bathroom: Foxes do not inhabit human-made structures such as bathrooms. Their natural habitats are found in various environments across the northern hemisphere, as mentioned above. In conclusion, the best answer to the question of where a fox spends most of its time is in its natural habitat. Each fox species occupies a unique environment that caters to its specific needs and physical adaptations. Although they may occasionally venture into human settlements, foxes predominantly reside in their natural habitats."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Premise: \\"A young child with his face in his plate.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A child finishes meal.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

The incident led to strained relations between the United States and Iraq, putting the spotlight on the role of private security contractors in the war-torn country. Over the years, Blackwater Worldwide, which has since rebranded itself as Academi, has been under scrutiny for its aggressive behavior and questionable tactics while providing security for U.S. officials and diplomatic staff in Iraq. The 2007 tragedy, often referred to as the Nisour Square massacre, was just one of several incidents where Blackwater guards were accused by Iraqi authorities of using excessive and lethal force. Faced with these allegations and the Iraqi government's refusal to renew the firm's operating license, the State Department was left with no choice but to terminate Blackwater's contract. Critics argue that private security contractors like Blackwater often benefited from a lack of legal accountability, resulting in a sense of impunity and a disregard for Iraqi civilians' safety. In response to these concerns, the U.S. government has increased oversight and regulation of private security contractors and taken further measures to ensure better communication and coordination with the Iraqi government and military. Although Blackwater is no longer operating in Iraq, the long-lasting effects of the company's actions in the country continue to be felt. Several lawsuits and criminal prosecutions have stemmed from the Nisour Square incident, leading to the conviction of four former Blackwater employees in 2014 on charges ranging from murder to manslaughter and weapons violations. However, these convictions were later overturned or sentences reduced, and the U.S. government eventually reached a settlement with the company for violations of the Arms Export Control Act and International Trafficking in Arms Regulations. As the United States continues its efforts to rebuild Iraq and foster diplomatic relations, the legacy of Blackwater serves as a cautionary tale in the use and management of private security contractors. It highlights the importance of striking a balance between ensuring the safety of American personnel abroad and respecting the sovereignty and well-being of other nations and their citizens. With increased oversight and regulation, the hope is that future security contractors can learn from Blackwater's mistakes and help contribute to a more secure and stable Iraq moving forward."},{"instruction":"Write highlights for this article: By.

Given the context: What will Robin want to do next? Possible answers: be grateful for the mentoring, ignore Kai due to disappointments, be self opinionated","output":"Based on the context provided, Robin is showing a growing concern and has specifically sought out Kai's opinion. This indicates that Robin values and respects Kai's insights, potentially because of Kai's experience, wisdom or their personal relationship. Going forward, there are several possible outcomes, such as being grateful for the mentoring, ignoring Kai due to disappointments, and becoming self-opinionated. 1. Be grateful for the mentoring: If Kai provides a well-thought-out, comprehensive, and helpful response to Robin's concerns, it is likely that Robin will appreciate the guidance that Kai has offered. This would lead Robin to feel grateful for the mentoring Kai has provided and could strengthen their working relationship or personal bond. Robin may continue to seek out Kai's advice in the future, and they can engage in collaborative problem-solving when facing challenges or concerns. This outcome fosters open communication, learning, and growth in both individuals' professional or personal lives. 2. Ignore Kai due to disappointments: If Kai's response to Robin's concerns does not live up to Robin's expectations, Robin may feel disappointed and choose to disregard the advice or perspective that Kai offered. In this case, the value that Robin places on Kai's opinion could be diminished, which could strain their relationship. This scenario might lead Robin to rely more on their own insights or seek out other sources of guidance, possibly creating a rift or tension between the two individuals. 3. Be self-opinionated: Depending on Kai's response and Robin's reaction to it, Robin may choose to become more self-reliant and form their own opinions about the situation or concern. This outcome could arise from either a disappointing response from Kai as mentioned above or from Robin's own sense of self-confidence and ability to make decisions. Being self-opinionated can be both an advantageous and disadvantageous trait. It allows individuals to stand firm in their beliefs and showcase their decision-making abilities, but in excess, it may inhibit a person from considering other perspectives or new information fairly. In this case, Robin's self-opinionated nature could lead them to value Kai's input less, potentially damaging their relationship or hindering Robin's professional or personal growth. In conclusion, Robin's future actions will be largely influenced by the quality and relevance of Kai's response to their concerns, as well as Robin's own personality traits and emotions. Ensuring transparent and open communication will be key to maintaining and fostering their relationship, regardless of the proposed scenarios. Ultimately, by valuing and learning from each other's perspectives, both Robin and Kai can grow and develop through collaboration and mutual respect."},{"instruction":"Without Meyer, No Celebration is Complete (German: Keine Feier ohne Meyer) is a 1931 German comedy film directed by Carl Boese and starring Sig Arno, Ralph Arthur Roberts and Dina Gralla.

Make this lower case","output":"notes on your system: 425w power supply, 90 percent efficiency is not compatible with ddr3 rdimm memory. The information provided suggests that your system is configured with a 425-watt power supply unit (PSU), which is rated at 90 percent efficiency. Typically, a power supply unit converts the alternating current (AC) input from the mains to the direct current (DC) required to power the components within a computer system. A 90 percent efficiency rating indicates that the PSU is able to convert 90 percent of the input power to useful DC output power, while the remaining 10 percent is dissipated as heat. However, it is important to note that the efficiency and wattage of a PSU are unrelated to the compatibility of DDR3 RDIMM memory modules in a system. DDR3 RDIMM (registered dual in-line memory module) is a kind of memory module used in servers and high-end computer systems to provide scalability and improved data integrity. DDR3 stands for \\"double data rate type three,\\" and as the name suggests, RDIMM memory contains registers for improved data signal quality. Several factors determine the compatibility of DDR3 RDIMM memory with a particular system: 1. Motherboard compatibility: The system's motherboard must have appropriate memory slots and a chipset that supports DDR3 RDIMM memory modules. 2. BIOS support: The system BIOS (basic input/output system) should have the necessary support for recognizing and configuring DDR3 RDIMM memory. 3. CPU compatibility: The system's processor should support the use of registered DDR3 memory modules, as some low-end or consumer-grade CPUs may not have this capability. 4. Operating system support: Some operating systems may impose limitations on the amount of memory that can be addressed, although this is typically not an issue with modern 64-bit operating systems. In summary, although your system might be utilizing a 425W power supply with a 90 percent efficiency rating, this information is not directly related to compatibility with DDR3 RDIMM memory modules. To determine if your system can support DDR3 RDIMM memory, more details about the specific components, such as the motherboard, CPU, and BIOS, would be necessary."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Kendall thanked Lee for his help and promised to give Lee the proper credit when the project is finished.

Upon arrival in Sonora, Earl learns that the company would pay him double if he caught one of the creatures alive. He also meets geologist Kate Reilly and her assistant Julio, who are scientifically investigating the Graboids. Earl and Grady begin systematically killing the Graboids by using remote-controlled cars rigged with explosives. Realizing the vast number of Graboids, Earl enlists the help of Burt Gummer, who arrives with a truck loaded with firearms and explosives. The next day, Earl and Grady encounter what appears to be a sick Graboid after crashing their truck. They radio for the oil field's mechanic Pedro and wait with the Graboid. That night, the Graboid dies, and Earl and Grady find sacs within the carcass. Pedro's truck arrives, but Grady and Earl find only his arms remaining and the engine motor ripped apart. While breaking into a parked car, they encounter several Graboid-like creatures, later named Shriekers, that have apparently come from their Graboid.

The hoard is often known as the Bactrian gold. Can we infer the following? Tillya tepe is known for the gold deposits in the area","output":"Tillya Tepe, also known as Tillia Tepe or Tillā tapa (Persian: طلا تپه‎ ‎), which translates to \\"Golden Hill\\" or \\"Golden Mound\\" is indeed an archaeological site located in the northern Afghanistan province of Jowzjan, near Sheberghan. The site was excavated in 1978 by a Soviet-Afghan team led by Greek-Russian archaeologist Viktor Sarianidi, a year before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the discoveries made during this excavation are often referred to as the Bactrian gold. The name \\"Golden Hill\\" or \\"Golden Mound\\" may suggest the presence of gold deposits in the area, but it is important to fully understand the site and its context to determine if such an inference is valid. In the context of Tillya Tepe, the primary reason for its association with \\"gold\\" stems not from the presence of gold deposits but rather from the archaeological treasure that was discovered at the site. Tillya Tepe is particularly famous for its association with a collection of around 20,600 gold ornaments, coins, and other precious objects dating back to the 1st century BCE, which makes it one of the most significant and valuable archaeological finds in Afghanistan. These artifacts, which include gold jewelry, belts, buckles, crowns, and more, are believed to be connected to a culture of nomadic peoples (possibly the Kushans) that inhabited the regions of Bactria and Sogdiana. The discovery of these gold items at Tillya Tepe has provided a wealth of information about the craftsmanship, artistic styles, and cultural influences of that era, reflecting the exchange of ideas and techniques between the regions associated with the Silk Road trade routes. So, to infer that Tillya Tepe is known for gold deposits in the area might not be accurate, as the site is primarily known for its archaeological significance related to the discovery of the Bactrian gold treasure. Though the name \\"Golden Hill\\" or \\"Golden Mound\\" does have a connotation of gold linked to the location, this association is derived from the treasure trove of gold artifacts, rather than gold deposits themselves. As a result, it is more accurate to emphasize the archaeological value of the site and its connection to the Bactrian gold artifacts, rather than focusing on gold deposits in the area."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - The ophicleide is a keyed brass instrument similar to the tuba. It is a conical-bore keyed instrument belonging to the bugle family and has a similar shape to the sudrophone. - Brass is a metal alloy made of copper and zinc; the proportions of zinc and copper can be varied to create a range of brasses with varying properties. It is a substitutional alloy: atoms of the two constituents may replace each other within the same crystal structure. - The subcontrabass tuba is an extension of the tuba family within the modern contrabass tuba . At least five known examples have been created , all pitched in BBBb , sounding a full octave lower than standard BBb contrabass tubas . Music for them is written in bass clef sounding a full octave lower than notated . - The tuba is the largest and lowest-pitched musical instrument in the brass family. Like all brass instruments, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or \\"buzz\\" into a large cupped mouthpiece. It first appeared in the mid 19th-century, making it one of the newer instruments in the modern orchestra and concert band. The tuba largely replaced the ophicleide. \\"Tuba\\" is Latin for 'trumpet'. - A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - A concert band, also called wind ensemble, symphonic band, wind symphony, wind orchestra, wind band, symphonic winds, symphony band, or symphonic wind ensemble, is a performing ensemble consisting of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families of instruments, along with the double bass. - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments.

She is unknown to everyone in the party, even to the hotel staff. During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend Wai (Andy Hui Chi-On), and this is the very reason why she was in the hotel when the crime was committed.

For this example, I will choose the effect of exercise on mental health. Step 2: Develop the context Now that I have chosen a topic, I will create the context around it. The context should briefly explain the relationship between exercise and mental health, including any relevant information that may help in understanding the current knowledge in this field. Here's the context: \\"Regular physical exercise has been linked to various physical health benefits, such as improved cardiovascular health, reduced risk of certain diseases, and weight management. In recent years, research has also suggested that exercise might have a positive impact on mental health, including reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and better overall mood. While the exact mechanisms for the relationship between exercise and mental health are still being studied, it is thought that physical activity might trigger the release of mood-enhancing chemicals in the brain, such as endorphins, and support the growth of new neurons.\\" Step 3: Create a hypothesis based on the context Lastly, I will generate a hypothesis based on the context. A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for the relationship between variables, which in this case are exercise and mental health. The hypothesis should be testable, and it must make a clear and specific prediction.

A telepathic communicator Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Minds Apart\\" Step 1: Setting the premise The movie takes place in a futuristic society where humans are separated into distinct communities based on their inherent psychic abilities. Aura, a gifted teacher specialized in psychic communication, resides in the Telepath Community. Flash, a young and energetic man with latent psychic powers, lives in the neighboring community where people use technology for everyday communication. Step 2: Establishing character motivations and relationships Aura and Flash meet during a rare gathering of representatives from all communities, with the intention to facilitate innovation and unity. As an ambitious soul always eager to learn, Flash shows curiosity about Aura's abilities, which sparks her interest in helping him unlock his innate telepathic potential. Step 3: Introducing conflict Despite their basic psychic differences, Aura and Flash begin secretly meeting for lessons. They encounter a major setback when they discover a hidden plot, led by an influential leader from Flash's community, that seeks to dominate all other communities by controlling their psychics' powers and using them for their own benefit. Step 4: Building tension Aura and Flash work together to master the telepathic communicator, a powerful device that amplifies psychic connections and allows them to communicate instantaneously. Aura teaches Flash how to connect with other psychics across the communities, with the ultimate goal of rallying them against the malicious plot threatening their society's balance and freedom. Step 5: Climax As Flash's abilities grow stronger, the villainous leader begins to suspect their secret collaboration. He launches an aggressive and targeted attack on Aura, who is forced into hiding. In desperation, Flash uses the telepathic communicator to rally the psychics across all communities and successfully mobilizes them against their oppressors. Step 6: Resolution The combined psychic and technological forces, under the guidance of Aura and Flash, defeat the villain and his followers. This victory leads to a greater appreciation for the unique skills and abilities of all communities, encouraging cooperation and the sharing of knowledge. Step 7: Conclusion Aura and Flash's heroics not only save their society from tyranny but also pave the way for a more inclusive, harmonious world. Their personal bond, forged through the telepathic communicator, serves as an inspirational example of what can be achieved when people embrace their differences and unite for the greater good. The film ends with a hopeful message, emphasizing the transformative power of connection and unity."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you have to generate the title of the recipe given its required ingredients and directions.

Reuters - EarthLink Inc. on Thursdayposted a higher third-quarter profit, helped by subscribergrowth, but it forecast revenue below analysts' consensustarget for the current quarter, which dragged down shares 9percent.","output":"This news is about EarthLink Inc., a U.S.-based internet service provider (ISP), reporting better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter of the fiscal year. EarthLink's profit increased compared to the same period last year, primarily due to an increase in the number of subscribers. Despite this positive result, the company projected that its revenue during the upcoming quarter would be lower than the consensus estimate formed by financial analysts. This forecast led to a 9% decline in the company's stock price following the announcement. In more detail, EarthLink Inc. posted a higher third-quarter profit as a direct result of subscriber growth in its internet services. The increase in the company's subscriber base translates to higher demand and, subsequently, a rise in revenue. This can be attributed to the company's efficient marketing campaigns, attractive service offerings, and competitive pricing strategy that gained traction and enticed more customers to join. However, EarthLink's forecast for the current quarter's revenue fell short of what financial analysts had predicted. Although the company experienced positive results in the third quarter, its projected revenue might not meet the expectations set by the analysts who monitor the industry and company's performance. This could be due to various factors, including increased competition from other internet service providers, potential seasonal slowdowns, or shifts in consumer behavior and technology trends. As a consequence of the lower-than-anticipated revenue forecast, EarthLink's share price declined by 9% as investors reacted negatively to the news. Generally, when a company's financial results or outlook does not meet market expectations, the stock price is adversely affected, as in this case with EarthLink Inc. In conclusion, the news is about EarthLink Inc.'s third-quarter financial report, which showed improved earnings due to increased subscriber numbers. While the revenue growth is encouraging, the company's lower revenue projection for the upcoming quarter led to a decline in its stock price. This suggests that the market might have concerns about the company's ability to sustain growth in the near term. The overall sentiment among investors can be influenced by a multitude of factors, and it remains crucial for EarthLink Inc. to address these challenges going forward to maintain investor confidence and remain competitive in the market."},{"instruction":"Chelsea right-back Branislav Ivanovic has sounded an ominous warning to the rest of the Premier League by insisting Jose Mourinho's team will only get better. The Blues entered the October international break with a five-point lead at the top of the standings after dropping just two points in the opening seven games, in a draw at defending champions Manchester City, who are second.

Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Input: Passage: The term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. The primary metal is called the base, the matrix, or the solvent. The secondary constituents are often called solutes. If there is a mixture of only two types of atoms, not counting impurities, such as a copper-nickel alloy, then it is called a binary alloy. If there are three types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a ternary alloy. An alloy with four constituents is a quaternary alloy, while a five-part alloy is termed a quinary alloy. Because the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a system. In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a binary system, while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a ternary system. Output:","output":"Part #1: Creating questions which require satisfying a constraint not mentioned in the passage. Usage: What is the melting point of a copper-nickel alloy? The passage doesn't mention the melting point of any alloys, hence this question is unanswerable based on the provided information. Part #2: Creating questions which require information beyond the passage in order to answer. Usage: What are the applications of quinary alloys in aerospace engineering? The passage doesn't provide any information on specific applications of alloys or their uses in aerospace engineering, making it unanswerable. Part #3: Replacing an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with another one and using it in the question. Usage: What is the name for an alloy containing six constituents? The passage only covers alloys up to five constituents (quinary alloys), so this question is unanswerable. Part #4: Replacing one or two words in an answerable question with their antonyms or inserting/removing negation words to make the question unanswerable. Usage: Is an alloy with only two types of atoms called a ternary alloy? This example replaces \\"ternary\\" with \\"binary\\", which is the term mentioned in the passage for alloys with two types of atoms, making the question unanswerable as presented."},{"instruction":"Available choices: (I).

All multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms, and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host. An example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species, which colonizes the mammalian colon, and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin. Neither of these colonizations are considered infections. The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance. Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions, and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection. Some colonizing bacteria, such as Corynebacteria sp. and viridans streptococci, prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host, preventing infection and speeding wound healing.

Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Fourteen people were killed and another 60 were injured in Indonesia over a four-day period as a result of Cyclone Iggy, according to the country's National Disaster Management Agency. Most of those who died were struck by falling trees or debris from strong winds, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. More than 2,000 homes were also damaged in 35 towns or cities in Java and Bali between Wednesday and Sunday, he said. The government has provided food and aid to the areas affected, the agency said. As of Sunday, Iggy was off the northwestern coast of Australia, said Tom Sater, meteorologist for CNN International. In anticipation of the storm,","output":"Indonesian authorities had put in place evacuation plans and emergency response teams, allocating resources to manage the unfolding situation. However, the severity of Cyclone Iggy caught many residents by surprise, with its heavy rainfall, strong winds, and localized flooding in several provinces. Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo, expressed deep condolences for the victims and urged all related government agencies to work together in the aftermath of the cyclone to conduct search-and-rescue operations, provide medical help to the injured, and restore damaged infrastructure. He also urged residents in the affected areas to remain calm and follow the guidance of local authorities to ensure their safety. In the following weeks, the Indonesian government worked closely with local governments, the military, and humanitarian organizations such as the Indonesian Red Cross and international aid groups to provide much-needed relief to affected communities. Efforts were focused on clearing debris, restoring damaged infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and utilities, and providing temporary shelter for displaced families. Disaster management experts from around the world were invited to assess the situation and offer recommendations, aiming to improve Indonesia's emergency preparedness and response capabilities to minimize the loss of life and damage in future natural disasters. Weather agencies and researchers also collaborated on developing early warning systems, conducting investigations to understand the changing patterns of cyclones in the region. Meanwhile, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology kept a close eye on Cyclone Iggy as it approached the northwestern coast of Australia, issuing warnings and advice for residents and maritime vessels. The storm was projected to weaken as it moved further southward, reducing its impact on the Australian mainland. In the wake of Cyclone Iggy, the global community rallied behind Indonesia, offering condolences, financial support, and resources for rebuilding the affected communities. International organizations such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank pledged assistance in the form of grants, loans, and technical assistance. Over time, with the collaborative efforts of national and international stakeholders, affected communities gradually recovered from the devastation left behind by Cyclone Iggy. They were able to rebuild their homes, schools, and businesses, while also addressing the broader challenges of climate change and disaster resilience. Although Cyclone Iggy left a tragic toll on human lives and property in Indonesia, it also served as a reminder of the importance of coordinated disaster preparedness and response efforts. The lessons learned and the progress made in the wake of this disaster have the potential to save many lives and mitigate the impact of future storms in the region."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: Colonel Edmund Munro for the following movie plot: The action of the story takes place in 1757 during the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years' War) in the Adirondack Mountains in what was then the British colony of New York.

He praised IBM for being \\"a critical partner in our economic development efforts\\" in New York state. In a brief speech, Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM's chief executive, emphasized that it was important to make long-term investments despite the current slump in the technology business. \\"To play to win in technology, you innovate and you lead,\\" he said. But manufacturing technology products is a costly and cyclical business. In June, IBM announced that it was taking a charge of more than 2 billion against earnings. The largest single reasons for the charge were the cost of getting out of the business of manufacturing hard disks for storage, which it sold to Hitachi, and closing down some of its older semiconductor operations. But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips, like those produced at IBM's facility in Burlington, Vt., is strong. \\"I need more capacity in that end of the market,\\" he said, \\"and this is factory is critical to meeting that growing demand.\\" If IBM has miscalculated the demand, it will suffer badly as both the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital investment for the East Fishkill factory drag down earnings.

This approach highlights the importance of placing gender equality as a priority within the institution's work. The term \\"mainstreaming gender equality\\" refers to the integration of concerns regarding gender equality within the context of all policy areas and at all levels of decision-making.

What is the solution?","output":"The problem requires finding the specific value for variable 'q' in the equation 307q + 8143 = -3830. The first step is to isolate 'q' on one side of the equation. To achieve this, we need to get rid of 8143 from the left-hand side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 8143 from both sides of the equation, which results in: 307q + 8143 - 8143 = -3830 - 8143, which simplifies to: 307q = -11973. Now, to isolate 'q', we need to get rid of 307. We do this by dividing every term in the equation by 307: q = -11973 / 307 When we compute this, we obtain: q = -39.

He led an uprising against the Commonwealth and its magnates (16481654) which resulted in the creation of a state led by the Cossacks of Ukraine. In 1654, he concluded the Treaty of Pereyaslav with the Tsardom of Russia. The Khmelnytsky Uprising led to the deaths of an estimated 18,000 -100,000 Jews. - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. - The Khmelnytsky Uprising (; also known as the Cossack-Polish War, Chmielnicki Uprising, or the Khmelnytsky insurrection) was a Cossack rebellion within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 16481657, which led to the creation of a Cossack Hetmanate in Ukrainian lands. Under the command of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Zaporozhian Cossacks, allied with the Crimean Tatars and local peasantry, fought against the armies and paramilitary forces of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. The insurgency was accompanied by mass atrocities committed by Cossacks against the civilian population, especially against the Roman Catholic clergy and the Jews. - Adam Kisiel , also Adam Kysil ( Polish : Adam Kisiel Ukrainian : ; 1580 or 1600 - 1653 ) was a Polish nobleman , the Voivode of Kiev ( 1649 - 1653 ) and castellan or voivode of Czernihów ( 1639 - 1646 ) .

Article: Traffic Management Traffic lights are key tools for regulating traffic How.They are not, however, perfect.Drivers exchange the traffic jams that would happen at unmanaged crossings for a pattern of stop-go movement that can still be annoying, and which bums more fuel than a smooth passage would. Creating such a smooth passage means adjusting a vehicle's speed so that it always arrives at the lights when they are green.That is theoretically possible, but practically hard.Roadside signs wired to traffic lights can help get the message across a couple hundred metres from a crossing, but such signs are expensive, and are not widespread.Margaret Martonosi and Emmanouil Koukoumidis at Princeton University, and Li-Shiuan Peh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, have an idea that could make the process cheaper and more effective.Instead of a hardwired network of signs, they propose to use mobile-phone applications.

Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.

It was filled with the usual pictures – his mom, dad and brothers – as well as portraits of the family taken by the world-famous surrealist artist Man Ray, a family friend. But towards the back, something caught his eye: two pictures of a young woman, her eyes cast downward, with curly, deep-black hair. Steve still doesn’t know why he had the idea, but as he looked at the images, he thought to himself: “My God, that looks like the Black Dahlia.” The Black Dahlia, of course, is the nickname given to Elizabeth Short after her grisly death on 15 January 1947. The 22-year-old aspiring actor was living in Los Angeles when her corpse was found maimed and split in two, its body parts displayed in an grotesque posture on the ground of a vacant lot. The personal connection between Short and George Hodel suggested by the album photos seemed outrageous. Hers was one of the most brutal murders in American history, and, after the Zodiac killer’s shooting spree in San Francisco, perhaps the most famous unsolved crime in California. But from this moment on, Steve was hooked. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Elizabeth Short, known as the ‘Black Dahlia’, was murdered in 1947. Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty Images In just over 23 years, Steve had diligently risen through the ranks of the Los Angeles police department, establishing a reputation as an unfaltering homicide detective. So like any good cop, Steve started digging and the details began to add up. Crime scene photos showed that Short had been given a hemicorporectomy, a procedure that slices the body beneath the lumbar spine, the only spot where the body can be severed in half without breaking bone. It was taught in the 1930s, when George had been in medical school. The letters sent to the press and police from The Black Dahlia Avenger, a man claiming to be Short’s killer, also bore a chilling resemblance to his dad’s handwriting. Cataloguing evidence has been Steve’s life for the last 15 years, during which the quest to connect his father to Short’s murder consumed his life. It brought him back to Los Angeles, where he now spends his days in a modest apartment, documenting his father’s supposed criminal past in a snowballing body of work including four books, a play and a frequently updated blog. And though his first book, Black Dahlia Avenger: The True Story, is little more than hundreds of pages of evidence, listed chronologically like a cop’s case log, it made the New York Times bestseller list after it was released in 2003. This research has won him fans. It has also made many people uncomfortable given his tone, which blurs the line between obsession and admiration, and his conveniently gripping narrative: a homicide detective, raised in the heart of gritty Los Angeles, finds his father guilty of the city’s most notorious unsolved murder. Steve, who is now 74, isn’t the first person to claim that he’s solved Short’s murder; he’s not even the first to claim that one of his parents was the killer. But Steve has dug up a cache of evidence, including law enforcement files that show that his father topped the LAPD’s list of suspects at the time of the crime. While law enforcement officials disagree about whether Steve Hodel is a brilliant vigilante or an obsessive crackpot, no one has been able to prove him wrong. That fact has been all the encouragement Steve needs to keep digging. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A newspaper article on Short’s death. Photograph: Los Angeles The celebrity status of Short’s death was driven, in part, by a relentlessness media. The Los Angeles Record carried related items on its front page for 31 consecutive days, and sales of newspapers surged as the LAPD’s investigation continued. Part of the intrigue came from the unprecedented brutality of her murder. Before she was killed, Short had been forced to eat feces. Flesh and pubic hair had been shaved off her body and inserted into her vagina and rectum. Short’s uterus was removed. Long gashes extended her mouth into an eerie smile. “It’s the body itself which laid the groundwork for endless generations of Black Dahlia zealots,” the writer John Gilmore told an interviewer. “It’s like this tremendous, bizarre magnet.” The day after Short’s body was found, the Los Angeles Examiner sold more copies than it had any other day, except when it announced the allied victory in the second world war. Sales were fueled by the tawdry way the tabloid press covered Short – as a streetwalking, sexualized young thing (the rumors that she was a prostitute were untrue). As a childhood friend later recalled, “It was just horrible, the way she was portrayed.” This sensationalized portrait has endured over time. Her murder has been memorialized in movies (The Black Dahlia, starring Scarlett Johansson, is the latest), and on television shows (most recently on an episode of American Horror Story). The Biltmore, the hotel where Short was seen alive a few days before her death, offers a popular Black Dahlia cocktail. Dozens of threads on Reddit are devoted to discovering the identity of her killer. Numerous writers have written books about the case. Like Hodel, a woman named Janice Knowlton believed that her father was the Black Dahlia killer, and wrote a book about it. “Her book was trash, and it wasn’t even true,” her sister told the Los Angeles Times after her death in 2004. “She believed it, but it wasn’t reality.” So far, only Hodel’s own investigation warranted an official acknowledgement from the DA’s office. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Hodel at home in Sherman Oaks, California. Photograph: Emily Berl for the Guardian Hodel lives in a salmon-colored stucco apartment complex in Studio City, just a few miles from his childhood home. His unit overlooks a small, empty swimming pool. His girlfriend, Roberta, would like something nicer, but the rent is low and the space is large. A physically imposing man, Hodel is tall and broad with a dusting of white hair and a gentle demeanor – like Santa Claus, vibrating on a darker frequency. And after 16 years immersed in Dahlia-lore, the smallest details are ingrained in Steve’s mind. Once, when I referred to an officer on the case with the wrong title, Hodel lunged forward, his eyes narrowed, and began a well-rehearsed monologue on the officer’s role in the case. “He’s like a pit bull,” his brother Kelly Hodel says. “Once he gets his teeth into something, he doesn’t let go.” Steve began investigating his father with the deliberate fastidiousness of the good cop he’d always been. He surveyed the case from scratch, digging through witness interviews and newspaper archives. He filed a Freedom of Information Act to retrieve the FBI files on the murder, and other information the bureau had collected on his father. He sent the photographs that he found in his father’s photo album to facial recognition experts (one remains unknown, the other he identified as another woman). A handwriting expert determined that there was a strong likelihood that his father’s handwriting matched the script on some of the notes the killer sent to the LAPD, but the results were inconclusive. In the archives of UCLA, Steve found a folder containing receipts for contracting work on his childhood home. One of the receipts showed a purchase a few days before Short’s murder of 10 five-pound bags of concrete – the same size and brand found near Short’s body that police believe her killer used to carry her. As a civilian, Steve doesn’t have access to the original police files and, as an officer admitted to him in his only meeting with the LAPD, the majority of the physical evidence has been lost over the years. Most of the witnesses are dead, as are the original cops that worked the case. To sidestep the age of the evidence, Steve relied on carefully assembled anecdotes. He has recreated conversations that dead cops had with friends, family members, and, in one case, the daughter of a lieutenant’s family dentist. A number of them report hearing that the department believed the culprit was a doctor “who lived on Franklin Avenue”, where the Hodel family lived at the time of the murder. Steve tracked down a policewoman who reported seeing Short on the street with a man and a woman, on the night before she was found murdered, but half a century later, the cop could only remember what Short looked like, not the two other people present. In 2001, after two years of researching the case full-time, Hodel turned to Steven Kay, an acquaintance who worked in the Los Angeles county district attorney’s office. Hodel still wasn’t sure he could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his father was the Black Dahlia killer. But he was convinced his investigation had unearthed enough new material to justify a fresh look from law enforcement officials. Kay, an assistant district attorney at the time, agreed to review Steve’s work. Six weeks later, Kay responded with a glowing letter. “Thanks to some great detective work by his courageous son Steve, the name of Dr George Hodel will live in infamy,” wrote Kay, who added that, if George were still alive, he would file two charges of murder against him. Surprisingly, Kay believed Steve was right. “When I had that, that was kind of the moment where I said, OK, case solved,” says Steve. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dr George Hill Hodel. Photograph: Courtesy of Steve Hodel The assessment gave Steve the reassurance he needed to start on a book – the best vehicle, he believed, to share his story with the world. Michael Hodel, Steve’s son, was staying with his father the summer he began writing the manuscript. Every day, “he’d get up at five in the morning and he’d be up in his room doing research”, Michael recalled, “I was just impressed with his dedication.” At the time, Steve told no one but his girlfriend, Roberta, what he was working on. But in January of 2002, a few weeks before the book was slated to come out, he started informing friends and family. He called June Hodel, his father’s widow, first, a conversation that ended up being their last. “She just kept saying, this isn’t true, your father was a scholar,” Steve said (I tried to locate June Hodel for this article, but couldn’t contact her). One of the next people he called was his younger brother, Kelly Hodel. When Kelly picked up the phone, Steve didn’t waste time with small talk. “Our father was a homicidal maniac,” he said, by way of greeting. Almost as if scripted, startling revelations came after Steve concluded his research. Steve Lopez, a columnist at the Los Angeles Times, received a copy of Steve’s book and decided to write about it. While fact-checking his column, Lopez asked the Los Angeles county district attorney’s office for more information on the murder. The DA’s office complied, and Lopez received access to a file that Lt Frank Jemison, one of the original officers investigating Short’s murder, had left behind in a safe in the basement of the district attorney’s office. The file, a copy of which the district attorney also shared with the Guardian, contains an assortment of photographs, newspaper clippings and several hundred pages of typed interview notes, pixelated with age, compiled by Jemison. Buried in the notes is the bombshell that Steve had been hoping for: the Los Angeles police department was focused on six suspects in its Black Dahlia investigation, and George Hodel was on the list. And then there is the transcript of the period in 1950 when the police were bugging George Hodel’s home. Most of the transcript is dull: Hodel has sex; he berates his secretary; he talks about money problems. But on 19 February 1950, there’s a haunting exchange. 8:25pm. “Woman screamed. Woman screamed again. (It should be noted, the woman not heard before the scream.)” Later in the day, Hodel talks to a confidant. “Realise there was nothing I could do, put a pillow over her head and cover her with a blanket. Get a taxi. Expired 12:59. They thought there was something fishy. Anyway, now they may have figured it out. Killed her.” The surveillance continues, routinely, but for one telling moment. “Supposin’ I did kill the Black Dahlia. They couldn’t prove it now. They can’t talk to my secretary any more because she’s dead.” Lopez’s discovery of this file – the surveillance, the confirmation of his dad’s place on the suspect list – was a redeeming moment for Hodel, and he still beams when he talks about it now, more than a decade later. “Here you’ve got independent corroboration that he was in fact the prime suspect,” he says. “Basically, I was blown away.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Hodel on Norton Avenue, the area where the Black Dahlia’s body was found. Photograph: Emily Berl for the Guardian On a brisk morning in January three years ago, Steve decided to re-enact the drive that he believes his father took the night he killed Short. Steve woke up early on 16 January (a day after the anniversary of Short’s actual murder on 15 January 1947), and drove at 6am to his childhood home on Franklin Avenue. “I wanted to see the ambient lighting,” Steve told me. He has recreated the drive many times since then, for reporters, friends and family. When Short’s body was discovered, the Leinart Park neighborhood was just developing. It was nothing more than a series of overgrown lots with a scattering of houses. Now, it’s solidly middle-class, with rows of close-set houses with manicured laws. On a clear day, you can see the Hollywood sign in the distance. It took us a minute to find the spot where Short’s body was found, using a compass app and the house numbers. Steve seemed pleased when we finally located the spot, on the closely cropped grass of a single-story home, a few feet away from the sidewalk. One of the most difficult parts of Steve’s beliefs is how flatteringly they make out his dad. In his estimation, it’s George’s relationship with the surrealist photographer, Man Ray, that helped propel Short’s murder. Two of Man Ray’s photographs, Les Amoureux and Minotaur, do bear a chilling resemblance to Short’s mutilated body. Short’s body, Steve argues, was George’s way of emulating his friend’s surrealism, allowing him to build what Steve calls a “masterpiece, a crime so shocking and horrible it would endure, be immortalized through the annals of crime lore”. In the car, after we left, I asked Steve what he thought his father would think of his investigation. He paused for a moment, before replying. “I don’t know,” he said, after stopping to think. “I’m guessing he’d be proud of me.” Though Steve’s family is proud of his dedication, their pride has slid, slowly, towards bafflement. At one point, I asked Steve’s son Michael why he thought his father kept investigating. “Have you figured it out?” he asked me, “Because I’d like to know.” He paused, and then added, “To my dad, the Black Dahlia is his story,” he said. “If there’s any kind of noteworthiness in his life, it probably came from this. This is kind of his calling card at this point. So, yeah, I can see how you would want it to be as grand as possible.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Hodel at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. Photograph: Emily Berl for the Guardian Steve says that, for him, the Black Dahlia case is like a loose thread in a sweater: you tug on it gently, thinking you’ve come to the end, and it continues to unravel. There has never been a comfortable end point to conclude his investigation: each piece of evidence leads to another, in turn leading to another crime. All told, Steve believes he’s located a trail that connects his father to dozens of murders, stretching across California. Details from murders in Los Angeles lead Steve to a string of murders in Chicago, which then led him to Manila and the slaying of a 28-year-old woman named Lucila Lalu, whose dismembered body had been found situated oddly like Short’s. She body was found scattered about a half mile from his father’s home, along a street named “Zodiac”. Steve took it as a clue. “I thought, no, no, no, there’s no way,” he told me. He worried that there was no way to accuse his father of the Zodiac murders without seeming loony. “I had spent all of this time and effort and blood, sweat and tears establishing my credibility in Black Dahlia. And now this guy’s saying his dad is also the Zodiac? It’s like, oh man.” That assessment has proven largely accurate. After his first book, Black Dahlia Avenger, was released, Steve seemed on the verge of a breakthrough. It was met with a wave of mostly positive press coverage. The Seattle Weekly called it “one of the most compelling true-crime books of all time”. The New York Times gave it a rave review. Steve appeared on Dateline, CBS and NBC; Anderson Cooper interviewed him for CNN. But after he turned his attention to the Zodiac, and published Most Evil, which argues that his father was responsible for the Zodiac murders as well, interest in his work has been middling. Ultimately, all of his investigations have produced precious little in the way of real results. Aside from hosting one meeting with Steve, shortly after the release of his book, the LAPD has largely ignored him. As Lt Brian Carr, the officer who was responsible for the files told Cold Case in 2009, “I don’t have the time to prove or disprove what [Hodel] says. I’m buried in other cases that do have evidence that are possibly solvable.” Steve told me he views this as more evidence of a massive LAPD cover-up. In a re-release of the Black Dahlia Avenger, Steve writes that he’s angry that major papers, like the Los Angeles Times, have chosen to “ignore the story”. The reality, however, is more complicated. “When I found out what [Steve’s theory] was, it struck me as pretty spectacular,” Steven Lopez, the Times columnist, told me in an email. “An LAPD detective solves one of the most notorious unsolved murders in LA history, and the murderer is his father.” “But I was struck, in reading the book, by the fact that Hodell never sealed the deal,” wrote Lopez. “I thought he offered mostly circumstantial evidence, then acted as if the case was closed.” In fact, most people, aside from Steve, seem to have moved on from the case. Short’s two closest family members, her mother and her sister, are dead. Steven Kay, the district attorney who reviewed Steve’s files, declined to discuss the case for this article. Steve says he has long since given up on trying to sway law enforcement officials. “My judge and jury are the public” he said. “My readers.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Joe Dirt Context: Joe Dirt (David Spade) is an irrationally optimistic, 30-ish, southern-rock and muscle-car-loving, mullet-sporting, lovable loser working as a janitor at an L.A. radio station. Finding Joe an irresistable target for his sarcastic on-air wit, a Howard Stern-like deejay named Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller), puts Joe on the air to tell his story. For three days Zander and a growing legion of listeners are surprised to find themselves captivated, delighted, and occasionally repelled by Joe's incredible tale of his search to find the parents who referred to him as \\"Joe Dirt\\" (rather than by his real last name, which he can no longer remember) and left him sitting in a garbage can at the Grand Canyon when he was 8 years old. Thorughout the film, the story reverts for short periods back to the KXLA studio for dialogue between Joe and Zander.Pivotal to Joe's story is the past relationship he reveals between himself and Brandy (Brittany Daniel), a beautiful farm girl from his adopted hometown of Silvertown, Idaho. Joe feels that Brandy and his dog, Charlie, were the only real friends he ever had. After living in and leaving a series of bizarre foster homes, Joe met Brandy one winter when he was living in the woods outside Silvertown and Charlie's testicles became frozen to the front porch of Brandy's house. Brandy helped Joe and Charlie and for the next few years the three spent most of their time together.Believing that Brandy is \\"too hot\\" to ever love a guy like him, Joe is blind to the fact that she obviously has very real feelings for him. Complicating their relationship is Brandy's alcoholic father (Joe Don Baker) and the local Trans-Am-driving bully, Robby (Kid Rock). Brandy's father kills Joe's dog after it fails in a Lassie-like mission to free the father when he gets stuck on railroad tracks, resulting in the loss of his leg.The death of Charlie causes Joe to feel that he needs to take up the search for his mother and father. Joe is certain they did not leave him intentionally and must be looking for him too.... A:","output":"In the movie Joe Dirt, the title character is portrayed as having a mullet throughout his life, starting from his childhood. As a baby, Joe wore a mullet wig, which can be considered a humorous and exaggerated symbol of the cultural background and time period he grew up in. The film is set in the late 20th century, particularly in the 1980's and 1990's when the mullet hairstyle was quite popular, especially among certain demographics in the United States. It is plausible that the wig can signify his connection to the working-class, southern-rock, and muscle-car subcultures mentioned in the description. Moreover, the mullet wig serves as a key element of Joe's identity. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Joe's experience of being abandoned by his parents left him with a profound sense of not belonging. His unusual hairstyle can be interpreted as both an attempt to connect with his roots as well as an expression of his personal resilience and defiance against societal norms. In many ways, Joe Dirt's mullet represents his sense of individuality and a desire to be true to himself, regardless of the opinions and judgements of others. Joe Dirt's adventures throughout the movie often emphasize the importance of self-acceptance and personal growth. His mullet becomes a symbol of his journey, imparting a message that it is not one's appearance or circumstances that define them, but rather their character, actions, and decisions. The mullet wig, both as a baby and as an adult, serves as a constant reminder of who Joe is and where he came from, allowing him to remain grounded and authentic. In conclusion, Joe having a mullet wig as a baby serves multiple purposes in the movie, including representing the cultural background, providing a connection to his past, and symbolizing his sense of individuality. The wig is an essential aspect of his personal identity and helps to draw attention to the themes of self-acceptance, resilience, and personal growth that run throughout the film."},{"instruction":"Q: What do cells of dermal tissue secrete?

This judgment can be supported by several aspects mentioned in the text. First, the reviewer mentions that the establishment seemed to be confused about its identity, implying that it might not be completely focused on either a pub experience or a restaurant experience. The uncertainty around purpose or identity could contribute to inconsistencies in the offerings and execution of their services. The décor is described as \\"pretty and modernish,\\" which comes across as faint praise. While light-toned woods, colorful art, and a modernish aesthetic may be attractive to some, the reviewer does not seem particularly excited about these features. The mention of limited beer options also appears to be a downside, as this could detract from the overall experience of a pub for those who enjoy varied beverage choices. Moreover, the review highlights that the menu is small, which can be seen as a negative aspect for those who prefer a wider selection of dishes. Adding to this, the reviewer states that the items they tasted were decent but didn't stand out, suggesting that the food experience at this establishment was neither exceptional nor memorable. This also supports the notion that the review leans more towards negativity. In conclusion, while there are some elements that may be perceived as positive, such as the décor, these positives are not strong enough to outweigh the negative comments.

This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain, which would be emulated in countries around the world. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development. - Vermont is a state in the New England region of the northeast United States.

As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Finance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance. - Boston (pronounced ) is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States.

The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.7 million people in 2014 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country. Alternately, as a Combined Statistical Area (CSA), this wider commuting region is home to some 8.1 million people, making it the sixth-largest as such in the United States. - Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states, following New Jersey. Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The state also shares a short maritime border with New York. - New England is a geographical region comprising six states of the northeast United States: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and south, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and north, respectively. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the south. Boston is its largest city. Its largest metropolitan area is Greater Boston, which also includes Worcester (the second-largest city in New England), Manchester (the largest city in New Hampshire), and Providence (the capital and largest city of Rhode Island), with nearly a third of the entire region's population. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.

Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) What is most likely the author's occupation? A. not enough information B. a researcher C. works for American Heart Association D. a doctor Answer:","output":"D. a doctor"},{"instruction":"Choose from the options at the end. Are the following two questions the same? How do you sell a car with a lien? What is a lien on a car title? Select from the following. (i) no. (ii) yes. The answer is:","output":"(i) no. The two questions are not the same. They are related in terms of subject matter, as both questions deal with liens on a car. However, they are addressing different aspects of the topic. 1. \\"How do you sell a car with a lien?\\" This question is asking about the process of selling a car that has a lien on it. A lien is a legal claim or right against a piece of property (in this case, a car) to ensure that an outstanding debt or obligation is paid. When selling a car with a lien, the seller must take certain steps to ensure that the lien is properly paid off and released before transferring ownership of the car to the buyer. Here is a detailed answer to this question: To sell a car with a lien, follow these steps: a. Contact your lienholder: Reach out to the financial institution that holds the lien on your car. They can provide you with the current payoff amount for the loan, as well as any necessary paperwork and instructions for transferring the lien. b. Determine the value of your car: Research the current market value of your car using resources like Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds. This will help you set a fair asking price for potential buyers. c. Pay off the lien: In some cases, you may be able to pay off the lien with your own funds before selling the car. This will allow you to transfer the title to the buyer without involving the lienholder. If you cannot pay off the lien yourself, you may need to work with the lienholder and buyer to arrange for the loan to be paid off as part of the sales transaction. d. Prepare for the sale: Gather all necessary documents, such as the car's title, registration, bill of sale, and lien release (if you have already paid off the lien). It's also a good idea to have the car inspected and cleaned to make it more attractive to potential buyers. e. Advertise and negotiate: List your car for sale using online classifieds, social media, or word of mouth. Be prepared to negotiate on the price and communicate with potential buyers about the lien and any arrangements made with the lienholder. f. Complete the sale: Once you have agreed on a price and terms with a buyer, work with your lienholder to finalize the sale. Typically, this will involve the buyer paying off the lien directly to the lienholder and the lienholder releasing the lien and transferring the title to the buyer. 2. \\"What is a lien on a car title?\\" This question is asking for a definition or explanation of what a lien on a car title means. As mentioned earlier, a lien is a legal claim or right against a piece of property as collateral for a debt or obligation. In the context of a car title, a lien signifies that a financial institution or individual has a legal claim to the car as security for a loan or other obligation owed by the car owner. When a lien is placed on a car title, the financial institution or individual with the lien has the right to repossess the car if the owner defaults on their loan or other financial obligation. The lien will remain on the title until the debt is paid in full, at which point a lien release must be filed to remove the lien from the title. In summary, while both questions are related to liens on cars, they are not the same question. The first question deals with the process of selling a car that has a lien on it, while the second question is asking for an explanation of what a lien on a car title means."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. Input: In outbreak detection, one of the key issues is the need to deal with the weakness of early outbreak signals because this causes the detection model to have has less capability in terms of robustness when unseen outbreak patterns vary from those in the trained model. As a result, an imbalance between high detection rate and low false alarm rate occurs. To solve this problem, this study proposes a novel outbreak detection model based on danger theory; a bio-inspired method that replicates how the human body fights pathogens. We propose a signal formalization approach based on cumulative sum and a cumulative mature antigen contact value to suit the outbreak characteristic and danger theory. Two outbreak diseases, dengue and SARS, are subjected to a danger theory algorithm; namely the dendritic cell algorithm. To evaluate the model, four measurement metrics are applied: detection rate, specificity, false alarm rate, and accuracy. From the experiment, the proposed model outperforms the other detection approaches and shows a significant improvement for both diseases outbreak detection. The findings reveal that the robustness of the proposed immune model increases when dealing with inconsistent outbreak signals. The model is able to detect new unknown outbreak patterns and can discriminate between outbreak and non-outbreak cases with a consistent high detection rate, high sensitivity, and lower false alarm rate even without a training phase.

I asked the lady behind the counter if they had any books on “Wicca.” She got excited and whisked me off to the metaphysical section of the store. She told me she was pagan and started handing me book after book into my arms. Soon I could barely see over the books in my arms.

He wrote hundreds of political, folk, and children's songs, along with ballads and improvised works. His album of songs about the Dust Bowl period, Dust Bowl Ballads, is included on Mojo magazine's 100 Records That Changed The World. Many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress. During the Dust Bowl period, Guthrie joined the thousands of Okies who were migrating to California looking for work, leaving his wife and children in Texas. Many of his songs are concerned with the conditions faced by these working-class people. During the late part of that decade, he achieved fame with radio partner Maxine \\"Lefty Lou\\" Crissman as a broadcast performer of commercial hillbilly music and traditional folk music. Guthrie was making enough money to send for his family, who were still living in Texas. While appearing on the commercial radio station KFVD, owned by a populist-minded New Deal Democrat, Frank W. Burke, Guthrie began to write and perform some of the protest songs that would eventually appear on Dust Bowl Ballads. While at KFVD, Guthrie met newscaster Ed Robbin. Robbin was impressed with a song Guthrie wrote about political activist Thomas Mooney, believed by many to be wrongly convicted in a case that was a cause celebre of the time. Robbin, who became Guthrie's political mentor, introduced Guthrie to socialists and Communists in Southern California, including Will Geer (who, in turn, introduced Guthrie to John Steinbeck). Robbin remained Guthrie's lifelong friend, and helped Guthrie book benefit performances in the Communist circles in Southern California. Notwithstanding Guthrie's later claim that \\"the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party\\", he was never a member of the party. He was noted as a fellow traveler--an outsider who agreed with the platform of the party while not subject to party discipline. Guthrie wrote a column for the Communist newspaper, People's World. The column, titled \\"Woody Sez\\", appeared a total of 174 times from May 1939 to January 1940. \\"Woody Sez\\" was not explicitly political, but was about current events as observed by Guthrie. He wrote the columns in an exaggerated hillbilly dialect and usually included a small comic; they were published as a collection after Guthrie's death. Steve Earle said of Guthrie, \\"I don't think of Woody Guthrie as a political writer. He was a writer who lived in very political times.\\" With the outbreak of World War II and the non-aggression pact the Soviet Union had signed with Germany in 1939, the owners of KFVD radio did not want its staff \\"spinning apologia\\" for the Soviet Union. Both Robbin and Guthrie left the station. Without the daily radio show, his prospects for employment diminished, and Guthrie and his family returned to Pampa, Texas. Although Mary Guthrie was happy to return to Texas, Guthrie preferred to accept Will Geer's invitation to New York City and headed east.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Evashevski served as the head football coach at Hamilton College in 1941, Washington State University from 1950 to 1951, and the University of Iowa from 1952 to 1960, compiling a career record of 68-35-6. Evashevski's 1958 Iowa team went 8-1-1, winning the Big Ten Conference title and defeating the California Golden Bears in the 1959 Rose Bowl. \\"People in the Midwest are my people and I wanted to be back among them...And, of course, I don't have to tell you what I think of Big Ten football. It's the best in the country.\\" With those words, Evashevski left the Palouse in eastern Washington to become the University of Iowa's 19th head football coach. Evashevski nearly took the head coaching job at Indiana University, but Fritz Crisler urged him to consider Iowa. He felt that it would be easier to attain statewide support at Iowa than in Indiana, where Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame shared the spotlight. Evashevski was familiar with Iowa City from his stint with the Naval Pre-Flight School. Crisler was the man who recommended Evashevski to Iowa's athletic director, Paul Brechler. Crisler did warn Brechler, however, that Evashevski was \\"a tough, stubborn Polack, and you might have to put the reins on him.\\" In 1952, Iowa football had only had three winning seasons in the previous 16 years. Iowa had also gone without a Big Ten Conference title for three decades. A United Press International story named three football programs in 1952 with new coaches that would struggle to ever be competitive: Iowa, Indiana, and Pittsburgh. Iowa's first two opponents in 1952 were Pittsburgh and Indiana, and Iowa lost to both, starting the year 0-2. But Evashevski knew the Hawkeye program could be resurrected. When he came to Iowa, Evashevski was asked by a writer, \\"Do you think Iowa could ever really have a consistently winning team?\\" Evashevski snapped, \\"Why in the hell do you think I took the job?\\" Afterwards, a photographer noted, \\"I think that man truly believes he's the savior of Iowa football.\\" Entity:","output":"The text is about Forest \\"Evy\\" Evashevski, an American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Given the sentence \\"A man painting murals on the sidewalk.\\" is it true that \\"A man is using a brush.\\"?.

He shakes the hands of the pigs and tells them that he's joining up with the band. He pulls out his trumpet from his coat, and begins playing out of tune, much to the dismay of the pigs. The pigs throw him out through the emergency exit. The wolf tries to barge back in, but to no avail. As a result, he vows to \\"huff and puff and blow the house down\\".

The sale fell though so Robin had put the cart before the horse. And I was wondering Due to this Robin will feel how? A:","output":"Due to the situation, Robin is likely to experience a range of emotions and feelings. Here's a detailed breakdown of what she might be going through: 1. Disappointment: Robin was certain that she would make the sale, which is why she spent her commission prematurely. When the sale falls through, the first feeling she might experience is disappointment in herself for not being able to close the deal. This disappointment could be intensified by the fact that she was already counting on the money from the commission. 2. Frustration: Besides disappointment, Robin might also experience a sense of frustration. This could be directed towards herself for spending the commission ahead of time, or towards external factors that contributed to the sale falling through. This frustration might make her question her abilities or blame external circumstances for her failure. 3. Anxiety: As Robin spent her commission before making the sale, she might now be facing financial difficulties or struggling to make ends meet. This can cause anxiety about her financial stability, which could lead to stress and panic in her personal and professional life. 4. Regret: Robin will likely feel regret after realizing that she put the cart before the horse by spending her commission too soon. This regret might make her question her decision-making skills and create self-doubts in her abilities and judgment. 5. Embarrassment: The fact that others might be aware of Robin's premature spending could result in her feeling embarrassed about the situation. She might feel ashamed for being overly confident or too quick with her actions, leading to a hit on her self-esteem. 6. Determination: Despite the setback, Robin might also feel motivated and determined to overcome this failure and prove herself in future sales opportunities. This determination could push her to work harder, hone her skills and be more careful with her finances in the future. 7. Lesson Learned: Eventually, Robin may come to accept the situation as a valuable lesson learned. She might recognize the importance of not counting chickens before they hatch and strive to avoid such mistakes in the future. This realization can lead to personal growth and improved decision making in her career and personal life. In summary, Robin will likely experience a mix of emotions, including disappointment, frustration, anxiety, regret, embarrassment, determination, and personal growth. The extent of these feelings and the order in which they arise may vary depending on her personality and circumstances. However, it's essential for Robin to learn from this experience, manage her emotions effectively, and apply the lessons learned to prevent similar situations in the future."},{"instruction":"Q: Jordan went home after school and went straight to bed without any hesitation.

At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? There is a territorial waters dispute.","output":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"There is a territorial waters dispute,\\" does indeed follow from the provided text. From this text, we understand that there is a lingering dispute, a consequence of the 1965 war, over the demarcation of the maritime boundary. This conflict is expressed through the problems that fishermen from both sides of this unspecified boundary are currently experiencing. The inability of the fishing boats to determine when they have crossed into the other country's territory due to the lack of navigational tools reflects that the boundary in question is poorly defined on the field. Hence, this assertion is based on the fact that the maritime boundary dispute has not yet been definitively resolved. Moreover, this boundary dispute puts these fishermen potentially at risk as the inadvertent crossing of a maritime boundary might be interpreted as an intrusion into the other side's territory. This could lead to several problems, including detention of fishermen, confiscation of their boats, or international diplomatic incidents. This challenge that fishermen face emphasizes the complexities arising from the territorial waters disputes. However, without more specific context from the previous sentence, it's difficult to know who the \\"both sides\\" are and what specific part of the territorial waters are in dispute. The 1965 war reference could be between many different sets of countries, so the particular case in reference isn't lucid. In conclusion, while more information helps to fully comprehend the context of the dispute, the next sentence about the territorial waters dispute certainly follows from the given text. It adds up to the main idea being expressed - uncertainty and contentiousness in maritime boundaries affecting the day-to-day activities of fishermen."},{"instruction":"Karl Popper: In 2004, philosopher and psychologist Michel ter Hark (Groningen, The Netherlands) published a book, called Popper, Otto Selz and the rise of evolutionary epistemology, in which he claimed that Popper took some of his ideas from his tutor, the German psychologist Otto Selz.

Region A was favorable for sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria, while region B was more favorable for the developement of Non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes. But I can use this background: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.

After years of iPhone and iPod owners getting turned away for replacements because their devices indicated water damage, and thus a voided warranty, Apple has agreed to pay out 53 million in a class action suit. Settled: Apple has agreed to pay 53 million in class action suit that said it unfairly denied customers replacement devices. The settlement could affect hundreds of thousands of customers who brought their malfunctioning devices to Apple, only to be told they were no longer covered by warranties because a little sticker inside had turned a shade of pink or red. No matter the problem, the company refused to replace any device with a pink or red sticker and must now pay what amounts to about 200 per claimant in the suit. Only owners of original, 3G, and 3GS iPhones as well as first, second, and third generations of the iPod Touch are affected by the settlement. So, who’s to blame? Not us, says Apple. Signed Wednesday, the tech giant admitted to no wrongdoing in the settlement. The company that makes the ‘Liquid Indicator Strips,’ meanwhile, said their product may have been the culprit in so many voided warranties. Though Apple owns the patent to the strips, maker 3M indicated that humidity and not water contact could have turned some of the white stickers pink, misleading customer service representatives who examined the devices. Apple, nonetheless, may have learned of the issue years ago. Denied: For years, Apple routinely voided warranties to customers whose devices indicated water damage. According to a report in The Atlantic, the company ‘quietly tweaked’ its water damage policy in 2011 to be a little more giving. The policy now indicates that devices with an activated LCI may still be replaced ‘if a customer disputes’ that water made contact with the device as long as there are no signs of corrosion. However, the policy stopped short of faulting the indicator strips, which the policy says ‘are designed not to be activated by temperature or humidity that are within the product's operating requirements.’ That means newer devices were not covered in the suit, payouts for which could go up or down depending on number of claims submitted. Blame: Apple claimed no wrongdoing in the suit while makers of the 'Liquid Contact Indicator' strips admitted they may have been misleading.

A dazzling gem of old-school showbusiness, it seems only right that her living room ceilings scaled 30ft-high, and velvet drapes framed the vast windows. The 5,000-square-foot penthouse is held up by gold pillars. And in every corner of the opulent New York apartment sit stacks of index cards with jokes spanning her entire career. Scroll down for video. Opulent: The drawing room in Joan Rivers's Upper East Side condo is a sea of pink and gold velvet, with a piano in the corner, lit by three glittering chandeliers. The money shot: Stacks of the biting and controversial jokes that made Joan Rivers a star are scattered around the apartment. In progress: Among her extensive archive there were files of uncompleted jokes ready to be worked on. The comedienne, who died last week at the age of 81, once described the Upper East Side condo as 'where Marie Antoinette would have lived if she had the money'. The limestone mansion was built in 1910 for society figure John R Drexel and his socialite wife. In 1959, it welcomed Ernest Hemingway as a tenant in one of the one-bedroom apartments. He installed a study and hoped to write but found they city too oppressive and soon left. Tributes: Bouquets of flowers have been lain across the marble stairs outside the cast iron front door of the Manhattan apartment following Rivers's death. A pillar of showbusiness: Like Rivers, who died last week at 81, the New York apartment lined with pillars and mirrors is a star of the city, valued at around 35million. Renaissance style: Rivers once described her home with marble statues and cast-iron décor as 'where Marie Antoinette would live if she had the money' Sweeping: To get up to the glittering penthouse, next door to Bette Midler's home, the star would have to scale this vast marble staircase helped by a carved iron rail. Finally, in the 1980s, Rivers descended on the lavish property, called in developers to strip away layers of paint and coat it with gold. The Renaissance-themed bedroom has a four poster bed draped in white lace, surrounded by vases of white lilies and demure paintings. But the soft style is vamped up in one of the numerous living spaces, which has leopard-print carpet and deep red chairs. And the gregarious performer treated every day like a show as her bathroom looks like the backstage of a theatre. Elegant: The bedroom, complete with a four poster bed and lacy drapes and a permanent stock of fresh lilies, is 'as elegant and beautiful as she was', the realtor said. Backstage: She prepared for every day as if she was going to perform, starting in this bulb-lined bathroom which resembled backstage at a theatre. Painstaking: Never one to emerge without a made up face, Joan had an extensive collection of eyeliner, lip liner, eyelash curlers and mascara in little silver pots. Rivers had tried to sell the property a number of times. She first listed it on the market in 2009, when she planned to move to the West Coast to be closer to her daughter, Melissa Rivers. The latest attempt was in 2012 went it was listed with an asking price of 29.5 million. Now, it may be worth considerably more, with similar-sized apartments in the area on the market for 35 million. Cosy: This off-shoot of the vast living area is much smaller but still a treasure trove of silver, gold and pink, with a potted orchid and a mahogany table. Fashion police officer: This is a sneak peek inside the decadent wardrobe of the Fashion Police presenter, who revelled in slating other stars' sartorial mishaps. Exquisite: The living room, with a flat screen TV tucked into a book case, boasts a wood fire, framed artworks, and an oriental rug. Gregarious: The comedienne who entertained the world with her risque jokes spent her time in this leopard print room with stacks of books. In demand: In 2009, Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi allegedly asked to rent the penthouse of the limestone mansion with a cast-iron front door (right) One notable offer allegedly came from the Libyan dictator Muammur Gaddafi in 2009. According to Rivers, his advisers got in touch with her broker offering to rent it for 200,000 a week. She said at the time: 'I thought it was great.

C: Tom is very lazy and he does nothing every day. D: Tom eats some of the fruits and vegetables in his garden. The answer is:","output":"D: Tom eats some of the fruits and vegetables in his garden. The article provides various details about Tom and his garden. It states that Tom manages to grow the most beautiful flowers, fruits, and vegetables in the village throughout the entire year. While he does sell most of them in the market, it is also mentioned that Tom does occasionally cut some flowers for his sitting-room table and enjoys eating a portion of the fruits and vegetables himself. This information directly supports option D as the correct answer. Option A is incorrect as the article specifically mentions that Tom sits under his orange tree, which means that he does have an orange tree in his garden. Option B can't be confirmed as true since the article doesn't mention Tom giving away flowers to the villagers. It only states that he cuts some flowers for himself and sells the rest in the market. Option C is not entirely true. Although the article mentions Tom's laziness and the fact that he listens to his radio all day, it also emphasizes that he plants flowers, fruits, and vegetables during all four seasons - spring, summer, autumn, and winter. While he may not put in the same level of work as others, the article doesn't support the idea that he does nothing every day.

To understand the reasons behind this, let's break down the sentence and analyze its different components: 1. The sentence starts with \\"an encyclopedia of cliches,\\" which implies that the subject contains repetitive, unoriginal, or overused elements. This is considered a negative aspect as it does not provide any fresh or innovative content to the audience. 2. The phrase \\"shoplifts shamelessly\\" further emphasizes a negative sentiment, as the word \\"shamelessly\\" indicates a lack of restraint or remorse in reproducing material from other sources. This suggests that the subject is not only unoriginal but also does so without any sense of guilt or acknowledging its lack of creativity. 3. The sentence mentions \\"farewell-to-innocence movies\\" such as \\"The Wanderers\\" and \\"A Bronx Tale\\" as sources from which the subject \\"shoplifts.\\" By referencing these movies, the writer implies that the subject attempts to replicate the success of these well-regarded films but fails to do so. 4. The phrase \\"without cribbing any of their intelligence\\" serves as a final critique by highlighting that the subject not only borrows aspects from more successful films but also misses out on the intelligence and depth that made those movies worth watching. By stating this, the writer confirms that the subject is indeed inferior in comparison. In conclusion, the sentiment of the given sentence is undeniably negative, as it criticizes the subject for its lack of originality, shameless reproduction of material from more successful movies, and failure to capture the intelligent and engaging aspects of the films it attempts to imitate."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Gordon Brown was the leader of the Labour Party and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2010. The Lisbon Treaty, formally known as the Treaty of Lisbon, was signed by representatives of European Union (EU) member states on December 13, 2007, and entered into force on December 1, 2009. The treaty aimed to streamline the EU's decision-making process, reform its institutions, and enhance its role in global affairs. Although Gordon Brown was the Prime Minister who signed the treaty for the United Kingdom, his decision to do so was not without controversy. Brown skipped the initial signing ceremony, which took place in Lisbon, Portugal, on December 13, 2007. Instead, he signed it a few hours later, separately from other EU leaders. This decision was seen by some as an attempt to distance himself and the UK from the EU integration process and appease Eurosceptic elements within the United Kingdom. The Lisbon Treaty significantly altered the workings of the European Union. Some of its major provisions and effects include: 1. Introduction of the European Council President: To streamline decision-making and provide continuity, the treaty established the position of a full-time President of the European Council, who would be appointed for a 2.5-year term, renewable once. 2. Expansion of the role of the High Representative: The treaty created the role of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, effectively combining the positions of the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Commissioner for External Relations. This official would represent the EU in foreign policy matters, helping to provide a unified voice. 3. Changes in the voting system: The Lisbon Treaty introduced a new qualified majority voting system in the Council of the European Union, which was designed to make decision-making more efficient by basing it on a double majority of member states (representing at least 65% of the EU's population). 4. Strengthening the European Parliament: The treaty gave the European Parliament more power, including the authority to co-decide with the Council on a majority of legislative proposals put forth by the European Commission. 5. Increased cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs: Several measures were put in place to enhance cooperation among member states in justice and home affairs, including a more efficient decision-making process and the expansion of Europol's mandate. 6. Enhanced role for national parliaments: The Lisbon Treaty granted national parliaments greater powers in participating and monitoring EU legislation, making them an active part of the decision-making process. In summary, Gordon Brown, as the British Prime Minister, signed the Lisbon Treaty, which brought about significant changes to the European Union's decision-making process, institutions, and global presence. Although controversial at the time, the treaty has had a lasting impact on the EU and its member states, including the United Kingdom, until its departure from the EU with Brexit in 2020."},{"instruction":"Please write a short summary for the following article: Hundley drives in four as Padres best Phillies San Diego, CA – Nick Hundley smacked a two-run home run, drove in four runs and scored twice as the San Diego Padres won back-to-back games for the first time this season with a 6-1 decision over the Philadelphia Phillies on Sunday.

We want to find out what \\"b\\" is. Here's our problem: 4*b + 0*b + 56 + 54 = 9*b First, let's simplify what we can: 0*b equals to 0 (since anything multiplied by 0 is 0, imagine if you had 0 apples, no matter how many times you multiply it, you will not have more apples) 56 + 54 can be added together which will give us 110 (you can double check by adding the numbers to each other) Now our problem looks like this: 4*b + 110 = 9*b To solve for b, we want the b's on one side and the numbers on the other side. Let's move the 4*b from the left side to the right side by subtracting 4*b from both sides: 110 = 9*b - 4*b Now, subtract 4*b from 9*b: 110 = 5*b Almost there! Now we need to find out what b is. To do that, we need to divide both sides by 5: 110 ÷ 5 = 5*b ÷ 5 22 = b Yay! We found out that b is 22.

Who introduced the term in group and out group? Let's have some stream of consciousness first.","output":"The terms \\"ingroup\\" and \\"outgroup\\" were introduced by the social psychologist Henri Tajfel in the early 1970s. Tajfel, along with his colleagues, conducted several studies to examine the psychological processes underlying social categorization, group formation, and social identity formation. These ideas were developed as part of his broader work on Social Identity Theory. The concept of ingroup/outgroup came about by analyzing how individuals psychologically categorize themselves and others into different social groups. The ingroup refers to the social group to which a person feels a sense of belonging and identifies with, often showing loyalty and bias towards its members. The outgroup consists of individuals who are not a part of one's ingroup, and are often seen as different or separate. This distinction can lead to discrimination, prejudice, and negative attitudes when comparing one's own group with another. Henri Tajfel's studies, particularly the minimal group paradigm, demonstrated that people could quickly develop a sense of belonging to a group, even when the categorization criteria were arbitrary or trivial. This groundbreaking research showed the importance of the ingroup/outgroup distinction in understanding human behavior, prejudice, and social identity."},{"instruction":"Quinn heard the ice cream truck and couldn't find any money.

Cold can affect other parts of the body.The expression \\"get cold feet\\" has nothing to do with cold or your feet.The expression means being afraid to do something you have decided to do.For example, you agree to be president of an organization.But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned, and all the work of the organizations will be your responsibility.You are likely to get cold feet about being president when you understand the situation. The expression \\"give someone the cold shoulder\\" probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone, instead of speaking to him face to face.You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you.Or, to someone who has lied about you to others. A cold fish is not a fish.It is a person.But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional and shows no love or warmth.A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone.Someone who is a cold fish could be cold-hearted.Now a cold-hearted person is someone who has no sympathy.Several popular songs in recent years were about cold-hearted men or cold-hearted women who, without feelings, broke the hearts of their lovers. \\"Out in the cold\\" means not getting something that everybody else got.A person might say that everybody but him got a pay raise----he was left out in the cold.And it is not a pleasant place to be.

Watch out for basal cell carcinoma. Recognize the characteristics of melanoma. Notice squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Keep track of lesions.","output":"Title: Performing a Skin Survey: Detect Early Signs of Skin Cancer Introduction Skin cancer is one of the most encountered forms of cancer worldwide. With early detection, it becomes easier to treat and manage. Therefore, it is crucial to be aware of the different types of skin cancer and recognize their early signs. This article delves into performing a skin survey and identifying basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Monitoring lesions and keeping track of any changes in their appearance will also be addressed. Performing a Skin Survey A skin survey is a self-assessment conducted to examine your skin for signs of cancer regularly. It is crucial to perform skin checks at least once a month, during which you should survey your body from head to toe. Make use of a full-length mirror and a handheld mirror to inspect hard-to-see areas and ensure you cover every part of your body, including the scalp, face, neck, chest, arms, back, legs, feet, and nails. Check for the appearance of new moles and marks or any changes in the existing ones. Basal Cell Carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer. It arises in the basal cells, which are found in the lower layers of the epidermis (the outermost layer of the skin). BCC usually appears on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, neck, and arms. It can take several forms: 1. Pearly or translucent bumps with visible blood vessels 2. Raised, red patches 3. Smooth, shiny bumps that may be pink or red 4. Scaly, flat patches with irregular borders 5. Open sores that don't heal, or heal but continue to resurface Watch out for unusual bumps and sores that persist for weeks or grow in size. Consult a dermatologist if you suspect a BCC lesion. Melanoma Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer. It arises from melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin pigment responsible for skin color. Melanoma can form in existing moles or develop as new marks on the skin. To recognize melanoma, follow the ABCDE rule: 1. Asymmetry: Half of the mole does not match the other half. 2. Border: The edges are irregular, ragged, or blurred. 3. Color: The mole exhibits a variety of colors, such as black, brown, tan, red, or white. 4. Diameter: The size is larger than the width of a pencil eraser (approximately 6 millimeters). 5. Evolving: The mole changes in size, shape, color, or appearance. If you notice any of these signs, contact a dermatologist for examination and diagnosis. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) SCC is another common type of skin cancer that originates from squamous cells, which make up most of the skin's upper layers. SCC often appears on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, ears, neck, and hands. Signs of SCC include: 1. Crusty or scaly patches with irregular borders 2. Elevated, firm bumps that may be red or brown 3. Open sores that don't heal or heal but repeatedly return 4. Wart-like growths If you notice any of these signs, consult a dermatologist for evaluation and treatment. Keeping Track of Lesions It is essential to keep track of any skin lesions that emerge or change. Take photographs of your skin and compare them over time. Note the location, size, and appearance of moles and marks to monitor any changes. Share this information with your dermatologist during your visits to facilitate early detection and treatment of potential skin cancers. Conclusion Performing a skin survey and recognizing the early signs of basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma is crucial in detecting and treating skin cancer. Keeping track of lesions and consulting a dermatologist when needed can significantly improve the chances of successful treatment and recovery. Always remember that prevention is better than cure: practice sun safety and protect your skin from excessive sun exposure."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Written primarily by George Mason, the resolutions rejected the British Parliament's claim of supreme authority over the American colonies. More than thirty counties in Virginia passed similar resolutions in 1774, \\"but the Fairfax Resolves were the most detailed, the most influential, and the most radical.\\" - The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as \\"habeas corpus\\". Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles. The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies and the formation of the American Constitution in 1787, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States. Research by Victorian historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries. - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America. - The Mason family of Virginia is a historically significant American political family of English origin, whose prominent members are known for their accomplishments in politics, business, and the military. The progenitor of the Mason family, George Mason I (5 June 16291686), arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on the ship \\"Assurance\\" in 1652. Mason was a Cavalier member of the Parliament of England during the reign of Charles I of England. George Mason I's great-grandson was George Mason IV (11 December 17257 October 1792), an American patriot, statesman, and delegate from Virginia to the U.S. Constitutional Convention. Along with James Madison, George Mason IV is known as the \\"Father of the Bill of Rights.\\" For these reasons, Mason is considered one of the \\"Founding Fathers\\" of the United States and raised the Mason family to national political prominence. - The Bill of Rights is the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 178788 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). - George Mason I (5 June 1629 1686) was the American progenitor of the prominent American landholding and political Mason family. Mason was the great-grandfather of George Mason IV, a Founding Father of the United States. - George Mason ( sometimes referred to as George Mason IV ) ( December 11 , 1725 -- October 7 , 1792 ) was a Virginia planter , politician , and a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787 , one of three men who refused to sign . His writings , including substantial portions of the Fairfax Resolves of 1774 , the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 , and his Objections to this Constitution of Government ( 1787 ) in opposition to ratification of the constitution , have been a significant influence on political thought and events . The Virginia Declaration of Rights served as a basis for the United States Bill of Rights , of which he has been deemed the father . Mason was born in 1725 , most likely in present - day Fairfax County , Virginia . Mason 's father died when he was young , and his mother managed the family estates until he came of age . He married in 1750 , built Gunston Hall , and lived the life of a country squire , supervising his lands , family and slaves . Mason briefly served in the House of Burgesses and involved himself in community affairs , sometimes serving with his neighbor , George Washington . As tensions between Britain and the American colonies grew , Mason came to support the colonial side , and used his knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause , finding ways to work around the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the rebel Virginia Conventions of 1775 and 1776 . Mason prepared the first draft of the Declaration of Rights in 1776 , and his words formed much of the text adopted by the final Virginia Convention . He also wrote a constitution for the state ; others who sought to have the convention adopt their ideas , like Thomas Jefferson , found Mason 's version could not be stopped . During the war , he was a member of the powerful lower house of the Virginia General Assembly , the House of Delegates , but to the irritation of Washington and others , refused to serve in the Continental Congress in Philadelphia , citing health and family commitments . Named one... - The Colony of Virginia (also known frequently as the Virginia Colony, the Province of Virginia, and occasionally as the Dominion and Colony of Virginia or His Majesty's Most Ancient Colloney and Dominion of Virginia) was the first permanently settled English colony in North America. Newfoundland, with seasonal settlements, had been established as a colony by Royal Charter in 1583. American archaeologist William Kelso says Virginia \\"is where the British Empire began ... this was the first colony in the British Empire.\\" The colony existed briefly during the 16th century, and then continuously from 1607 until the American Revolution (as a British colony after 1707). The name Virginia was first applied by Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. After the English Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed \\"The Old Dominion\\" by King Charles II for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the Commonwealth of England. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Virginia Declaration of Rights is a document drafted in 1776 to proclaim the inherent rights of men, including the right to reform or abolish \\"inadequate\\" government. It influenced a number of later documents, including the United States Declaration of Independence (1776) and the United States Bill of Rights (1789). - The Bill of Rights is an Act of the Parliament of England that deals with constitutional matters and sets out certain basic civil rights. Passed on 16 December 1689, it is a restatement in statutory form of the Declaration of Rights presented by the Convention Parliament to William and Mary in February 1689, inviting them to become joint sovereigns of England. The Bill of Rights lays down limits on the powers of the monarch and sets out the rights of Parliament, including the requirement for regular parliaments, free elections, and freedom of speech in Parliament. It sets out certain rights of individuals including the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and reestablished the liberty of Protestants to have arms for their defence within the rule of law. Furthermore, the Bill of Rights described and condemned several misdeeds of James II of England. - The Declaration of Independence is the statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State House (Independence Hall) in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies, then at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain, regarded themselves as thirteen newly independent sovereign states, and no longer under British rule. Instead they formed a new nationthe United States of America. John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was passed on July 2 with no opposing vote cast. A committee of five had already drafted the formal declaration, to be ready when Congress voted on independence. The term \\"Declaration of Independence\\" is not used in the document itself.

Firstly, the statement presents a specific situation of children playing in the water on a sunny day. It doesn't mention the time of day, so it could be any time - morning, afternoon, or even evening. There is no explicit indication that this activity occurs after school hours. Secondly, the statement does not provide any information about the frequency or consistency of this activity. Even if we were to assume that the children are playing in the water during after-school hours, we cannot definitively conclude that this is something that happens regularly. It could be a one-time event or part of a special occasion such as a weekend outing or a holiday. Moreover, the statement does not specify which or how many children are involved in this water play. It could refer to a small group of children who enjoy playing in the water regularly, or it could be referring to a larger group participating in a one-off event. Without further information about the children involved, their ages, or their backgrounds, we cannot generalize the statement to all children. Additionally, we should also consider the geographical and cultural context. Children's activities are influenced by their environment as well as cultural norms and habits. For example, children residing in coastal areas or warmer climates might be more likely to engage in water play regularly, while kids in colder climates might not have the same opportunity. Cultural factors can further influence the scheduling of activities and children's leisure time. Lastly, it is important to take into account the different types of water play that children could be engaging in. This could range from swimming in a pool, playing in the ocean, splashing in puddles, or even participating in water fights. The type of water play involved could affect when and how often children participate in this activity, as well as whether it could be linked to their daily routines, such as after school. In conclusion, the statement \\"Children playing in water on a sunny day\\" does not provide enough information for us to definitively conclude that \\"kids play in water after school.\\" To make such a conclusion, we would need more details about the timing, frequency, context, and types of water play, along with the specific children involved. Without additional context, it would be unwise to make generalizations based on a single statement."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

If I stayed up past 1:30 am, I wouldn't get any work done. I'd be falling asleep at my computer. My classes begin at 7:30 am. I'm partly awake in my first class. By the second, I'm a little sleepy. By my third class, I'm sleepy. By midday I'm finally fully awake. But by 3:00 pm, I'm slowing down again. Yet I get more sleep than usual students. Most American high schools seem to have a similar problem with sleepy students. High school classes start at 7:30 am, so students have to get up one and a half hours before that to get ready and catch the bus. It's believed that lack of sleep can be bad for both grades and health. Some schools are paying attention. Classes in those schools start at 8:30 am. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the reading? Options: A: The writer usually stays up past 1:30 am. B: The writer usually goes to bed around midnight. C: The writer usually does a survey. D: Many American students don't get enough sleep, so they can have high grades.

Peter Hall directed the Bayreuth Ring after Chéreau. His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include Helga Dernesch who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967. Lotte Lehmann played Wellgunde at the Hamburg State Opera between 1912 and 1914 and the Vienna State Opera in 1916. Recorded Rhinemaidens have included Sena Jurinac for Furtwängler and RAI, Lucia Popp and Gwyneth Jones for Georg Solti, and Helen Donath and Edda Moser for Karajan.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: To answer this question, we must consider various factors influencing human behavior and the constantly changing nature of the world. Firstly, people have free will, and their choices are influenced by multiple factors, including their upbringing, socio-economic status, cultural factors, and personal beliefs. Moreover, individuals are often shaped by their past experiences that contribute to their decision-making process. Predicting the outcome of every individual's choices without considering all these factors would be nearly impossible. In addition to personal factors, external factors also play a significant role in determining people's actions. These can include environmental conditions, technological advancements, political climate, and social dynamics. The unpredictability of these factors adds even more complexity to the already intricate process of predicting human behavior. Furthermore, the butterfly effect, a concept in chaos theory, states that small changes in initial conditions can have a dramatic impact on the outcome of complex and nonlinear systems. The world is a vast and intertwined system, making it extremely difficult to predict if a tiny change could lead to drastically different outcomes. Lastly, the concept of prediction in itself is not absolute, as it is based on the probabilities of various outcomes occurring. Even the most sophisticated models utilizing historical data, algorithms, and other tools cannot guarantee 100% accuracy of their predictions. Taking all these factors into account, it becomes clear that, due to the complexity and ever-changing nature of the world and the myriad of influences that affect individual choices and actions, it is not possible to tell whether we can predict the outcome of every person's decisions."},{"instruction":"Goal: refrigerator Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"As an AI, it seems that there might be some missing information regarding the provided goal and the methods to accomplish it.

Carlos runs around the entire block in 3 minutes. Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"To find the average time for the racers, we first need to determine the total time spent by both racers, and then divide that time by the number of racers. Step 1: Convert the minutes into seconds. Carlos takes 3 minutes to complete the block, which is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 seconds. Diego takes 2.5 minutes to complete half the block, which is equal to 2.5 * 60 = 150 seconds. Step 2: Find the pace of Diego to calculate his time for the entire block Diego's pace can be calculated as Distance / Time. In this case, it is half a block / 150 seconds. To determine his hypothetical time for the entire block, we need to find the time it would have taken him to run the entire block at the same pace. Diego's pace: (1/2 block) / 150 seconds = 1 block / x seconds Solving for x: x = (1 block * 150 seconds) / (1/2 block) = 300 seconds Step 3: Calculate the average time. Now we have the actual time for Carlos (180 seconds) and the hypothetical time for Diego (300 seconds). We can find the average time by adding these together and then dividing by the number of racers (2). Average time = (Carlos's time + Diego's time) / number of racers = (180 seconds + 300 seconds) / 2 = 480 seconds / 2 = 240 seconds Therefore, the average time for the racers would have been 240 seconds, assuming Diego kept up the same speed for the entire race."},{"instruction":"Which effect of stress could cause death if not treated immediately? Options: - age grieving person - heart attacks - depression - hair loss - headache Step-by-step reasoning process below:","output":"Among the options provided, heart attacks are the most likely to cause death if not treated immediately. Step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Age grieving person: While stress can be a factor in aging, this would not cause immediate death. People can experience stress due to grief, but this is not a direct cause of death. 2. Heart attacks: Chronic stress can increase the risk of heart attacks by raising blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triggering inflammation. Heart attacks occur when blood flow to the heart is blocked, depriving the heart muscles of oxygen. If not treated immediately, heart attacks can cause severe damage to the heart or even death. 3. Depression: While stress can lead to depression, and depression can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or actions, it is not as immediately life-threatening as heart attacks. Treatment for depression involves therapy and medications, and these interventions can take time to show results. 4. Hair loss: Stress can cause hair loss, but this is neither life-threatening nor a cause of immediate death. 5. Headache: Headaches can be a result of stress but do not pose an immediate risk of death. Moreover, they can be treated with over-the-counter pain relievers and other stress management techniques. In conclusion, heart attacks are the most immediate life-threatening effect of stress among these options and require urgent medical attention to prevent death."},{"instruction":"The last (I believe) of the movies The Boys made with Hal Roach, this is also the last truly funny film they made, before going to 20th century fox, which so famously misued their talents.

Irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next. This type of migration is normally associated with food availability. Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and subdominant males, migrates. Partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in Australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory. Altitudinal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes elevations and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability.

Phelps, 29, was sentenced to a year in prison, but the prison sentence is suspended. He must be on probation for a year and a half. The swimmer was contrite in court, with his attorney detailing his pursuit of sobriety since his arrest, including 45 days of inpatient treatment in Arizona. A letter from his doctor there was glowing, saying he was forthright and cooperative. Phelps also is attending Alcoholics Anonymous and is continuing with therapy in Maryland. “I now have the tools to move past this. What I did was wrong, and I made a bad mistake. I’m looking forward to having a much brighter future than I had in the past,” Phelps told the judge. Judge Nathan Braverman told Phelps that success overcoming alcohol would not come overnight, and warned him of the consequences of another slip-up. “You don’t need a lecture from the court,” Braverman said. “If you haven’t gotten the message by now, or forget the message, the only option is jail.” Phelps was arrested Sept. 30. Documents show he was stopped for speeding and crossing the double yellow line while driving in the Fort McHenry Tunnel. Police say Phelps registered a .14 percent on a blood-alcohol test. The legal limit is .08 percent in Maryland. The officer who interviewed Phelps noted in his report that he pulled Phelps over for going 84 mph in a 45 mph zone. The officer wrote that he smelled alcohol in the car and on Phelps’ breath, and that the swimmer’s speech was “mush-mouthed” and his eyes were red and bloodshot. When the officer asked the 18-time gold medalist to stand on one leg as part of a sobriety test, Phelps replied, “that’s not happening,” according to a police report. Phelps also appeared “disoriented and argumentative” when placed under arrest and asked to take the sobriety test again, this time by the side of the road. Ultimately though, Phelps did not re-attempt the test and was taken to the station for processing. Afterward, an officer dropped Phelps off at his home in Baltimore, according to the Maryland Transportation Authority Police. It was not Phelps’ first brush with the law, or with drinking and driving. His first DUI arrest came in 2004 on the Eastern Shore of Maryland when he was 19. He was sentenced to probation and required to talk to high school students about alcohol awareness. Phelps pleaded guilty to the charges, but as a young first-time offender he avoided conviction. “I recognize the seriousness of this mistake,” he said at the time. “I’ve learned from this mistake and will continue learning from this mistake for the rest of my life.” Another embarrassment for Phelps came in 2009, when a British tabloid newspaper published a photo of him using a marijuana pipe at a party in South Carolina. Afterward, Phelps was suspended from USA swimming for three months and one of his major sponsors, Kellogg Co., dropped him. Before the latest arrest, Phelps came out of retirement with his sights set on competing at a fifth Olympics in Rio. The plea is not expected to have any impact on those plans. He has returned to training and a six-month suspension imposed by USA Swimming ends on March 6, allowing him to swim the final three events on the U.S. Grand Prix schedule. Phelps might also seek to add some international meets to beef up his 2015 schedule, since he is also banned from swimming in next summer’s world championships in Russia. “We’re looking at a lot of different options for competition,” his coach, Bob Bowman, told The Associated Press in a recent interview. “We’re just taking it one day at a time. He’s back in training, and we’re seeing how things go. We’ll look at things in March and really go from there.” Phelps retired after the 2012 London Olympics but changed his mind a year later. Bowman said the swimmer was in much better shape, even after his DUI arrest and taking time off, than he was during his initial return to the pool. Phelps won three golds and two silvers at one of the biggest meets of the 2014, the Pan Pacific Championships in August. He was named the male athlete of the year by USA Swimming.

Please write the text above using proper case.","output":"Sure, let's rearrange your sentence using proper case and standard sentence syntax. \\"The Neems are celebrating the transition with a glass of champagne.\\" Here's the breakdown: 1. The beginning of the sentence \\"The\\" was already capitalized, so no modifications were required. 2. The word \\"neem’s\\" seemed to be a typo, where the apostrophe suggested a possessive noun, while the context of the sentence suggested otherwise. Thus, I've interpreted 'neem’s' as a proper noun \\"Neems,\\" assuming it may be a family or group name, for example. And, it's always recommended to capitalize the initial of a proper noun. 3. The rest of the sentence was already in correct case and the nouns were neither at the beginning of the sentence nor were they proper nouns, so they didn't require capitalization. 4. The end of sentence is always followed by a full stop (period), for correct punctuation which was already correct here. Therefore, no modifications were needed there too."},{"instruction":"Lizzy: Mr. Grey is purchasing gifts for his family. So far he has purchased 3 polo shirts for 26 each; 2 necklaces for 83 each; and 1 computer game for 90. Since Mr. Grey purchased all those using his credit card, he received a 12 rebate. What is the total cost of the gifts after the rebate?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"To calculate the total cost of the gifts after the rebate, we need to first determine the original cost of each item and then subtract the rebate amount from the total. First, we calculate the cost of the polo shirts: 3 polo shirts × 26 each = 78 Next, we calculate the cost of the necklaces: 2 necklaces × 83 each = 166 Now, we can add the cost of the computer game: 1 computer game = 90 We find the original total cost before the rebate by adding the costs of each item together: 78 (polo shirts) + 166 (necklaces) + 90 (computer game) = 334 Now, we need to subtract the rebate from the original total cost: 334 (original total cost) - 12 (rebate) = 322 So, the total cost of the gifts after the rebate is 322."},{"instruction":"Given an entity, a before event, an after event, and an attribute related to the entity, generate a sentence as output.

This battle was fought between the Union Army, led by Major General Ulysses S. Grant, and the Confederate Army, led by General Albert Sidney Johnston and his second-in-command, General P.G.T. Beauregard. Ultimately, the Union Army emerged victorious, but the battle was one of the bloodiest in the entire conflict. The Battle of Shiloh occurred in southwestern Tennessee and was primarily the result of the Union Army's attempt to capture the crucial railroad hub of Corinth, Mississippi. As part of this effort, General Grant had established a forward base at Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River. This base was intended to act as a staging area for an advance on Corinth. As the Union Army gathered at Pittsburg Landing, General Johnston chose to attack Grant's forces before they could unite with another Union force, led by General Don Carlos Buell. The Confederate Army launched a surprise attack on the encamped Union troops early on April 6th. The Union forces were initially taken aback and suffered significant casualties, being pushed back towards the Tennessee River. However, over the course of the day, the Union lines held, with fierce fighting and high casualties on both sides. General Johnston was mortally wounded during the battle and was succeeded by General Beauregard. That night, a large reinforcement of Union troops under General Buell arrived, bolstering the Union ranks and strength. Consequently, on the morning of April 7th, the combined forces of Generals Grant and Buell counterattacked. The Confederate forces, now under the leadership of General Beauregard, were forced to withdraw in the face of the renewed Union offensive, leaving the battlefield to the Union Army. While the Union Army suffered heavy casualties with an estimated 13,000 soldiers killed, wounded, or captured, the Confederate forces fared even worse, with an estimated 10,700 soldiers killed, wounded, or captured in the two days of fighting. General Grant's victory at Shiloh was a much-needed morale boost for the Union and further solidified his reputation as an effective military leader. The Battle of Shiloh holds significance in the broader context of the Civil War for several reasons. First, it underlined the increasing scale and brutality that would characterize the conflict, with both sides suffering staggering losses in just two days. Second, it demonstrated the strategic importance of controlling the transportation networks in the Western Theater, particularly the railroads. Finally, it marked a critical turning point in Grant's career, setting the stage for his eventual rise to overall command of Union forces, culminating in his eventual role as the key architect of Union victory in the Civil War. In summary, the Union Army, led by Major General Ulysses S. Grant, won the Battle of Shiloh against the Confederate Army, commanded by General Albert Sidney Johnston and later General P.G.T. Beauregard. This hard-fought Union victory inflicted crippling losses on the Confederate forces and marked a crucial step towards the eventual Union triumph in the American Civil War."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

Twelve years later, Rebecca returns as a young woman to find that Tommy (Matt Smith) not only remembers her, but still cares deeply for her. The two begin a new relationship. Tommy is a political activist fighting against the biotech corporations, who plan to open a new natural park populated by animals artificially created by cloning. Tommy plans to spoil the inauguration ceremony by letting loose rucksacks filled with cockroaches.

Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full.

Panetta will recommend to Congress that military salaries be limited to a 1% increase in 2014. The Pentagon has calculated that the Labor Department's 2014 Employment Cost Index is expected to be above 1% but wants to still cut back on pay because of \\"budget uncertainties,\\" a department official told CNN. In 2013, a 1.7% increase was approved, based on the index, which has been the basis for military pay for the last several years. Three Pentagon officials have confirmed details of the plan to CNN. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have also agreed to Panetta's proposed pay plan. Final approval for the pay would come from Congress in the form of the 2014 budget. The recommendation is tied to the Defense Department's 2014 budget recommendation, which was expected to be sent to Congress this month, one of the officials said. But the officials acknowledge it is going to be seen as an effort to push Congress to stop the automatic budget cuts that could go into effect if no deal is reached on spending reductions. ALSO: Panetta warns spending cuts will degrade military readiness The decision comes as the secretary is stepping up the rhetoric about dire cuts at the Pentagon if sequestration goes into effect. President Obama in 2012 walled off military pay from cuts, so if this current pay plan goes into effect, it's widely seen as \\"cutting our pay,\\" one military officer familiar with the plan told CNN. \\"It's a smart move, it puts it in Congress' hands,\\" he said. Panetta, in one of his last official speeches as secretary of defense, told an audience at Georgetown University on Wednesday that the Pentagon faced \\"the most serious readiness crisis in over a decade.\\" The defense secretary outlined a series of possible cuts should the Pentagon be forced to find half a trillion dollars more in savings. He warned that 800,000 civilian workers could furloughed for 22 days and that the Army would need to cut back on training and maintenance, putting two-thirds of combat teams at \\"reduced readiness levels.\\" Pacific naval operations could be cut by as much a third, and Air Force flying hours and weapons maintenance could be cut. CNN has also learned that this week, the Navy is expected to announce it does not have the money to pay for refueling and maintenance of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln. That will essentially mean the Navy is short a carrier and overseas deployments will be cut. \\"No good options exist,\\" Panetta said. ||||| Washington (CNN) -- Furloughed workers, reduced combat readiness, shrunken naval operations and cuts to Air Force flying hours and weapons maintenance. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta listed those consequences as he provided a stark warning on Wednesday about the effects of impending budget cuts on the military unless Congress acts to avert them. The result, he said, would be \\"the most serious readiness crisis\\" faced by the armed services in over a decade. Panetta's address at Georgetown University, which he called \\"hopefully one of my last speeches as secretary of defense,\\" included the first details of how the Pentagon would deal with the automatic spending cuts -- or sequestration in congressional jargon -- set to trigger March 1 across federal agencies. For the Pentagon, sequestration would mean almost 500 billion in cuts over 10 years. For 2013 alone, some 46 billion in reduced spending would result in \\"a serious disruption in defense programs and a sharp decline in our military readiness,\\" Panetta said. Opinion: How to avoid job-killing budget cuts \\"There are no good options\\" to deal with the situation, he continued, saying 46,000 department jobs would be at risk and more damaging measures in coming months could include: -- Furloughing as many as 800,000 civilian workers for up to 22 days; -- Cutting back on Army training and maintenance, which would reduce readiness of combat brigades outside Afghanistan; -- Shrinking naval operations; and, -- Reducing Air Force flying hours and weapons systems maintenance. \\"This is not a game. This is reality,\\" Panetta said, his voice rising. \\"These steps would seriously damage a fragile American economy and they would degrade our ability to respond to crisis precisely at a time of rising instability across the globe.\\" His comments sought to increase pressure on Republicans and Democrats to reach agreement on deficit-reduction steps, thereby avoiding the across-the-board spending cuts of sequestration that were part of a 2011 deal that raised the federal debt ceiling. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama called for a short-term deal to put off the cuts so Congress could continue work on a permanent fix that provides desired reductions in the federal deficit. Obama made clear that he still wants a broader deficit-reduction agreement with Republicans that includes spending cuts, some entitlement reforms and increased revenue from eliminating some tax breaks. However, Obama said, with time running out before the sequestration cuts slash government spending and result in job losses and economic slowdown, Congress should pass a temporary fix that would allow time for further negotiations on a broader plan. By the numbers: Recent defense spending \\"Compromise is a way to achieve it,\\" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday, noting that Obama continued to offer proposals to cut spending and increase revenue that shifted to the middle from his original stances. However, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, accused Obama and Democrats of avoiding needed spending cuts and trying to put off tough decisions instead of facing their responsibilities as elected leaders. Deficit reduction should focus on cutting government spending and must include savings from popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Boehner insisted on Wednesday. \\"At some point, Washington has to deal with its spending problem,\\" he told reporters. \\"I've watched them kick this can down the road for 22 years. I've had enough of it. It's time to act.\\" Boehner also echoed Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky in opposing Obama's call for including more tax revenue in the mix. Opinion: Republicans, be smart about defense cuts Also Wednesday, GOP legislators proposed 85 billion in reduced spending through attrition -- or not filling all vacated government jobs -- and freezing congressional pay as an alternative to the sequestration this year. They said the plan achieves the same amount of deficit reduction without more tax revenue sought by Obama and Democrats. The debate continues the ideological showdown between Republicans and Democrats over the size and role of government. Republicans driven by their conservative base want to reduce government and taxes to fund it, arguing that is the best way to grow the economy. Democrats promote a strong government safety net through entitlements and support programs that they say bolsters middle-class opportunity necessary for economic growth. Congress and the White House agreed to the sequestration cuts as part of the 2011 debt ceiling deal that ended a showdown over whether to increase the federal government's borrowing limit to meet its obligations. The automatic spending cuts never were intended to become law, but instead were designed to be so unwieldy and overbearing that Congress would reach a broader deficit reduction deal to avoid them. Military pay in play in game of political poker Deep partisan divisions prevented such an agreement from happening in 2012, an election year. Initially the cuts were to go into effect on January 2, but the government delayed the impact of sequestration for the first two months of 2013. In his speech, Panetta referred to what he described as \\"partisan dysfunction in Congress\\" that he said threatens the quality of life and national security of the nation. Instead of making tough decisions to resolve problems, political leaders from both parties let issues become crises that require immediate but insufficient responses, he said. \\"It's the easy way out,\\" Panetta said, adding that there is a price to be paid for such an approach. \\"You lose the trust of the American people,\\" he said. \\"You create an aura of constant uncertainty that pervades every issue and gradually undermines the very credibility of the nation.\\" CNN Explains: Sequestration In another effort to stoke public alarm over the pending cuts, Carney told reporters that top defense contractors met at the White House with senior administration officials to discuss the impacts on their industry. According to Carney, those impacts would be overwhelmingly negative. \\"It's not just a parlor game here in Washington,\\" he said of the issue. \\"These are real-world decisions that significantly affect the economy and the American people.\\" Obama said Tuesday that he still supports a broader deficit deal and made clear that revenue from tax reform measures previously agreed to by Republicans -- such as eliminating some loopholes to increase revenue for the government -- should be part of it. Boehner, however, reiterated the GOP call for replacing the sequester plan with spending cuts and reforms -- a reference to changes in entitlement programs. A last-second agreement in the previous Congress that passed in the first days of 2013 raised tax rates on top income earners as part of a limited deficit-reduction package. That measure followed weeks of tough negotiations involving Obama and Congress in which other steps to increase government revenue, such as eliminating some tax breaks for corporations, were considered but not included in the final deal. How our tribes cause gridlock in Congress Obama and Democrats now want such revenue-raising steps to be part of a package that would replace the mandated deficit reduction of the sequester cuts. McConnell expressed his opposition to such a move Tuesday, saying, \\"The American people will not support more tax hikes in place of the meaningful spending reductions both parties already agreed to and the president signed into law.\\" CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Defense Secretary Leon Panetta suggests limiting military pay in 2014 due to \\"budget uncertainties.\\" This would involve decreasing the salary of troops next year.

A: Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the question The question asks about the greatest contribution of arthropods to the human food supply. We need to determine which of the given options (vegetation, reproduction, hibernation, or pollination) has the most significant impact on the human food supply. Step 2: Consider the importance of each option - Vegetation: Arthropods play a role in maintaining plant life through predation and decomposition. However, this indirect contribution does not have a major impact on the human food supply. - Reproduction: Arthropods reproduce at a high rate, but this would benefit humans primarily through the consumption of arthropods, such as insects or crustaceans, which have a minor presence in our food supply compared to other sources. - Hibernation: This refers to the period of inactivity for some arthropods during unfavorable conditions. This does not directly affect human food supply. - Pollination: Many arthropods, especially insects such as bees, play a crucial role in the pollination of a wide variety of plants. Pollination is required for plants to produce fruits, seeds, and vegetables, which are essential components of the human diet. Step 3: Choose the most significant contribution Based on the impact of each option, pollination (option D) has the greatest contribution to the human food supply, as it allows for the growth and development of a vast array of plant-derived food sources.

In the first sentence, the product is undergoing a change in order to improve it. The word 'change' in this context means a transformation or modification in the product's design, features, or functionality. This change is purposefully being made to enhance the product and make it better than before, ultimately benefiting the users and the company behind the product. The use of the word 'change' in this context suggests a positive connotation, as it delivers beneficial results. On the other hand, the second sentence states that the storm is a change for the worse. In this context, the 'change' refers to a shift in conditions or circumstances caused by the storm. Contrary to the positive use of 'change' in the first sentence, its use in this sentence carries a negative connotation. The word 'worse' explicitly implies that the change caused by the storm leads to unfavorable outcomes, likely resulting in damage, danger, or disruption for those affected by the storm. In conclusion, the word 'change' in the two sentences carries different meanings. While the first use signifies a positive transformation made to improve a product, the second use points to a negative shift in circumstances caused by an unfavorable event (the storm)."},{"instruction":"Given a sentence with a missing word, pick the answer option that best fills out the missing word in the sentence.

When some kind of medicine was brought out recently, researchers found that the color of the package caused the shoppers to lose interest because they made the product look ineffective . At last, it came on the market in dark blue and white--blue because we think of it as safe, and white as calm. The size of a package can also attract a shopper, although quite often a bottle doesn't hold as much as it seems to. It is said that the better-known companies spend about 40 percent of the cost of the product itself on packaging! The most successful producers know that it's not enough to have a good product.

In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. Paragraph: Drought is major concern in the Midwest. To confront the problem scientists are trying to develop drought-resistant crops. To that end, they took a plant that was not exposed to drought. They labeled it as plant A. Then they took a similar plant, and repeatedly exposed it to drought. They labeled it as plant B. They wanted to find out what makes a plant drought-resistant.

He has won 91 international tournaments, including 20 PGA Tour tournaments and two majors: The Open Championships in 1986 and 1993. Norman also earned thirty top-10 finishes and was the runner-up 8 times in majors throughout his career. In 1986, Norman's 11 worldwide victories that year included four wins in Australia and two regular PGA Tour events; the Panasonic Las Vegas Invitational and the Kemper Open (for the second time) but 1986 is remembered for the Norman Slam or the Saturday Slam. Norman held the lead for all four majors through 54 holes. This meant he played in the final group for every major and had perhaps the best chance in history of winning the single season Grand Slam. However, the only major victory Norman earned that year was in the 1986 Open Championship at Turnberry. At the 1986 Masters, Norman started with the lead until he double-bogeyed the 10th hole. After making four consecutive birdies on holes 14 to 17, Norman was tied with Jack Nicklaus going to the 18th. Norman missed a par putt on the 18th that would have sent the two into a sudden death playoff. At the 1986 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills, Norman again led after 54 holes. However, Norman faltered on the final day, finishing with a final round 75 placing him six strokes behind the winner, Raymond Floyd. Norman finally broke through at the 1986 Open Championship for his first major title. Norman shot an efficient second round of 63 on Friday at Turnberry. Only 15 players broke par in the second round. Tom Watson described Norman's feat as \\"the greatest round ever played in a tournament in which I was a competitor.\\" Norman survived the weekend's brutal conditions at Turnberry, with a final round of 69 to win The Open by five shots. After being presented with the Claret Jug trophy, Norman said: \\"Outside of Australia, Britain was the first place that accepted me as a professional golfer. To win my first Open in front of the British public is the greatest feeling ever.\\" Norman was again in contention at the 1986 PGA Championship. He was in the lead on the final day, but shot a final round 76 to finish 2 strokes behind the eventual winner, Bob Tway. Norman's four wins in Australia in 1986 helped him to finish top of the Australian Order of Merit for the fifth time. He also topped the U.S. PGA Tour money list for the first time that year. In September 1986, Norman won the Panasonic European Open at Sunningdale Golf Club and the following month he had another victory in England, winning his third World Match Play Championship at Wentworth. Norman ended 1986 with eleven worldwide victories and was officially ranked number 1 in the brand new Official World Golf Rankings. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: how did he feel about his accomplishments?","output":"Gregory John Norman, also known as \\"The Shark\\", is a famous golfer from Australia who was really good at golf in the 1980s and 1990s.

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: a northern light Review: this seems to be aimed at a younger reader. not as good as her other books, winter rose and tea rose Answer:","output":"After a careful analysis of the given review, it can be concluded that the customer is likely dissatisfied with the product, in this case, a book titled \\"A Northern Light.\\" To support this claim, we can break down the review into three main points: 1. The customer states that the book seems to be aimed at a younger reader. It implies that the reader might have been expecting a more sophisticated or complex piece of literature, catering to their taste and reading level. This statement suggests that the book did not meet their expectations, leading to a feeling of disappointment. 2. The second point of comparison the customer makes is with the author's other books, \\"Winter Rose\\" and \\"Tea Rose.\\" By saying that \\"A Northern Light\\" is not as good as these two other titles, the customer highlights their dissatisfaction further. It indicates that the customer has enjoyed the author's previous works and had expectations from this book based on that prior experience, but unfortunately, this particular book did not deliver at the same level, leading to dissatisfaction. 3. Lastly, it is essential to consider the tone of the review. The customer expresses their opinion in a manner that does not seem to enthusiastically endorse or support the book. The absence of any positive remarks or compliments for \\"A Northern Light\\" suggests that the customer was not satisfied with their purchase or reading experience. Taking these factors into consideration, it can be determined that the customer was dissatisfied with \\"A Northern Light\\" due to its perceived target audience, its comparison to the author's other books, and the overall tone of the review."},{"instruction":"Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do earthworms do when a segment breaks off\\" is \\"regrows it\\", given that earthworms can regrow segments that break off?

This question is focused on the idea of a divine being and the expectations or desires that might be placed upon people in terms of their financial well-being and actions. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers 1. work in life 2. speak to people 3. everywhere 4. sitting ideal 5. care for people Step 3: Cross out irrelevant answers - \\"everywhere\\" isn't an action or activity that people do, so we can eliminate it. - \\"sitting ideal\\" is not a task or action and does not provide any clear guidance for earning money, so we can eliminate it as well. Step 4: Compare remaining answers 1. work in life 2. speak to people 5. care for people - \\"speak to people\\" is a bit too vague and not specifically related to making money in any given context, so it doesn't stand strongly on its own. Now we are left with two possible answers: 1. work in life 5. care for people Step 5: Decide on the best answer \\"Work in life\\" seems like the most suitable answer of the two remaining choices. Historically, many religious texts and teachings encourage the idea of work and earning a living through honest means.

It may be a general principle that could apply to various areas of life, but it doesn't directly address the question at hand. Conclusion: I believe the correct choice is \\"work in life,\\" as it is closely aligned with the general understanding of religious teachings and expectations in the context of earning money. This answer emphasizes the importance of honesty, effort, and personal growth in one's chosen field or occupation, reflecting the values often associated with divine guidance."},{"instruction":"Give stream of consciousness and then the final answer.

Work done by Person A in a single day: Since Person A can complete the work in 30 days, the work done in a single day would be 1/30. 2. Work done by Person B in a single day: Since Person B can complete the work in 45 days, the work done in a single day would be 1/45. 3. Combined work done by Person A and B in one day: We sum up the work done by each person in a single day (1/30 + 1/45). To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which in this case is 90 (LCM of 30 and 45). So, the combined work done in a day would be: (3/90) + (2/90) = 5/90. 4. Work done by both in 7 days: To find the combined work done by both in 7 days, we multiply the work done in a single day by 7. (5/90) * 7 = (5*7)/90 = 35/90. Now we'll simplify the fraction and compare it to the options provided: 35/90, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 5, which gives us 7/18.

Here's a possible answer for the posed question: \\"In the United States, a Homeowners' Association (HOA) may employ various strategies to collect unpaid fees on a property. Some common methods include: 1. Sending payment reminders: The first step is often to send a reminder to the homeowner that their dues are unpaid, and specify the deadline for payment. 2. Levying late fees: If the homeowner still hasn't paid after receiving a reminder, the association can impose late fees, which may encourage timely payment in the future. 3. Negotiating a payment plan: The HOA can work with the homeowner to set up a payment schedule. This can help to avoid legal conflicts and ensure that the dues are eventually paid. 4. Filing a lien on the property: If efforts to collect the unpaid fees prove unsuccessful, the HOA could file a lien on the property, which would need to be satisfied before the homeowner can sell or refinance their home. 5. Initiating legal action: As a last resort, the HOA can pursue legal action against the homeowner to collect the unpaid fees, such as a small claims court or civil lawsuit, which could result in wage garnishments or sale of the homeowner's assets to recoup the outstanding dues.

Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when a sound wave matches the natural frequency of an object and causes that object to vibrate intensely. Step 2: Analyze the choices a) it becomes quieter - This choice suggests the sound decreases in volume during resonance, which is in contrast to the concept of resonance. b) it dissipates - This choice implies that the sound disperses or spreads out during resonance, which doesn't describe the process accurately. c) it echoes - This choice means the sound bounces back and repeats itself during resonance. Although echoing can occur in a resonant environment, it's not the primary effect of resonance. d) amplified, it becomes louder - This choice suggests that the sound increases in volume during resonance, which is consistent with the concept of resonance. Step 3: Determine the correct answer Since resonance causes an object to vibrate more intensely when the sound wave matches its natural frequency, the volume of the sound is amplified, making it louder.

Several factors can contribute to the low number of accidents in this busy area, including: 1. Effective traffic management: A well-designed and efficiently managed traffic system can reduce traffic congestion and prevent accidents. This may include the proper placement of traffic signs, traffic signals, and pedestrian crossings. Moreover, well-maintained roads and infrastructure can also reduce the risk of accidents. 2. Driver education and awareness: Good driver education and awareness programs can ensure that all drivers are knowledgeable about safe driving practices and are aware of the traffic rules and regulations. This can lead to responsible driving behavior, reducing the likelihood of accidents in busy areas. 3. Law enforcement: Stringent law enforcement can discourage risky driving behavior and ensure adherence to traffic rules. This may include regular patrolling and swift action against traffic offenders, making the area safer for all road users. 4. Pedestrian safety measures: To help maintain a low accident rate in busy areas, pedestrian safety is crucial as well. This can be achieved by providing well-marked pedestrian crossings, pedestrian-only zones, and ample sidewalk space for people to walk. 5. Public transportation system: In busy metropolitan areas, having an efficient public transportation system can ease traffic congestion and reduce the number of vehicles on the road, which in turn lowers the chances of accidents. Encouraging the use of public transportation by making it accessible, affordable, and punctual can contribute to the safety of all road users. 6. Technology integration: The use of modern technological advancements such as smart traffic signals, surveillance cameras, and real-time monitoring systems can help efficiently manage traffic, identify potential traffic problems, and prevent accidents. 7. Accident reporting and data analysis: A proactive approach to accident reporting and analyzing collected data can help identify trends, pinpoint accident-prone areas, and take necessary corrective measures to reduce the risk of accidents in the future. In conclusion, while it does appear that there are few accidents in the busy area you described, it is essential to understand the multiple factors that can be in place to support and maintain such a low accident rate. Ensuring the efficient functioning of traffic systems, law enforcement, public transportation, pedestrian safety measures, and technology integration can be effective measures for maintaining low accident rates in busy areas."},{"instruction":"What Republics did the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public, except on special occasions? Answer the above question based on the context below: The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions. In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire. The tombs, chapel, exterior of Manjakamiadina and two traditional wooden houses (Besakana and Mahitsy) have since been restored with further restorations planned to continue until at least 2013.

It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - Khwja Shams-ud-Dn Muammad fe-e Shrz, known by his pen name Hafez (\\"fe\\" 'the memorizer; the (safe) keeper'; 1325/261389/90), was a Persian poet who \\"lauded the joys of love and wine but also targeted religious hypocrisy.\\" His collected works are regarded as a pinnacle of Persian literature and are to be found in the homes of most people in Iran, who learn his poems by heart and still use them as proverbs and sayings. His life and poems have been the subject of much analysis, commentary and interpretation, influencing post-14th century Persian writing more than any other author. - Shiraz (\\"Šrz\\", ) is the sixth most populous city of Iran and the capital of Fars Province (Old Persian as Pârsâ). At the 2011 census, the population of the city was 1,460,665 and its built-up area with \\"Shahr-e Jadid-e Sadra\\" (Sadra New Town) was home to 1,500,644 inhabitants. Shiraz is located in the southwest of Iran on the \\"Roodkhaneye Khoshk\\" (The Dry River) seasonal river. It has a moderate climate and has been a regional trade center for over a thousand years. Shiraz is one of the oldest cities of ancient Persia. - Qazvin (, also Romanized as \\"Qazvn\\", \\"Caspin\\", \\"Qazwin\\", or \\"Ghazvin\\") is the largest city and capital of the Province of Qazvin in Iran. Qazvin was an ancient capital in the Persian Empire and nowadays is known as the calligraphy capital of Iran. It is famous for its Baghlava, carpet patterns, poets, political newspaper and pahlavi (Middle Persian) influence on its accent. At the 2011 census, its population was 381,598. - Fars Province (\\"Ostn-e Frs\\") also known as Pars or Persia in historical context, is one of the thirty-one provinces of Iran and known as the cultural capital of Iran. It is in the south of the country, in Iran's Region 2, and its administrative center is Shiraz. It has an area of 122,400 km². In 2011, this province had a population of 4.6 million people, of which 67.6% were registered as urban dwellers (urban/suburbs), 32.1% villagers (small town/rural), and 0.3% nomad tribes. The etymology of the word \\"Persian\\" (From Latin \\"Persia\\", from Ancient Greek (Persis)), found in many ancient names associated with Iran, is derived from the historical importance of this region. Fars Province is the original homeland of the Persian people. - Nezam od - Din Ubeydollah Zâkâni ( Persian : ) , or simply Ubayd - i Zkni ( Persian : c. 1300 -- 1371 CE ) , was a Persian poet and satirist of the 14th century ( Mongol Period ) from the city of Qazvin . He studied in Shiraz , Iran under the best masters of his day , but eventually moved back to his native town of Qazvin . He however preferred Shiraz to Qazvin , as he was a court poet in Shiraz for Shah Abu Ishaq , where a young Hafez was present as well . His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses , often political or bawdy , and often cited in debates involving homosexual practices . He wrote the Resaleh - ye Delgosha , as well as Akhlaq al - Ashraf ( \`\` Ethics of the Aristocracy '' ) and the famous humorous fable Masnavi Mush - O - Gorbeh ( Mouse and Cat ) , which was a political satire . His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written , in league with the other great works of Persian literature . He is one of the most remarkable poets , satirists and social critics of Iran ( Persia ) , whose works have not received proper attention in the past . His books are translated into Russian , Danish , Italian , English , and German ( by Joachim Wohlleben , 2009 : seemingly the first translation of the complete work into a Western language ) . - The Old Persian language is one of the two directly attested Old Iranian languages (the other being Avestan). Old Persian appears primarily in the inscriptions, clay tablets, and seals of the Achaemenid era (c. 600 BCE to 300 BCE). Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now present-day Iran, Romania (Gherla), Armenia, Bahrain, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt, the most important attestation by far being the contents of the Behistun Inscription (dated to 525 BCE). Recent research into the vast Persepolis Fortification Archive at the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago have unearthed Old Persian tablets (2007). This new text shows that the Old Persian language was a written language in use for practical recording and not only for royal display. - Shah (pronounced , \\"king\\") is a title given to the emperors, kings, princes and lords of Iran (historically also known as Persia). It was also adopted by the kings of Shirvan (a historical Iranian region in Transcaucasia) namely the Shirvanshahs, the rulers and offspring of the Ottoman Empire (in that context spelled as \\"eh\\"), Mughal emperors of the Indian Subcontinent, the Bengal Sultanate, as well as in Georgia and Afghanistan. In Iran (Persia and Greater Persia) the title was continuously used; rather than King in the European sense, each Persian ruler regarded himself as the \\"Šhanšh\\" (King of Kings) or Emperor of the Persian Empire. - Middle Persian is the Middle Iranian language or ethnolect of southwestern Iran that during the Sasanian Empire (224654) became a prestige dialect and so came to be spoken in other regions of the empire as well. Middle Persian is classified as a Western Iranian language. It descends from Old Persian and is the linguistic ancestor of Modern Persian. - Persian literature is one of the world's oldest literatures. It spans two-and-a-half millennia, though much of the pre-Islamic material has been lost. Its sources have been within Greater Iran including present-day Iran, Iraq, the Caucasus, and Turkey, regions of Central and South Asia where the Persian language has historically been either the native or official language. For instance, Rumi, one of best-loved Persian poets, born in Balkh or Vakhsh (in what is now Afghanistan), wrote in Persian, and lived in Konya, then the capital of the Seljuks in Anatolia. The Ghaznavids conquered large territories in Central and South Asia and adopted Persian as their court language. There is thus Persian literature from Iran, Mesopotamia, Azerbaijan, the wider Caucasus, Turkey, western parts of Pakistan, India, Tajikistan and other parts of Central Asia. Not all Persian literature is written in Persian, as some consider works written by ethnic Persians in other languages, such as Greek and Arabic, to be included. At the same time, not all literature written in Persian is written by ethnic Persians or Iranians, as Turkic, Caucasian, and Indic poets and writers have also used the Persian language in the environment of Persianate cultures.

The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to \\"drive\\" the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction the change is −2.1 mV/°C. In some circuits special compensating elements (sensistors) must be used to compensate for such changes. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the ideal junction forward voltage?","output":"The ideal junction forward voltage depends on the specific application and the type of transistor being used. However, in general, a lower junction forward voltage is considered better, as it requires less power to drive the transistor, improving overall efficiency and reducing power consumption. For silicon-based bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), the typical forward voltage at the emitter-base junction is around 0.7 V. This value is considered a good balance between providing adequate power to drive the transistor and minimizing power dissipation. However, for other types of transistors or materials used, the junction forward voltage may be different. It is important to note that the junction forward voltage is not a constant value, and its value varies depending on the device's operating temperature. An increase in temperature will result in a decrease in the junction forward voltage, at a rate of approximately -2.1 mV/°C for silicon junctions. This temperature dependence may need to be taken into account in certain applications and compensated with the use of specialized components such as sensistors. To sum up, the ideal junction forward voltage is application-dependent and should be chosen to optimize the performance of the transistor while minimizing power consumption. For typical silicon BJTs, a value of around 0.7 V is commonly used, while other materials or specific use cases may call for different values."},{"instruction":"OPT: *No *Yes Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: This collection pack is great for any enthusiast who is obsessed with Star Trek: The Next Generation and wants a Hi-Def remastered set.

In his remarks, Biden highlighted the work he did with President Barack Obama to help curb sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine. ||||| A HOUSE Intelligence Committee hearing Monday produced the remarkable spectacle of FBI Director James B. Comey publicly testifying that there was “no information that supports” tweets by President Trump alleging wiretapping of his New York headquarters on the order of President Barack Obama. It saw National Security Agency Director Michael S. Rogers agree with the British government that it was “utterly ridiculous” for the White House to suggest that such surveillance had been undertaken by Britain’s signals agency. And it produced official confirmation by Mr. Comey that the agency is investigating Russia’s interference in the U.S. presidential election, including possible coordination with members of the Trump campaign. You’d think that all of this would be of surpassing concern for Republican members of Congress. The president who leads their party has been officially reported to have made false statements alleging criminal activity by his predecessor. What’s more, his campaign is under scrutiny for possible cooperation with a dedicated and dangerous U.S. adversary in order to subvert American democracy. Yet to listen to Republican members of the Intelligence Committee, the most pressing problem to arise from Russia’s intervention and the FBI’s investigation of it is that reports of contacts between Russia’s ambassador and Mr. Trump’s designated national security adviser were leaked to The Post. The priority of Chairman Devin Nunes (Calif.) and other Republican members, judging from their statements, is not fully uncovering Russia’s actions but finding and punishing those who allowed the public to learn about them. Mr. Nunes and Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) could not have been more zealous in their outrage over the exposure of Michael Flynn, who was forced to resign as national security adviser after reports in The Post exposed his lies about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Mr. Flynn accepted nearly 68,000 in payments from Russian companies, including the state propaganda outlet, before advocating greater cooperation with Moscow during his brief White House stint. Yet Mr. Nunes and Mr. Gowdy would have it that hunting down the sources for the disclosure that Mr. Flynn discussed the lifting of U.S. sanctions with Mr. Kislyak is more urgent than learning the full extent of the contacts he and other Trump aides had with Moscow. The Republicans seem to be slavishly following the cues of the president, who, while failing to retract his accusation against Mr. Obama, is seeking to direct attention elsewhere. “The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information,” he tweeted Monday morning. Such a diversion, like anything else that distracts attention from Vladi­mir Putin’s support for his election, would be to Mr. Trump’s advantage. Congressional Republicans ought to consider larger national interests. Russia’s intervention in the election was not incidental and haphazard, but part of a concerted campaign to disrupt Western democracy. Mr. Putin is even now attempting to interfere in ongoing election campaigns in France and Germany. Given Mr. Trump’s refusal to acknowledge the threat, it is essential that Congress discover the truth about Russia’s activities, take steps to defend against similar intrusions in the future and help allies protect themselves. The first useful step would be to fully inform the public. Instead, Mr. Nunes and his followers appear bent on silencing anyone who would do so. ||||| Well, that wasn’t very helpful. FBI director James Comey took his latest star turn before the House Intelligence Committee on Monday and didn’t disclose much of anything new about Russian meddling in the presidential election or wiretaps of Trump Tower. Mr. Comey did confirm what four bipartisan leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees said last week—that the FBI has “no information” to support President Trump’s assertion that Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower. He also acknowledged that the FBI... ||||| Just before 3:20 on Monday afternoon, Devin Nunes, the Republican head of the House Intelligence Committee, asked James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was testifying before the committee on his agency’s investigation into Russian interference in last year’s Presidential election, a last set of questions. Earlier in the hearing, Nunes, seemingly taking his lead from a series of early-morning tweets by President Trump, had focussed his questions on the leaks of classified information that have plagued the Administration since January. Now, though, Nunes got to the crux of the matter: Comey's public confirmation that the F.B.I. was investigating possible coördination between people associated with the Trump campaign and Russia. Nunes asked Comey if he had evidence that anyone currently working in the Trump Administration had undisclosed ties to Russia. Comey refused to answer. Nunes tried again: What about Kellyanne Conway? \\"Same answer,\\" Comey said. Nunes didn't pretend to be surprised. \\"There is a big gray cloud you have put over the people who lead this country,\\" he went on. \\"The faster you can get to the bottom of this, it's going to be better for all Americans.\\" It was a statement rather than a question, but Comey evidently felt obliged to respond. \\"I understand,\\" he said, quietly. Thus ended a hearing the likes of which Washington hasn't seen in many a day—if, indeed, there has ever been anything like it. It lasted five hours and twenty minutes, with just a single bathroom break, and while it began with Comey’s acknowledgement that an investigation existed, much of the rest of it was taken up with his refusals to provide any more details about the probe, or to comment on individual Trump associates whom media reports have tied to it. \\"I know that is extremely frustrating to some folks,\\" he said, in his opening statement. \\"I hope you and the American people can understand. The F.B.I. is very careful in how we handle information about our cases and about the people we are investigating.\\" Despite his reticence, Comey said more than enough to transfix the political world, and to leave many Republicans feeling as helpless as supporters of Hillary Clinton felt in October, when Comey revealed that the F.B.I. had reopened its investigation into Clinton's private e-mail server. Despite refusing to go into specifics, Comey did point out that, \\"as with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.\\" Arguably, he didn't need to say that: investigating possible crimes is what the F.B.I. does. Evidently, though, Comey felt it was necessary to explain to the public why the F.B.I. had made the unprecedented decision to launch a counterintelligence investigation into a major party’s Presidential candidate. At one point, Michael Turner, a Republican congressman, quizzed Comey on this very question: What does it take for the F.B.I. to open a counterintelligence investigation? He only succeeded in getting Comey to confirm that the agency doesn't act lightly. “What is the tipping point?” Turner asked. “Don’t you need some action or some information besides just attending a meeting, having been paid to attend a conference, that a picture was taken or that you travelled to a country, before you open an investigation for counterintelligence by the F.B.I.?” Comey said that a couple of things could come into play: “a credible allegation of wrongdoing or reasonable basis to believe that an American may be acting as an agent of a foreign power.” If that weren’t bad enough for the White House, Comey also spoke openly, and at length, about Russian interference in the election, and he defended the intelligence community's judgment that Vladimir Putin sought to tip the scales in Trump's favor. Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the panel, first got Comey to say that the Russian government preferred a candidate who had a dim view of NATO, and that it hoped to see the lifting of sanctions that were imposed after the Russian invasion of Crimea. Then Schiff asked Comey whether the Russians would \\"have a preference for a candidate who expressed open admiration for Putin.\\" After pausing for a moment, Comey replied, \\"Can I help you reformulate the question? Mr. Putin would like people who like him.\\" In an exchange with Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican, Comey said that, by early December of 2016, the F.B.I. had come to the conclusion that Russia had wanted to undermine faith in America’s election process, and that it had sought to denigrate Clinton and hurt her campaign. \\"The conclusion that active measures were taken specifically to help President Trump's campaign, you had that—by early December, you already had that conclusion?\\" Conaway asked. \\"Correct, that they wanted to hurt our democracy, hurt her, help him,\\" Comey replied. \\"I think all three we were confident in, at least as early as December.\\" Comey also informed the committee that the F.B.I.'s investigation into the Trump campaign began in July, 2016. Perhaps surprisingly, it was a Republican, Elise Stefanik, who represents a district in upstate New York, who asked Comey why he hadn't informed lawmakers earlier. \\"Because of the sensitivity of the matter,\\" Comey replied That answer didn't satisfy Stefanik, and it won't satisfy many Democrats, who are still furious at Comey for, in their view, helping to tip the election in Trump's favor with his announcement about the Bureau’s Clinton investigation. In this instance, though, it is Republicans who have reasons to be gravely concerned about what the F.B.I. director said. As the hearings wore on, some of the Party's representatives wisely departed from the smoke-screen strategy of talking about leaks, and pointed to a statement made last month by James Clapper, President Obama's director of national intelligence. Speaking on \\"Meet the Press,” Clapper said that, when he left the government, he hadn't been aware of any evidence of \\"collusion\\" between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Comey, responding to Pete King, the veteran Republican congressman from Long Island, said that Clapper’s remarks were \\"not something I can comment on.\\" Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat, tried to get him to discuss the meaning of collusion, and the difference between implicit and explicit collusion. Once again, Comey refused to be drawn in. \\"Collusion is not a term, a legal term of art,\\" he said, \\"and it's one I haven't used here today, as we're investigating to see whether there was any coördination between people associated with the campaign—” Quigley cut Comey off before he could say \\"the Russians,\\" but his meaning was clear. In case it wasn't, he spelled it out to Denny Heck, a Democrat from Washington State, who asked Comey to explain to the American people \\"why we should care about Russia's use of U.S. persons, of Americans, helping Russia destabilize our democracy.\\" Comey, who earned his reputation for independence when he worked in George W. Bush's Justice Department, began by saying that he \\"truly believed\\" that America is a \\"shining city on a hill,\\" in the words of Ronald Reagan. He went on, \\"One of the things we radiate to the world is the importance of our wonderful, often messy, but free and fair democratic system, and the elections that undergird it. So when there is an effort by a foreign nation-state to mess with that, to destroy that, to corrupt that, it is very, very serious. It threatens what is America. And if any Americans are part of that effort it's a very serious matter. And so you would expect the F.B.I. to want to want to understand, is that so? And, if so, who did what?\\" It was for these reasons, Comey said, that he had decided it was important to share at least some information about the investigation with the committee and the American people. \\"And now we are going to close our mouths and do our work to see if we can answer those questions,\\" he continued. \\"Because the answers matter.\\" ||||| Which brings us to Russia. Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential campaign was an attack on the United States. It’s the kind of national-security matter that a president and members of Congress swear to treat with utmost seriousness when they take the oath of office. Yet now it has become the subject of an escalating series of lies by the president and the people who work for him. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As Comey was acknowledging on Monday that the F.B.I. was investigating possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, Trump was lying about it. From both his personal Twitter account and the White House account, he told untruths. A few hours later, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, went before the cameras and lied about the closeness between Trump and various aides who have documented Russian ties.

The big question now is not what Trump and the White House are saying about the Russia story. They will evidently say anything. The questions are what really happened and who can uncover the truth.

I was most saddened during Comey’s testimony not by the White House’s response, which I’ve come to expect, but by the Republican House members questioning him. They are members of a branch of government that the Constitution holds as equal to the presidency, but they acted like Trump staff members, decrying leaks about Russia’s attack rather than the attack itself. The Watergate equivalent is claiming that Deep Throat was worse than Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Nixon. It fell to Adam Schiff, a Democratic representative from Southern California, to lay out the suspicious ties between Trump and Russia (while also hinting he couldn’t describe some classified details). Schiff did so in a calm, nine-minute monologue that’s worth watching. He walked through pro-Putin payments to Michael Flynn and through another Trump’s aide’s advance notice of John Podesta’s hacked email and through the mysterious struggle over the Republican Party platform on Ukraine. “Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated, and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible,” Schiff said. “But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated, and that the Russians used the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they have employed in Europe and elsewhere. We simply don’t know, not yet, and we owe it to the country to find out.” Comey, as much as liberals may loathe him for his 2016 bungling, seems to be one of the few public officials with the ability and willingness to pursue the truth. I dearly hope that Republican members of the Senate are patriotic enough to do so as well. Our president is a liar, and we need to find out how serious his latest lies are. ||||| From Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton, history suggests that it is never a good thing for a president to have the FBI, with its nearly infinite resources and sweeping investigative powers, on his tail. FBI Director James Comey’s promise to the House Intelligence Committee on Monday to “follow the facts wherever they lead” in the bureau’s investigation into possible collusion between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia during last year’s election amounted to an ominous guarantee, barely two months into Trump’s term, that institutional forces beyond any president’s control will force the facts of the case to light, whatever they are. Story Continued Below “Comey’s admission of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation, with no endpoint in sight, is a big deal,” said historian Timothy Naftali, who was the first director of the federally run Nixon presidential library. “This is not going away.” Moreover, given Trump’s demonstrated willingness to attack any adversary — hours before Comey’s testimony, he tweeted that the suggestion of collaboration between his campaign and Russia was “fake news” — official acknowledgment of the investigation raises sharp new questions not only about the president’s own credibility, but also about his willingness to continue undermining public trust and confidence in the government institutions he leads. Typically, the mere existence of such an investigation would make any White House hypersensitive about the appearance of attempting to interfere with the FBI or the Justice Department. Bill Clinton’s loathing for his FBI director, Louis Freeh, was an open secret in the 1990s (and the feeling was mutual), but it couldn’t stop the bureau from doggedly pursuing investigations of Whitewater or the Monica Lewinsky affair. If anything, the reverse was true. Will the Trump White House, which is installing loyalty monitors in every Cabinet department, feel similarly hamstrung about publicly attacking Comey, whom the president famously hugged at a Blue Room reception shortly after his inauguration, or trying to quash the inquiry? At a minimum, Trump and his aides would do well to recall the most celebrated instance of a president’s attempt to block an FBI investigation. “The obvious example that comes to mind is Watergate, when Richard Nixon famously turned to the CIA to block the FBI’s investigation,” said the historian Julian Zelizer, a professor at Princeton. That attempt failed spectacularly, of course, but Zelizer added, “This is the kind of investigation that is never good news for an administration,” and he noted that the current probe has already “consumed much of the president’s time, and the doors keep opening to bigger potential problems.” Trump has an ambitious agenda that involves the Justice Department on matters from immigration to civil rights to border security. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, one of his earliest and most vocal supporters, had his choice of Cabinet positions. Sessions has announced he would recuse himself from any Russia-Trump investigation, but Comey went out of his way to say that the Justice Department had authorized him to take the unusual step of disclosing it. The disclosure raises questions about how Trump will navigate his dealings with his attorney general and the department to avoid any suggestion of meddling in an ongoing investigation. At least since Watergate, there have been strict protocols covering contacts between the White House and Justice Department about pending investigations — protocols that Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, may already have violated by speaking with Comey and Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe about the Russia inquiry. It also raises the possibility that Trump will get bogged down in questions about the investigation, which could adversely affect his ability to achieve his policy goals. Even initiatives that have nothing to do with Russia or national security could suffer if a Republican Congress is less inclined to fight for his proposals, and there is also the matter of the time and focus responding to such an inquiry requires from the White House. Louis Freeh, President Clinton's choice to head the FBI, speaks as the president looks on July 20, 1993, in the Rose Garden of the White House. The two came to dislike each other. | AP Photo Bill Clinton devoted much of his second term to fending off the Lewinsky investigation and subsequent impeachment proceedings, fueled not only by the zealous special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, but also by a hostile FBI. When the Lewinsky probe was gathering steam in 1998 and Starr’s lieutenant Bob Bittmann requested 20 FBI agents and 10 financial analysts, “We had them the next day,” he would recall. Freeh personally let Attorney General Janet Reno know that he opposed the Secret Service’s invocation of a “protective function” privilege that would shield its agents from having to testify about any contacts they might have witnessed between Clinton and Lewinsky. Trump’s aides and allies have questioned whether the permanent professional bureaucracy of the federal government amounts to a “deep state,” dedicated to undermining his policies. They should be more concerned in the short term about a new “Deep Throat,” like the long-anonymous source who aided The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward’s coverage of Watergate. The source turned out to be Mark Felt, the No. 3 official at the FBI, a reality that the Nixon White House caught onto just months after the foiled break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters. “Now why the hell would he do that?” Nixon asked his chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, on Oct. 19, 1972. A few months later, when Felt’s name was floated as a possible successor to FBI Director L. Patrick Gray, who had resigned under fire, Nixon told his attorney general, Richard Kleindienst, “I don’t want him. I can’t have him.” If Trump can take any comfort from Comey’s latest revelation, it may be that the FBI director’s own credibility was badly damaged last year — first when he took the unusual step of announcing that the bureau’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server did not warrant prosecution; then when he announced he was revisiting the investigation in light of potential new evidence found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the husband of Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin; and, finally, when he declared, just days before the election, that his original conclusion still stood. Trump has repeatedly shown himself willing to breach the usual niceties of presidential decorum and discourse. With his White House now officially under siege by an entity empowered to seek subpoenas to compel testimony, it’s anybody’s guess just how the president or his lieutenants might react. But one thing is certain: The mood in the White House is grim, and probably apt to get worse before it gets better. In September 1972, as the FBI pursued its Watergate investigation, Nixon had some advice for his White House counsel, John Dean, as reported in John A. Farrell’s forthcoming book, “Richard Nixon: The Life.” “This is war,” Nixon said. “We’re getting a few shots and it will be over, and we’ll give them a few shots and it will be over. Don’t worry. I wouldn’t want to be on the other side right now.” The president had no idea just how wrong he was. But the FBI did. Authors: |||||","output":"In his recent remarks, US President Joe Biden addressed his role in helping to pass tough-on-crime legislations in the 1990s, which many believe led to mass incarceration that disproportionately affected black Americans. He acknowledged that the decision was a mistake, but highlighted his work with former President Barack Obama to curb sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine. FBI Director James B. Comey recently testified that there is \\"no information that supports\\" President Trump's claims of wiretapping at his New York headquarters by the Obama administration. During the hearing, Comey also confirmed an ongoing investigation into Russia's interference in the US presidential election, including possible coordination with members of the Trump campaign. Although this should be of major concern for Republican members of Congress, it appears that their priority is finding and punishing those responsible for leaking information, rather than investigating potential Russian interference. Congressional Republicans need to prioritize the investigation to protect democracy in the US and help allies, rather than focusing purely on punishing leaks."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Milan. for the following movie plot: On April 1, 2007, Desiree Cartier is hosting a party at her mansion for her actress friend Torrance Caldwell.

Grape farm had depleted soils and a low crop production, while Fruit farm, having parcels with depleted soils in the past, established an agroforestry system starting a decade ago which helped stabilize soil and increase production. Which farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods? Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: A:","output":"Grape farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods. Their depleted soils and low crop production indicate that they likely have not implemented agroforestry systems with groundcover plants to help prevent soil erosion and increase soil cover, leading to reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff for cleaner water."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Marty for the following movie plot: Marty Faranan is a struggling writer who dreams of finishing his screenplay, Seven Psychopaths.

Life seemed pretty normal and well-balanced for Emily, but little did she know she was the mysterious subject of an intense and twisted lesbian obsession by a woman named Andrea Glassen. Andrea had been covertly monitoring Emily's life from a distance, becoming deeply infatuated with her, and was now intent on not only making Emily aware of Andrea’s unwavering love, but making Emily hers - no matter the cost. One fateful evening, Emily's life took a dark and terrifying turn when a man suddenly forced his way into her apartment. Overwhelmed with panic and fear, she managed to flee the scene unharmed. Shaken by the frightening ordeal, Emily quickly realized that her sense of security was shattered. It was evident that she could no longer stay in her current apartment, so she decided to protect herself by relocating to a new apartment in a different section of the city. She hoped a change of environment would be enough to deter any future threats and secure her safety. What Emily couldn't have known was that Andrea Glassen had been orchestrating these events in order to tighten her invisible grip on Emily's life. Relentless in her pursuit, Andrea decided to exploit Emily's vulnerability by hiring a seemingly harmless taxi driver in the area where Emily had settled in her new home. With the taxi driver as her pawn, Andrea's real intention was to manipulate Emily's every move and gain a valuable recording, providing Andrea with intimate details of Emily's life. Emily, unaware of the danger lurking behind the friendly face of the taxi driver, went about her life as usual, making use of the taxi services provided by Andrea’s accomplice. The taxi driver, after successfully gaining Emily’s trust, presented her with what appeared to be an innocent recording. Unassuming, Emily took the recording not realizing the dangerous and intimate information stored within. This recording had been crafted by Andrea with the purpose of controlling Emily and melding her into Andrea's fantasy. With the carefully planned unfolding of events, Andrea's motives and obsession began to reveal themselves to the authorities. When Emily realized the sinister truth behind the recording, she sought help from the police. To her surprise, they advised her that she needed to get back into that same taxi. This was a ploy by the police to draw Andrea out of hiding and ultimately expose her malicious intentions. Emily, frightened but determined, followed the advice of the authorities and reluctantly reentered the taxi. As the taxi approached its destination, the police, who had been working this case behind the scenes, moved in. With swift precision, they apprehended Andrea Glassen before she could ensnare Emily in her web of obsession and terror. Although it seemed like an impossible task, Emily, now safe and sound, tried to pick up the shattered pieces of her life and move on with newfound strength and resilience. From that moment on, Emily knew she had narrowly escaped a fate too horrid to imagine. She was grateful for the swift response and the support she received from the authorities. Perhaps most importantly, she had learned the importance of remaining vigilant and adaptive in a world filled with unexpected danger. As Emily began to heal and reclaim the pieces of her life, she deeply understood that even in the darkest of times, there were people looking out for her and a light at the end of the tunnel."},{"instruction":"Here are two sentences: \\" Approximately 60 per cent of all national advertisers do not yet advertise in Spanish , \\" he said . \\" Approximately 60 percent of all national advertisers do not yet advertise in Spanish . \\" Choose your answer: are the two sentences saying the same thing?

The first description, \\"A girl wearing glasses and a brown plaid long-sleeved shirt holds a cup and looks through a book with people photographs and text,\\" provides us with a detailed and vivid image of a girl engaged in a particular activity. The statement indicates that the girl is wearing glasses and a brown plaid long-sleeved shirt, which gives us information about her appearance. Furthermore, the statement also describes her action of holding a cup while looking through a book containing photographs and text. This implies the girl's likely interest in the book's content, as well as her potential engagement in a leisurely or educational pursuit. On the other hand, the statement \\"A guy is drinking at a table.\\" provides a different scene. We are given a more straightforward description of a male individual who is drinking (most likely a beverage) at a table. This provides us with minimal information about the guy's appearance, and reveals nothing about his surroundings, thoughts, or other actions he may be engaged in while drinking. It is a single, self-contained statement that has no apparent relation to the first description. Given the lack of any common elements between the two statements, we cannot conclude that the scenario involving the girl wearing glasses and looking through a book, as described in the first statement, has any link or connection to the scenario involving a guy drinking at a table, as mentioned in the second statement. The two situations are independent of one another and would require additional context and information to establish any potential connection or conclusions between them. As a result, it is not possible to derive the description of the girl wearing glasses and looking through a book based solely on the information provided in the statement about the guy drinking at a table."},{"instruction":"Summarize: A fourth man was reported missing in Cowes Harbour at about 03:00 BST, sparking a sea search by a coastguard helicopter and two lifeboats.

His father, David Willis, was an American soldier. His mother, Marlene, was German, born in Kassel. Willis is the oldest of four children with a sister named Florence and two brothers, Robert (who is deceased) and David. Context: Throughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as In Country, The Siege, Hart's War, Tears of the Sun, Grindhouse, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Growing up in a military family, Willis has publicly sold Girl Scout cookies for the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis's then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time. In 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq war, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered 1 million to any noncombatant who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war: I went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers--young kids for the most part--helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these young men and women who are over there fighting to help this country. Willis stated in 2005 that he wanted to \\"make a pro-war film in which American soldiers will be depicted as brave fighters for freedom and democracy.\\" The film would follow members of Deuce Four, the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, who spent considerable time in Mosul and were decorated heavily for it. The film is to be based on the writings of blogger Michael Yon, a former United States Army Special Forces soldier who was embedded with Deuce Four and sent regular dispatches about their activities. Willis described the plot of the film as \\"these guys who do what they are asked for very little money to defend and fight for what they consider to be freedom.\\" Question: What else is interesting in this section?. Whats the answer?","output":"In this section, apart from the brief background on Bruce Willis and his connection to the military through his family, there are several interesting points: 1. Willis's support for the US military is exemplified through his act of purchasing 12,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies for the troops, as suggested by his daughter. 2. He visited Iraq in 2003 as part of the USO tour, performing for the troops with his band, The Accelerators. 3. Although he considered joining the military to fight in the second Iraq war, his age deterred him from doing so. 4. There was confusion regarding his supposed 1 million bounty offer for terrorist leaders, which he later clarified as a hypothetical statement. 5.

He's nearer now, a bearded man in a dark cowboy hat and long dusty overcoat--the Stranger (Clint Eastwood).The Stranger enters the tiny western town of Lago and rides slowly down the main street. The townspeople stop and watch him pass. Freighter Jake Ross (John Quade) cracks a bullwhip to wake his team of horses. The Stranger, startled, snaps his head around at the source before riding on.The Stranger leaves his horse at the livery stable and walks to the saloon. On the front porch three armed, tough-looking men watch him enter: Bill Borders (Scott Walker), Tommy Morris (James Gosa), and Fred Short (Russ McCubbin). The Stranger exchanges looks with Borders and enters the saloon.From the end of the bar farthest from some locals, he orders a \\"beer and a bottle\\" from saloon keeper Lutie Naylor (Paul Brinegar). The three men who were on the porch enter and take positions around him. Borders says, \\"Flea-bitten range bums don't usually stop in Lago. Life here's a little too quick for 'em. Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us, huh?\\" Everyone freezes, waiting for the Stranger's reaction. He suddenly reaches for the whiskey bottle, scattering the local town folk, and causing the three tough men to tense. As he leaves, he whispers, \\"I'm faster than you'll ever live to be,\\"He walks across the street to the barber shop, whiskey bottle in hand, and pays for a shave and a hot bath. He hangs his overcoat and gun belt on a coat rack. The barber (William O'Connell) seats him, drapes him with a smock, and nervously applies shaving cream to his face. The three toughs enter and resume taunting him. The Stranger ignores them, irritating Borders, who suddenly spins the chair. The Stranger shoots Borders in the forehead with a gun hidden under the smock. He then shoots Morris and Short before they can react.He stands and removes the shaving cream with the smock.

The man put the jacket on the back of the chair, but the chair was too small. It was one of those old-fashioned wooden chairs that had been in the family for generations, its legs slightly wobbly and the once glossy finish now faded and chipped. Many years had passed since the chair accommodated his grandfather, who often sat by the fireplace, reading his favorite mystery novels. As a child, the man would listen to his grandfather's voice while enjoying the warmth of the fire. The memories of those simpler times brought a sense of nostalgia and a pang of melancholy as he tried to find a place to put his jacket. His grandfather was long gone now, and his descendants had grown taller and broader than their ancestors. The once-fitting chair was now dwarfed by the man's imposing figure. It could no longer bear the weight of his jacket, which slipped off its meager back over and over again, falling to the worn wooden floor with a soft thud. He tried to adjust the position of his jacket, draping it over both sides of the chair's backrest, hoping that it would somehow manage to stay in place. But as the man took a step back to assess his handiwork, the jacket slid down onto the floor yet again. Feeling a bit frustrated, he decided to find a larger chair on which to hang his jacket. As he surveyed the room, the man noticed a more modern, sturdier chair across the room. Its generous proportions and solid structure seemed to promise a solution to his predicament. Carefully, he shrugged off his jacket and approached the new chair. With a gentle hand, he placed the jacket on the back of this chair, making sure to evenly distribute the fabric over its surface. This time, the jacket remained in place, allowing him to finally turn his attention to the task at hand. Yet, as he left his jacket securely hanging on the sturdy chair, his thoughts lingered on the small, old chair and the memories of his grandfather. He thought of the countless evenings he spent listening to the soothing sound of his grandfather's voice as they shared stories, laughter, and warmth. The small, old chair stood as a reminder of those cherished moments, now tucked away in the recesses of his memory. Although it could no longer serve its intended function, the chair held a treasured place in his heart as a symbol of his family's history and the love he shared with his grandfather. The juxtaposition of the old and the new now reflected the inevitable passing of time. The small, wooden chair that brought such comfort and joy to his grandfather's days stood right alongside the newer, bigger chair, their contrasting features a testament to the change that had taken place within the family over the generations. As he went about his day, the man felt a newfound appreciation for the history that connected him to his roots and for the objects that bore the weight of these accumulated memories. It reminded him of the importance of preserving the past and honoring the ties that bound the family together, even as they welcomed the future and embraced change."},{"instruction":"Leo: Premise: \\"Two young boys hold a man's hands.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The man walks with the children.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Once you've mastered the fundamentals of safe night driving, the experience can actually be a fun, relaxing one, especially if you make the most of entertaining opportunities that also help you drive safely. For instance, if you have a passenger in the car with you while you're driving at night, you may want to partially engage yourself in a light conversation with him or her. Talking to other people is a great way to stave off driving fatigue, and the calm, pitch-black surroundings can often encourage surprisingly intimate conversations. Be sure, however, not to engage yourself too heavily in the conversation. Getting into a heated argument, for example, can distract you from the most important task at hand — driving safely. Driving at night can be a fantastic time to listen to your favorite music on your car's stereo. The relative quiet and calm of night driving makes it easier to hear a song's minor details, making good music especially enjoyable. Some people prefer to listen to slick disco or electronica cuts at night, while others appreciate the thrill of hard rock tracks. There's no \\"right\\" type of music to listen to at night — it's up to you! Below are just a few great night driving tracks from several different genres (there are many, many more): Kavinsky - \\"Nightcall\\" Chromatics - \\"Back From the Grave\\" DJ Shadow - \\"Midnight in a Perfect World\\" Kyuss - \\"Gardenia\\" Allan Kingdom - \\"Evergreens\\" Golden Earring - \\"Radar love\\" Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich - \\"Hold Tight\\" Quiet Riot - \\"Party All Night\\" Daft Punk - \\"Contact\\" Charles Mingus - \\"Moanin'\\" Driving at night can sometimes be a way to come into contact with people and things that you wouldn't otherwise see! For instance, most major city centers truly \\"come to life\\" at night and bustle with unique characters enjoying the night life. Even rural areas can have their share of unique late-night \\"flavor\\". Every stretch of road is different, so keep your eyes peeled for attractions as you drive — if you're taking lots of breaks to fight night-driving fatigue, you should have ample opportunities to stop. Below are just a few things you may want to look out for: Late-night diners/hang-outs Bars and nightclubs (note: avoid drinking and driving, especially at night) Truck stops/rest areas Scenic paths and overlooks Camp grounds Drive-in attractions (theaters, restaurants, etc.) Driving at night can be an experience like no other. With the calm, steady hum of the engine and the darkness of your surroundings, driving can be almost like flying through space. Driving at night feels mysterious, fun, and even exciting — for some people, it's one of life's simplest yet most addictive joys. It's perfectly fine to enjoy a good night drive, but don't forget to focus on what's most important of all — your safety and the safety of other drivers. Always remember that getting distracted while driving can be deadly (especially at night), so keep your attention on the road. If you're confident in your safe driving habits, you'll be able to responsibly relax, tune in, and enjoy your ride!","output":"Mastering safe night driving can lead to a fun and relaxing experience, enhanced by engaging in light conversations with passengers, listening to your favorite music, and exploring unique late-night attractions while maintaining focus on safety and avoiding distractions."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: If you look at a star through a prism, you will see a spectrum .

Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland.

Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms.

In the first sentence, \\"Last week, his lawyers asked Warner to grant clemency under conditions that would have led to a new sentencing hearing,\\" the focus is on the lawyers requesting clemency. More specifically, they are asking for clemency with conditions that would result in a new sentencing hearing. This suggests that there is a possibility of a different outcome during the new hearing if clemency is granted. Conversely, the second sentence, \\"Last week, his lawyers asked Gov. Mark R. Warner to grant clemency, but the governor declined to intervene,\\" addresses the fact that the lawyers requested clemency from the governor. However, this sentence emphasizes that Gov. Mark R. Warner made the decision not to intervene in the matter, effectively declining the request for clemency. The conditions for a new sentencing hearing, as mentioned in the first sentence, are not specified in this sentence. In summary, while both sentences discuss the request for clemency and involve Gov.

The composer writes, \\"The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. The words as well as the music are thus treated symphonically.\\" Walt Whitman's poems inspired him to write the symphony, and Whitman's use of free verse became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be \\"pushed about by the music\\", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.Vaughan Williams was not the only composer following a non-narrative approach to his text. Mahler took a similar, perhaps even more radical approach in his Eighth Symphony, presenting many lines of the first part, \\"Veni, Creator Spiritus\\", in what music writer and critic Michael Steinberg referred to as \\"an incredibly dense growth of repetitions, combinations, inversions, transpositions and conflations\\". He does the same with Goethe's text in Part Two of the symphony, making two substantial cuts and other changes.Other works take the use of text as music still further. Vaughan Williams uses a chorus of women's voices wordlessly in his Sinfonia Antartica, based on his music for the film Scott of the Antarctic, to help set the bleakness of the overall atmosphere. While a chorus is used in the second and third movements of Glass's Seventh Symphony, also known as A Toltec Symphony, the text contains no actual words; the composer states that it is instead formed \\"from loose syllables that add to the evocative context of the overall orchestral texture\\". contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the song where there is a chorus of women's voices wordlessly by the composer who was inspired by Walt Whitman?, what is it ?

This process is called echolocation. Echolocation allows bats to navigate and locate their prey effectively in complete darkness. In this final step, the bat's brain calculates the time it took for the emitted sound wave to return as an echo. The time difference between the emission of the sound wave and the reception of the echo helps the bat estimate the distance to the object. The greater the time interval, the further away the object is, allowing the bat to avoid obstacles and catch their prey. Moreover, the intensity and frequency of the sound wave and echo also provide valuable information about the object's size and texture. For example, if the echo frequency is high, it indicates a small object, while a lower frequency suggests a larger object. The difference in sound intensity between the emitted sound wave and the echo can also give hints about the object's texture; a rough surface will reflect sound waves differently than a smooth one. Once the bat's brain has processed all the information collected by echolocation, it generates a mental image of the object, allowing the bat to react accordingly. This can involve swerving to avoid a potential collision, honing in on a small insect to eat, or navigating to a specific location. The bat continually repeats the echolocation process to update the mental map of its surroundings, ensuring the most accurate and up-to-date information. In summary, the final step of the echolocation process is the bat's brain interpreting and processing the echoes received from the surroundings to create an accurate mental map of the environment, determine object characteristics such as distance, size, and texture, and make appropriate navigation and foraging decisions in real-time."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Who does Osmund beg to bring Averill back ?

February 24] 1907 - April 22, 1986) was a Romanian historian of religion, fiction writer, philosopher, and professor at the University of Chicago. He was a leading interpreter of religious experience, who established paradigms in religious studies that persist to this day. His theory that hierophanies form the basis of religion, splitting the human experience of reality into sacred and profane space and time, has proved influential. Context: In his work on the history of religion, Eliade is most highly regarded for his writings on Alchemy, Shamanism, Yoga and what he called the eternal return--the implicit belief, supposedly present in religious thought in general, that religious behavior is not only an imitation of, but also a participation in, sacred events, and thus restores the mythical time of origins. Eliade's thinking was in part influenced by Rudolf Otto, Gerardus van der Leeuw, Nae Ionescu and the writings of the Traditionalist School (Rene Guenon and Julius Evola). For instance, Eliade's The Sacred and the Profane partially builds on Otto's The Idea of the Holy to show how religion emerges from the experience of the sacred, and myths of time and nature. Eliade is known for his attempt to find broad, cross-cultural parallels and unities in religion, particularly in myths. Wendy Doniger, Eliade's colleague from 1978 until his death, has observed that \\"Eliade argued boldly for universals where he might more safely have argued for widely prevalent patterns\\". His Treatise on the History of Religions was praised by French philologist Georges Dumezil for its coherence and ability to synthesize diverse and distinct mythologies. Robert Ellwood describes Eliade's approach to religion as follows. Eliade approaches religion by imagining an ideally \\"religious\\" person, whom he calls homo religiosus in his writings. Eliade's theories basically describe how this homo religiosus would view the world. This does not mean that all religious practitioners actually think and act like homo religiosus. Instead, it means that religious behavior \\"says through its own language\\" that the world is as homo religiosus would see it, whether or not the real-life participants in religious behavior are aware of it. However, Ellwood writes that Eliade \\"tends to slide over that last qualification\\", implying that traditional societies actually thought like homo religiosus. Question: What did thinkers say of Eliade's ideas?. Whats the answer?","output":"Over the years, thinkers and scholars expressed various opinions on Mircea Eliade's ideas. While many found his theories revolutionary, insightful, and groundbreaking, others criticized him for his methodology and his sweeping generalizations. Here, we will explore the views of several influential thinkers who have interacted with Eliade's ideas. 1. Georges Dumézil: The famous French philologist and specialist in the comparative study of myth and religion, praised Eliade's Treatise on the History of Religions for its coherence and ability to synthesize diverse and distinct mythologies. Dumézil likely appreciated Eliade's cross-cultural approach, as it aligned with his own work, which sought to identify common themes in Indo-European mythologies. 2. Wendy Doniger: Eliade's colleague from 1978 until his death, has observed that \\"Eliade argued boldly for universals where he might more safely have argued for widely prevalent patterns\\". While she acknowledges the significance of Eliade's work and admits a certain admiration for his ideas, she also points out his tendency to oversimplify and overgeneralize religious phenomena across cultures. 3. Robert Ellwood: A religious historian and scholar, Ellwood describes Eliade's approach to religion and discusses the concept of \\"homo religiosus\\" which Eliade uses to present a universal religious person. Ellwood remains somewhat critical, noting that Eliade tends to overlook the real-life participants in religious behavior who might not be aware of how their actions align with his theories. 4. Bruce Lincoln: A critic of Eliade's work, Lincoln has argued that Eliade's approach to religion relies heavily on the assumption of a universal religious experience. Lincoln believes that Eliade's methodology, which focuses on similarities rather than differences between various religious phenomena, results in oversimplification and undermines the individuality of various religious experiences. 5. Carl Olson: In his book \\"The Theology and Philosophy of Eliade,\\" Olson critiques the concepts in Eliade's work that he regards as stemming from a certain outdated, Eurocentric perspective and an essentialist approach to culture. Olson explores Eliade's theories regarding the eternal return and the sacred, raising questions regarding their philosophical legitimacy and their connection to larger theological questions. Despite the critiques from various thinkers, Mircea Eliade is still remembered and celebrated for his groundbreaking work on the history of religion and the role of the sacred in human culture. His theories, such as hierophanies and the eternal return, have proved influential in the field of religious studies. While his methodology and imprecise generalizations have been critiqued, many continue to admire and engage with his ideas, adapting them to new insights and research in the field."},{"instruction":"The American Canadian Tour (ACT) is a late model stock car racing series based in the northeastern United States, and Quebec, Canada.

They finally pursued him so closely that he had to leave Italy. He came to America and set up a fruit store in New York City, where there were quite a number of his countrymen. By 1854, he had made a great deal of money in the fruit business, but had not forgotten his beloved country, and was anxious to be rich only in order that he might free Italy from the Austrians. He sold out his business in New York, and taking all his money, sailed for Italy. When the war of 1859 broke out, he volunteered, and fought throughout the campaign. But the compromising terms of peace galled him, and he was not satisfied with a country only half free. In the region around Genoa, he enrolled a thousand men to go on what looked like a desperate enterprise. Garibaldi had talked with Cavour, and between them, they had schemed to overthrow the kingdom of the Two Sicilies and join this land to the northern country. Of course, Cavour pretended not to know anything about Garibaldi, for the king of Naples and Sicily was supposed to be a friend of the king of Sardinia. Nevertheless, he secretly gave Garibaldi all the help that he dared, and urged men to enroll with him.

How to Make a Girl Miss You","output":"To make a girl miss you, you would need to follow certain steps, focusing on being genuine, interesting, and giving her space. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this goal: Step 1: Be genuine First and foremost, be true to yourself. Don't put on a facade or try to be someone you're not - being genuine will help you form a deeper connection with the girl. Step 2: Show interest in her Show that you are interested in her thoughts, opinions, and desires. Ask her questions and listen to her responses. By taking the time to get to know her, you will become someone she values and misses. Step 3: Create positive memories together Spend quality time together and create memorable experiences. Participate in activities you both enjoy and can bond over. These shared experiences will become memories that she will associate with you and miss when you're not around. Step 4: Be confident Confidence is attractive. Carry yourself with self-assurance and let your captivating qualities shine through. This will make the girl gravitate toward you and miss your presence whenever you're not together. Step 5: Be a good communicator Ensure that your conversations are interesting and engaging. Genuinely listen to her and respond thoughtfully. Keep the conversations lighthearted, fun, and occasionally mysterious - this helps to create a sense of intrigue that makes her want more. Step 6: Give her space Don't be overly clingy or controlling. Give her enough space and time to miss you. This means not constantly messaging her or crowding her. Less can be more, and giving her time to recharge and think about you can make her miss your presence in her life. Step 7: Be a supportive and caring friend Demonstrate that you care about her feelings and well-being. Offer support and encouragement when necessary, and celebrate her achievements. Being a dependable and caring friend makes you someone she'll cherish and miss when you're not around. Step 8: Show that you have your own life Maintain your own hobbies, interests, and social circle. This demonstrates that you are an interesting, independent individual and will make her feel like she's missing out when she's not with you. Step 9: Be patient Don't rush the process or try to force her to miss you. Let things unfold naturally and let her feel the desire to maintain contact and continue building the relationship. Remember, it's crucial to be genuine, as manipulating someone's feelings is not healthy or ethical. Keep these steps in mind, and focus on building a strong, genuine connection with the girl."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: This task is in Spanish.

With the rise of online learning platforms, various digital tools, and artificial intelligence, we have entered a new era, where blended and adaptive learning has become the norm. While educational technology (EdTech) can offer multiple benefits in terms of personalization and accessibility, it also raises concerns about the potential negative effects on the traditional teacher-student relationship and the holistic development of learners. Hypothesis: The integration of technology in education can lead to improved learning outcomes by providing adaptive and personalized learning experiences, but it may also cause a reduction in critical thinking skills and diminish social interactions, thus requiring a balanced approach in the implementation of EdTech solutions. To analyze this hypothesis, we will examine the benefits and drawbacks of implementing technology in education. Benefits of implementing technology in education: 1. Personalized learning: One of the significant advantages of technology integration in education is the ability to provide personalized learning experiences for students. Adaptive learning platforms can identify each student's strengths and weaknesses and tailor learning materials in real-time, ensuring the learner receives the appropriate level of challenge and support. 2. Increased accessibility: EdTech solutions have broken down geographical barriers, enabling students from different parts of the world to access high-quality education. Online courses, digital libraries, and learning resources are now available to millions of students, regardless of their location. 3. Enhanced learning experiences: Technology-based teaching tools can supplement traditional instructional methods to provide interactive and engaging learning experiences. Virtual labs, simulations, gamified learning, and multimedia resources help students grasp complex concepts more effectively. 4. Instant feedback: EdTech tools enable teachers to provide instant feedback to students, making the learning process more efficient. Automated assessments and quizzes offer real-time insights into students' understanding, allowing for immediate adjustments and interventions when necessary. Drawbacks of implementing technology in education: 1. Reduced social interactions: One of the potential negative effects of technology reliance in education is the potential decline of social interactions and learning opportunities that result from face-to-face communication between students and teachers. This lack of human connection may hinder the development of interpersonal skills, empathy, and group collaboration abilities. 2. Shallow learning and diminished critical thinking skills: When students become overly dependent on technology for information and rely on internet search engines and ready-made solutions, they may develop a shallow understanding of subjects, lacking the ability to analyze and synthesize information. This, in turn, can result in inadequate critical thinking and problem-solving skills. 3. Digital divide: Inequitable access to technology and proper internet connectivity is a considerable concern in integrating technology in education. Students from low-income families or remote locations may not have the same opportunities to benefit from the latest EdTech advancements. To address these concerns and ensure that the benefits of technology outweigh the drawbacks, educators must adopt a balanced approach: 1. Blended learning: Combining traditional face-to-face teaching with technology-based learning methods can leverage the best of both worlds. This approach encourages social interactions, critical thinking skills, and adaptive learning opportunities. 2. Digital literacy education: Educators must focus on teaching digital literacy skills to students, helping them navigate and evaluate online information and develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. 3. Addressing the digital divide: It is crucial to create policies and provide resources to bridge the technological gap among students, ensuring that everyone has equal access to educational technology. Overall, integrating technology in education has the potential to significantly enhance learning outcomes by offering personalized and adaptive learning experiences. However, ensuring that students also develop vital critical thinking skills and social abilities in the age of technology requires a thoughtful and balanced approach."},{"instruction":"Andan buna yanıt olarak yaptığı açıklaada, insan haklarının ihlal edildiğini söyledi.

Question: What happened to the college after hostile British forces threatened to raze it? Context: Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when hostile British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the College.

A police investigation has been launched into the death of the 67-year-old - a wanted man in Russia, and an opponent of President Vladimir Putin. A former Kremlin power-broker whose fortunes declined under Mr Putin, Mr Berezovsky emigrated to the UK in 2000. Thames Valley Police said the death, at a property in Ascot, Berkshire, was being treated as unexplained. The area around the property has been cordoned off to allow the investigation to take place, the force said. The inquiry was at a very early stage and more details will be released when available, it added. A South Central Ambulance Service spokeswoman said it had been called to the property at 15:18 GMT. \\"We sent a number of ambulance officers and an ambulance to the address. The 67-year-old male was confirmed deceased at the scene,\\" she said. Last year, Mr Berezovsky lost a £3bn (4.7bn) damages claim against Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich. Diminished wealth Mr Berezovsky claimed he had been intimidated by Mr Abramovich into selling shares in Russian oil giant Sibneft for a \\"fraction of their true worth\\". The allegations were completely rejected by the London Commercial Court judge, who called Mr Berezovsky an \\"inherently unreliable\\" witness. 'Fell foul of Kremlin' Russians have little sympathy for oligarchs, whether alive or dead. That's because while Boris Berezovsky - and the tiny number of other tycoons - were striking rich in the 1990s, millions of people here were sliding into poverty. As he gained in power, many Russians saw Berezovsky as the \\"grey cardinal\\" in the Kremlin - exerting huge political influence for his own benefit. Having fled to London, he became a vocal Kremlin critic and pledged to work from self-imposed exile to depose President Putin. But back home in Russia, many of Mr Putin's opponents blamed Berezovsky for having engineered the transfer of power from Yeltsin to Putin. Boris Berezovsky will be remembered as a towering figure of the 1990s and as one of the most powerful men in Yeltsin's Russia. BBC world affairs reporter Richard Galpin said sources have told him that Mr Berezovsky was depressed after the loss of the court case and was under financial pressure. The tycoon's wealth is thought to have considerably diminished in recent years, leaving him struggling to pay debts in the wake of costly court cases. Mr Berezovsky had made his fortune in the 1990s selling imported Mercedes as well as Russian-made cars. He was one of the first Russian oligarchs - a tiny group of tycoons who at the end of communism used their connections to become rich almost overnight. Later owning Sibneft, the national airline Aeroflot, and as primary shareholder in Russia's main television channel, he supported Boris Yeltsin's rise to power, enjoying huge influence during this era. Mr Berezovsky survived numerous assassination attempts, including a bomb that decapitated his chauffeur. During the later years of Yeltsin's presidency, Mr Berezovsky was part of the leader's inner circle as deputy secretary of Russia's security council. \\"Boris Berezovsky was one of the most powerful men in Russia back in the 1990s,\\" said the BBC's Moscow correspondent, Steve Rosenberg. \\"He rose from being a mathematician, a computer programmer and a used car salesman, to being such an influential figure in Boris Yeltsin's Russia.\\" He then played a role in Mr Putin's rise in the late-1990s, before the new president moved to curb the political ambitions of Russia's oligarchs. Leaving Russia for self-imposed exile in the UK, Mr Berezovsky became one of Mr Putin's fiercest critics. But our correspondent said that on Saturday, a spokesman for Mr Putin said that Mr Berezovsky had sought the president's permission to return to Russia. ||||| Berezovsky’s transformation in little more than a decade from a Soviet mathematics professor and systems analyst earning 500 roubles (£12.18) a month to a multibillionaire, was one of the most extraordinary and revealing stories of the immediate post-Communist era. He rose to power in the early-1990s by diligently cultivating Boris Yeltsin and his influential daughter Tatyana Dyachenko. As the Russian president and his advisers struggled to get a grip on Russia’s bankrupt economy, Berezovsky showed great financial skill as well as the ability to charm and manipulate. Thus he became the king of Kremlin intrigue, regarded by his many enemies as a latter-day Rasputin. From the shattered remnants of the Soviet Union, he emerged as one of a group of seven businessmen who oversaw and influenced the break-up of Russia’s state sector, securing the lion’s share of the spoils for themselves. Berezovsky’s particular prizes were the airline Aeroflot, the Siberian oil company Sibneft and a 49 per cent stake in the state television station ORT, which he used to ensure Yeltsin’s re-election as president in 1996. By the end of the process, Berezovsky and his oligarch colleagues owned well over half of Russia’s entire GDP. Berezovsky’s success had little to do with the market economics in which he professed to believe. He simply used his powers of persuasion, his political contacts and his ability to grant personal favours to turn the cash flow of former state enterprises his way. “Privatisation in Russia goes through three stages”, he explained in 1995. “First, the privatisation of profit; second, privatisation of property; third, the privatisation of debt. Aeroflot is now going through the intermediate stage between privatisation of profit and property. We want to take part in both.” Physically Berezovsky bore a passing resemblance to his fellow billionaire, the Italian media mogul and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and he shared Berlusconi’s undeniable charm, taste for the good life and shady business reputation. Above all, however, he shared Berlusconi’s interest in political power. But while Berlusconi tapped into something deep in the Italian psyche, Berezovsky was regarded with hatred and suspicion by ordinary Russians who blamed him for their country’s parlous economic condition. In 1994 Berezovsky’s chauffeur had his head blown off by a bomb intended for his employer, who walked away from the explosion unscathed. The explosion did, however, introduce Berezovsky to a young agent of the FSB, successor organisation to the KGB, who was assigned to investigate: Alexander Litvinenko. Berezovsky went on to support Vladimir Putin in his bid to become Russian president in 2000, funding the pro-Kremlin, pro-Putin Unity party and churning out pro-Putin propaganda on ORT. But his arrogance proved his undoing. In response to public anger and to secure his own position, Putin turned on his former backer, turfing him out of a state-owned country estate, and demanding back government number plates that Berezovsky used on his fleet of cars. In 2001 Berezovsky fled to France, then later to Britain, pursued by allegations of fraud and corruption. Boris Berezovsky was born in Moscow on January 23 1946 into a Russian Jewish family. His father, Abram, was a civil engineer and his mother, Anna Gelman, a nurse. He studied Forestry and Mathematics at the Moscow Forestry Engineering Institute and took a doctorate in 1984 on the “theory of optimising and decision making”. He went on to become a professor, earning a wide reputation. His commercial career began in the 1980s when he went into business, importing computer software from the west; but it was the end of the Soviet Union that made him. As Communist controls crumbled, he saw a chance to exploit the difference in price between cars sold cheaply for export and those sold in the home market. He established the Logovaz car dealership, which allowed him to sell off Russian-made Ladas at a profit. Logovaz evolved into a mammoth financial and business conglomerate and made Berezovsky a multi-millionaire. Berezovsky met Boris Yeltsin in 1993, and soon established a mutually beneficial relationship with the Russian president and his circle. He subsidised the publication of Yeltsin’s biography and established a strong friendship with Yeltsin’s daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, and his chief of staff, Valentin Yumashev, winning himself a key role in the Kremlin decision-making machine. Within two years Berezovsky had acquired his stake in ORT and bought the potentially lucrative Sibneft oil company for just 100 million. He came to public prominence in 1996 when Yeltsin, who had slumped to just six per cent approval ratings in the polls, was embarking on what seemed a doomed re-election bid. Berezovsky mobilised his fellow oligarchs to provide millions of dollars in finance and organised a ruthlessly professional campaign with rock concerts and glossy advertising which crippled the opposition and rescued Yeltsin from defeat, although it brought on two heart attacks. Boris Yeltsin, left, presents Boris Berezovsky as new executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Apri 1998 (AP) The oligarchs extorted a heavy price for their support. They received shares in the most valuable state-owned companies as security against loans they made to the state budget in an infamous “loans for shares” scheme. After Yeltsin won the election, these companies were put up for auction and the oligarchs divided them among themselves. In 1997 Berezovsky acquired Aeroflot. The same year, Forbes magazine named him the ninth most powerful entrepreneur in the world, with a fortune worth 3bn. Rich and powerful, Berezovsky exerted ever greater influence on the unhealthy and increasingly confused president, who awarded him a Kremlin job as deputy secretary of the Security Council. Effectively, Berezovsky became the Kremlin’s man dealing with the breakaway republic of Chechnya, where a ceasefire had been agreed after 20 months of war. He helped forge the deal that had Aslan Maskhadov elected as Chechen president and Russia promise economic aid, although his detractors claimed his real interest was in getting his hands on the region’s oil. Maskhadov himself later claimed that Berezovsky had helped to finance warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab in their separatist campaign. In 1998 his contacts in Chechnya enabled him to secure the release of two British men held hostages by Chechen rebels. His appointment as executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) — a loose league of 12 former Soviet republics — in 1997 carried little official weight but was another clear sign of his power. One Russian cartoonist depicted him as a black devil looking over the president’s shoulder. It is hard to pinpoint the exact moment at which it all began to turn sour, but a raid by police on the offices of an obscure Moscow security firm in July 1998 might have marked a turning point. Among an arsenal of bugging devices, scanners and cameras, police found a library of video and audio cassettes reaped from years of snooping on top people, including members of Yeltsin’s family. The owner of the firm was Berezovsky. As a result of the raid, the bedrock of Berezovsky’s power — his access to the Kremlin — was shaken. Details of the raid leaked onto newspaper front pages. Acting on instructions from the prosecutor general, Yuri Skuratov, police went on to raid other companies linked to Berezovsky. At first Berezovksy’s allies in the Yeltsin administration and law enforcement agencies tried to brush over the affair by forcing the prosecutor-general to resign – a lurid video of Skuratov having sex with two prostitutes was leaked, with extracts shown on prime-time television. But the Russian parliament rallied behind Skuratov. He stayed in place, and launched an anti-corruption investigation. In 1999 an arrest warrant was issued for Berezovsky in connection with alleged profits skimming at Aeroflot, but was subsequently dropped. Meanwhile Berezovsky had transferred his political allegiance to the up and coming Vladimir Putin, Yeltsin’s prime minister. Putin’s presidential victory, in March 2000, was largely secured during campaigning for the parliamentary elections of December 1999, when a ferocious smear campaign on ORT television effectively eliminated his two main rivals. In a series of popular news shows, Moscow’s mayor Yuri Luzhkov was portrayed as a murderous con-man, while gory footage of a hip operation was broadcast to demonstrate that the former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov (who had recently undergone surgery) was not up to the job. The parliamentary elections also saw Berezovsky elected as representative for the region of Karachevo-Cherkess, securing him immunity from prosecution. Boris Berezovsky leaves Bow Street Magistarates wearing a President Putin mask in 2003 (Geoff Pugh) Yet the honeymoon with Putin was short-lived. During his election campaign, Putin gained popular support by promising to crack down on the oligarchs, and in June 2000 he instigated criminal investigations against many of those who had flourished under his predecessor. Berezovsky was a particular target since he had used his media empire to criticise Putin over his handling of the war in Chechnya and the Kursk submarine disaster. In July 2000 he resigned from his seat in parliament in protest at “authoritarian trends” within Putin’s government. In 2001, as investigations proceeded, Berezovsky fled to France, then to London, where he sought to reinvent himself as a champion of liberal democratic values. The irony did not go unremarked in Russia. Berezovsky professed to be immune to public cynicism about his motives. “I just hope to help people,” he said. In 2002, the Russian authorities issued an arrest warrant on charges of money-laundering and illegal business activity. Berezovsky sought to resist moves to extradite him the following year, claiming to be a martyr to an “utterly corrupt” legal system, and arguing, more persuasively, that his life would be in danger if he returned. In 2004, rumours swirled that Berezovsky had helped to finance Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, which ushered in a government in Kiev determined to break free of Moscow’s influence. Then, in 2006, Alexander Litvinenko, who had begun working for Berezovsky, and whom Berezovsky had helped to escape to London in 2000, died after being poisoned with radioactive polonium at a London hotel. He accused Putin of his murder. But the coup de grace was yet to come. In 2007 Berezovsky served a writ on the Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, whom he had first met on a fellow oligarch’s yacht in 1995. Abramovich, one of the richest and most private men in the world, was accused of blackmailing Berezovsky into selling-off his interests both in Sibneft and an aluminium company for a fraction of their true worth. Abramovich in turn claimed that between 1995 and 2002 he had paid Berezovsky 1.3bn not for any oil or metal stakes, but to buy political protection. When in 2012 the Chelsea owner won what turned out to be the biggest private court case in British history, it was a devastating blow to Berezovsky, financially and psychologically. By the time of the verdict his billions were under assault from those in his personal life too. In 2011 he paid what was, at the time, the biggest divorce settlement in history, believed to be worth hundreds of millions, to his ex-wife Galina Besharova. Then, this January, his former lover Elena Gorbunova began legal proceedings claiming that she, too, was owed millions. A request by Berezovsky to impose “total privacy” on early rounds of his battle with Gorbunova was rejected by a High Court judge in January this year. Mr Justice Mann, presiding over the case, described Berezovsky as a “man under financial pressure”. And this week Berezovsky made headlines when it emerged that he was attempting to sell a limited edition Andy Warhol portrait of Lenin at Christie’s. The portrait was valued at up to £50,000. With his once vast fortune and influence fast dwindling to nothing, Berezovsky cut an increasingly isolated figure at his home in Surrey, where the phalanx of former French foreign legionaries which once served as his close protection team had been whittled down to a single bodyguard. It was that bodyguard who reportedly found Berezovsky’s body, and though police sent in teams specialised in handling radioactive substances, the property was quickly given the all clear. Boris Berezovsky had two children with his first wife, Nina. In 1991 he married Galina Besharova, with whom he also had two children. The marriage was dissolved in 2010. He also had two children with his partner Elena Gorbunova. Boris Berezovsky, born January 23 1946, died March 23 2013 ||||| The British-based businessman Boris Berezovsky has won his claim for libel after being falsely named on Russian state television as the man behind the murder of the former Moscow agent Alexander Litvinenko. Mr Litvinenko, a strong critic of then Russian President Vladimir Putin, was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 and died in London in November 2006, prompting a murder investigation that implicated Russia. Yesterday Mr Berezovsky, 63, was awarded £150,000 in libel damages against both the TV channel RTR Planeta and Vladimir Terluk, the man who made the allegations, which were also broadcast on satellite television in the UK in April 2007. During the High Court hearing in London, the judge, Mr Justice Eady, heard that the Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (RTR) had declined to take part in the proceedings. It left Mr Terluk, whom Mr Berezovsky alleged was the silhouetted figure called Pyotr featured in the programme, \\"to face the music on his own\\" without legal representation. The judge, who tried the case without a jury, said: \\"I can say unequivocally that there is no evidence before me that Mr Berezovsky had any part in the murder of Mr Litvinenko. Nor, for that matter, do I see any basis for reasonable grounds to suspect him of it.\\" Mr Berezovsky, who now lives in Surrey, had told the court that Mr Litvinenko, whom he knew as Sasha, had twice saved his life and that their shared history as exiles and opponents of President Putin and the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, had cemented their friendship. He said he was concerned about the damage which the \\"absolutely outrageous\\" allegation would cause to his reputation. Alexander Litvinenko's death was linked to a meeting with a group of Russians in a London hotel three years ago during which his tea was spiked with polonium. After yesterday's ruling, Mr Berezovsky said: \\"I have no doubt that, in making this programme, the purpose of RTR and the Russian authorities was to undermine my asylum status in the UK and to put the investigation of Sasha Litvinenko's murder on the wrong track. \\"I am pleased that the court, through its judgment, has unequivocally demolished RTR's claims. I trust the conclusions of the British investigators that the trail leads to Russia, and I hope that one day justice will prevail.\\" The central allegation in the programme Vesti Nedeli – the equivalent of BBC's Newsnight – was that Mr Berezovsky was somehow responsible for the murder of Mr Litvinenko. The motive was said to be that Mr Litvinenko was a witness to a conspiracy in 2003 to save Mr Berezovsky from extradition to Russia and instead obtain his political asylum in the UK. Both RTR and Mr Terluk, who denied in court that he was Pyotr and pleaded justification, are jointly liable for the damages, but the judge acknowledged there were likely to be formidable obstacles in recovering the money. Key figures in the case: Where are they now? *The suspect During interviews in Moscow with Scotland Yard investigators, the former KGB agent Andrei Lugovoi, 44, a wealthy businessman who once headed a private security firm, denied the accusations that he killed Litvinenko, saying he was also a victim in the case. Russia refuses to extradite Lugovoi, who is now a Russian parliamentarian with the Kremlin-aligned Liberal Democratic Party, and thus has state protection from extradition. *The widow Marina Litvinenko, 47, has spent the last few years campaigning to bring her husband's killers to justice. In 2007 she wrote a letter to President Putin asking him not to obstruct the British investigation of her husband's poisoning. Mrs Litvinenko, a qualified engineer who lives in London, co-wrote a book on the affair with Russian author Alex Goldfarb and has reportedly been working on a film project. *The family Litvinenko's father Walter, 71, has claimed that the Italian government refused him and his family refugee status because of Silvio Berlusconi's close friendship with Vladimir Putin. A restaurant in Rimini belonging to Alexander's chef brother Maxim was raided and closed down last year. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A long time ago, a man named Boris Berezovsky, who was from Russia, had a lot of money and was very powerful. He moved to the United Kingdom after having some problems with the Russian government and their leader, President Putin. In 2013, Boris Berezovsky was found dead in his house near London. The police couldn't explain the reason behind his death, but they kept investigating to find out what happened. Boris Berezovsky had other issues before his death, like losing a lot of money in a big legal fight with another rich man named Roman Abramovich, who owns a famous soccer club called Chelsea Football Club. People believed that Berezovsky was very sad and under a lot of pressure because of these troubles. The story also talks about another man named Alexander Litvinenko, who was once a friend of Berezovsky and was a critic of the Russian government. Litvinenko was poisoned and died in London in 2006, and many people thought that the Russian government had something to do with his death. Berezovsky had won a legal battle against a Russian TV channel and another man who said that he was the one behind Litvinenko's murder, which was not true. In the end, we don't know why Boris Berezovsky died, but his life had many twists and turns, and he was involved in a lot of conflicts with powerful people in Russia and the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical completion of this news story?.

In fact, your independence is reinforced with good friends. When your friend needs someone to talk to, be there for them. Be trustworthy. Do not gossip or tell anyone about your friends' secrets or personal matters. Even if they didn't say anything about it. Be a strong person for your friends and loved ones. It not only shows you're selfless, but pretty soon you'll learn how to deal with any situation that comes your way because of your friends' experiences. It will be difficult because parents have a natural instinct to provide for us. Just politely decline when they offer financial help. It is tempting to depend on others financially, but before you experience independence, you must be independent. Secure your finances. True independent living relies on financial freedom. Pay your own bills, drive your own car, sign a personal check for your rent. If you don't have the money for these expenses, save aggressively. Not only will you gain financial freedom with your savings, but the money you keep to yourself will give you an incredible feeling of independence and motivation. Work hard at everything you do. Defend your opinions. And, for you girls, don't let a man feel he has to pamper you and for you boys, vice versa. If you're capable of doing something good, do it. So long as it doesn't have a bad effect, you should do it. That doesn't mean do absolutely everything, but you shouldn't feel it's necessary for people to do things for you that you could do for yourself. Work your best and hardest to leave people saying \\"That person doesn't rely on anyone to do things for them. What a strong, independent person.\\" This is a difficult step on the journey to independent living, but you must start doing things on your own. You do not need to drive with someone to the restaurant, because you can meet them there. Go shopping alone, spend at least one or two evenings a week by yourself. Work on activities that force you to lead, not follow. If you're used to always having a buddy when you go hiking or go to the mall, see how it feels to rough it on your own. Don't break friendships unless absolutely necessary. Learn to keep a healthy distance. Even if those friends are \\"totally cool,\\" they may only hold you back from breaking out on your own. \\"Weed out your garden\\"; some people make you shine, while others will stunt your growth and draw all your energy. If you have a friend who is trying to make you do things that make you uncomfortable, whether it's stealing or just being a meaner person, then it's time to cut the cord. Avoid any friends who really like building a following and having people worship them. These people will want you to only do what they say and will keep you from being independent. Save as much as reasonably possible. This will help you create an emergency fund, since life can be unpredictable at times. You don't plan accidents. Improve the quality of your life by putting aside a set amount of money each month. There are such things as accidents, health problems, or even natural disasters, which can occur when you least expect it. You may not think that you have the capacity to save money, but even doing small things, like making your own coffee instead of going to Starbucks once a day, can save you over 30 a week -- that's over 1,500 a year! Most banks offer a checking and savings account together, in one convenient package. Some companies, institutions, and organizations will require you to have at least a checking account (some only pay employees via direct deposit). Money you earn that isn't necessary for your own expenses should be put into a savings account until you're ready to be independent. Having your own bank account will keep you from depending on others for money, and will help you stay away from reckless spending. Experiment with different careers and find the one that you enjoy most. If money makes you happy, be an investment banker or start a small business. If you like kids, be a teacher. If you like being an expert, be a lawyer, professor or consultant. If you enjoy talking to people, be a salesperson or go into the services industry. If knowing how things work is more your game, try engineering, or Psychology and sociology. The majority of students end up in careers unrelated to their major. Some people do not get far in formal education and end up millionaires. Working in a career that you enjoy is a part of becoming a mature person. Something you are devoted to, whether it is a sport, girlfriend/boyfriends, music, a band, a form of art/dance, religion. Something that you do constantly that takes up some time. Video games and playing Barbie all day aren't the best value out there. (This includes wasting your time on the Internet). Finding a passion will make your life feel more meaningful and will make you feel more like you know what you really want out of life. People who are most dependent on others allow their worlds to revolve around the needs of other people or other things. Plan your day according to your own schedule--make a list of what you want to do, what you need to do and what you should have already done. If a friend really needs a favor, fine, but don't let that friend dominate the plan you had made so carefully. Treat your alone time like it's a date with Brad Pitt. That is, guard it carefully and don't let anyone stop you from spending time with yourself. You don't have to be stubborn to be independent. If someone has really helped you out, then thank that person by giving him a sincere \\"thank you,\\" writing a card, or giving him a big hug if he's a close friend. There's nothing wrong in admitting that you do need help sometimes and it won't make you any less independent to acknowledge the times when you need help. Just because somebody wants to pay 60 for a shirt doesn't mean you have to. Dress how you want to dress, and say what you want to say. If you like to act crazy, by all means go for it! A good thing to remember is that good taste and style does not have to cost money - it is something that is innate or learned but can make good of anything with a little know-how. Hanging out with people who are just like you won't inspire you to be any more independent. Making an effort to be friends with a variety of people who all have different perspectives and occupations can give you more of a sense of what's out there and to see that there's no one way to do it right. It can be refreshing to hang out with a lawyer if you're a yoga instructor, or to spend time with a chef if you're a student. This can make you more open-minded and more willing to do something completely new on your own. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, being independent doesn't mean cutting ties with friends.

Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. In its six years of existence, Audioslave released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. Audioslave disbanded in February 2007 when Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was permanently leaving the band \\"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences.\\" The 2007 Rage Against the Machine reunion and tour involving the rest of the band, as well as solo albums released that same year by Morello and Cornell, cemented the supergroup's permanent demise. On January 20, 2017, three days after announcing their reunion, Audioslave performed together for the first time in over a decade at Prophets of Rage's Anti-Inaugural Ball. In the early hours of May 18, 2017, Chris Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit, at the age of 52, after playing a Soundgarden show.

Jane was 70 years-old, while Jill was 55. They shared many stories. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend had a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Jill, who is 55 years old, has a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to Jane, who is 70 years old. Age is one of the most significant risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, with the likelihood of developing the condition increasing as one gets older. Although age is not the sole determinant of Alzheimer's risk, it is widely known that the probability of developing the disease doubles every five years after the age of 65. By this measure, Jane, being 70 years old, faces a higher risk of Alzheimer's compared to Jill, who is 55. Other factors that can contribute to the risk of developing Alzheimer's include genetics, family history, and lifestyle choices such as smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise, and social isolation. It is important to note that while Jill has a smaller chance of developing Alzheimer's disease when compared to Jane due to their respective ages, both should still take preventative measures to maintain their cognitive health. These measures can include staying mentally and physically active, maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding smoking, and participating in regular social interactions. In conclusion, while both Jill and Jane can take steps to reduce their risk of Alzheimer's disease, Jill, being younger at 55 years old, has a smaller chance of developing the condition compared to her 70-year-old friend, Jane."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The sweet taste of cold and wood smoke hung in the air. Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this. He set a half dollar on the bar and started for the door. \\"Don't get in a huff,\\" the bartender said. Marlin looked back. \\"Kraamer lives about a mile west of town.

Second question: How much Benadryl can you give your dog? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: Is it safe to give a cat Benadryl? It is generally safe to give Benadryl (diphenhydramine) to cats if recommended and dosed properly by a veterinarian. Benadryl is classified as an antihistamine that works by blocking the effect of histamine, a compound released during an allergic reaction. It may help to alleviate itching, sneezing, and hives in cats experiencing allergies or mild reactions to vaccines, bug bites, or environmental irritants. However, it is crucial to consult with a veterinarian before administering any medication to your cat. Cats require a much lower dose of Benadryl than humans, and it is typically recommended to be given at a dosage of 0.5 to 2 milligrams per pound of the cat's body weight, usually not exceeding 2 milligrams per dose. The frequency should be around every 8 to 12 hours, but the exact dosage and frequency must be determined by a veterinarian on a case-by-case basis. Some potential side effects of Benadryl in cats may include sedation, dry mouth, increased heart rate, and urinary retention. It is vital to monitor your cat closely after administering Benadryl and keep in contact with a veterinarian if any severe reactions or concerns arise. Second question: How much Benadryl can you give your dog? It is generally safe to give dogs Benadryl (diphenhydramine) if recommended and dosed properly by a veterinarian. Dogs can sometimes experience allergies, insect bites, or mild vaccine reactions, and Benadryl may help alleviate symptoms such as itching and swelling in these cases. The general dosage recommendation for dogs is approximately 1 milligram per pound of body weight, given every eight to twelve hours. However, the exact dosage, frequency, and duration of treatment should be determined by a veterinarian taking into consideration your dog's size, age, medical history, and the specific issue being addressed. Potential side effects of Benadryl for dogs may include sedation, dry mouth, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, and coordination problems. It is essential to monitor your dog closely after administering Benadryl, and always consult with a veterinarian if any problems arise or your dog's symptoms worsen. Are these two questions asking the same thing? While these two questions are related in that they both concern the use of Benadryl for pets, they are not asking the same thing. The first question asks about the safety and appropriate use of Benadryl in cats, while the second question is focused on the dosage guidelines of Benadryl for dogs. While the main subject is Benadryl's use in animals, the specific details and considerations for cats and dogs differ due to differences in their physiology, potential side effects, and dosing recommendations."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

Some sports historians believe that the game of soccer began in England in the third century, however. They say that early English warriors kicked around the head of a killed enemy. This may or may not be true, but it is certain that soccer is an ancient sport. Without doubt, the English played soccer during the times of King Edward I in the 1300s. In fact, the king passed a law against playing it.

However, providing a long detailed answer as per your requirement would mean explaining more about the Spanish language, its origins, features, etc., to make sure it's meaningful and insightful. Spanish, also known as Español, is a Romance language that originated in the Iberian Peninsula of Europe. Today, it is a global language with nearly 500 million native speakers, mainly in Spain and the Americas. It is the second most spoken native language in the world, after Mandarin Chinese. Spanish is a phonetic language, which means words are generally pronounced the way they're spelled. Spanish grammar is quite different from English grammar, though, with gendered nouns and a different verb conjugation system, among other things. Another interesting trait is the use of inverted question and exclamation marks at the beginning of questions and exclamations. Now, let's consider a simple sentence in Spanish: \\"El gato está en la caja.\\" The above sentence means \\"The cat is in the box.\\" Let's break it down: 1. \\"El\\" is a definite article in Spanish, equivalent to \\"the\\" in English, used here because it's referring to a specific cat. 2. \\"Gato\\" is a masculine noun that means \\"cat.\\" 3. \\"Está\\" is the third-person singular present form of the verb \\"estar,\\" which is one of the two Spanish verbs that can be translated as \\"to be.\\" It implies a temporary state or location. 4. \\"En\\" is a preposition which means \\"in.\\" 5. \\"La\\" is the feminine definite article, equivalent to \\"the\\" in English. 6. \\"Caja\\" is a feminine noun which means \\"box.\\" So, that's a detailed version of a simple sentence in Spanish.

The language spoken in Sicily under Muslim rule was Siculo-Arabic. In 1038, a Byzantine army under George Maniaces crossed the strait of Messina. This army included a corps of Normans that saved the situation in the first clash against the Muslims from Messina. After another decisive victory in the summer of 1040, Maniaces halted his march to lay siege to Syracuse. Despite his success, Maniaces was removed from his position, and the subsequent Muslim counter-offensive reconquered all the cities captured by the Byzantines. The Norman Robert Guiscard, son of Tancred, invaded Sicily in 1060. The island was split between three Arab emirs, and the Christian population in many parts of the island rose up against the ruling Muslims. One year later, Messina fell, and in 1072 Palermo was taken by the Normans. The loss of the cities, each with a splendid harbor, dealt a severe blow to Muslim power on the island. Eventually all of Sicily was taken. In 1091, Noto in the southern tip of Sicily and the island of Malta, the last Arab strongholds, fell to the Christians. Islamic authors noted the tolerance of the Norman kings of Sicily. Ibn al-Athir wrote: \\"They [the Muslims] were treated kindly, and they were protected, even against the Franks. Because of that, they had great love for King Roger.\\" The Muslim problem characterized Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily under Holy Roman Emperors Henry VI and his son Frederick II. Many repressive measures were introduced by Frederick II to please the popes, who were intolerant of Islam in the heart of Christendom. This resulted in a rebellion by Sicilian Muslims, which in turn triggered organized resistance and systematic reprisals and marked the final chapter of Islam in Sicily. The complete eviction of Muslims and the annihilation of Islam in Sicily was completed by the late 1240s when the final deportations to Lucera took place.

Read and understand the question: The person is following a recipe that calls for a significant amount of salt to bring out the flavor. However, due to dietary restrictions, he needs to adjust the amount of salt added. 2. Analyze the wording: The question uses the word \\"added,\\" implying that the person did use some salt, just not the full amount the recipe called for due to his dietary limitations. This means that there should be at least some salt involved. 3. Evaluate each option: - too much: This option suggests he put in more salt than needed, which contradicts his dietary restrictions. So, this can be ruled out. - little bit: This option indicates he used a smaller amount of salt than the recipe called for, adhering to his dietary restrictions. This option seems plausible. - too little: This option implies that he used an insufficient amount of salt. While it shows he reduced salt usage, \\"too little\\" has a negative connotation, implying that it might not give the desired taste. This option could be considered but it's less favorable than \\"little bit.\\" - too few: This option is grammatically incorrect because \\"few\\" is used for countable nouns, while salt is considered uncountable. So, this can be ruled out. - very little: This option suggests that the person used an extremely minimal amount of salt. While it could comply with his dietary restrictions, it has a greater chance of compromising taste in comparison to \\"little bit.\\" 4.

Brevity and clarity are essential components of effective communication because they enable a speaker or writer to convey their thoughts and ideas in a concise and easily understandable manner. When we express ourselves briefly and clearly, we minimize the chance of misunderstanding and confusion, and we make it easier for our audience to grasp the intended message. There are several ways to achieve brevity and clarity in communication: 1. Use simple words and phrases: Choose words that are familiar to most people, and make your point using simple, direct language. This reduces the cognitive load on the reader or listener, making it easier for them to understand the message. 2. Focus on the main point: Determine the most critical information you want to convey, and concentrate on expressing that message as straightforwardly as possible. Too much peripheral information can distract from the main point, leading to a loss of clarity. 3. Omit unnecessary details: When providing examples or explanations, only include the crucial elements that directly relate to the issue or topic at hand. Including too many extraneous details can dilute the message and make it more challenging for the audience to understand. 4. Use specific language: Whenever feasible, use concrete and precise language rather than abstract or vague expressions. By using specific terms, you make your message more understandable and facilitate a more accurate interpretation by your audience. 5. Edit and revise: After crafting your message, review and revise it to ensure that it is as concise and clear as possible. This may include eliminating redundant phrases, simplifying sentence structures, and removing unnecessary words or jargon. To illustrate the importance of brevity and clarity, here's an example of a brief sentence: \\"The sun sets early in winter, leaving the evenings cold and dark.\\" This sentence conveys a clear message in a concise manner, enhancing the reader's understanding of the intended point. In conclusion, whether in written or spoken forms, brevity and clarity are crucial to effective communication. By using simple words, focusing on the main point, omitting unnecessary details, being specific, and revisiting and revising the message, communicators can more successfully convey their ideas and reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings."},{"instruction":"Context: Trying to snap their three-game losing streak, the Lions flew to Gillette Stadium for a Week 13 fight with the New England Patriots.

When Cardinal Richelieu discovers that the queen had sent valuable diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham in England, a country enemy of France, the cardinal uses the information to blackmail the queen and create a difficult situation between her and King Louis, who now believes his wife to be in love with the Duke of Buckingham. Nobody knows that the diamonds are in possession of an old woman, Milady, who had stolen the diamonds from the duke and had brought them for Rochefort so that they would be nowhere to be found; Rochefort allows her to hold on to the diamonds in order to ensure this.

Public park vs. Sunday school classroom: The locations are different – one is outdoors and the other indoors in a specific classroom. Kids: The kids are the common element in both premise and hypothesis. Inflatable bouncer vs. praying: The activities are completely different – playtime with a physical activity vs. religious activity. Step 3: Analyze the relationships between the key elements. The premise describes a situation where kids gather at a public park to play in an inflatable bouncer. Meanwhile, the hypothesis talks about kids praying in a Sunday school classroom. The key elements in the hypothesis (praying and Sunday school classroom) do not share any relationship or similarity with the key elements in the premise (inflatable bouncer and public park).

He said his plan was to kill as many people as possible. But he said he had tried to spare some of the young people caught up in the killings on Utoeya island who he thought were under 16. Breivik has admitted the Oslo bombing and island shootings that killed 77. The trial will decide whether he is sane. A state psychiatric commission requested further clarification on the second of two psychiatric reports, which concluded he was sane and accountable for his actions. The first report found him legally insane. Breivik said he would do \\"anything to prevent\\" committal to a psychiatric hospital. Earlier, he said he had \\"lost absolutely everything\\" on 22 July 2011, all his family and friends, therefore he understood the loss he imposed on others. But he said the killings were \\"a small barbarian act to prevent a larger barbarian act\\". In July last year, Breivik set off a car bomb near government buildings in Oslo, killing eight, and then massacred 69 participants in a Labour Party youth camp on the nearby island of Utoeya. 'Not sorry' At the scene Anders Behring Breivik apologised for the first time in court on Monday - but not to those he killed, nor the hundreds he injured in his twin attacks. He said he was sorry for those injured in his bomb attack on Oslo government buildings whom he deemed not to be part of what he called Norway's ruling elite. He also said he understood perfectly well the suffering he had caused for those he injured and the families of the ones he killed. Yet to those gathered here to listen, his words most certainly rang hollow. Breivik has been speaking with the same visible lack of empathy he has shown throughout this trial, and he also repeated on Monday he would have done the same again and again. As he continued to describe the events on Utoeya island, Breivik told the court he had made an impromptu call to police with the intention of surrendering. But the police did not call him back, he said. He added that he was thinking: \\"I will carry on until I die.\\" Breivik apologised to those he did not define as his enemies. He also said he did not kill \\"many\\" under the age of 16 and chose not to shoot three people because they appeared to be minors. But he maintained he was not sorry for killing 77 and injuring hundreds of others in the twin attacks last year. And he described walking through the bodies lying on the ground, meticulously shooting each one again to ensure they were dead. For the first time, Breivik apologised not to those he killed, but to some of those he injured in the bomb attack on Oslo government buildings, whom he considered not to represent his self-defined enemy. Later, he said he would have carried out the attacks again \\"even knowing that 40% of the people on Utoeya were under 18 years old\\". He added there were many others in Norway \\"who deserve to be executed, eg journalists and members of parliament\\". During his five days of giving evidence, Anders Behring Breivik has usually answered questions from both prosecution and defence in a polite manner, reports Lars Bevanger in Oslo. On Monday, however, he appeared defiant on several occasions, especially when the prosecution team asked him about details of his so-called manifesto. He repeatedly interrupted and said they were out to \\"ridicule\\" him. Breivik said he understood his actions would lead to sympathy for the Labour party, but believed that sympathy could be eroded in two to three years. He again drew comparisons to al-Qaeda, arguing the Madrid train attacks in 2004 led to a change of government and the pull-out from Afghanistan. \\"Militant nationalists have a lot to learn from [al-Qaeda],\\" he told the court. Planned video Image caption Breivik's second target was a Labour Party summer youth camp on Utoeya In his other evidence on Monday, Breivik said he: believed political leaders would be \\"emotionally unstable\\" and would instruct police to execute him after his arrest at Utoeya told police he believed his family might be executed after his actions considered at one stage stealing a small plane from a nearby airfield to flee after his actions planned to make a video recording of himself decapitating former PM Gro Harlem Brundtland while reading a prepared text spelling out her \\"crimes\\" repeatedly replied \\"no comment\\" to any questions about other members of an anti-Muslim network called the Knights Templar, which Breivik says he belongs to. Although several organisations use that name, prosecutors believe Mr Breivik's group does not exist Breivik denies criminal responsibility for killing the 77 victims, saying he was defending Norway from multiculturalism. He said he had envisaged the most important attack as being the Oslo bombing, but Utoeya \\"became the most important attack when the government building did not collapse\\" as planned. Depending on whether he is found sane or not, he faces either prison or committal to a psychiatric institution. Breivik himself maintains he is sane, but a practitioner of political extremism. Breivik has been allocated five days in total to give evidence, with the entire proceedings expected to last 10 weeks. Monday was expected to be his last day of evidence, but he may return to the stand on Wednesday when his psychological state is discussed. ||||| OSLO — Anders Behring Breivik , the self-described anti-Islamic militant who admitted killing 77 people in a bombing and shooting rampage last summer, sought Monday to include himself among the victims, telling a court that he was able to undertake the “gruesome” murders of scores of youths because they were “necessary” and telling bereaved families that he too had paid a high price. Describing how he stalked and executed teenagers attending a political youth camp on the wooded island of Utoya, Mr. Breivik, 33, said: “I have never experienced anything so gruesome. It was probably even more horrendous for those I was hunting. But it was necessary. Yes, it was necessary. The July 22 operation was necessary.” “When people say they have lost their most beloved, I also lost my entire family, I lost my friends,” he also said. “It was my choice. I sacrificed them, but I lost my entire family and friends on 22 July. I lost everything. So to a certain extent, I understand.” Monday was the last scheduled day of testimony from Mr. Breivik, who maintains that he acted out of a dedication to fight political acceptance of the “Islamic colonization of Norway.” The court will now begin to hear from witnesses of the shootings on Utoya, which left a total of 69 people dead, and a bomb blast in central Oslo that killed eight more people. With his guilt already established, the trial centers on the question of whether Mr. Breivik was insane at the time of the killings. Two psychiatric reviews have come down on opposite sides of the question. He insists that he was sane, and that efforts to portray him otherwise are part of a campaign to discredit his fight against Muslim immigration. If he is found to have been sane, the presiding judges can sentence him to up to 21 years in prison, with a provision to keep him behind bars longer if he is still considered dangerous. If he is found to have been insane, Mr. Breivik can be kept in forced psychiatric care. Two contradictory psychiatric reports have already been handed to the court, but the final decision will be in the hands of the two professional and three lay judges at the trial. “This case is very simply that I am not a psychotic case and I am sane,” Mr. Breivik told the court on Friday. “I understand that when you see something too extreme, you might think it is irrational and insane. But you must separate political extremism from insanity.” ||||| OSLO (Reuters) - The Norwegian who massacred 77 people to protest against Muslim immigration to Europe said on Monday he had hoped to kill as many as 150 and kept on killing because police failed to respond urgently to his phone call. Breivik has given a detailed account of his car bomb attack at government headquarters in Oslo on July 22, which killed eight people, followed hours later by his shooting of 69 people, mostly teenagers, at a Labour Party island camp. He said on Monday his \\"gruesome\\" actions were to prevent a civil war caused, he said, by a Muslim takeover of Europe. \\"This was a minor barbarity to prevent a larger one\\", he said on the sixth day of a trial that has transfixed Norway. \\"I've never ever experienced such a horrendous ... gruesome act as this. But it was necessary,\\" Breivik said in his usual tone, lacking emotion. \\"It was much more cruel than I expected.\\" Breivik said he thought that at least another 150 people had drowned in a lake as they fled his gunfire so he called police to surrender, only to find himself forced to leave a message. \\"I said 'call me back when you got the right person',\\" Breivik said. \\"I told myself 'I will continue until the phone rings'. I thought, I will continue until I die. What would I have done, sat by the pier waiting?\\" COLD, MATTER-OF-FACT Breivik has denied criminal guilt, insisting his victims were \\"traitors\\" whose multiculturalist views facilitated what he saw as a de facto Muslim invasion of Europe. Most Norwegians have reacted with horror to his testimony, delivered in a cold, matter-of-fact manner, while there is wide public acceptance of his right as a defendant to give it. Breivik has had almost free rein to issue warnings against immigration and explain how he scoured the Internet for bomb-making information while writing a 1,500-page document declaring himself part of a secretive group that is Europe's answer to al Qaeda - a group the police have said likely does not exist. Breivik said he spared some people, including a 10-year-old boy whose father was his first victim, and a Labour Party activist because he looked right-wing. \\"Some people have the type of look that is associated with the leftist movement,\\" Breivik said. \\"This person, (Adrian) Pracon appeared right-wing, that was his appearance. That's the reason I didn't fire any shots at him,\\" said Breivik, 33, whose sanity or lack of it is a prime issue to be determined in the trial. The 22-year-old Labour party youth wing activist earlier told Reuters: \\"I remember him pointing the gun at me for quite a long time before he took it down, turned and walked away.\\" Breivik told how he used a fake police uniform to trick people into coming out of hiding and then shot them at close range. \\"I started with ‘have you seen him, do you know where the shots came from?' ... then I said ‘there's a rescue boat that's going to take you to safety but you need to come out',\\" he said. FIRST APOLOGY Later in the rampage, which lasted more than an hour, Breivik came upon Pracon again as he played dead, and this time shot the son of Polish immigrants through the shoulder. He said he spared the boy's life because \\"I could not understand what such a little boy was doing at a political indoctrination camp.\\" But he said he had no qualms about killing teenagers. His victims were as young as 14. \\"They were not children, under the legal definition only under 14 are children ... they were political activists,\\" he said. Breivik issued his first seeming apology, to innocent bystanders hurt or killed when his 950-kg fertilizer bomb went off in Oslo. More than 200 were injured. \\"To all of those ... I want to say I am deeply sorry for what happened,\\" he said. \\"But what happened, happened.\\" Ahead of the trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks, one court-appointed team of psychiatrists concluded that Breivik was psychotic while a second found him mentally capable. If Breivik is deemed sane, as he hopes to be, he could face a 21-year prison sentence with indefinite extensions for as long as he is considered dangerous. (Editing by Janet Lawrence) |||||Summary:","output":"Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to killing 77 people in a bombing and shooting rampage in Norway, shared more details of the killings during his trial in Oslo. Breivik called the police to surrender but decided to carry on killing when they failed to return his call. His plan was to kill as many people as possible, but he claimed that he tried to spare some of the young people on Utoeya island who he thought were under 16. The trial will determine whether Breivik is sane or not, as there are conflicting psychiatric reports. If found sane, he faces up to 21 years in prison with a provision to keep him behind bars longer if he is still considered dangerous; if found insane, he can be kept in forced psychiatric care."},{"instruction":"Question: What is extra-pair copulation? Answer: Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"As an AI assistant, I'll answer the question about extra-pair copulation in a more detailed and step-by-step manner: 1. Define extra-pair copulation: Extra-pair copulation (EPC) is a mating behavior in which an individual that is part of a socially monogamous pair engages in reproductive activities with another individual outside of their pair bond. 2. Explain why it occurs: In many species, extra-pair copulation may occur to increase genetic diversity and improve offspring survival chances. Additionally, EPC can help ensure that individuals produce more offspring, thus maximizing their reproductive success. 3. Provide examples of species where EPC is common: Birds are often cited examples for EPC. For instance, in species such as song sparrows, blue tits, and European starlings, it has been observed that females can mate with multiple males, outside of their primary pair bond, during a single breeding season. 4. Discuss implications: EPC can have varied consequences, such as increased aggression among males, paternity uncertainty, and higher energy investment in mating efforts. Moreover, since it challenges the traditional concept of monogamy, EPC has become an essential topic of study and discussion among biologists, particularly in the fields of behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology. In conclusion, extra-pair copulation is a mating behavior in which an individual, usually part of a socially monogamous pair bond, engages in reproductive activities with another individual outside of their pair bond. It occurs in several species mainly for increasing genetic diversity, offspring survival rate, and maximizing reproductive success, often leading to varied consequences for the individuals involved."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: There are many older people in the world and there will be many more.A limeknown fact is that over 60 percent of the older people live in developing countries.According to the World Health Organization,by 2020 there will be 1 billion,with over 700 million living in developing countries. It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries.For example,it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent.It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk?One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability.Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible,including during old age,to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value the older people in their society.In some African countries,certainly in Asia,older people are respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge.Yet traditions are fading away daily,which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people.As society changes,attitudes will change. Much needs to be done to get rid of age discrimination in employment.Lifelong learning programs need to be provided to enable older people to be active members in a country's development.

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.

This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 Portrait of a Man, Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa in front of a landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view – popularised during the Italian Quattrocento – towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer. The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer. Van Eyck's 1433 Portrait of a Man is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer. Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position.

To answer the underlying question, here's a step-by-step approach to learning and memorizing information quickly and effectively: 1. Break down the material: Divide the information into smaller, manageable chunks. This makes it easier to grasp and retain. 2. Repetition with spaced intervals: The more you repeat something, the more likely you are to remember it. But, spacing out the repetitions over time is more effective than repeating something multiple times in quick succession. This is known as the spacing effect, which helps build stronger memory connections. 3. Create associations and connections: Relate new information to something you already know or to a personal experience. This makes the material more meaningful and easier to remember. 4. Use mnemonic devices: Mnemonics are memory aids that may involve acronyms, rhymes, or visual images. They can help you remember complex information by simplifying it into manageable patterns. 5. Teach someone else the material: Explaining a concept to someone else can help solidify your understanding and reveal any gaps in your knowledge. 6. Active engagement: Engage with the material actively by taking notes, asking questions, and discussing concepts with others, which will further improve your retention and understanding of the topic. 7. Test yourself: Practice recalling the information by taking quizzes, tests, or using flashcards. This form of active retrieval practice reinforces the memory and helps identify areas that need more focus. 8. Sufficient sleep and breaks: Sleep and breaks are crucial for consolidating memories and maintaining focus during the learning process. Make sure you give yourself enough time to rest between study sessions and get a good night's sleep. Overall, learning effectively requires a combination of techniques and strategies tailored to your individual needs and preferences. By incorporating these steps into your study routine, you can improve your ability to retain and understand information more quickly and efficiently."},{"instruction":"sold to scrapping in frederikshavn, in 2014.

In 1915, publisher Shōzaburō Watanabe introduced the term shin-hanga (\\"new prints\\") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences. Prominent artists included Goyō Hashiguchi, called the \\"Utamaro of the Taishō period\\" for his manner of depicting women; Shinsui Itō, who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women; and Hasui Kawase, who made modern landscapes. Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English Charles W. Bartlett (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goyō and Hiroshi Yoshida set up studios to publish their own work.Artists of the sōsaku-hanga (\\"creative prints\\") movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands. Kanae Yamamoto (1882–1946), then a student at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced Fisherman using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production. The foundation of the Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement. The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles. Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of Kōshirō Onchi (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of Un'ichi Hiratsuka (1895–1997).

This doesn't require much supervision or guidance, so you can set up drills for the rest of the session at the same time. And you don't even need cones! Another fun way to get them warmed up is games like' stuck in the mud'. Explanation: Option (1) is the appropriate choice as it explains how the initial pulse raising activity mentioned in the paragraph (running laps) doesn't require much supervision and allows the coach to set up further drills while the players warm up. It also offers an additional, fun warm-up activity for kids, which is relevant to the context. Option (2) is incorrect because a hard, fast cooldown is not recommended for a warm-up drill, and it's not age-appropriate for kids. Option (3) is incorrect because doing a standing handstand and hitting their arm and hip with a soccer ball is not a suitable warm-up exercise, and it could potentially result in injuries. Option (4) is incorrect because it describes an activity that could tire the kids out quickly rather than preparing them for the session with a proper warm-up activity."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \\"the descendants\\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves).

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Two farms were situated on opposite banks of a large river flowing into the ocean. Hill farm practiced conventional agriculture, while Dew farm practiced permaculture design within the context of organic farming. Which farm generated more marine litter?","output":"It is likely that Hill farm, which practiced conventional agriculture, generated more marine litter than Dew farm, which practiced permaculture design within the context of organic farming. Conventional agriculture often relies on the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, which are more prone to runoff into rivers and eventually contribute to marine pollution. The excess nutrients from these chemicals can promote algal blooms, leading to oxygen depletion and the creation of dead zones in marine ecosystems. Additionally, conventional farming practices may result in greater soil erosion and sedimentation, which can further contribute to marine pollution. On the other hand, permaculture design and organic farming practices, like those employed at Dew farm, focus on sustainable and regenerative methods. This includes minimizing external inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, reducing soil disturbance, and implementing practices that work with natural systems to improve soil health and prevent erosion. These practices lead to reduced chances of harmful chemicals and sediments entering waterways and the ocean, thus generating less marine litter and pollution in comparison to conventional agriculture methods like those at Hill farm. However, it should be noted that the specific practices at both the Hill farm and Dew farm, as well as the local environment, would play a crucial role in determining the precise comparative impact of the two farms on marine litter generation."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Among the guests are members of The Joy Luck Club, their daughters, other relatives, and friends. The characters narrate their journeys while they reflect upon their pasts. The Joy Luck Club was formed by four women; Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin), Ying-Ying St. Clair (France Nuyen), An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh), in San Francisco. The members have mainly played mahjong and told each other's stories over the years. They immigrated from China, remarried, and gave birth to children in America.

The film follows Homer Simpson, whose irresponsibility gets the best of him when he pollutes the lake in Springfield after the town has cleaned it up following receipt of a warning from the Environmental Protection Agency. As the townspeople exile him and eventually his family abandons him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, when he intends to destroy Springfield. 20th Century Fox announced on April 1, 2006 that the film would be released worldwide on July 27, 2007.

Richard Roberts and wife Lindsay appear on CNN's \\"Larry King Live\\" last week. Lindsay Roberts, in a statement on the university's Web site, said the allegations against her \\"sicken me to my soul. ... I live my life in a morally upright manner and throughout my marriage have never, ever engaged in any sexual behavior with any man outside of my marriage as the accusations imply.\\" The suit, filed earlier this month, has drawn international attention to the private Christian school in Tulsa, Oklahoma, founded by evangelist Oral Roberts, father of university President Richard Roberts. The new allegations come in an amended version of the wrongful termination suit filed by three former professors, who say they lost their jobs after reporting that Roberts and his family lavishly spent school money for personal expenses. The amended lawsuit, filed Friday, also alleges that the university gave a \\"convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to students\\" while the man acted as a \\"mentor.\\" The lawsuit also claims the university shredded evidence three days after the suit was filed against the school. The school denies both accusations in a statement on its Web site. The new allegations involving Lindsay Roberts come in a section titled \\"Scandal Vulnerability Assessment.\\" It says that photos show her and an underage male smoking at the president's residence and that she \\"spent the night in the ORU guest house with an underage male on nine separate occasions.\\" It also references 29 photos it says show her and an underage male alone in her car, time-stamped after midnight, despite a citywide 10 p.m. curfew for minors not with their parents. The suit does not allege sexual behavior. The suit says Richard Roberts \\"sought approval from stakeholders for moving the underage male into the family residence,\\" and \\"a longtime maintenance employee was summarily fired so that the same underage male companion could have his position.\\" In her statement, Lindsay Roberts denied all the allegations against her in the lawsuit. \\"The part that grieves me the most is that these accusations are being brought forth in so many areas and being seen and heard through the media when the parties suing have continued to say they don't even know if these allegations are true,\\" she said. \\"I believe it's grossly unfair to allow such speculation to be used against me and attached to a lawsuit in which I am not even named as a party.\\" Other allegations in the amended version of the lawsuit are in a section accusing the ORU board of negligence. It says that this past summer, the Board of Regents allowed the president and the school \\"to give a convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to the students of the university.\\" The man had previously \\"confessed to crimes\\" in courts in Tulsa and the surrounding area and was convicted, the suit says. \\"In one of these convictions, this 'Mentor' for ORU students -- reportedly hired at the direct personal instruction, and under the direct supervision of President Richard Roberts -- confessed to the facts regarding exposing himself to a 15-year-old boy in a school locker room,\\" the suit says. It also says three days after the initial lawsuit was filed on October 2, the board allowed ORU and Roberts to fire the school's financial comptroller after 26 years of service. Within hours, \\"voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoilation of evidence,\\" according to witnesses, the suit says. Beyond the online posting, university officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday by CNN. The suit was filed by John Swails, Tim Brooker and Paulita Brooker, who accuse Richard and Lindsay Roberts of treating school funds like their own bank account, using them for home renovations, expensive vacations and clothes -- allegations the Robertses and the school have previously denied. After complaining to the school's Board of Regents about university spending, two of the professors were fired from their jobs and the third was thrown into conditions \\"so intolerable\\" that he had no choice but to resign, the lawsuit says. One of the firings, the suit says, was also in retaliation for the plaintiff refusing to drop a sexual harassment complaint that one of his subordinates made against an associate provost, who is named as a defendant.

Bowser’s first week as mayor has not gone quite as smoothly as planned. On Tuesday, she handled her first snowfall to mixed reviews, and on Thursday evening, she learned that one of the few concrete goals she laid out in her inaugural speech — winning the right to host the 2024 Olympics — would not come to pass. Less than an hour later, she walked into a packed St. Augustine Catholic Church where she might have been brought even further down to earth. The Washington Interfaith Network gathered hundreds of concerned and churchgoing D.C. residents there to recite the group’s long-standing litany of grievances about a city that may be safer and more prosperous but is also less hospitable to seniors and low-income residents. Bowser heard from anonymous residents of the D.C. General shelter for homeless families. She heard from a MetroAccess driver fighting for better wages from the WMATA contractor she works for. And she heard from a Brooklyn minister organizing a national campaign to end handgun violence by pressuring firearms manufacturers. In the past, WIN’s “actions” have included asking elected officials or candidates to make specific pledges to create jobs, support affordable housing, or take action on other issues. On occasion, the group has taken steps to hold officials accountable for those pledges. But Bowser was not asked to make any pledges this time, and she won sustained applause from the crowd after more than 20 minutes of remarks that included lines like this one, responding to WIN’s new focus on gun violence: “You have a mayor who hates guns,” she said. “If it was up to me, we wouldn’t have any handguns in the District of Columbia. I swear to protect the Constitution and what the courts say, but I will do it in the most restrictive way as possible.” Bowser spent more of her speech, however, promising to make good on her campaign pledges of making the city more hospitable to the poor, the old, and the longtime residents who have felt left out by the city’s growth. She pledged to “to listen, to learn and to also to act.” She said, in her first 100 days, she would establish a “public works academy” to prepare D.C. residents without a college education for blue-collar jobs in the District government, as well as for public sector jobs with Metro or D.C. Water. She said she would create a “strike force” to focus on preserving affordable housing units that might be in danger due to expiring federal tax credits or voucher contracts. And she again pledged to commit at least 100 million yearly to affordable housing subsidy programs: “Today, at my first cabinet meeting, I heard one of my budget people say, ‘We’re gonna try to make the mayor look good with her first budget.’ To which I said, ‘Oh, the mayor’s gonna look good.’ So we’re gonna figure out how to get that 100 million.” Bowser closed her remarks with a plea for support. “When it gets tough, and it will, I need you there,” she said. “So when we have to have tough conversations around building transitional housing, tough conversations about closing D.C. General, tough conversations about revitalizing Barry Farm, I need you there.” “I didn’t get elected to warm the seat. And I only got elected for four years — though I’m going to run again,” she said to laughter. “But I know this, I can’t make decisions thinking about the next election, I have to make decisions that I think are right. And that is why I ran for mayor and that is why I need you every step of the way.” Mike DeBonis covers local politics and government for The Washington Post. He also writes a blog and a political analysis column that runs on Fridays.","output":"The new mayor of Washington DC, Muriel Bowser, had a challenging first week.

Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, a high-ranking Russian general, Aleksander Kodoroff, has other plans. Along with a rogue tactical unit, he kills all the soldiers onboard the train and then transfers nine of the warheads to another train. He also sets the timer on the one remaining warhead, then switches tracks to send his train out of harm's way and the transport train on a collision course with a passenger train. Inside a mountain tunnel, Kodoroff kills one of his high-ranking lieutenants who'd had reservations about the mission. A few minutes later the trains collide.

Every house had one, but no one really knew what either of them did when the door was shut. My dad left the house every morning and always seemed glad to see every one again at night. He opened the jar of pickles when no one else at home could. He was the only one in the house who wasn't afraid to go into the basement by himself. Whenever it rained, he got into the car and brought it around to the door. When anyone was sick, he went out to get the prescription filled. He set mousetraps. He cut back the roses so the thorns wouldn't hurt you when you came to the front door. He oiled my roller skates, and they went faster. When I got my bike, he ran alongside me for at least a thousand miles until I _ . He signed all my report and cards. He took a lot of pictures, but was never in them. He tightened up Mother's sagging clothesline every week or so. I was afraid of everyone else's father, but not my own. Whenever I played house , the mother doll had a lot to do. I never knew what to do with the daddy doll, so I had him say, \\"I'm going off to work now,\\" and threw him under the bed. When I was nine years old, my father didn't get up one morning and go to work, he went to the hospital and died the next day. There were a lot of people in the house who brought all kinds of good food and cakes. We had never had so much company before. He never did anything; I didn't know his leaving would hurt so much. We can infer(;) from the passage that _ . A) the writer thought her father was cool B) the writer missed her father very much after his death C) there were always a lot of people in the writer's house D) the writer was afraid of her father Answer:","output":"From the passage, we can infer that B) the writer missed her father very much after his death. The passage describes numerous moments in which the father played an important role in the writer's life, such as opening jars, going into the basement alone, and taking care of the family when they were sick. However, these instances were understated, not fully realized by the writer until her father's sudden and unexpected passing. The presence of people bringing food and cakes to the house highlights the gravity of her father's absence, emphasizing that his death has had a significant impact on their family and the community. In addition, the writer notes that her father never did anything that made her think his leaving would hurt so much, which speaks to the father's unassuming character and how his loss leaves a profound void in her life. Although options A, C, and D might be tempting, they do not fully address the main point of the passage, which revolves around the writer's deep sense of loss and melancholy after her father's death. The writer never explicitly mentions that her father was cool (option A), nor does she imply that there were always many people in her house (option C). Moreover, the passage specifically mentions that the writer was not afraid of her father (option D), instead stating that she was afraid of everyone else's father, but not her own. In conclusion, the passage leads us to infer that the writer indeed missed her father very much after his death, as his presence, though understated, played a crucial and caring role in her early life."},{"instruction":"Registration 28 February 2007 20:53 Please remove spaces between words.","output":"Youmentionedthatyourregistrationwason28February200720:53andyouwouldliketoremovespacesbetweenwords.

In this context, the statement \\"A man learns through his experiences\\" holds true because experiences play a vital role in shaping one's understanding of their abilities and overall personal growth. When Drew still hedges, it could mean that he is uncertain or apprehensive about trying new things or testing his abilities. The hesitance could be due to various reasons, such as fear of failure, lack of confidence, or simply not knowing what to expect. However, by not trying, Drew may not be able to gain valuable insights that would contribute to his learning and personal development. The statement \\"A man learns through his experiences\\" emphasizes the importance of engaging in activities, facing challenges, and pushing boundaries, as these serve as the medium for learning and growth. The wisdom gained from personal experiences often surpasses that of theoretical knowledge since it encapsulates one's unique journey. Through these experiences, one can refine their skills, identify areas of interest, recognize their weaknesses, and develop resilience. Moreover, experiential learning often leads to increased self-awareness, improved problem-solving skills, and adaptability. As an individual engages in diverse experiences, they discover new aspects of themselves, learn new strategies, and become more adept at navigating through life situations. This results in deep-rooted learning, enabling them to face future challenges with greater confidence and conviction. In conclusion, the statement \\"A man learns through his experiences\\" resonates with the idea presented by the phrase \\"A man can't tell what he can do until he tries.\\" Both promote the understanding that personal growth, learning, and the development of abilities are achieved by engaging in experiences and testing one's limits.

I will start by examining the two sentences provided: Sentence 1: The SSSI has an area of 190.3 ha, while the SAC covers 168.3 hectares. Sentence 2: The SSSI has an area of 190.3 hectares while the SAC covers 168.3 hectares. Step 2: Identify key components and units. In both sentences, the key components consist of the area of SSSI and the area of SAC. Sentence 1 - SSSI area: 190.3 ha, SAC area: 168.3 hectares Sentence 2 - SSSI area: 190.3 hectares, SAC area: 168.3 hectares Step 3: Compare units within both sentences. The units for the area values in both sentences are different for the SSSI area. In Sentence 1, the SSSI area is given in hectares (ha), while in Sentence 2, it is given in hectares. The SAC area is the same in both sentences – hectares. Step 4: Determine if units can be converted or are equivalent. 1 hectare (ha) is equal to 1 hectare. Since the areas for both SSSI and SAC can be represented in hectares (ha), I will convert the SSSI area in Sentence 1 to the same unit as in Sentence 2 to compare them fairly. SSSI area in Sentence 1: 190.3 ha = 190.3 hectares Step 5: Compare the information provided in both sentences after unit conversion. Now that both sentences have the same units for the area values of SSSI and SAC, let's see if the information conveyed is the same: Sentence 1: The SSSI has an area of 190.3 hectares, while the SAC covers 168.3 hectares. Sentence 2: The SSSI has an area of 190.3 hectares while the SAC covers 168.3 hectares.

Answer:","output":"Plants exhibit various sensitivities and responses to different factors in their environment. In the given answer choices, multiple factors affect plants in unique ways. However, considering that plants detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness and are sensitive to light, the best answer is likely a combination of factors that are directly or indirectly related to light. These factors include: 1. Sun's heat: Plants have evolved to detect and respond to light which they use for photosynthesis. The sun's heat is directly related to the sunlight they receive, and plants can be sensitive to extreme heat. High temperature can cause stress to plants, affect their growth and development, and can potentially lead to wilting, reduced photosynthesis, and even death in severe cases. 2. Gravity: While gravity itself may not be directly associated with the daily cycle of light and darkness, it is an important factor that plants are sensitive to. Through a process called gravitropism, plants are able to sense the direction of gravity and align their growth accordingly. For example, roots grow downwards, in the direction of gravitational forces, to anchor plants and absorb nutrients and water from the soil. The shoots, on the other hand, grow upwards, opposite to the gravitational force, to optimize exposure to light for photosynthesis. 3. Competition: Plants compete with neighboring plants and organisms for resources, including nutrients, water, and sunlight. This competition affects plant growth patterns in a way that helps maximize light exposure. For instance, a plant's leaves may grow in a way that ensures minimal shading of the surrounding leaves, while trees in a densely populated forest may grow taller to ensure their canopy gets adequate sunlight. 4. Darkness: As mentioned earlier, plants are sensitive to the daily cycle of light and darkness. Light is essential for photosynthesis - during daylight hours, plants absorb light and synthesize food, whereas at night, they undergo respiration and release stored energy. This cycle of light and darkness, known as the circadian rhythm, can affect numerous aspects of plant metabolism, growth, and development. 5. Temperature: Plants are very sensitive to temperature fluctuations, as it can have a significant impact on their growth and development. Photosynthesis, flowering, and many other processes in a plant's life cycle are regulated by the temperature of their environment. Plants contain temperature sensors that help them adjust to varying conditions; for instance, by altering their metabolism rates or producing new proteins to overcome freezing or overheating. Although not all of these factors are directly tied to a plant's sensitivity to light, they each play an essential role in the overall health, growth, and development of plants. Consequently, the best answer to the question, \\"What are plants sensitive to?\\" would be a combination of the sun's heat, gravity, competition, darkness, and temperature, as these factors are closely related to a plant's sensitivity to light and the daily cycle of light and darkness."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A Mountain of Green Beans Another envelope in the mail.

When I was a little kid I hated green beans. But my mom said I couldn't leave the table until I ate ten green beans. All alone at the table, I stared at the green beans for what seemed like hours. It was a mountain of green beans. I couldn't do it. My grandma came to me and asked if I could eat one green bean. \\"But Grandma, I have to eat ten!\\" She said all I had to do was to eat one green bean. One tiny little green bean. So I ate one. It was bad, but not as bad as I'd thought it would be. Then she asked me again if I could eat one. So I ate one green bean nine more times. My grandma doesn't know about the envelopes, but she tells me anyone can do one thing every day. Back in my room, I lay down on the bed.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms.

VW-owned MAN avoided a fine as it blew the whistle on the cartel. Daimler said it regretted these occurrences and took appropriate action some time ago. \\"The company has strengthened its internal controls and has intensified its regular and comprehensive employee training with regard to antitrust law and competition law,\\" it said in a statement. It is the highest penalty the EU has ever imposed on a cartel, and more than double the previous record. \\"These truck makers colluded for 14 years on truck pricing and on passing on the costs of compliance with stricter emission rules,\\" the EU statement said. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, said the fines were a clear \\"message to companies that cartels are not accepted.\\" The truck manufacturers were responsible for nine out of 10 of the medium and heavy trucks produced in Europe, she added. But the EU said the collusion was not aimed at avoiding or manipulating compliance with the new emission standards, nor did its investigation find any evidence of the use of emissions cheating software. The investigation found that between 1997 and 2004, meetings were held at senior manager level, sometimes at the margins of trade fairs or other events, to discuss their plans. This was complemented by phone conversations. From 2004 onwards, the cartel was organised via the truck producers' German subsidiaries, with participants generally exchanging information by email. Daimler received the biggest fine at €1.01bn. Sweden's Volvo was fined €670.4m and Iveco, part of Italian truck and tractor maker CNH Industrial, was fined €494.6m. DAF Trucks, owned by the US group Paccar, received a €752.7m fine. The four companies admitted wrongdoing in return for a 10% cut in their sanctions.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose disease affects blood flow around the body happens, how will it affect Less oxygen is absorbed by small blood vessels. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a disease affecting blood flow around the body can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen absorption by small blood vessels, and consequently, on the entire process of respiration. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced blood flow: If blood flow is reduced due to the disease, less blood will reach the alveoli. This means there will be fewer red blood cells available to carry oxygen, causing less oxygen to be absorbed by the small blood vessels. 2. Altered blood vessel function: If the disease affects the structure or function of the small blood vessels surrounding the alveoli, it may hinder the process of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange between the alveoli and the blood vessels. This can lead to decreased oxygen absorption and impaired removal of carbon dioxide from the blood. Indirect Effects: 1. Weakened immune system: The disease affecting blood flow may weaken the immune system, increasing the risk of infections in the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. These infections can further impair the lung function, and thereby reduce the efficiency of oxygen absorption by small blood vessels. 2. Poor tissue oxygenation: As the amount of oxygen absorbed by the small blood vessels decreases, tissues throughout the body may experience oxygen deficiency (hypoxia). This can lead to poor organ function, fatigue, and impaired healing processes. 3. Increased workload on the heart: The heart may need to pump harder to ensure adequate blood flow and delivery of oxygen to the body, leading to increased workload and potential heart-related issues. 4. Compensatory mechanisms: The body may attempt to compensate for the reduced blood flow and oxygen transport by increasing the respiratory rate, which could strain the respiratory system further and exacerbate the symptoms. Overall, a disease that affects blood flow around the body can indeed have a significant impact on the process of oxygen absorption by small blood vessels, as well as the general functioning of the respiratory and circulatory systems."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Upstate New York is the portion of the American state of New York lying north of New York City.

Upstate New York includes the major cities of Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, and Syracuse. - Raquette Lake is the source of the Raquette River in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. It is near the community of Raquette Lake, New York. The lake has 99 miles (160 km) of shoreline with pines and mountains bordering the lake. It is located in the towns of Long Lake and Arietta, both in Hamilton County. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean.

The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - An inholding is privately owned land inside the boundary of a national park, national forest, state park, or similar publicly owned, protected area. In-holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property. In the United States, the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States. When the park system was formed, many of these now-called \\"in-holdings\\" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed. Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the United States Congress to acquire private residences especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other federal lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas. - The Adirondack Park is a part of New York's Forest Preserve in Upstate New York, United States. The park's boundary corresponds to the Adirondack Mountains. Unlike most preserves, about 52 per cent of the land is privately owned inholdings heavily regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency. This area contains 102 towns and villages, as well as numerous farms, businesses, and an active timber harvesting industry. The year-round population is 132,000, with 200,000 seasonal residents. The inclusion of human communities makes the park one of the great experiments in conservation in the industrialized world. - The lake's popularity derives from its remoteness, climate and beauty, as well as its notoriety as the location of the murder of Grace Brown in 1906. Alleged ghost sightings and subsequent media attention have added to the allure. - The Adirondack Mountains form a massif in the northeast of Upstate New York in the United States. Its boundaries correspond to the boundaries of Adirondack Park. The mountains form a roughly circular dome, about in diameter and about high.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - A wilderness area is a region where the land is in a natural state; where impacts from human activities are minimalthat is, as a wilderness.

By 1930, Szigeti was established as a major international concert violinist. He performed extensively in Europe, the United States and Asia, and made the acquaintance of many of the era's leading instrumentalists, conductors and composers. In 1939, to escape the war and Nazi persecution of the Jews, Szigeti emigrated with his wife to the United States, where they settled in California. (A year later, Bartók also fled to America, and just two days after his arrival, he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.)During the 1930s, 1940s and into the 1950s, Szigeti recorded extensively, leaving a significant legacy. Notable recordings include the above-mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital; the studio recording of Bartók's Contrasts with Benny Goodman on clarinet and the composer at the piano; the violin concertos of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev (No. 1) and Bloch under the batons of such conductors as Bruno Walter, Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham; and various works by J.S. Bach, Busoni, Corelli, Handel and Mozart. One of his last recordings was of the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin by Bach; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time, the recording is prized for Szigeti's insight and depth of interpretation.In 1950, Szigeti was detained at Ellis Island upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for several days, officially \\"temporarily excluded\\" from the country. The reasons for his detention remain unclear. The following year, he became a naturalized American citizen.

Step 2: Recall that MVP stands for \\"Most Valuable Player,\\" indicating the standout performer in a game or sports event. Step 3: Compare the two terms, recognizing that both \\"Man of the Match\\" and \\"Most Valuable Player\\" highlight the best-performing athlete in a game or event. In conclusion, the American sporting equivalent of \\"Man of the Match\\" is \\"Most Valuable Player\\" or MVP, as both terms are used to honor the top player in a game or sports event."},{"instruction":"Same meaning? The gate is approximately high , with the still visible grooves in the granite stones for the hinges that are used when opening and closing the access . The gate is still visible with the approximately high grooves in the granite stones for the hinges that are used when opening and closing the access .","output":"While the two sentences convey similar information, the order of details presented and the emphasis on certain elements in each sentence differ, thus altering the meaning slightly. Let's analyze both sentences to understand these variations: 1. \\"The gate is approximately high, with the still visible grooves in the granite stones for the hinges that are used when opening and closing the access.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the gate itself, specifically its height. The fact that the gate is approximately high (though exact height is not mentioned, which should ideally have been provided for better clarity) is the primary detail. Afterwards, the grooves in the granite stones that are still visible are mentioned, elaborating on their function: housing the hinges used when opening and closing the access. The significance of the grooves is positioned as a secondary element. 2. \\"The gate is still visible with the approximately high grooves in the granite stones for the hinges that are used when opening and closing the access.\\" In contrast, this sentence initially emphasizes the visibility of the gate, suggesting that it can still be seen despite its age or surrounding environment. It then proceeds to describe the grooves, placing them as the prominent feature offering a clue about the gate's height. This suggests that the height of the grooves could be akin to the approximate height of the gate. Consequently, the gate's height appears as a secondary element in relation to the grooves in the granite stones. In summary, while both sentences express similar notions, sentence 1 accentuates the height of the gate and subsequently highlights the grooves' purpose. On the other hand, sentence 2 initially underscores the gate's visibility and puts more focus on the grooves, inferring the approximate height from them."},{"instruction":"Sentence: Bread is an ingredient of a bacon sandwich.

Michael Ren Wysolovski, 31, was taken into custody in Georgia and is facing a number of state charges, the FBI said. Wysolovski faced a judge on Monday and was denied bond after he was arrested and charged for allegedly holding Burns captive in his Duluth home, our sister station WSB-TV in Atlanta reported. He has been charged with aggravated sodomy, cruelty to children deprivation in the 1st degree, interference with custody and false imprisonment, according to WSB-TV. “It was a dream come true,” said Hailey's mother, Shaunna Burns. Channel 9 reporter DaShawn Brown spoke to Hailey's parents over the phone as they drove to Charlotte from the Atlanta area with their daughter. Past coverage: Burns, a student at Myers Park High School, had been held captive at Wysolovski’s home. Her parents said Hailey met the man online.

Shaunna Burns said that while in Georgia, Hailey met a woman online from Romania. The two started to chat when Hailey told the woman she was missing. After researching the case, that woman contacted Hailey's parents Friday night. “We got the first message at 8:09 (p.m.) and then by 12:32 (a.m.), they had her,” Shaunna Burns said. (Video from outside the home of where Hailey Burns was found in Georgia, from WSB-TV) Hailey’s parents said a tipster reached out to Hailey to find out where she was. Hailey didn’t know, so she took a photo from the house window, and within hours she was rescued. Former FBI assistant director Chris Swecker said the response in the case was remarkable given that Burns didn't know where she was at. \\"The victim took a picture outside and all they had to go on was the neighborhood, and what it looked like from inside the house,” Swecker said. “They did enough research and gumshoe work to figure out where that young woman was being held.

A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Here's a step-by-step guide to solving the equation: 1. First, we have the equation: 18*m = 22*m - 16 2. To isolate m, we need to eliminate one of the m terms. We can do this by subtracting the smaller m term (18*m) from both sides of the equation. This will give us: 18*m - 18*m = 22*m - 16 - 18*m 3. This simplifies to: 0 = 4*m - 16 4. Now, we want to isolate the 4*m term. To do this, we can add 16 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 16 = 4*m - 16 + 16 5. This simplifies to: 16 = 4*m 6. Finally, we want to isolate m completely. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4: 16 / 4 = 4*m / 4 7.

There are more than one billion people in the world who live without safe drinking water. The United Nations hopes to cut this number in half by 2015. Solving such a big problem seems like an unreal challenge. But everyone, even teenagers, can do something to help. A teenage girl in the U.S. has set an example to others of her age around the world. Rene Haggerty, 13, was awarded the 2004 Gloria Barron Prize for her work of collecting deserted batteries which pollute water. In 2003, Haggerty went on a field trip to the Great Lakes Science Centre in Ohio. There, she saw an exhibit about how chemicals in old batteries harm the water of Lake Erie. Haggerty learnt that recycling the batteries was an easy solution. \\"I think everybody can do it, because everyone uses batteries, and it can make a big difference.\\" With these words, she began to increase awareness in her area. She talked to her county government and school board. She got permission to start a recycling programmed in schools as well as the public libraries, hospitals, and churches. With the help from her family, friends and local waste-management officials, she gathered containers, arranged transportation, and made an educational video.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To answer this question, let's evaluate the given statements and determine their logical connections, if any. Premise: \\"well that's good though\\" This statement is quite vague and informal, as it refers to something being \\"good\\" without specifying the context or object being deemed as positive. However, this statement implies that whatever situation, outcome, or subject it is referring to is positive or beneficial. Hypothesis: \\"However, that is not bad.\\" This statement is a speculative assertion, proposing that a situation, outcome, or subject is not bad, meaning it is either neutral or positive. The use of \\"however\\" suggests that this hypothesis is contrasting or contradicting another statement, opinion, or belief. Now let's consider whether the truth of the premise can guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. In the given context, the premise and hypothesis are not particularly detailed or specific, making it difficult to establish an indisputable logical connection. However, we can still attempt to draw a bridge between the two. If the premise – that something is \\"good\\" – is true, then the subject being referred to is considered positive. Since the hypothesis asserts that the subject is \\"not bad,\\" which covers the neutral and positive spectrum of outcomes, the truth of the premise coincides with the truth of the hypothesis. In other words, if something is deemed \\"good\\" (a positive outcome), it is also automatically \\"not bad,\\" as it exists on the positive side of the spectrum. It is important to note that this conclusion comes with the caveat that both statements lack specificity and detail, which may limit its applicability in certain scenarios. However, based on the given information, we can infer that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also likely to be true. In conclusion, while the vague nature of both statements makes it difficult to establish a definitive logical connection, we can infer that if the premise (something is good) is true, then the hypothesis (it is not bad) is also likely true, as they both align on the positive or neutral spectrum of outcomes."},{"instruction":"Article:Tigers, having trailed at the break, edged a see-sawing game with the only points of the second half coming from Webster's burst and Luke Gale's goal. Andy Lynch and Webster had given the Tigers a 12-0 lead inside 13 minutes. Joel Moon, Kallum Watkins and Tom Briscoe all crossed in reply, but Liam Sutcliffe's two missed goals were key. Castleford won both their Super 8s encounters with the Rhinos last season, and enjoyed a third successive derby win here as their opponents fell to their fifth defeat in seven league games in 2016. The two sides are yet to hit their 2015 form - before kick-off, Castleford had lost three league games this year - and both sides were without key personnel, missing influential halves. It was testament to both sides that the missing players failed to dampen the quality or intensity of play. Daryl Powell's hosts looked to have mastered the arm wrestle with the two early tries, but Leeds showed champion spirit to fight back and lead by two at the half-time hooter. Both defences were on their mettle in the second half, with last-ditch efforts keeping the scores level, while video referee decisions looked to have denied Castleford when they crossed the stripe. However, Castleford's continued pressure was eventually enough to breach the Leeds line, with the powerful Webster crashing though to seal the two points, and continue Leeds' topsy-turvy start to the campaign. Castleford head coach Daryl Powell: \\"That was more like it. That was the commitment and effort and character and spirit we've shown over the last couple of years. \\"We didn't get everything right tonight but we worked hard.

Suky Guerrero, an aunt of the victim, said Tuesday that family members were trying to get the money together to secure the release of Ayvani Hope Perez. Guerrero said she did not know where the family would get the money but she understood they were still waiting for it to be delivered late Tuesday. A Levi's Call alert was posted for Perez, who authorities said was abducted from her family's Ellenwood home Tuesday about 2 a.m. Police released sketches of the two armed men they believe took her during the home invasion on Brookgate Drive. Police said the mother tried to hide her two children, but the suspects found the family, along with the family's dog, and demanded money and jewelry. Clayton County police spent the day searching for Ayvani, and the GBI and the FBI are now assisting in the investigation. \\"We've been receiving numerous tips on various hotlines,\\" said Lt.

When the United States does not back down, Soviet armored divisions are sent to the border between West and East Germany.During the late hours of Friday, September 15, news broadcasts report a \\"widespread rebellion among several divisions of the East German Army\\". As a result, the Soviets blockade West Berlin. Tensions mount and the United States issues an ultimatum that the Soviets stand down from the blockade by 6:00 A.M. the next day, or it will be interpreted as an act of war. The Soviets refuse, and the President of the United States puts all U.S. military around the world at DEFCON 2.On Saturday, September 16, NATO forces in West Germany invade East Germany through the Helmstedt checkpoint to Free Berlin.

She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if we can avoid it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions. For once let's twist and turn one for a good cause, yes?

A \\"fatberg\\" is what is created when congealed fat and unflushable items (think sanitary napkins, diapers, wipes, the Independent notes) combine in the sewer to create, well, the stuff of nightmares, and a 1940s-era sewer in London has been broken by an 131-foot-long one weighing roughly 11 tons.

Much of the fat comes from used cooking oil, millions of liters of which are poured down drains in London each year. And the wet wipes (which some people are apparently using instead of toilet paper) come from the one in five Londoners who admit to flushing them. \\"I’d urge people to consider what lurks beneath their feet,\\" says the supervisor. \\"When it comes to getting rid of fat, 'bin it—don’t block it.'\\" The whole messy business, including repairs to the sewer, is expected to cost more than 600,000 and take more than two months, with work finishing in May. And yes, the Washington Post notes, the same phenomenon happens here in the USA—New York City spends millions dealing with grease backups—though we don't often use the term \\"fatberg.\\" (This fatberg isn't the biggest in British history, though.)","output":"Once upon a time in London, there was a really big and smelly problem in the sewers. This problem was called a \\"fatberg.\\" A fatberg is a yucky mix of fats, oils, and things that should not be flushed down the toilet like diapers, baby wipes, and napkins. These things combine and create a massive, yucky mess underground, and sometimes they can even break a sewer. In this story, a very old sewer from the 1940s got broken by a fatberg that was bigger and heavier than 18 horses, 3 big cars called Hummer H2s, or 77,000 iPhone 6s. It was 131 feet long and weighed about 11 tons! People who had stores and businesses in a fancy part of London called Chelsea started to smell something really bad. So, they called some workers who take care of water and sewers. When the workers looked, they found the huge fatberg. They couldn't believe how big it was! They told people to think about what's underneath their feet when they pour fats, like from cooking, down their drains or flush things that shouldn't be flushed. To fix this big, stinky problem, they had to spend a lot of money (more than 600,000) and work for two whole months. This wasn't the first time this problem happened in London, and it happens in other places too, like the USA. To avoid these icky fatbergs, we should remember to throw away fats and other yucky things in the trash bin and not put them down the sink or toilet.

The question and answer pair are described below.","output":"Question: What could be the reasons behind the emergence of fascist trends at the boy's school? Answer: The emergence of fascist trends at the school could be attributed to various factors. Here are some possible reasons: 1. Influence of social media: The rise of social media platforms has made the spread of extremist views and ideologies easier. Some students might be exposed to fascist content, which could influence their beliefs and behaviors at school. 2. Family dynamics: Home environments can play a significant role in shaping an individual's beliefs and values. If the boy's peers come from households that promote or tolerate fascist views, they may bring those ideologies into the school. 3. Disenchantment with the establishment: Some students might feel disconnected from mainstream culture or dissatisfied with the current social and political system. This sense of disenchantment could lead them to explore alternative ideologies, including fascism. 4. Lack of education: A lack of proper education about history, politics, and social issues might contribute to the rise of extremist views. Without a balanced understanding of different perspectives, students might be more likely to embrace radical ideologies like fascism. 5. Group pressures and identity: Adolescents often seek a sense of belonging and camaraderie. Some students might join like-minded groups that embrace fascist ideologies as a way to find acceptance and a sense of identity. Peer pressure can be very influential during adolescence, and the boy could be noticing the effects of groupthink and conformity within his school environment. 6. Insecurity and power dynamics: Fascist trends can sometimes arise from a sense of insecurity or powerlessness among individuals. Students may feel threatened by different social or cultural changes and adopt extremist views as a means of re-establishing control or authority. 7. Media influence: Movies, television shows, and other forms of media can also promote extremist views and behavior. Students might be exposed to fascist characters or themes that glorify certain aspects of the ideology, leading them to adopt such beliefs in real life. It is crucial to identify and address these factors to create a more inclusive and tolerant school environment. Educators and parents should be vigilant in monitoring signs of extremist beliefs among students and engage in open discussions that promote critical thinking and empathy."},{"instruction":"Paragraph: Is this an insect or an animal?

Hypothesis: Although Linear B has been deciphered, Linear A is still a mystery. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise provides information about the presence of Linear B type in the exhibited examples, and also mentions the fact that it has been deciphered. The premise also states the Mycenaean origin of Linear B and indicates that the Minoans no longer had control over the major cities during the time when the tablet was written. The hypothesis, on the other hand, proposes that despite Linear B being deciphered, Linear A remains undeciphered. Within the context of the premise, it is implied that the knowledge about Linear B doesn't necessarily extend to Linear A. By stating that Linear B has been deciphered and mentioning its historical context, the premise indirectly reinforces the notion that there are other related scripts, such as Linear A, that may still be a mystery. Linear A and Linear B are both ancient writing systems used in the Aegean region, but they served different purposes, and their origins are distinct. Linear A was discovered earlier than Linear B and is known to have been used by the Minoans, primarily for religious and administrative purposes. Despite numerous efforts and studies, researchers have not yet been able to decipher Linear A conclusively. Linear B, on the other hand, was undoubtedly used by the Mycenaeans, who succeeded the Minoans in the dominance over the Aegean world. The decipherment of Linear B by Michael Ventris in 1952 led to a greater understanding of the Mycenaean civilization and its connection to the Minoan civilization. The fact that the two scripts have different origins and remain distinct in their structure and usage adds weight to the hypothesis that the decipherment of Linear B doesn't necessarily entail the decipherment of Linear A. In conclusion, the hypothesis stating that Linear A remains a mystery even though Linear B has been deciphered is entailed by the premise. The premise highlights the information about Linear B, its decipherment, and its historical context, implying that the knowledge we have about Linear B does not reveal the secrets of Linear A. Additionally, the differences between the two scripts emphasize that deciphering one does not automatically lead to an understanding of the other."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"A Yank at Oxford,\\" Lee Sheridan enjoyed much adoration from the townspeople and his father. Lee was a track athlete at a small town college and had developed a bit of an arrogant streak due to the attention and praise he received. His professor decided to send him to the Cardinal College of Oxford to broaden his horizons and introduce him to a world beyond his local track records. Upon arriving at Oxford, Lee's arrogance made him almost instantly unpopular, having managed to offend three students - Paul Beaumont, Wavertree, and Ramsey - before even arriving at Oxford. This led to the trio of students playing an elaborate prank on Lee, ultimately resulting in Lee's kicking the Dean's bums. Despite wanting to leave, Lee was talked into staying by his good-natured scout, Scatters. The rivalry between Lee and Paul Beaumont intensified after Lee joined the track team and outshined Paul. This eventually led to Lee's unsportsmanlike conduct in a competition against Cambridge, which resulted in the students of Cardinal College, led by Paul, ganging up on him and publicly humiliating him. Lee and Paul's conflict reached a boiling point when they encountered each other in a pub where Paul was secretly meeting Elsa, the wife of a local bookstore owner. Following a fight and a misunderstanding where Wavertree believed Paul punched a buller (campus police), Paul's stature began to decline due to the consequences it had on his academic standing and his affair with Elsa being revealed. Meanwhile, Lee gained popularity, becoming the star rower of the boat club and making new friends in the process. He even began dating Paul's sister, Molly. However, Lee began to feel uneasy about his ongoing feud with Paul, even going so far as to try to help Paul hide Elsa in his room when she came to meet Paul in his dorm room. This ultimately led to Lee being caught and expelled from the college. Lee's expulsion, however, was celebrated by the students who found being kicked out for a lady-related incident impressive. They organized a small parade to send Lee off. Meanwhile, Lee's father, Dan, came to Oxford, unaware that his son was on his way home after being expelled. In conclusion, Lee Sheridan is the character who enjoyed much adoration from the townspeople and his father in the movie \\"A Yank at Oxford\\". The film explores Lee's journey from being overconfident and arrogant to experiencing new challenges at Oxford, as well as the development of his rivalry with Paul Beaumont. As you consider investing in this film proposal, take into account the story's underlying themes of personal growth, rivalry, and the importance of learning from mistakes."},{"instruction":"Select from: - negative. - positive.

Some random reasoning:","output":"To find the length of the train, we need to determine the distance the train travels while crossing the pole. Step 1: Convert the speed of the train to meters per second. 1 km = 1000 meters, 1 hour = 3600 seconds, So, 60 km/hr = (60 * 1000) / 3600 = 16.67 m/s (approximately). Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by the train in 9 seconds. Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 16.67 m/s * 9 s = 150 meters. Step 3: Compare the calculated distance with the given options.

Translate this to English?","output":"As many new vaccines that become available will have a significant impact on the health of children and young people, public awareness, education, and advertising are necessary to inform not only parents, but also children and young people of these potential benefits. The development and availability of new vaccines play a crucial role in improving the health and well-being of children, adolescents, and the wider community. By protecting against a range of diseases and conditions, vaccines contribute to reducing mortality rates, improving quality of life, and promoting long-term health. To ensure that parents, children, and young people are aware of these benefits and make informed decisions regarding vaccination, public awareness campaigns, education programs, and advertising efforts are essential. These initiatives should focus on delivering accurate, comprehensive, and evidence-based information about the vaccines and their associated advantages. Public awareness campaigns can include various activities designed to raise knowledge and awareness about the importance of vaccinations among the general population. These can involve community events, social media campaigns, and partnerships with healthcare providers, schools, and other stakeholders. Education programs can involve incorporating vaccine and immunization-related information into school curriculums and providing regular training and updates to healthcare professionals. Providing age-appropriate information to children and adolescents through school-based programs is particularly valuable, as it allows them to develop a better understanding of vaccination and encourages active participation in making decisions about their health. Advertising efforts can use various channels and platforms, including traditional media (e.g., television, radio, and print advertisements) and digital media (e.g., targeted online ads, sponsored social media content) to reach diverse audiences, convey key messages, and promote vaccinations. In addition to these initiatives, it is also crucial to address and mitigate any potential barriers to vaccination, such as misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, or concerns regarding vaccine safety and efficacy. To this end, public health authorities and healthcare providers should work together to build trust and communicate transparently with the public. In conclusion, as new vaccines become available with the potential to significantly improve the health of children and young people, it is essential to focus on raising public awareness, enhancing education, and promoting vaccinations through advertising. By doing so, we can help ensure that the benefits of these vaccines are widely understood and appreciated, leading to improved health outcomes for children, adolescents, and the broader community."},{"instruction":"OPT: A. negative; B. positive; Short movie review: it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The critic is thinking negatively about the movie.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose you Sit and guard your eggs more like a hawk. happens, how will it affect MORE birds. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed suggests that if a bird sits and guards its eggs more like a hawk, it could potentially have an effect on the process of producing more birds. This perturbation could have both direct and indirect effects on the various stages of the bird life cycle process. Direct effects: 1. Enhanced egg protection: By sitting and guarding the eggs more attentively, a bird can potentially reduce predation on its eggs, thereby increasing the chances of the eggs successfully hatching into baby birds. This can lead to a higher number of baby birds surviving and eventually growing into adult birds. 2. Increased parental care: A bird that spends more time guarding its eggs, like a hawk, may also be more involved in providing care to the hatchlings. This increased level of parental care can result in a higher survival rate for the hatchlings as they grow and develop. Indirect effects: 3. Mate and nest selection: A bird that exhibits more hawk-like behavior regarding egg protection may be more appealing as a mate. A higher level of dedication to protecting the eggs could signal to other potential mates that this bird is a better partner in raising the offspring, thus increasing the chances of successful reproduction. 4. Impact on competition for resources: By having more surviving baby birds, there is increased competition for limited resources such as food, shelter, and territory. This can push the bird population in the area to adapt and develop more efficient strategies for survival, ultimately leading to a healthier overall population. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis you've suggested, in which a bird sits and guards its eggs like a hawk, could have both direct and indirect effects on the bird life cycle process. The proposed perturbation could lead to enhanced egg protection, improved parental care, more strategic mate and nest selection, and changes in the competition for resources. All these factors can contribute to an increase in the number of birds in the population."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog with this premise \\"Ally's advice to a writers block is a 10-minute meditation.\\".","output":"Step 1: Introduce the characters For this dialogue, we need two characters.

Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Explanation: Each action has a specific command that represents it in the limited natural language form. Part #2: The use of 'left' and 'right' to denote direction of an action. Usage: 'I_TURN_LEFT' -> 'turn left', 'I_TURN_RIGHT' -> 'turn right' Explanation: In the given command format, when the action is associated with a directional change, we use 'left' or 'right' as a part of the command. Part #3: The use of 'opposite' to make the agent turn backward in the specified direction. Usage: \\"turn left opposite\\" (the agent turns backward to the left) Explanation: This criterion specifies that if the command wants the agent to make a backward turn, the word 'opposite' should be included after the direction. Part #4: The use of 'around' to make the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. Usage: \\"run around left\\" (the agent runs while turning around to the left) Explanation: The word 'around' is used to indicate that an action is executed while the agent is turning around in a specific direction. Part #5: The use of 'and' to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope. Usage: \\"run and jump\\" (the agent runs and then jumps) Explanation: The word 'and' is used to connect two actions in sequence, allowing the execution of one action after another. Part #6: The use of 'after' to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope. Usage: \\"run after jump\\" (the agent jumps and then runs) Explanation: The word 'after' is used to signify that the next action should be executed first, followed by the previous action.

Two-thirds of Americans say they aren’t spending as much as they could each month, according to the poll released Tuesday by Bankrate.com. And they may keep spending down even as they enter the holiday season, says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. “People just don’t have a lot of extra money to throw around,” he says. The most common reason people gave for keeping their wallets closed: They’re waiting for a raise. Thirty-two percent of people polled said stagnant income was their biggest concern. The next most common reason given, cited by 29 percent, is that people are trying to save more. And 16 percent said they were worried about their economy. (Bankrate.com surveyed about 1,000 people over the phone from Oct. 2 to Oct. 5.) Worries increased with age. People ages 30 to 49 — a time when people are coping with tuition payments, car payments and child-care costs — were the most likely to say they are limiting their monthly spending. And seniors were three times as likely as those 18 to 29 to say stagnant income was the main reason for cutting back. Retirees and people approaching retirement are especially strained because they are dealing with record low interest rates on bonds, which are often a primary source of income in old age, McBride says. Older consumers were also more likely to be worried about the economy than any other group. It makes sense that pay would be the No. 1 concern. As I’ve previously reported, most workers have seen hourly wages stay flat – or fall– since the recession. For college graduates, wages fell by 2.5 percent between 2007 and 2014, according to the Economic Policy Institute. For high school graduates, they fell by nearly 5 percent. One bright note: Young people are saving more. Millennials were most likely to cite the need to save as their main reason for cutting down spending. Younger consumers, who are also less likely to own a credit card, and may be overwhelmed by student loans, recognize the importance of having emergency savings. “Many of them are building a solid financial foundation,” McBride says.

The SS Meredith Victory was noted for evacuating 14,000 refugees, the largest rescue operation by a single ship, even though it was designed to hold 12 passengers. Before escaping, the UN Command forces razed most of Hungnam city, especially the port facilities; and on 16 December 1950, President Truman declared a national emergency with Presidential Proclamation No. 2914, 3 C.F.R. 99 (1953), which remained in force until 14 September 1978.[b] The next day (17 December 1950) Kim Il-sung was deprived of the right of command of KPA by China.

Thompson is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games. During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. This included rap music, broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern, the content of computer and video games and their alleged effects on children. Thompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as \\"murder simulators\\" to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres. According to Thompson, \\"In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers.\\" Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, \\"If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.\\" Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as \\"Pearl Harbor 2\\". According to Thompson, \\"Many parents think that stores won't sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked.\\" Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by freedom of expression, saying, \\"Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They're not even speech. They're dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it,\\" as well as simply calling video games \\"mental masturbation\\". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking \\"for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end\\". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller \\"gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory.\\" Although his efforts dealing with video games have generally focused on juveniles, Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the \\"functional equivalent of a 15-year-old,\\" and \\"the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense\\". Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did Thompson do any writing about video games?","output":"The provided article does not specifically mention Thompson writing about video games.

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Question: What can fire do to a sapwood? Context: It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Baran Movie plot: It is winter in Teheran. Lateef is 17. He works at a building construction site managed by MEMAR, the site foreman. Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers. Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her. He goes to the village where the Afghans live, walks around, meets an enigmatic cobbler, and ends up in the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard... My question: How does Najaf break his leg?

This classification is made on the basis that the text is describing a type of vehicle, specifically a car model called 'Toyota Publica' manufactured by the company 'Toyota'. The description tells about the period of manufacture, its concept and its place in the line of Toyota's small cars. It falls under the category 'mean of transportation' as it is a vehicle which was used to move people from one place to another, essentially serving as a mode of transportation. The category 'mean of transportation' covers all different types of vehicles, machines or systems that are used to move people or goods, which in this case is a car, a widely utilized form of transportation around the globe. Other categories provided for classification such as company, animal, building, etc., do not fit the text as it is not describing a corporation, some living entity or a structure but a model of a car. The references made to the automaker 'Toyota' could suggest it may fall under 'company', however, the main subject of the text is the 'Toyota Publica' thus making 'mean of transportation' the most apt categorization."},{"instruction":"If \\"A group of people gathering in front of a clothing store.\\", can we conclude \\"A bunch of people are sitting inside a restaurant.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"A bunch of people are sitting inside a restaurant\\" based on the information provided about \\"A group of people gathering in front of a clothing store.\\" The two scenarios describe different situations involving groups of people, and there is no direct correlation between the two. In the first scenario, a group of people is gathering in front of a clothing store. This could be for various reasons, such as waiting for the store to open, participating in a promotional event, or just socializing. However, this information alone gives no indication that these people will later go to a restaurant or that they are planning to dine together. On the other hand, the second statement describes a separate situation, where a bunch of people is sitting inside a restaurant. While both situations involve gatherings of people, they are not necessarily linked, as they occur in different locations and settings. Therefore, to draw a conclusion that connects these two scenarios, we would require additional information or context that establishes a clear link between the groups of people and their activities. For example, if we knew that the clothing store and the restaurant were hosting a joint event, and that the people gathering in front of the store were planning to attend the event at the restaurant, then it would be more reasonable to conclude that these people may eventually be sitting inside the restaurant.

As a young composer and pianist he was well regarded in Prague musical circles, and had the approval of Liszt, Proksch and others, but the public's lack of acknowledgement was a principal factor behind his self-imposed exile in Sweden. After his return he was not taken particularly seriously, and was hard put to get audiences for his new works, hence his \\"prophet without honour\\" remark after the nearly empty hall and indifferent reception of Richard III and Wallenstein's Camp at Žofín Island in January 1862.Smetana's first noteworthy public success was his initial opera The Brandenburgers in Bohemia, in 1866 when he was already 42 years old. His second opera, The Bartered Bride, survived the unfortunate mistiming of its opening night and became an enduring popular triumph. The different style of his third opera, Dalibor, closer to that of Wagnerian music drama, was not readily understood by the public and was condemned by critics who believed that Czech opera should be based on folk-song. It disappeared from the repertory after only a handful of performances. Thereafter the machinations that accompanied Smetana's tenure as Provisional Theatre conductor restricted his creative output until 1874. In his final decade, the most fruitful of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition. Of his later operas, The Two Widows and The Secret were warmly received, while The Kiss was greeted by an \\"overwhelming ovation\\". The ceremonial opera Libuše was received with thunderous applause for the composer; by this time (1881) the disputes around his music had declined, and the public was ready to honour him as the founder of Czech music. Nevertheless, the first few performances in October 1882 of an evidently under-rehearsed The Devil's Wall were chaotic, and the composer was left feeling \\"dishonoured and dispirited.\\" This disappointment was swiftly mitigated by the acclaim... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who was left feeling dishonoured and dispirited?

Her mother met her father, who was twenty years her senior, at age eighteen, and Carlisle was born nine months later. She was named after her mother's favorite film, Johnny Belinda (1948). Carlisle was the first of seven siblings, with three brothers and three sisters. Carlisle's first venture into music was in 1977 as drummer for the punk rock band the Germs, under the name Dottie Danger. She was recruited into the band by Lorna Doom, whom she had met in an art class while a student at Thousand Oaks High School. However, her time in the band was short due to her contracting mononucleosis, and she never recorded or performed live with the Germs. According to Pat Smear, upon quitting, she introduced her friend, Donna Rhia, who became her replacement. Carlisle does appear on one recording introducing the band at a 1977 performance at the Whisky a Go Go, heard on the live album Germicide (1977). Around this time Carlisle did some back-up singing for Black Randy and the Metrosquad. Soon after leaving the Germs, she co-founded The Go-Go's (originally named the Misfits), with friends and fellow musicians Margot Olavarria, Elissa Bello, and Jane Wiedlin. Olavarria and Bello were soon out of the group and the new line-up included bassist-turned-guitarist Charlotte Caffey, guitarist-turned-bassist Kathy Valentine, and drummer Gina Schock. All five women were largely untrained musicians, and Carlisle recalls having to use tape as fret markers during their initial songwriting: \\"[Charlotte] had to show us how to plug in our amps,\\" she said. The Go-Go's would go on to become one of the most successful American bands of the 1980s, helping usher new wave music into popular American radio, and becoming the first all-female band who wrote their own music and played their own instruments to ever achieve a No. 1 album, Beauty and the Beat, which featured the hits \\"We Got the Beat\\" and \\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\". The Go-Go's recorded two more studio albums on I.R.S. Records, including 1982's Vacation, which went gold. \\"Head over Heels\\", from their 1984 album Talk Show, made it to No. 11. In 1984, Carlisle made a foray into acting in the movie Swing Shift, starring alongside Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Sure, little buddy!

India (ISO: Bhārat), also known as the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947.

Which crop would be less beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B? Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. The answer to this question is:","output":"Crop B would be less beneficial to farmers. This is because crop B is not tolerant of herbicides, which means that applying herbicides to control weeds could also harm the crop itself. In contrast, crop A has been genetically engineered to be herbicide tolerant, allowing it to grow without being harmed by the herbicides used for weed management. The introduction of herbicide-tolerant crops like crop A has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Hi i have a problem with app\\" Answer:","output":"Upon analyzing the provided review, \\"Hi i have a problem with app,\\" I would rate it a 1 on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable.

It would have no planets and no stars. Thats how it looked when it was young. When the universe was young, there was only gas and dust. From this gas and dust, everything we now see was made.

The same force that causes it to fall to the floor. The invisible force of gravity caused dust and gas particles to be pulled together. This force is what formed all the objects in our solar system.

To maintain lactation, a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves. Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \`\`dairy bull'' or a \`\`beef bull.'' Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age. A cow's gestation period is approximately nine months. Newborn calves are removed from their mothers quickly, usually within three days, as the mother/calf bond intensifies over time and delayed separation can cause extreme stress on both cow and calf.","output":"Based on the given text, it appears that a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves to maintain lactation. Here is the step-by-step reasoning: 1. The text states that \\"to maintain lactation, a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves.\\" This sentence directly suggests that a cow needs to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk consistently. 2. Dairy farmers breed or artificially inseminate heifers around 13 months of age, and a cow's gestation period is approximately nine months. This information further supports the idea that pregnancy is necessary to enable milk production in cows. 3. Newborn calves are removed from their mothers quickly, usually within three days. This fact implies that the presence of a calf is related to the cow's ability to produce milk. From the information provided in the text, it is true that a cow cannot give milk without getting pregnant. Pregnancy is necessary for maintaining lactation and enabling milk production in cows."},{"instruction":"Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person Dunbar asked, \\"Don't you know who this is?\\" Lennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit.

This task involves understanding and manipulating various physical objects, such as tools and materials. Here is a detailed breakdown of the process and the necessary knowledge of physical objects: 1. Understanding the dimensions and weight capacity: Before starting the assembly, it is crucial to have a clear idea of the desired dimensions and weight capacity of the bookshelf. This involves understanding concepts like height, width, and depth, as well as considerations such as wall space, floor space, and the number of shelves needed. 2. Selecting materials: The choice of material is essential in determining the appearance, durability, and functionality of the bookshelf. Common materials include wood, metal, and engineered wood products such as particleboard or medium-density fiberboard (MDF). An understanding of these physical objects and their properties is necessary to make an informed selection. 3. Acquiring tools: Building a bookshelf typically requires a variety of hand tools and power tools. These might include a saw, drill, hammer, screwdriver, measuring tape, level, square, clamps, and a pencil for marking. Knowledge of these physical objects, their uses, and safety measures is crucial for a successful assembly process. 4. Preparing the materials: This stage includes cutting and drilling the chosen materials to form the components of the bookshelf. Measuring and marking the parts accurately, as well as performing the actual cuts and drilling holes for screws and other fasteners, requires an understanding of the properties and characteristics of the specific materials being used. 5. Assembling the bookshelf: The assembly process typically starts with attaching the side panels to the top and bottom panels. Then, the back panel is installed, and the shelves are positioned and secured with fasteners. For adjustable shelves, brackets or tracks are used. The process requires knowledge of basic joining and fastening techniques, and familiarity with hardware such as screws, nails, dowels, and brackets. 6. Finishing: If the furniture piece was made from scratch or if the flat-pack kit allows for customization, the bookshelf may need to be finished with paint, varnish, or a protective sealant. Knowledge of the appropriate application techniques and materials is essential to provide an attractive and durable finish. 7. Anchoring and positioning: Finally, if the bookshelf is freestanding, it may need to be anchored to the wall for safety. If attached to the wall, proper installation of brackets or mounting hardware is necessary. For secured placement, it is essential to know the types of wall materials and the appropriate fasteners to use. In conclusion, building a bookshelf from scratch or assembling a flat-pack kit is a task that requires knowledge of various physical objects, including tools, materials, hardware, and finishing products. Furthermore, one must understand the properties and appropriate use of these objects to perform the task successfully and create a functional, aesthetically pleasing, and safe piece of furniture."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task you are given a premise and two alternatives in Chinese.

He has just been awakened by his housekeeper, Urania (Helene Gerasimidou). \\"This is the last day\\" she says, \\"Let me come with you to the hospital.\\" Alexander, very philosophically, refuses and he thanks her for her three years of faithful service. She leaves the room, but promptly returns for an ultimate glance at Alexander, on the pretext of reminding him that his dog has eaten, before furtively leaving again.

The key is to prioritize essential products, versatile items, and travel-friendly packaging to create a compact and lightweight makeup kit that still meets your beauty needs. Follow these steps to pack a small makeup kit for quick trips: 1. Assess your makeup needs: Start by evaluating your makeup routine and determining what products and tools are essential for your trip. Consider factors such as the trip duration, climate, planned activities, and any special events or occasions that may impact your makeup choices. This will help you create a list of necessary items and avoid over-packing. 2. Choose multi-purpose products: Opt for products that can serve multiple purposes to save space in your makeup kit. For example, a tinted moisturizer with SPF can work as a foundation, moisturizer, and sunscreen; a lip and cheek tint can be used for both blush and lip color; a brown matte eyeshadow can double as an eyebrow filler and contour powder. 3. Select travel-sized or compact products: Whenever possible, use smaller-sized, lightweight, and compact products to save space in your makeup kit. Many cosmetic brands offer travel-sized versions of their popular products, or you can transfer your favorite products into reusable travel containers. Additionally, look for slender or flat packaging that easily fits into a small makeup bag. 4. Use multi-functional brushes and tools: Instead of packing multiple brushes and applicators, choose a few versatile tools that can be used for multiple purposes. For example, a dual-ended brush with a fluffy blending brush on one end and a smaller, angled brush on the other can be used for applying eyeshadow, blending, and filling in eyebrows. You can also use your fingers for blending certain products, like cream blush or eyeshadow, to save even more space. 5. Organize your makeup kit: Use a small, flexible makeup bag or cosmetics organizer to hold your products and tools. Organize items by type or area of application (e.g., face, eyes, lips) to make them easy to locate. Opt for bags with zippered compartments or pockets to keep items securely stored and avoid spills or breakage. 6. Pack makeup removers or cleansing wipes: Don't forget to include a travel-sized makeup remover or a small pack of makeup cleansing wipes to easily remove your makeup at the end of the day. These items are essential for maintaining your skincare routine while on-the-go. 7. Consider color palettes: To make your makeup kit even more compact, choose a minimal color palette that can be easily mixed and matched for various looks. Stick to neutrals or choose a few complementary colors that can be used for a variety of day-to-night makeup looks. 8. Prioritize products according to your personal style: Tailor your makeup kit to your style and preferences. If you favor a bold lip, be sure to include a few of your favorite lipsticks. If you're more focused on complexion and minimal eye makeup, prioritize base products and skin-perfecting items. 9. Verify TSA regulations: If you're flying, make sure your makeup products comply with TSA liquid regulations and pack any liquids or creams in a separate, clear zip-top bag. By following these steps and prioritizing essential, multi-purpose, and travel-friendly products, you can create a compact and functional makeup kit that caters to your specific makeup needs for quick trips."},{"instruction":"Awe it rained last night so all of our beautiful chalk art is gone. *C-money Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","output":"Oh, I understand.

Guy reminds her he \\"dragged her out of the gutter to make her a star\\". He's furious that she left him, outraged over her \\"silly Reno divorce\\" and indignant that she is playing around with young men, in particular a struggling writer staying near them at their retreat on the English coast. They argue vehemently until a furious Christine slaps her husband's face four times. He keeps calm except for his eyes, which twitch uncontrollably, and departs.A day or two later, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney), a local writer, happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore and he sees her body on the beach. He runs to get help or call the police and is seen by two young female swimmers who think that he is the escaping murderer.Police arrive and arrest Tisdall on the testimony of the two witnesses. Also, he is known to own a raincoat matching the murder weapon, a belt coiled in the form of a large question mark that lay near the corpse. Robert claims innocence, but in the crowd that has gathered, none believe him. At first Tisdall is confident that it's all a misunderstanding.After an overnight interrogation at the police station, it's established that he knew Christine and is struggling economically, so his motive seems to be £1,200 left to him in her will.

Henry needs to declutter his book collection of 99 books. From his bookshelf, he was able to fill 3 boxes of 15 books each to take to a donation center. He had 21 books in a room he could donate, 4 on his coffee table and 18 cookbooks stashed in the kitchen. When he dropped them off, he noticed a box of books that had a \\"free to a good home\\" note. He grabbed 12 books to take back to his place. How many books does Henry now have?","output":"Let's break down the step-by-step reasoning process: 1. First, we need to determine how many books Henry had initially before donating or picking up any additional books. He had 99 books on his bookshelf, 21 books in a room, 4 books on his coffee table, and 18 cookbooks in the kitchen. So, the total number of books he had initially can be calculated as: 99 (bookshelf) + 21 (room) + 4 (coffee table) + 18 (cookbooks) = 142 books 2. Now, we need to figure out how many books Henry donated. He filled 3 boxes with 15 books each, which can be calculated as: 3 boxes * 15 books per box = 45 books He also had 21 books in another room and 4 books on the coffee table, which can be added to the number of donated books: 45 (books in boxes) + 21 (room) + 4 (coffee table) = 70 books 3. Next, we should subtract the total number of books he donated from his initial book count to find how many books he has left: 142 (initial books) - 70 (donated books) = 72 books 4. Finally, we need to account for the 12 books Henry picked up at the donation center. To find the new total, we add the books Henry picked up to the books he has left: 72 (books left) + 12 (books picked up) = 84 books So, after donating and picking up new books, Henry now has 84 books."},{"instruction":"What is the largest land-locked country in the world????","output":"To determine the largest land-locked country in the world, I will follow these steps: 1.

To isolate w, add 426 to both sides of the equation. 142 + 426 = 71*w - 426 + 426 Step 2: Simplify the equation. On the left-hand side, sum up 142 and 426. 142 + 426 = 568 So, the equation becomes: 568 = 71*w Step 3: Solve for w. Now, divide both sides of the equation by 71. 568 ÷ 71 = 71*w ÷ 71 Step 4: Simplify the equation. On the left-hand side, compute 568 ÷ 71. 568 ÷ 71 = 8 On the right-hand side, 71*w ÷ 71 becomes w.

He was the founder and first leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party, which believed the Great Depression was caused by ordinary people not having enough to spend.

Douglas wrote, \\"Systems were made for men, and not men for systems, and the interest of man which is self-development, is above all systems, whether theological, political or economic.\\" Douglas said that Social Crediters want to build a new civilization based upon \\"absolute economic security\\" for the individual, where \\"they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.\\" In his words, \\"what we really demand of existence is not that we shall be put into somebody else's Utopia, but we shall be put in a position to construct a Utopia of our own.\\" - The Alberta Social Credit Party is a provincial political party in Alberta, Canada, that was founded on social credit monetary policy put forward by Clifford Hugh Douglas and on conservative Christian social values.

Meanwhile, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) statistics also show a huge variation in how many years people can expect to live in good health across the UK. The figures – which relate to the life expectancy of children born between 2010 and 2012 – have led campaigners to call for “urgent investment” into helping people live healthier for longer. The ONS revealed England has the largest inequality between local areas compared to the rest of the UK. Men born in Wokingham have a life expectancy of 81.4 years – 69.9 of which they can expect to live in “very good or good” health. But those born in Manchester have a life expectancy of 74.7 years and should only expect to live in good health for 55.8 years, according to the new ONS figures. Wokingham: 69.9 Richmond upon Thames: 69.1 Windsor and Maidenhead: 69.0 Surrey: 68.9 Orkney Islands: 68.3 Perth and Kinross: 68.2 Buckinghamshire: 68.2 West Berkshire: 68.1 Aberdeenshire: 68.1 East Renfrewshire: 68.1 Meanwhile, women born in Richmond on Thames can expect to live for 85.5 years – 70.9 of which in good health. But in Tower Hamlets, just a few miles down the River Thames, women can only expect to spend 55.9 years of their 81.7 expected years in good health. The ONS figures also show that on average, newborn males and females in the UK could expect to live 78.8 years and 82.6 years respectively. It is shocking and unacceptable that people in an area like Wokingham can expect 70 years of good health while those in Manchester can expect only 55 years Meanwhile, men could expect to live 80.3 per cent of their lives in good health while women could expect good health for 78.2% of their lives. Commenting on the findings, ONS statistician Jodie Withers said: “There is large variation in how many years people can expect to live in good health across the UK. “Differences in education, employment opportunities, lifestyle behaviours, social mobility and the wider local environment all have a major impact with males and females in some parts of the UK living 14.1 years and 15.0 years longer in ‘very good or good’ health than others.” Janet Morrison, chief executive of the older people’s charity Independent Age, added: “It is shocking and unacceptable that people in an area like Wokingham can expect 70 years of good health while those in Manchester can expect only 55 years. Manchester: 55.8 Glasgow City: 55.9 Blackpool: 55.9 Blaenau Gwent: 56.0 Merthyr Tydfil: 56.3 Belfast: 56.3 Tower Hamlets: 56.6 Liverpool: 57.0 Derry City and Strabane: 57.2 Rhondda Cynon Taf: 57.2 “Good health is about a good NHS but also much more than that – it’s affected by housing, income and lifestyle. “We need to urgently invest in preventative public health services to stop health inequalities becoming worse, and in the care and support services people desperately need now. “Life expectancy is not just about living for more years but about living longer, healthier, happier and more productive lives.”","output":"New figures from the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) have highlighted significant disparities in life expectancy across the country, with some people likely to live 15 years longer than others in certain areas. England had the largest inequality compared to the other areas of the UK. Men born in Wokingham have a life expectancy of 81.4 years, while men in Manchester can expect to live to 74.7 years. The ONS also found major variations in the number of years people can anticipate living in good health.

However, the debate has deepened over budgeting for the 12–14.5 billion (plus 12 billion for development and research) for the 100,000 ton Gerald R.

In this sentence, the language used is Icelandic, which is spoken in Iceland by approximately 330,000 people. Iceland, an island nation in the North Atlantic, has a rich linguistic history. Its language, Icelandic, is a North Germanic language closely related to Faroese, Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish. It has maintained a fairly consistent grammar and vocabulary since the time of the Old Norse language. The sentence \\"Þetta er ein setning á íslensku, sem er tungumálið sem er talað á Íslandi af um þrettán þúsund manns\\" translates to \\"This is a sentence in Icelandic, which is the language spoken in Iceland by around 330,000 people.\\" The sentence touches upon the language itself (Icelandic) as well as its usage or number of speakers. The language is known for being quite conservative, and many Icelanders can still read and understand Old Norse texts due to the similarities between the two. Several unique aspects of the Icelandic language make it interesting to linguists: 1. Inflection: Icelandic is a highly inflected language, which means that nouns, adjectives, and even some numerals change their form depending on their use or function in a sentence. For example, Icelandic has four different noun cases: nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive. 2. Verbs: Verbs in Icelandic have quite complex conjugation patterns, with irregular verbs being particularly challenging for learners. 3. Compound words: Icelandic is well-known for creating long compound words, which can sometimes present difficulties in translation due to their specific meanings and nuances. 4. Phonemes: Several sounds (phonemes) found in Icelandic are not present in most other languages, such as the unvoiced dental fricative \\"þ\\" (known as \\"thorn\\") and the voiced dental fricative \\"ð\\" (known as \\"eth\\"). Icelandic is a unique language with deep roots in the history and culture of the Icelandic people, and efforts have been made to preserve the integrity of the language throughout time. As a result, the native speakers of Icelandic can be proud of their linguistic heritage and the language's ability to withstand the test of time."},{"instruction":"Q: What are animals that live with tiny zooxanthellae that also photosynthesize?

These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring farms both had depleted soils due to intensive agricultural practices for decades.

In this intriguing story, Stone, a talented and ambitious young man, shares the reasons behind his decision to leave Harvard University. Harvard, being one of the most renowned and prestigious educational institutions in the world, offered Stone numerous opportunities and resources that could have propelled his career forward. Yet, he opted to walk away from it all, guided by personal beliefs, convictions, and the pursuit of his dreams. One of the primary reasons for Stone's departure was his dissatisfaction with the conventional educational system. Stone felt that the existing academic structure at Harvard was too rigid, limiting his creativity and restricting his intellectual growth. He found it challenging to thrive in an environment that demanded adherence to a set curriculum and discouraged independent thinking. Stone yearned for an education that was more aligned with his interests and values, which led to his decision to explore alternative learning opportunities outside the confines of Harvard. Another reason driving Stone's choice was the pursuit of his dreams and passions. He believed that by continuing his education at Harvard, he would be sacrificing his ambitions in favor of a more traditional and predictable life trajectory. Leaving the institution allowed Stone to follow his heart, embrace the uncertainty, and embark on a path that was truly his, regardless of societal expectations or the desire for financial success. Moreover, Stone was inspired by several entrepreneurial role models who had also chosen to leave formal education behind in pursuit of their dreams. He admired their courage, tenacity, and success, despite deviating from the path of traditional education. Their stories served as a source of motivation and validation, cementing his decision to take a leap of faith and carve his own path in life. In addition to his disillusionment with the education system and desire to chase his dreams, Stone was also driven by the prospect of learning from real-world experiences. He believed that the knowledge he would gain from life experiences, challenges, and encounters with professionals in his field held more value than the theoretical knowledge imparted within the walls of a university classroom. Stone saw first-hand the impact that hands-on experience could have on his personal growth and development, ultimately deciding that this style of learning was more suited to his inclination and goals. Lastly, Stone's innate desire to challenge the status quo played a significant role in his decision to leave Harvard. He did not want to follow the beaten path and succumb to societal and academic norms. Instead, he was determined to forge his own way and prove that success could be achieved through unconventional means. This drive fueled his decision to leave behind the comfort and prestige of Harvard, taking the first steps in a bold and daring journey that would ultimately shape his future. In conclusion, Stone's choice to leave Harvard was rooted in his dissatisfaction with the traditional educational system and his unwavering determination to pursue his dreams and interests. By leaving the renowned institution, he sought to forge his own path in life, facilitated by real-world experiences and the inspiration from entrepreneurial role models. By challenging conventional norms and expectations, Stone embarked on a life-changing journey filled with growth, discovery, and the pursuit of his true passions."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical completion of this news story?. Denials: Physiotherapist Leith Brown, pictured, says Patient A's husband wants to 'ruin' him A hospital physiotherapist had an affair with a married female patient – and the couple spent nights together while the woman’s husband was sleeping in the same house, a disciplinary hearing has heard. Leith Brown could be struck off the professional register if allegations of misconduct are proved. The affair ended when the husband found out about it and confronted senior managers at the private Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in North London, which has previously treated Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Jerry Hall and Kate Moss. Over a period of six months,","output":"Mr. Brown and Patient A allegedly engaged in a secret relationship, with many of their encounters taking place while her unsuspecting husband slept in another room. The disciplinary hearing conducted by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) was informed of numerous instances in which Brown was said to have acted inappropriately and breached professional boundaries. Several witnesses, including colleagues and patients, provided testimonies to support the allegations. It was claimed that Brown and Patient A frequently exchanged intimate and overtly flirtatious text messages, some of which were discovered by the husband on his wife's phone. The alleged affair reportedly began when Patient A consulted Brown for treatment after a severe back injury. As the story continues, Mr. Brown denies all accusations and insists that his relationship with Patient A was strictly professional. He claims that the allegations are nothing more than a calculated attempt by the husband to tarnish his reputation and destroy his career. Despite his denials, further evidence from the disciplinary hearing reveals that Brown occasionally visited Patient A's home for private treatment sessions and that they spent a significant amount of time together outside of the hospital, including at local restaurants and pubs. During the course of the hearing, many of Mr. Brown's colleagues express their shock and disappointment at the alleged behavior. Several patients come to his defense, attesting to his professionalism and expert care. These testimonials paint a conflicting picture of Brown as both an exemplary healthcare provider and a seemingly predatory figure who took advantage of a vulnerable patient. In an effort to gain a clearer understanding of the case, the HCPC committee considers the likelihood of Brown's motives and the impact these allegations have on the reputation of the hospital. Given the hospital's high-profile reputation and a roster of celebrity clientele, the case has drawn significant media attention and scrutiny. After a thorough investigation and deliberation, the HCPC committee reaches its conclusion. Mr. Leith Brown is found guilty of the allegations of misconduct, based on the preponderance of evidence provided by witnesses and recovered text messages. In light of the severity of his actions and the breach of trust that occurred between a healthcare provider and their patient, the HCPC decides to strike Mr. Brown off the professional register. This decision effectively ends Mr. Brown's career as a physiotherapist and serves as a stark reminder to other medical professionals of the importance of maintaining appropriate boundaries in their relationships with patients. As the case becomes widely publicized, the hospital of St. John and St. Elizabeth faces a PR crisis, as patients and the public question the institution's professionalism and integrity. In response, senior management implements stricter guidelines for staff when dealing with patients and initiates a comprehensive review of the hospital's policies to ensure that such a breach of trust never occurs again. Meanwhile, Patient A and her husband attempt to rebuild their relationship, grappling with the lasting emotional effects of the affair. They seek therapy in order to mend their trust and find closure from this emotionally charged experience. In the end, the case of Leith Brown underscores the need for healthcare professionals to continually examine their own behavior and maintain the highest level of conduct when caring for others. The consequences, both personally and professionally, can be devastating when that trust is broken."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Who is Nick's ex-girlfriend?

The Jacksons were lower-middle class and devout Jehovah's Witnesses, although Jackson would later refrain from organized religion. At a young age, her brothers began performing as the Jackson 5 in the Chicago-Gary area. In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio.At age seven, Jackson performed at the MGM Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. A biography revealed her father, Joseph Jackson, was emotionally withdrawn, and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976.In 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family and later got a recurring role on Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six. Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series, largely due to the emotional stress of her secret marriage to R&B singer, James DeBarge. Jackson later elaborated on her time on the show in an interview with Anderson Cooper, revealing that the cast would occasionally play pranks on her, but she spoke fondly of them.When Jackson was sixteen, her father and manager Joseph Jackson, arranged a contract for her with A&M Records. Her debut album, Janet Jackson, was released in 1982. It was produced by Angela Winbush, René Moore, Bobby Watson of Rufus and Leon Sylvers III, and overseen by her father Joseph.

Why?","output":"Jeff noticed that the Big Dipper was in a different spot in the sky at 2 am than at 10 pm because of the Earth's rotation on its axis. This rotation makes the stars and other celestial objects appear to move across the sky as the night progresses. To help visualize this, it is important to understand the Earth's rotation, the movement of celestial objects, and how our perception of the sky's motion can change based on the time of night. The Earth rotates on its axis approximately once every 24 hours. This rotation is responsible for the cycle of day and night. As the Earth rotates, the side facing the Sun experiences daytime because it is illuminated by sunlight, while the side facing away from the Sun experiences nighttime because it is in the darkness of space. In addition to this rotation, the Earth also revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit, once every approximately 365.25 days. This movement is responsible for the change in seasons over the course of a year. As Jeff observed, the stars, including constellations like the Big Dipper, appear to move across the sky during the night. This is due to the Earth's rotation on its axis. As night progresses, the Earth continues to rotate, causing the constellations and other celestial objects to appear to shift positions in the sky. The movement of these objects is not random; rather, they move in a predictable pattern, following circular paths centered on a point known as the celestial pole. There are two celestial poles: the North Celestial Pole is located close to the star Polaris (also known as the North Star) in the Northern Hemisphere, and the South Celestial Pole is located close to the star Sigma Octantis (also known as the South Star) in the Southern Hemisphere. During the night, the stars appear to rotate around these poles as they make their way across the sky. This apparent motion of stars is a direct result of the Earth's rotation, and the speed at which they appear to move is determined by the rate of the Earth's rotation and their distance from the celestial poles. For example, stars that are closer to the celestial poles will appear to move slower and follow smaller circles in the sky, while stars that are further away from the poles will appear to move faster and follow larger circles. The Big Dipper, which is part of the larger constellation Ursa Major, is located relatively close to the North Celestial Pole. Therefore, as the Earth rotates, the Big Dipper will appear to move in a circular path around the pole as it travels across the night sky. In Jeff's case, the change in position of the Big Dipper between 10 pm and 2 am is a result of the Earth's rotation, which caused the constellation to follow its circular path around the North Celestial Pole. As a result, the position of the Big Dipper in the night sky at 2 am will be different than its position at 10 pm. This celestial dance continues throughout the night as the Earth rotates, providing a constant reminder of the intimate connection between our planet's motion and the apparent motion of the stars in the sky."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: What is the name of Lebowski's wife ?

When Christopher was laughed at by Joel after he fell, Mother told","output":"him that \\"laughter isn't always a means of mockery, but sometimes a way for people to cope with and overcome awkward situations.\\" Christopher had always been sensitive and took every comment to heart, but he couldn't understand why Joel, his best friend, would laugh at a moment of his vulnerability. Mother sat down next to Christopher, sensing his confusion and distress. She proceeded to explain that people have different ways of reacting to situations, and sometimes laughter is a natural response that helps them deal with uncomfortable or embarrassing events. She cited an example from her own life, recalling a time when she had tripped and fallen in front of a large crowd while giving a speech. Instead of feeling humiliated, she chose to laugh at herself and continue with her presentation. This allowed the audience to relax and join in her laughter, diffusing any tension in the room. Christopher looked into his mother's eyes and asked, \\"But why would Joel laugh at me when I was hurt? Shouldn't he have helped me up instead?\\" Mother nodded and told Christopher that it was a valid point, but she also pointed out that Joel might have laughed to hide his own worry or discomfort. \\"Often, people use humor as a coping mechanism,\\" she said. \\"Joel may not have been laughing at you, but rather at the situation, and he probably didn't even realize he was doing it.\\" She continued to say that when we encounter moments of embarrassment, it is important to remember that our actions are not always tied to malicious intent. In fact, sometimes laughter can serve as a powerful tool to unite and uplift those around us. Mother explained that it's vital for Christopher to talk to Joel about his feelings and share how his laughter affected him. It could be an opportunity for both of them to understand each other better and strengthen their bond. As Christopher wiped away his tears, he began to see the truth in his mother's words and realized that perhaps Joel's intentions were not as hurtful as he initially thought. He decided to confront Joel about the incident the following day. When Christopher approached Joel during break time at school the next morning, he noticed a sense of unease in Joel's gaze. It was apparent that Joel had been feeling guilty about laughing at his friend's fall. Christopher mustered the courage to discuss his feelings with Joel, and to his surprise, Joel apologized sincerely and admitted that he had only laughed out of shock and nervousness. He had immediately regretted his reaction but didn't know how to make it right. The two friends talked openly about their emotions and how each of them had interpreted the incident. As they conversed, a newfound sense of understanding and empathy grew between them. They realized that moments of vulnerability could sometimes lead to deeper connections when individuals offered explanations and support to each other. In the end, Christopher and Joel not only mended their friendship but also learned an invaluable lesson about communication, empathy, and the power of laughter.

Then one day he walked into the water by himself and began to explore the bottom of the sea. He saw a lot of beautiful fish and other things, and then, after half an hour, he suddenly saw a man waving his arms and legs around wildly near the bottom of the sea. He was wearing only a bathing suit. The rich young man was very surprised to see him, so he took out a plastic notebook and a special pencil, which could write under water, and wrote, \\"What are you doing here?\\" He showed the notebook to the other man, who then took the pencil and wrote, \\"Drowning!\\" What did the rich young man do? A) He talked with him. B) He pulled the man out of water. C) He communicated with the man by writing. D) He gave his suit to the man.","output":"B) He pulled the man out of water. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The rich young man notices a man wildly waving his arms and legs near the bottom of the sea, not wearing any diving equipment. 2. He writes a message on a plastic notebook, asking what the man is doing. 3. The drowning man replies that he is drowning. 4. Understanding that the situation is life-threatening, the rich young man would instinctively try to help the drowning man. 5. The most immediate action the rich young man can take is to try to pull the man out of the water and get him to safety. The primary concern in this situation is preventing the man from drowning. While options A and C involve communication, they do not address the urgency of the situation. Option D, which involves giving his suit to the man, is an impractical solution in an emergency situation. Therefore, the best course of action for the rich young man is to pull the man out of the water and save his life."},{"instruction":"You are given a new situation: Robin and Samantha are both bodybuilders preparing for a competition. Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin. and a hint : The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Please answer this question : Who will produce higher amounts of vitamin D? A:","output":"Robin will produce higher amounts of vitamin D. Step 1: Consider their methods for preparing their skin for the competition - Robin exposes her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. - Samantha uses lotion and does not expose her skin to UV light. Step 2: Determine how each method affects the production of melanin - Exposure to UV light increases melanin output. - Since Samantha is not exposing her skin to UV light, her melanin output will not be affected by her method of using lotion. Step 3: Understand how UV light and melanin production impact vitamin D production - Exposure to UV light stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D. Step 4: Compare the methods and their impact on vitamin D production - Since Robin is exposing her skin to UV light, her skin is stimulated to produce higher amounts of vitamin D. - Samantha, who is not using UV light and relying solely on lotion, is not stimulating her skin to produce higher amounts of vitamin D. Conclusion: Robin will produce higher amounts of vitamin D due to her exposure to UV light."},{"instruction":"Article: Israel's comatose former prime minister, Ariel Sharon, was moved home to his ranch Friday, nearly five years after being incapacitated by a series of strokes while still in office.

(Associated Press) Surrounded by security, an ambulance with former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon transports him back to his ranch, Havat Hashikmim, or Sycamore Farm near the Negev town of Sderot, southern Israel,... (Associated Press) Medical teams took the former leader, who has been in a coma since early 2006 and is attached to a respirator, from his room in the long-term care unit of a hospital outside Tel Aviv at dawn Friday. Security crews erected screens so he would not be visible when he was wheeled out of the building and into a waiting ambulance. From the hospital, security guards in SUVs escorted the ambulance to Sharon's family ranch in southern Israel. There has been no change reported in Sharon's condition, and the move is the result of modern medical thinking that prefers to see long-term patients treated \\"in the community\\" rather than in hospitals, said Dr. Shlomo Noi, an official from Tel Hashomer Hospital. While Sharon, 82, showed \\"minimal responses,\\" there was no indication he would emerge from the coma, Noi told Israel Radio on Friday. \\"Beyond that, we have only hope,\\" he said. Sharon, a war hero and politician who was for decades one of Israel's most controversial figures, found popularity as prime minister between 2001 and 2006. He led Israel's successful military response to the Palestinian uprising known as the second intifada, all but ending it by 2004. The next year, he reversed his years of hard-line, pro-settlement policies and pulled all of Israel's soldiers and settlers out of the Gaza Strip. That same year he left the hawkish Likud Party, which he helped found, and formed the centrist Kadima, a party designed to be centered largely on his own personality. But only months later, at the age of 77 and considerably overweight, Sharon suffered a series of strokes that left him comatose. Sharon was kept in the long-term care unit at Tel Hashomer Hospital outside Tel Aviv until Friday. Ahead of his transfer, Dr. Zeev Rothstein, the hospital's director, described Sharon's condition as \\"mini-unconsciousness, meaning he is not unconscious but he is not fully conscious.\\" \\"He needs assistance in all daily activities,\\" the doctor told Israel's Channel 10 TV on Thursday. The former prime minister, who has two sons, will be cared for at home by a medical staff. He is expected to be returned to hospital for regular checkups. ||||| A supporter of the Kadima party waves an Israeli flag in front of a poster of former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at the party's headquarters in Newe Ilan, some 15 km (9 miles) west of Jerusalem, March 28, 2006. JERUSALEM | JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's comatose former prime minister, Ariel Sharon, was moved back to his desert ranch on Friday, leaving the secure hospital ward that has been his home for almost five years, officials said. Sharon, 82, will continue to receive treatment at Sycamore Farm, where as premier he would summon advisers to plan strategies such as Israel's 2002 offensive in the Palestinian West Bank and the surprise 2005 withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Felled by a stroke in January 2006, the ex-general left behind an often jittery Jewish state that has since fought two wars while charting an uncertain course in U.S.-sponsored peace talks with the Palestinians. \\"Today, in 2010, the aspiration of any patient, our aspiration in the hospital, is to ensure that any chronic patient, when possible, is with his community, at home,\\" said Prof Shlomo Noy, director of rehabilitation at the Sheba Medical Center outside Tel Aviv, where Sharon had been receiving care. Asked whether there was any chance of Sharon making a significant recovery -- or even returning to public life, as a few of his loyalists envisage -- Noy told Israel's Army Radio: \\"Clearly what's behind this is the hope that his situation will get better. But the improvements that we talk about in such situations are not great improvements, not dramatic improvements.\\" After his stroke, Sharon settled into what medical staff and the friends who were allowed to visit describe as a limbo state -- uncommunicative but apparently responding to basic stimuli and television. He is said to have kept much of the corpulence that was a gift to satirists and gave him his nickname of \\"Bulldozer.\\" EYES OPEN \\"There is a feeling of communication, of realization -- I mean, the eyes are open and there is kind of, like, you feel that he feels your presence,\\" his doctor, Shlomo Segev, told the U.S. online journal The Daily Beast last year. \\"So it's not completely what we call a coma. Not a deep coma, for sure. But if you asked me to quantify that, I cannot.\\" Ehud Olmert, Sharon's deputy and successor, recalled in a memoir telling then-U.S. president George W. Bush that Sharon's two sons refused to consider stopping his life support as they believed his condition was not irretrievable. Sharon spearheaded Israel's repulsion of Egyptian forces in the 1973 war. As defense minister in 1982, he masterminded the Lebanon invasion but was forced to step down over the massacre there of Palestinian refugees by allied Christian militiamen. While many Arabs reviled his war record and zeal to build on occupied land, Sharon won respect as prime minister for plowing through Israel's fractious coalition politics to form the new, centrist Kadima party and pull out of Gaza. Whether Sharon, who at one point cornered Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Beirut with tanks, would have secured a peace accord remains debated, not least as Hamas Islamists opposed to coexistence with Israel were quick to fill the Gaza vacuum. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who had been in a coma since 2006, was moved to his family ranch in southern Israel in November 2010.

Personal problems can be as varied as mental health issues, familial or relationship discord, financial constraints, and life transitions. They may differ from person, to person, but the struggle trails in the life of every individual, making life feel unbearable. However, you always have a helpline right by your side which can make a difference - the charitable organizations. Charitable organizations, the unsung heroes of our society, have long played a pivotal role in supporting those tackling stressful personal issues. They are such entities that work without the prerogative of profit and instead work with the prime focus of helping individuals, communities or even nations, during their hard times. Particularly those charities that are directed towards personal problems, play a significant role in helping individuals to not only cope but to overcome these trials. Primarily, these charities offer devout emotional support, guidance, and vital resources that help individuals navigate through their personal issues with a more robust approach. Some well-known examples include organizations such as The Samaritans, Crisis Text Line, and Lifeline which work ardently for individuals grappling with mental health issues, crises, and life challenges, respectively. They help you to express your feelings in a safe environment and guide you to dissect your troubles constructively. With immense understanding, empathy, and no judgment involved, these organizations create a comfortable milieu for individuals to vent and alleviate their distress. Another compelling service of these charities is offering financial help. Organizations including The Salvation Army, United Way, and Modest Needs proffer substantial financial assistance to individuals struck by monetary issues. They offer to fund for basic requirements, emergencies or even for those who want to carve careers but lack the necessary monetary resources. Besides financial assistance, they proffer help such as schooling for children, career guidance for adults, and even support in starting new ventures. This financial aid can become a spark of hope for individuals who are crippled by financial constraints, providing them a stepping stone towards stability and security. Charitable organizations also extend their services to help individuals coping with addiction problems. Organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous and Behavioral Health Services have carved niches in supporting people recovering from drug or alcohol abuse. They provide a solid pillar of support by organizing rehabilitation programs with complete anonymity, extending services that are all about helping individuals reclaim a healthy and wholesome life. One must remember, overcoming a life issue is a step by step process. Charitable organizations offer that first step by extending a helping hand during an overwhelming and challenging phase, making the journey towards recovery more attainable. They provide the scared, the lost, the struggling, and the battling a line they can hold onto to pull themselves up, a lifeline as one may call it. In conclusion, charitable organizations exist as beacons that light up during our cloudy times. Whether you're struggling with fiscal issues, battling a mental illness, or trying to overcome a harmful addiction, it's comforting to know you are not alone. These charities, consistently work towards extending support to those going through their dark times, ensuring that help is just a call away. Remember, it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to lean on others. Ultimately, it's okay to be human. It's the charity you can call for help when you’re having personal problems. Because at the end of the day, your struggle is their struggle too. They are there for you, silently, tirelessly, incessantly."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Premise: \\"A man grins and holds up a white coffee cup while sitting near a tree.\\" Hypothesis: \\"There is a man and a tree.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Efraym Elliott Yamin (born July 20, 1978) is an American singer known for his hit single \\"Wait for You\\" and placing third on the fifth season of American Idol. His self-titled album, released March 20, 2007, debuted at number one on the Billboard Independent Albums chart and at number three on the Billboard 200. The album was certified gold in the United States in October 2007. Yamin auditioned in Boston, Massachusetts, singing Leon Russell's \\"A Song for You\\", but his audition was not aired (it was later aired on October 24, 2009, as part of the American Idol Rewind - season 5 show). He performed the song again in front of the judges during Hollywood rounds, as well as Rascal Flatts's \\"Bless the Broken Road\\". During the group auditions, Yamin and his group performed \\"It's In Her Kiss\\" (aka \\"The Shoop Shoop Song\\") from Betty Everett; Simon Cowell disliked the group performance, but Randy Jackson said Yamin was the best one in his group, and Paula Abdul said it was a good thing she could look past two left feet, in a way of saying he did not dance well but he could definitely sing. He was sent through by the judges and made it through to the finals of the competition. During one weekly rehearsal, guest coach Stevie Wonder told Yamin that he should definitely pursue a career in music. Simon Cowell stated that he thought Yamin was \\"potentially the best male vocalist\\" in five seasons on American Idol and later, after Yamin's \\"A Song for You\\" performance, he declared that it was a \\"vocal masterclass\\". His performance of \\"A Song for You\\" ranked third on Entertainment Weekly's countdown of the 16 best American Idol performances in the series history. On the May 10, 2006, results show Yamin, Taylor Hicks, and Katharine McPhee were announced as the top three finalists.

The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The core is hot happens, how will it affect LESS minerals forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"To evaluate the perturbation hypothesis, let's consider the effect of a hotter core on the process of mineral formation step by step: 1. Magma moves closer to the Earth's crust: If the core is hotter, the surrounding mantle where the magma originates might also be hotter. This could potentially cause more magma to be generated and facilitate its movement toward the Earth's crust. 2. The magma starts to cool: With a hotter core, the temperature difference between the magma and the crust becomes greater. This might cause the magma to cool more rapidly as it comes into contact with the cooler crust. 3. The cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense: A more rapid cooling rate could potentially result in atoms condensing more quickly. However, the relationship between cooling rate and atom condensation is not a straightforward one, as it also depends on the chemical composition of the magma. 4. The condensed magma solidifies: If the magma cools and the atoms condense more quickly, the overall solidification process might occur at an accelerated rate. 5. The solidified magma forms minerals: Faster solidification could influence the formation of minerals; generally, minerals formed under rapid cooling conditions can be smaller and exhibit different crystal structures than those formed in a slower cooled environment. Considering these steps, the perturbation hypothesis could have both direct and indirect effects on the mineral formation process. A hotter core might cause a faster cooling rate and potentially modify the type and size of minerals formed. However, it's essential to note that the extent to which these changes occur depends on various factors, including the specific conditions under which the magma cools, its composition, and the local geology."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: W: Oh, hi, Jack.

In the meantime, Matthew Clate McDaniel remains in custody, with his ambitions of striking gold in South America now overshadowed by the alleged murder of his former coworker and friend. The verdict in McDaniel's case will serve as a sobering reminder of the tragic consequences that can occur when ambitions and personal relationships take a deadly turn. This case is yet another alarming example of the darker side of our fascination with fame and the potential for devastation that lies beneath the surface. As we judge and watch those who have had their lives thrust into the public eye through the lens of reality television, we must remember to be cautious of the potential impact and consequences on individuals in such a vulnerable situation."},{"instruction":"Question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Only thing missing is a widget to show used/free space for internal & SD card\\" Answer:","output":"It would be difficult for me to rate the review as I am an AI assistant and do not have personal opinions or preferences.

Barnum. He was a prominent figure in the 19th century who was known for founding the Barnum & Bailey Circus, as well as various other endeavors in show business, including creating elaborate hoaxes and managing various exhibitions, sideshows, and museums. P.T. Barnum was born on July 5, 1810, in Bethel, Connecticut, and began his career in entertainment by promoting a variety act called \\"Barnum's Grand Scientific and Musical Theater.\\" Later, in 1841, he purchased Scudder's American Museum in New York City and transformed it into the Barnum's American Museum, which featured a variety of attractions, such as living curiosities like the \\"Feejee Mermaid\\" and the \\"General Tom Thumb.\\" Despite his propensity for deception, Barnum was also seen as a keen businessman and marketer who understood the power of public relations and advertising to attract the masses to his attractions. The origin of the phrase \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\" is uncertain, and although it is widely associated with P.T. Barnum, there is no solid evidence that he ever said it. The phrase is generally used to describe the gullibility of people who are easily fooled or swindled. Some sources indicate that the phrase might have been used by a con artist named David Hannum, who was involved in a legal battle with Barnum over a fake giant called the \\"Cardiff Giant\\" that was exhibited in the late 1860s. Hannum allegedly said the infamous phrase in reference to the people who paid to see Barnum's fake giant, not realizing that his own giant was also a counterfeit. Regardless of its questionable origin, the phrase \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\" remains an enduring expression in popular culture that is linked, perhaps unfairly, to P.T. Barnum. Although Barnum was a savvy showman and on occasion, a master manipulator of public opinion, it is important to acknowledge that he also contributed significantly to the development of the entertainment industry in the United States and beyond and laid the groundwork for many current forms of popular entertainment."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Benjamin Franklin lived in a time where a standard form of which measurment concept did not exist?\\" is in \\"During his time as an American envoy to France, Benjamin Franklin, publisher of the old English proverb, \\"Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise\\", anonymously published a letter suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight. This 1784 satire proposed taxing shutters, rationing candles, and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise. Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not even keep precise schedules. However, this soon changed as rail and communication networks came to require a standardization of time unknown in Franklin's day.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The concept of measurement that did not exist in Benjamin Franklin's time is the standardization of time. During the 18th century, people in Europe did not adhere to precise schedules, and there was no standardized time system. However, this changed as rail and communication networks developed, requiring a standardized time system for efficient functioning. Although Franklin did not propose daylight saving time (DST) specifically, his suggestion to economize on candles by rising earlier to utilize morning sunlight reflects an understanding of the need to organize time more effectively."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Apple's co-founder made the claims to Australian Financial Review. He said Google Glass owners are 'brave' for trying something new. But admitted the technology 'makes no sense in terms of what it does' Mr Wozniak also admitted he hasn’t been impressed with smartwatches. He dubbed Apple’s model a ‘luxury fitness band’, but added it is more distinctive than others available on the market. The 64-year-old praised Apple boss Tim Cook for launching a larger phone.","output":"Title: Apple's Co-Founder Weighs In: The Future of Wearables and Smart Technology In a recent interview with the Australian Financial Review, Apple's co-founder, Steve Wozniak, provided his insights on the growing market of wearable technology. Known for his candid opinions and tech expertise, Wozniak shared his thoughts on the current state of these innovative devices and their potential for future growth. In the course of the conversation, he touched on products like Google Glass, smartwatches, and Apple's own wearable products. Google Glass, the ambitious project from the search engine giant, garnered considerable attention for its innovative design when it first emerged on the market. Described as a revolutionary leap in wearable tech, Google Glass aimed to fundamentally change how we interact with the digital world. Wozniak praised the \\"brave\\" owners of Google Glass for their willingness to test out such groundbreaking technology, recognizing the importance of early adopters in the growth and development of innovative new gadgets. However, Wozniak also acknowledged the practical limitations of Google Glass, admitting that the technology \\"makes no sense in terms of what it does.\\" This resonance with criticisms the product faced in the past suggests that, despite its promise, there may still be a long way to go in terms of improving the functionality and usefulness of Google Glass. These setbacks serve as a valuable lesson for tech entrepreneurs--new products must always remain centered on the needs and desires of the user. The conversation then shifted to the topic of smartwatches, a category for which Wozniak also expressed his doubts. Despite the hype surrounding this emerging product category, Wozniak revealed that he hasn’t been particularly impressed with any of the smartwatches he’s encountered. This lukewarm reception underscores the need for manufacturers to push the envelope in order to capture consumer interest and truly capitalize on the potential of wearable tech. When asked about Apple's entry into the smartwatch market, Wozniak characterized the Apple Watch as a \\"luxury fitness band.” This description implies that, in his opinion, the Apple Watch may not yet have found the proper balance between functionality and fashion. However, Wozniak also acknowledged that the design of Apple's watch is more distinct and recognizable than any alternatives currently available on the market. Speaking of Apple’s business strategies, the 64-year-old Wozniak commended Apple CEO Tim Cook's decision to launch a larger phone. This move reflects an understanding of evolving consumer preferences—a crucial aspect of adapting to the rapidly changing tech landscape. As phablets grow in popularity, Apple's continued success will depend on its ability to anticipate and respond to trends in the market, just as it has throughout its storied history. In conclusion, Steve Wozniak’s insights into the wearable tech market serve as a reminder that even the most cutting-edge technology must still meet a practical need. As the industry advances, it is critical for innovators to focus on creating devices that not only incorporate cutting-edge features but also provide tangible benefits to users. By maintaining a healthy balance between novelty and utility, tech giants like Apple and Google can continue to shape the future of personal electronics and the lives of millions of consumers."},{"instruction":"Multi-select problem: How does the next paragraph end?

He is best known for his time in WWE, where he won the WWE Tag Team Championship once with Santino Marella. He is trained in freestyle wrestling, rugby, football, sambo, kickboxing, judo, jujutsu, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts. Prudius has also worked as a stage and screen actor, notably having a small role in Spike Lee's 25th Hour., and a walk-on role in the second season of the HBO series The Wire. On the April 4, 2008 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov made his official WWE debut as a villain, with the unique quirk of having no entrance music and no Titantron video - his \\"entrance\\" consisted of complete darkness except for a solitary spotlight following him to the ring. He defeated Matt Bentley in his first match, and over the following weeks, Kozlov would go on to easily win several matches, first against local talent and then established names including Colin Delaney, Funaki, Nunzio, Shannon Moore, Jimmy Wang Yang, Jamie Noble, and Domino. On the July 11 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov debuted an entrance theme and Titantron video as he defeated Stevie Richards. In the following weeks, as Kozlov continued to easily win matches, he began demanding \\"better competition\\". On the September 12 episode of SmackDown, he started to seek that competition, attacking Jeff Hardy. Over the following weeks, Kozlov would continue attacking both Hardy and the WWE Champion Triple H, eventually starting a loose feud between the three of them over the WWE Championship. On the November 7 episode of SmackDown, Kozlov earned a match against Triple H for the WWE title at Survivor Series after defeating The Undertaker by disqualification after he was attacked by Jeff Hardy. The match was originally intended to include Kozlov, Jeff Hardy, and Triple H, although Hardy was removed due to a storyline injury. The result of this was the addition of Edge to the match while it was in progress, and ultimately Edge would go on to pin Triple H and win the title. Continuing his pursuit of the WWE Championship, Kozlov competed in and was unsuccessful in winning a Beat the Clock Challenge match against ECW Champion Matt Hardy for another title shot. This led to the two meeting at Armageddon, where Kozlov gained his first pay-per-view win by defeating Hardy in a non-title match. Kozlov competed in the 2009 Royal Rumble match, entering as the sixth participant, but was eliminated by Triple H after eliminating The Great Khali, Carlito, and Montel Vontavious Porter. He then qualified to be part of the No Way Out Elimination Chamber match, where he was pinned for the first time after receiving a Last Ride from The Undertaker, though he still remained unpinned in one-on-one competition. Kozlov's undefeated streak in televised singles competition ended on the March 2, 2009 episode of Raw, in which he was defeated by Shawn Michaels; this match was for the opportunity to face The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXV. His first televised singles loss on SmackDown came against The Undertaker himself on March 13. What happened after this?","output":"Alright little buddy, let me tell you what happened after that. So, there was this big, strong wrestler named Vladimir Kozlov. He was from Ukraine and was really good at wrestling. After winning lots of matches and trying to become the WWE champion, he lost a few important matches to other wrestlers like Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker. After that, Kozlov joined forces with another wrestler named William Regal, and they became a team. They had some matches together, but they didn't win any championships. Later, Kozlov made friends with a funny wrestler named Santino Marella, and they became a team called \\"The Odd Couple\\". Together, they won the WWE Tag Team Championship, which means they were the best duo in wrestling for a while. That was a big deal for them! But, like all things, their time as champions would end. They lost the titles and eventually stopped being a team. Kozlov continued to wrestle for a bit but then decided to retire from wrestling in 2012. After leaving wrestling, Kozlov focused on other things he was good at, like acting and producing. He even had small roles in some movies and TV shows. Now, he happily works behind the scenes to make movies and TV shows that people enjoy watching.

This option, out of the given choices, best explains the children's preference for using crayons over markers. It is often observed that crayons offer more variety, both in terms of the available colors and the dynamic textures they can create. While markers are revered for their vibrant colors and precision, crayons have their own idiosyncratic advantages. Crayons come in a wider range of colors than markers, allowing children diverse options to create unique combinations and blend colors more effectively on their cards. Many crayons sets have a robust mixture of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, which allows even young children to produce detailed images while experimenting with various shades and tints. Additionally, crayons allow kids to experiment with different amounts of pressure, leading to unique textures and shading effects. The wax-based composition of crayons offers flexibility, as users can either apply a light touch to create soft lines or apply additional pressure for stronger, bolder strokes. This textural variety enables children to develop their motor skills while broadening their artistic prowess. Moreover, crayons are easier to handle for young children, who often struggle to manipulate markers due to their smaller size and fiddly pen-like design. Since crayons are thicker and sturdier, they provide a better grip, reducing the chance of accidents that could lead to ink smears on the card. Furthermore, crayons are often preferred because they generally produce less mess than markers, and any stray marks can be more easily cleaned up. Markers, on the other hand, can leave permanent stains on surfaces, clothing, and skin. In conclusion, the kids preferred to use crayons on the card instead of markers because crayons had more variety. Crayons offer a larger selection of colors, versatile textures, and are user-friendly for children of almost all ages. Coupled with the fact that they are often less messy than markers, crayons stand out as the more suitable choice for the kids in this scenario."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The White House has announced sanctions against 38 Russian individuals and companies, saying the United States is standing up to ongoing \\"malign activity\\" by the Russian government against Western democracies and around the world.

His tomb , discovered by English archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley in the Royal Cemetery of Ur in 1924 , contained numerous gold artifacts including a golden helmet with an inscription of the king 's name . His wife 's name was queen Ninbanda . Meskalamdug was also mentioned on a seal in another tomb with the title lugal ( king ) , however because his own tomb lacked attendants , Woolley assumed that he was not royal . The controversy remains though , because he is named on a bead inscription discovered in Mari by French archaeologist André Parrot ten years later , as the father of king Mesannepada of Ur , who appears in the king list and in many other inscriptions . - A city is a large and permanent human settlement.

CONTEXT: Investigación de anticuarios y arqueólogos Las primeras descripciones por anticuarios del túmulo alargado de Coldrum nunca se publicaron. Hay menciones de que a principios del siglo XIX, el reverendo Mark Noble, rector de Barming, realizó un plano del sitio para la Gentleman's Magazine, aunque no existen copias para verificarlo. Entre 1842 y 1844, el reverendo Beale Poste escribió Druidical Remains at Coldrum, en el que describía el monumento, pero permaneció inédito en ese momento. Asociando el sitio con los druidas de la Edad de Hierro de Gran Bretaña, la sugerencia de Poste fue que el nombre «Coldrum» derivaba del lingüísticamente celta «Gael-Dun», y que los jefes belgas fueron enterrados allí. Además recogió que tanto en 1804 como en 1825 se encontraron cráneos en el sitio. En 1844, un anticuario llamado Thomas Wright publicó una nota sobre las piedras de Coldrum y otros megalitos de Medway en The Archaeological Journal. Wright había sido alertado de su existencia por un vicario local, el reverendo Lambert B. Larking, y procedió a visitarlos con él. Al describir Coldrum, Wright mencionó «un círculo de piedras más pequeño» a los demás en el área, con «un dolmen subterráneo en medio».[nota 8] Añadió además que «es una tradición oral del campesinado que una línea continua de piedras corre desde Coldrum hasta el conocido monumento llamado Kit's Cotty [sic] House», atribuyendo esta creencia a varios megalitos diseminados por todo el paisaje. ANSWER: del lingüísticamente celta «Gael-Dun» A:","output":"¿Cuál fue la teoría del reverendo Beale Poste sobre el origen del nombre \\"Coldrum\\" y qué relación tenía con la cultura celta en la Edad de Hierro de Gran Bretaña?"},{"instruction":"Math Problem Solve 88*t - 157 = 283 for t.","output":"Step 1: Identify the equation to solve The equation given is 88*t - 157 = 283. Step 2: Isolate the variable term (t) We want to solve the equation for t, so we need to move all terms involving t to one side of the equation and all constants to the other side. In this case, we will add 157 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with t. 88*t - 157 + 157 = 283 + 157 Doing the addition: 88*t = 440 Step 3: Solve for t Now, we need to get t alone on one side of the equation. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 88. 88*t / 88 = 440 / 88 Doing the division: t = 5 The solution of the equation 88*t - 157 = 283 for t is t = 5."},{"instruction":"Given the question: According to an old story, a farmer once found that a bag of corn had been stolen from his house.

He then said, \\"Come before me again tomorrow. I shall then know which of you is the thief because the stick given to the thief will be one inch longer than the others.\\" The thief was afraid of being found out, and so he cut an inch off his stick.

Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers. Q: Why is the sky blue? A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits \\"raised area\\" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime? A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us. Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter? A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months. The sky looks blue mainly because the color blue in the sunlight _ . A) has the longest wavelength among all the colors B) cannot be taken in by the gas molecules C) doesn't hit \\"raised area\\" in the atmosphere D) cannot pass through space successfully A:","output":"B) cannot be taken in by the gas molecules"},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: \\"So, Jenny tells me jury selection is going well,\\" said Buford, puffing small billows of Cuban cigar smoke into the phone with each syllable. \\"Yes, I think so too.\\" Kyle was speeding down FM-2208 in his new Lexus SC 430, headed toward Coreyville.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is when water rich in minerals, such as rainwater or water from an underground source, comes into contact with the rock below the surface. This water can seep into existing cracks, fractures, or pores within the rock. Over time, the minerals in the water chemically react with the minerals in the rock, gradually dissolving and eroding parts of the rock surface. This process of dissolution and erosion is called weathering. As this continues over a long period of time, a small opening forms within the rock, which eventually leads to the formation of a cave. As more water flows through the cave, the space within the rock continues to expand, eventually forming a cavern."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Certainly, he cares only about his work, its realisation - and sod the consequences.

It contains an iridescent shimmer that seems to dance and change colors as he moves his flashlight across its surface, creating an elusive and otherworldly effect. Intrigued by this unusual finding, the man decides that perhaps he should take a sample of the material for further study and, if possible, identify its true composition. He searches his backpack for a small chisel, and upon retrieving one, gingerly taps the metal with it. To his surprise, the chisel seems to have no effect on the material. Even more baffling is that the metal seems to emit a faint humming noise as he attempts to take a piece off. Undeterred and even more curious than before, the man decides to give it one last try with a more forceful approach. With a firm grip on the chisel, the man strikes the metal with much more force - but just as before, the metal remains unharmed. In fact, the humming noise grows louder with each blow, until it reaches a level where the man can feel it vibrating in his very bones. Panic creeping in, he ceases his efforts and steps back to consider what he has found. As the vibrations and humming die down, the man can't help but feel as though the metal is almost sentient, responding in some way to his actions. He decides to leave the warehouse, feeling overwhelmed and somehow threatened by his discovery. As he exits the warehouse doors, the man notices a previously unseen inscription on the slab of metal, written in a language he cannot recognize but bearing an oddly familiar structure. Despite being unable to comprehend its meaning, the man can't shake the feeling that he was meant to find the large piece of metal, and that perhaps it holds untold secrets and stories, waiting to be revealed under the right circumstances. In the passing days and weeks, the man can't stop thinking about his discovery, his mind constantly returning to the strange slab of metal and its unearthly qualities. Yearning for answers and driven by his unceasing curiosity, he begins to research the warehouse's history and learns about forgotten experiments and strange occurrences that had taken place there, as well as the warehouse being connected to a renowned scientist who mysteriously vanished years ago. Haunted by his findings and feeling compelled to unravel the mysteries surrounding the large piece of metal, the man embarks on a journey that will lead him to the very depths of human knowledge and understanding. The secrets he uncovers will shake the world around him, altering his perception of reality as he delves deeper into the unknown."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"The answer to why there was so little assimilation of Jews in central and eastern Europe for so long would seem to lie in part in the probability that the alien surroundings in central and eastern Europe were not conducive, though contempt did not prevent some assimilation.

The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic. - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs. - The National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) was the first organization governing American baseball. The first convention of sixteen New York City area clubs in 1857 practically terminated the Knickerbocker era, when that club privately deliberated on the rules of the game. The last convention, with hundreds of members represented only via state associations, provoked the establishment of separate professional and amateur associations in 1871. The succeeding National Association of Professional Base Ball Players is considered the first professional sports league; through 1875 it governed professional baseball and practically set playing rules for all. Because the amateur successor never attracted many members and it convened only a few times, the NABBP is sometimes called \\"the amateur Association\\" in contrast to its professional successor. - A professional is a member of a profession or any person who earns their living from a specified professional activity. The term also describes the standards of education and training that prepare members of the profession with the particular knowledge and skills necessary to perform their specific role within that profession. In addition, most professionals are subject to strict codes of conduct, enshrining rigorous ethical and moral obligations. Professional standards of practice and ethics for a particular field are typically agreed upon and maintained through widely recognized professional associations, such as the IEEE. Some definitions of \\"professional\\" limit this term to those professions that serve some important aspect of public interest and the general good of society. - The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), or simply the National Association (NA), was founded in 1871 and continued through the 1875 season. It succeeded and incorporated several professional clubs from the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP); in turn several of its clubs created the succeeding National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\"). - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced. Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a \\"title\\". - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. - The Mutual Base Ball Club of New York was a leading American baseball club almost throughout its 20 - year history . It was established during 1857 , the year of the first baseball convention , just too late to be a founding member of the National Association of Base Ball Players . It was a charter member of both the first professional league in 1871 and the National League in 1876 . Failing on the field and in the coffer , it declined to make its last western trip of the inaugural season . For the transgression it was expelled in December , and soon found itself defunct . The Mutual club initially played its home games at Elysian Fields in Hoboken , with the New York Knickerbockers and many other Manhattan clubs , but moved to the enclosed Union Grounds in Brooklyn in 1868 . The Mutuals chose open professionalism in 1869 -- 70 after NABBP liberalization . They joined the first professional league , the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players , for its 1871 to 1875 duration . In 1876 , the Chicago White Stockings initiated the National League and recruited its members from West to East , partly to wrest control of professional baseball from Eastern interests . The Mutuals were one of eight charter members , six of whom were from the National Association . Weak ( sixth place at 21 -- 35 ) and cash - poor , the club refused to complete its playing obligations in the West ; and was expelled . On May 13 , 1876 , the Mutuals executed the first triple play in major - league history in a game against the Hartford Dark Blues . Union Grounds proprietor William Cammeyer , often listed today as the Mutual club owner , signed the Hartford Dark Blues to play at his Union Grounds in 1877 .

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"The third primary color, alongside yellow and red, is blue. In the context provided above, which is related to the sports affiliations and history of Notre Dame University, the primary colors are not directly applicable. However, it is mentioned that the official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush, which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. The color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname, but it is not a primary color itself. To provide a further explanation about primary colors, they are the fundamental colors that cannot be created through the mixture of other colors. In the color theory, there are two major models of primary colors: additive and subtractive. In the additive model, which applies to light, the primary colors are red, green, and blue (RGB). When these colors are combined, they create the secondary colors cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY), and when they are combined at their full intensity, they produce white light. On the other hand, in the subtractive model, which applies to pigments and dyes, the primary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY). When these colors are mixed together, they create the secondary colors red, green, and blue, and when they are combined at their maximum intensity, they produce black. In this pigment context, the primary colors red, yellow, and blue are especially important in artistic context. Going back to the Notre Dame University context, the school's athletic teams' official colors, Navy Blue and Gold Rush, are directly related to the image and brand identity of the institution. These colors, as well as the additional color green, which is associated with the Fighting Irish nickname, not only represent the school's spirit during competitions, but they also help to create a sense of unity and tradition among the Notre Dame community. The mascot, the Notre Dame Leprechaun, adds to this sense of identity and further connects the university's athletic teams with the renowned Fighting Irish moniker."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given two statements.

This term is often used in religious contexts to describe anything that pertains to public worship, rituals, ceremonies, or the prescribed form of public religious worship. In the context you provided, we can see 'liturgical' used in reference to specific vestments. Vestments are liturgical garments and articles associated primarily with the Christian religion, especially among the Eastern Orthodox, Catholics (Western Church and Eastern Churches), Anglicans, Methodists, and Lutherans. Many other groups also make use of liturgical garments; this was a point of contention as Christian denominations diverged from one another. The Geneva gown, alb, chasuble, cassock, and surplice are all examples of liturgical vestments. The Geneva gown, a long, loose-fitting garment, is traditionally black and often used by clergy in Protestant and evangelical churches. However, as stated in the provided context, some movements are looking back to older forms of vestments. The alb and chasuble - The alb, a white tunic reaching to the feet, is typically worn for the sacrifice of the mass. The chasuble, a circular garment worn by celebrants of the Eucharist, is worn over the alb in the Western Church and over the sticharion in the Eastern Church. The cassock and surplice - The cassock is a long, close-fitting garment worn by the clergy in various religious traditions, while the surplice, a loose white linen vestment varying in length, is typically worn over the cassock. All of these vestments represent different avenues of liturgical tradition, harkening back to ancient times and indicative of the rich complexity and diversity within religious practice. A move toward these more 'ancient' forms of garments could be seen as a return to tradition, a quest for a more 'authentic' practice or a way of signifying unity, ecumenism, and continuity with the past. They all play a critical role in the liturgical worship and carry deep symbolic meanings within the religious communities that use them."},{"instruction":"Question: Steve bought 25 worth of groceries.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we'll need to break down the given information step by step and justify our decision for each step. 1. Particles in the environment interact with rocks: This is the initial stage of erosion. If cells release less energy, it does not have a direct effect on particle interaction with rocks. 2. The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks: This is a mechanical process resulting from particle collision against the rocks. Less energy released by the cells does not directly affect this process either. 3. The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks: This process is physical in nature, and the energy released by cells does not seem to have an influence on this step. 4. The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact: The erosion process is primarily driven by physical forces, not energy released by cells. Thus, this step is not affected by the cells releasing less energy. 5. The pieces of the rock are now small rocks: The physical process of breaking rocks into smaller pieces is again not affected by the energy released by cells. 6. The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces: The main erosive forces are the same as earlier, and are not reliant on cellular energy release for the process to occur.

The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance.

Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\" should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and...

In fact, you can exercise your brain as often as you do to your arms or legs-and the results can be positive and empowering. To improve your brain, you can't simply repeat the same exercises over and over. Just as lifting a two-pound weight will stop challenging you, so will repetitive exercises such as crosswords or Sudoku. Once you master easy exercises, you must move on to harder ones in order to push your brain-like your muscles-to a new level. The science behind brain training Scientists once believed that your mental abilities were fixed in adulthood. Since studies have shown just the opposite, millions of people around the world have adopted the new practice of brain training. The most popular of these brain training products is made by the San Francisco-based Lumosity. Lumosity's scientists with an experienced team of game designers have developed a fun,effective online brain training program that measures, tracks, and adapts to your progress, so you'll always be challenged. Promising studies on the effects of brain training In a 2013 Stanford study, a treatment group of 21 breast cancer survivors used 12 weeks of Lumosity training to work on processing speed, mental flexibility, and working memory tasks. On average, those who trained improved on tests of these abilities, compared to a group that did not train with Lumosity. There is even some evidence suggesting that Lumosity may be beneficial to normal, healthy adults. In a 2011 study by Lumosity and San Francisco State University researchers. 13 people who trained over 5 weeks improved working memory scores by 10%and attention scores by 20%. Brain training is designed to meet real-life needs The design of brain train ing is targeted at real-life benefits instead of improving game scores. Better attention, for example, can mean greater focus in the classroom or at an important business... Which skill may brain training not improve? A) Better attention. B) Better writing skills. C) A better memory. D) Higher processing speed. A:","output":"Brain training may not improve B) Better writing skills. While brain training programs like Lumosity are designed to improve cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and processing speed, they may not directly target or significantly improve writing skills. Writing is a complex skill that involves various aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, style, and organization, which might not be addressed by general brain training exercises. To improve writing skills, it is recommended to practice writing regularly, read extensively, study grammar and style guidelines, and seek feedback from others."},{"instruction":"Die Fakten über die Waldbrände in Griechenland und deren Ergebnisse sind bekannt, Herr Präsident, und das steht alles auch in der Entschließung, über die wir hier debattieren und die ich natürlich unterstütze. Translate to English English:","output":"The facts about the forest fires in Greece and their consequences are well-known, Mr. President, and all of this is also included in the resolution we are debating here, which I, of course, support. The forest fires in Greece have been a severe and recurring issue, causing significant environmental, economic, and human losses. These fires often take place during the summer months, when the temperatures are high, and the forests are extremely dry, making them highly susceptible to wildfires. Climate change, human action, and natural causes have contributed to the increasing frequency and intensity of these fires. The consequences of the forest fires in Greece are numerous and far-reaching. Firstly, the environmental impact is evident, as forest fires cause significant damage to the surrounding ecosystems. The loss of vegetation and wildlife habitats leads to disruptions in the natural balance, causing the remaining species to struggle for survival and resources. The fires also contribute to soil degradation, erosion, and increased risk of landslides, as the burned vegetation no longer provides stability to the ground. Secondly, the economic losses caused by the forest fires in Greece are substantial. The damage to infrastructure, businesses, and agricultural land can be significant, affecting local economies. Moreover, the cost of fighting the fires and their repercussion requires huge investments, compelling the government to allocate resources that could otherwise be utilized elsewhere. Additionally, as Greece relies heavily on tourism, these fires negatively impact that industry, as popular tourist destinations are damaged or deemed dangerous, and potential tourists may look for alternative vacation options. Finally, the human aspect cannot be overlooked, as people's lives are disrupted or even lost during these fires. Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and flee danger, leading to temporary or permanent displacement. The emotional and mental strain on those affected by the fires can also be substantial, as most face uncertainty and fear during these trying times. In light of these facts, the resolution mentioned in the question aims to address this critical issue in a comprehensive manner, seeking to prevent future forest fires, restore affected areas, and support those who have been impacted. By supporting this resolution, we can hopefully work towards a solution that lessens the destructiveness of these fires and builds a more resilient and environmentally conscious future for Greece and its citizens."},{"instruction":"This is some data: ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), length, 192000.0 (millimetres); ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), shipBeam, 24.4; ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), country, Argentina. Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","output":"The data provided pertains to a ship named ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), which belongs to the country, Argentina. The vessel has impressive dimensions, demonstrating the significant naval engineering expertise involved in its creation. One measurement disclosed for the ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2) is its length, provided in millimetres to denote precision. Specifically, the ship has a length of 192,000.0 millimetres, or 192 meters when converted. This substantial length suggests that the vessel is potentially a naval or maritime combatant ship; typically, military vessels such as aircraft carriers, destroyers, or cruisers are noted for their long length to incorporate various operational components like weapons systems, engines, and crew accommodation. In addition to the length, information about the vessel's shipBeam is given as well. The ship beam, often referred to as the breadth, is the width of the ship at its widest point. A wider beam often represents enhanced stability in the water, which is crucial in rough seas or during turning manoeuvres. For the ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), the shipBeam is recorded at 24.4 metres, indicating that the ship is not just lengthy but also considerably broad. Lastly, the data includes information about the country the ship belongs to, which is Argentina in this case. This would usually indicate that the vessel is part of that country's naval or maritime fleet. Given the type of vessel and its dimensions, it's likely that it plays a significant role within the Argentinian Navy. To summarize, the data provided gives a descriptive picture of the ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), an Argentinian ship with a length of 192 meters and a beam of 24.4 meters.

A more specific and comprehensive answer would outline the various types of emissions and pollutants that are released when these fossil fuels are combusted. Here is a detailed breakdown of the emissions produced: 1. Carbon Dioxide (CO2): The primary greenhouse gas emitted by burning coal, oil, and natural gas is carbon dioxide. Combustion of these fossil fuels releases CO2 as a byproduct, which contributes to the increase in atmospheric carbon levels and global warming. 2. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2): Burning coal and some petroleum products, particularly those with high sulfur content, releases sulfur dioxide. This pollutant can react with other compounds in the atmosphere to form fine particles and acid rain, both of which negatively impact human health and the environment. 3. Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): Burning fossil fuels also leads to the release of nitrogen oxides, which contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone (a principal component of urban smog), acid rain, and fine particle pollution. 4. Particulate Matter (PM): Combustion of fossil fuels, particularly coal, produces a significant amount of particulate matter – tiny particles suspended in the air that can be inhaled deep into the lungs and cause respiratory problems and other health issues. 5. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): Burning fossil fuels releases a variety of VOCs, which can react with other chemicals in the atmosphere to form harmful pollutants like ozone or contribute to the formation of secondary pollutants like PM. 6. Heavy Metals: Coal, in particular, contains trace amounts of heavy metals like mercury, lead, and arsenic. When burned, these heavy metals can be released into the atmosphere, posing potential threats to both human health and the environment. 7. Other Gases: Combustion of fossil fuels can also release smaller amounts of other pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4). Therefore, it's more accurate to say that burning coal, oil, and natural gas releases various types of pollutants and greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, and other gases, rather than simply stating \\"toxins.\\""},{"instruction":"Data: name = Cocum, eatType = coffee shop, food = Fast food, priceRange = high, customer rating = average, familyFriendly = yes.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects’ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor’s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean. According to the above context, answer the following question.

Determine the number of people counted on the first day. 2. Calculate the total number of people counted on both days. So let's go through these steps: Step 1: Determine the number of people counted on the first day. The problem states that the number of people counted on the first day was twice the total number counted on the second day. We know that the second day had 500 people. To find the number of people on the first day, we multiply the number of people on the second day by 2: First day: 500 people * 2 = 1000 people Step 2: Calculate the total number of people counted on both days. Now that we know the number of people on the first day (1000) and the second day (500), we can find the total number by adding these two numbers: Total number of people on both days: 1000 people (first day) + 500 people (second day) = 1500 people So, a total of 1500 people were counted on the two days."},{"instruction":"Select your answer from the options.

I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband.

But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Amnesty (from the Greek \\"amnestia\\", \\"forgetfulness, passing over\\") is defined as: \\"\\"A pardon extended by the government to a group or class of persons, usually for a political offense; the act of a sovereign power officially forgiving certain classes of persons who are subject to trial but have not yet been convicted.\\"\\" It includes more than pardon, inasmuch as it obliterates all legal remembrance of the offense. Amnesty is more and more used to express \\"freedom\\" and the time when prisoners can go free. - Martial law is the imposition of the highest-ranking military officer as the military governor or as the head of the government, thus removing all power from the previous executive, judicial branches of government. It is usually imposed temporarily when the government or civilian authorities fail to function effectively (e.g., maintain order and security, or provide essential services). - Aleksander Bardini (17 November 1913 30 July 1995) was a Polish-Jewish theatre and opera director, actor, notable professor at the State Theatre School in Warsaw.

The story takes place in the present day during the holiday season, creating a perfect scenario for baking homemade cookies. Step 2: Establishing the character's relationship Ana and Harold are neighbors in the same apartment building, but due to their different work schedules, they rarely interact. One day, when they coincidentally meet in the elevator, they exchange pleasantries and discover that they have a shared love of holiday baking. Step 3: Building conflict Harold has been facing immense work pressure, causing him to lose sight of the simple joys of life. He confides in Ana about his work, and she remembers the therapeutic nature of baking cookies. This inspires her to make cookies for him as a kind gesture to help brighten his mood.

If a smaller electromagnet is needed, it may result in a weaker magnetic field. This is because the size of the electromagnet can directly affect the strength of the magnetic field it produces. When the size of the electromagnet is reduced, the number of wire turns and the amount of electrical current flowing through it may decrease, leading to a weaker magnetic field.

Despite efforts to move on from the scandal, the association with a convicted fraudster continues to taint her image.

This recent acquisition in Manchester indicates a strategic shift in the Blair family's real estate investments. With a £650,000 price tag, the ten apartments appear to be a more promising prospect for the family's property portfolio. Although the Mancunian property comes with the peculiar challenges of a malodorous rubbish dump and a politically unsympathetic tenant, these factors seem to pose fewer obstacles than the lingering fallout from 'Cheriegate.' Attempting to distance herself from the past controversy, Mrs Blair is focusing on improving and expanding the family's property empire. The addition of the Manchester flats brings the total number of homes owned by the Blairs to 18, illustrating their commitment to the real estate market as a primary source of income and investment. As the Blairs navigate the complex world of property investment, they will continue to face both opportunities and challenges.

Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which...

Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \\"consumption\\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests. Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test.... - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible. - The Swedish Social Democratic Party, (SAP; literally, \\"Social Democratic Workers' Party of Sweden\\"), contesting elections as the \\"ArbetarepartietSocialdemokraterna\\" ('The Workers' Party The Social Democrats'), usually referred to just as the 'Social Democrats' (\\"Socialdemokraterna\\"); is the oldest and largest political party in Sweden. The current party leader since 2012 is Stefan Löfven; he has also been Prime Minister of Sweden since 2014. - A diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (LTB), also called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) means a patient is infected with \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\", but the patient does not have active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis can be contagious while latent tuberculosis is not, and it is therefore not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis. The main risk is that approximately 10% of these patients (5% in the first two years after infection and 0.1% per year thereafter) will go on to develop active tuberculosis. This is particularly true, and there is added risk, in particular situations such as medication that suppresses the immune system or advancing age. - Karl Johan ( K.

The army was ordered to deploy to volatile areas to stop further attacks that began about three weeks ago. At least seven people have been killed and 5,000 have been left homeless since the xenophobic violence began. For the latest news, views and analysis see the BBC Africa Live page. The army was also deployed during similar violence in 2008, when at least 63 people were killed. The first deployments were to Alexandra, a poor township north of Johannesburg, where Mozambican Emmanuel Sithole was killed at the weekend. The hostels are communal areas still owned by the government that used to house mine labourers during the days of white-minority rule. The BBC's Nomsa Maseko, who witnessed one raid in Johannesburg's Jeppestown, says they are often the target of raids when the police are looking for firearms during a crackdown on crime. No weapons were found during the raids overnight, and it is believed there may have been a tip-off, she says. Police say 11 arrests were made for possession of marijuana and suspected stolen items. A helicopter hovered above one hostel in Jeppestown, as inside police moved from floor to floor conducting searches where the residents were made to lie face down in the corridors, the AFP news agency reports. On the streets of the neighbourhood, soldiers stood in groups of about six, positioned within a few metres of each other, it says. Troops have also been despatched to KwaZulu-Natal province, where the unrest began following remarks by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The powerful monarch has denied fuelling the xenophobic attacks, saying at a rally on Monday: \\"If it were true that I said foreigners must go, this country would be up in flames.\\" More than 900 people have been voluntarily repatriated to their home countries since the violence broke out, officials say. Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said the troops were being sent in \\"as the last resort. The army will serve as a deterrent\\".

Burning Man is an annual festival that takes place in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada, USA. It began in 1986 and typically occurs around the end of August or the beginning of September. 3. The Mayflower made its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean over 350 years before Burning Man was ever organized. 4. The Mayflower was decommissioned and likely scrapped in 1624, about 360 years before the first Burning Man festival. As a result, the ship does not exist anymore.

Silent mutations are a specific type of point mutation, which occur when a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence is altered. Point mutations can lead to various outcomes, including missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and silent mutations. In silent mutations, the nucleotide substitution does not change the amino acid specified by the codon. This lack of change is due to the redundancy or degeneracy of the genetic code, where multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. Out of the 64 codons, 61 code for amino acids, while the remaining three serve as stop codons. For example, consider a triplet of DNA bases such as AAG, which codes for the amino acid lysine. If the third base changes from G to A, the codon is still recognized as encoding lysine (AAA). This is because multiple codons (AAG and AAA) can code for the same amino acid – in this case, lysine. Since the resulting protein remains unchanged despite the mutation, the mutation’s impact on protein synthesis is negligible. Silent mutations are considered neutral, as they typically do not cause an observable change in the phenotype of the organism and do not affect the overall function of the protein. However, it is important to note that in some instances, silent mutations may still alter the protein synthesis rate or splicing efficiency leading to subtle effects on protein function or regulation. But generally, it is safe to say that silent mutations do not produce significant effects on protein synthesis and overall organism fitness."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Each year, we celebrate many holidays here in America.

Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences. - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully. - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas. - A Singspiel (plural: Singspiele; literally \\"sing-play\\") is a form of German-language music drama, now regarded as a genre of opera. It is characterized by spoken dialogue, which is alternated with ensembles, songs, ballads, and arias which were often strophic, or folk-like. Singspiel plots are generally comic or romantic in nature, and frequently include elements of magic, fantastical creatures, and comically exaggerated characterizations of good and evil. History. Some of the first Singspiele were miracle plays in Germany, where dialogue was interspersed with singing. By the early 17th century, miracle plays had grown profane, the word \\"Singspiel\\" is found in print, and secular Singspiele were also being performed, both in translated borrowings or imitations from English and Italian songs and plays, and in original German creations. - A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art. - Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch. - A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral. - Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter. - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a characterin theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode. - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory. - One Thousand and One Nights (\\"kitb alf layla wa-layla\\") is a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age.

This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Abu Hassan is a comic opera in one act by Carl Maria von Weber to a German libretto by Franz Carl Hiemer , based on a story in One Thousand and One Nights . It was composed between 11 August 1810 and 12 January 1811 and has set numbers with recitative and spoken dialogue . The work is a Singspiel in the then popular Turkish style . - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. - An aria (plural: \\"arie\\" , or \\"arias\\" in common usage, diminutive form arietta or ariette) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work. The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods. - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - An opera house is a theatre building used for opera performances that consists of a stage, an orchestra pit, audience seating, and backstage facilities for costumes and set building. While some venues are constructed specifically for operas, other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers. - A critic is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response. - A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is \\"Middle-Eastern\\" and the derived noun is \\"Middle-Easterner\\". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments. - Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber (18 or 19 November 1786 5 June 1826) was a German composer, conductor, pianist, guitarist and critic, one of the first significant composers of the Romantic school. - Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\"). - A cantata (literally \\"sung\\", past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir. - Recitative (also known by its Italian name \\"recitativo\\") is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech. Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition. - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. What is the relationship between 'abu hassan' and 'operetta'? The answer is:","output":"Abu Hassan is a comic opera in one act by Carl Maria von Weber, and it falls under the larger genre of 'operetta.' An operetta is a light opera, characterized by its music and lighter subject matter. Abu Hassan, with its comic nature and musical elements, is an example of an operetta within the context of opera."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - The Colorado Plateau, also known as the Colorado Plateau Province, is a physiographic region of the Intermontane Plateaus, roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. The province covers an area of 337,000 km (130,000 mi) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, and northern Arizona. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado. Most of the remainder of the plateau is drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries. - Northern Arizona is an unofficial, colloquially-defined region of the U.S. state of Arizona. Generally consisting of Coconino County, Yavapai County, Navajo County, and Apache County, it is geographically dominated by the Colorado Plateau, the southern border of which in Arizona is called the Mogollon Rim. Mohave County, located in the northwest of the state, may or may not be considered part of Northern Arizona, depending on local opinions. - Canyon Diablo ( Navajo : Kin igaaí ) is a canyon north of Two Guns in Northern Arizona . It is located in the Navajo Indian Reservation . The canyon passes 3 miles ( 4.8 km ) west of Meteor Crater . The community of Canyon Diablo , Arizona on the edge of the canyon about 12 miles ( 19 km ) northwest of the crater was the closest community to the crater when scientists began investigating the crater . Consequently , the meteorite that caused the crater is officially called the Canyon Diablo meteorite . Canyon Diablo ( \`\` devil canyon '' ) is the Spanish translation of the Native American name . The 1930 Canyon Diablo highway bridge , once used by U.S. Route 66 to cross the canyon south of the present I - 40 bridges , is on the National Register of Historic Places . The BNSF Canyon Diablo railroad bridge is a well - known railfan site . - The Mogollon Rim (or ) or ) is a topographical and geological feature cutting across the U.S. state of Arizona. It extends approximately , starting in northern Yavapai County and running eastward, ending near the border with New Mexico. It forms the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau in Arizona. - In geography and geology, a cliff is a vertical, or nearly vertical, rock exposure. Cliffs are formed as erosion landforms by the processes of weathering and erosion. Cliffs are common on coasts, in mountainous areas, escarpments and along rivers. Cliffs are usually formed by rock that is resistant to weathering and erosion. Sedimentary rocks most likely to form cliffs include sandstone, limestone, chalk, and dolomite. Igneous rocks such as granite and basalt also often form cliffs. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Arizona (O'odham: \\"Al onak\\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western United States and the Mountain West states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California. - A canyon (Spanish: cañón) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. - An escarpment is a steep slope or long cliff that forms as an effect of faulting or erosion and separates two relatively level areas of differing elevations. Usually \\"escarpment\\" is used interchangeably with scarp (from the Italian \\"scarpa\\", shoe). But some sources differentiate the two terms, where \\"escarpment\\" refers to the margin between two landforms, while \\"scarp\\" is synonymous with a cliff or steep slope. The surface of the steep slope is called a scarp face.This (escarpment) is a ridge which has a gentle(dip) slope on one side and a steep (scarp) slope on the other side.

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. Question: \\"Who were many of the people happy about what the president was saying in his speech about renewing the country's transportation infrastructure?\\" Answer: \\"Democrats\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

Context: The 1982 Bavarian Tennis Championships was a men's Grand Prix tennis circuit tournament held in Munich, West Germany which was played on outdoor clay courts. It was the 66th edition of the tournament and was held form 17 May through 23 May 1982. Gene Mayer won the singles title. Hypothesis: The Bavarian Tennis Championships in 1982 was a men's Grand Prix racing tournament held in Munich. OPTIONS: (I) Yes. (II) It's impossible to say. (III) No.","output":"(III) No. Based on the information provided within the context, the 1982 Bavarian Tennis Championships was a men's Grand Prix tennis circuit tournament, not a Grand Prix racing tournament. The Grand Prix tennis circuit was a professional tennis circuit administered by the International Tennis Professionals from 1970 until the creation of the ATP Tour in 1990. It was an international tour constituted by a group of tournaments that presented themselves with a unified calendar and ranking system. Munich, being the venue of the tournament, is the capital and the most populated city in the German state of Bavaria, which hosts a variety of sporting events across different sports, including tennis. The context clearly indicates the sport being played was tennis, as it further mentions that the event was played on outdoor clay courts - a type of surface commonly used in tennis. In addition, the context also makes it clear that Gene Mayer won the singles title in this tournament. Gene Mayer is a notable figure in the world of tennis and not associated with racing. Therefore, the hypothesis that the Bavarian Tennis Championships of 1982 was a men's Grand Prix racing tournament is not accurate as per the provided context. Misrepresenting a tennis tournament as a racing event could cause confusion as these are entirely different sports with different athletes, rules, and cultural significance. Therefore, it would be incorrect to hypothesize that the 1982 Bavarian Tennis Championships was a Grand Prix racing tournament when all evidence, such as the use of clay courts and the participation of tennis player Gene Mayer, points towards it being a highly important tennis tournament."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog about anything you want.","output":"I will write a dialogue between two friends, Alex and Taylor, who are meeting for a coffee.

It's a 7-inch Tegra 3 tablet running Android Jelly Bean, and it's set to hit Australia in July. Update: Turns out that this leak was spot on. The Google Nexus 7 built by Asus is a reality, with all the specifications listed here revealed days before this morning's I/O keynote by Gizmodo Australia. Check out the Nexus 7 and read how it all unfolded in our live blog. Gizmodo Australia has today viewed a training document detailing exactly what's going to be in the new tablet and how much it's going to cost. As rumoured, Google's going to announce a 7-inch, Nexus-branded tablet called the Nexus 7. According to the leak, it's built by Asus, with a 1.3Ghz quad-core Tegra 3 processor, GeForce 12-core GPU and 1GB of RAM with two different storage variants: 8GB and 16GB. The Nexus tablet will also feature NFC and run Google Wallet (probably only in the US) and Android Beam. The screen is an IPS display with a 178-degree viewing angle, running a resolution of 1280x800. The device will also sport a 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera. The battery will also give you nine hours worth of operation. The 8GB model will set you back US199 and the 16GB will cost US249. No word in the document on local prices. The leaked document also says that the device will be the first to run Jelly Bean, the new version of Android. Details are scarce on Jelly Bean, but the slides tell us that Google will handle operating system updates from now on, which could address the fragmentation problem. We aren't sure if this statement means that Google will handle all handset updates from Jelly Bean onwards, or if it just means it will handle it for the Nexus 7 going forward. Based on the various arrangements with other manufacturers and telcos around the world, it's likely to be the latter. We'll know more come Google I/O. Update: The document says that the Nexus 7 will run Android Jelly Bean, but makes no mention of the version number. We understand that the device will be version stamped with Android 4.1, rather than leaping ahead a generation and stamping it as 5.0. Wired had suggested after spotting a leaked benchmark that this would be the case. Rumours about Google working on a Nexus-branded tablet with Asus have been swirling for a while. Even as far back as May, a report emerged of a super cheap Tegra 3-powered device was coming at the Google I/O developer event, which is now only days away. The first clue was when Asus demonstrated the awesome cheap and wonderfully cheerful Eee Pad MeMO 370T at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, before delaying the unit indefinitely. Since then, rumours about a home-grown tablet from Google have been few and far between, but this is the first time we've seen anything official regarding specs. Apple has already played its announcement cards around iOS 6, Microsoft has announced Surface and Windows Phone 8, and Google risks being left behind without its own bespoke tablet product. June is one hell of a month to be following what's new in tech. Priced at sub-US200, the Google's Nexus 7 will become Amazon's biggest problem post-launch, threatening the market share of the hugely successful Kindle Fire. The Fire runs a highly modified version of the Android operating system and prevents users from wandering outside the customised Amazon environment. The Nexus brand, however, has always been associated with the purest form of the Android operating system Google has to offer, meaning that it's likely going to be a better experience. Google is also banking on the fact that the screen is better than the Fire's, with a higher resolution and 10-point touch capability. Of course, this could all prove to be an elaborate fake. We've seen them before and we'll see them as long as there's a rabid tech-loving public that will queue up around the block for value this good. We'll bring you the news as we hear it about this tablet, and if it really is the Nexus 7, I'm looking forward to this year's Google I/O. Follow Gizmodo Australia on Twitter for further updates. ||||| Computerworld - A 199 Nexus 7 tablet from Google would raise the stakes for Amazon's Kindle Fire and Barnes & Noble's Nook tablet, which sell at a similar price and screen size. But since the 7-in. touchscreen device is reportedly a quad-core tablet with other costly hardware, the Nexus 7 might also in some ways compete with the popular Apple iPad or perhaps the Microsoft Surface tablets unveiled last week. The iPad starts at 499; pricing for the Surface has not yet been announced. To offer high-end features at a low cost with the Nexus 7, Google seems to be acknowledging that the Android strategy of having third-party companies make tablets hasn't worked. And that means Google must take aggressive pricing steps to make up the difference. \\"If Google wants to jump-start the Android tablet market, which has been weak to date, then a low-priced, high-quality device could do that,\\" said Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates. \\"Google certainly has an incentive to make the Android tablet a competitive product in the market, and maybe driven more by wanting to capture a bigger share of the pie, than by supporting its OEMs (Original Equipment Makers).\\" Google could be subsidizing the Nexus 7 to the tune of hundreds of dollars per tablet, some analysts said. Even so, \\"getting revenues is the name of the game for Google, and right now the OEMs are driving very little revenue to them on Android-based tablets,\\" Gold said. The big payback to Google from selling a 199 tablet would come from the sales of apps and the ads that Google sells for its search tool, analysts noted. \\"Considering that the tablet ecosystem war is getting heated now with Microsoft having a bigger role, Google might feel the need for a more aggressive [pricing] strategy,\\" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner. She said that 40 million iPad sales in 2011 at a cost of 499 or more show there's room for Android sales, especially at lower prices. \\"You would think that 40 million would not seem impossible for the combination of all the vendors supporting Android,\\" she said. IDC said iPads accounted for 59% of tablet sales globally in 2011. Among Android tablets, Samsung had 6.3% of the market, and Asus took 2.5%. Amazon had 6.9% of the market with its Android variant and Barnes & Noble had 4.9%. \\"Google has to be more than a little frustrated that the first mainstream hit Android tablet is the Kindle Fire,\\" said Tom Mainelli, an analyst at IDC. \\"Google is desperate to get some market traction for Android tablets and the Google ecosystem that supports them.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"Google's flagship I/O Conference announced the Nexus 7, a 7-inch Tegra 3 tablet running Android Jelly Bean, set to be released in Australia in July.

State District Judge Jean Boyd handed down the terms of Ethan Couch’s 10-year probation for the four intoxication manslaughter counts during a closed hearing. In doing so, she rejected prosecutors’ requests to give Couch jail time on the two intoxication assault counts. Boyd ordered Couch to be placed in a lock-down residential treatment center for an undisclosed amount of time and at his parents’ expense. Couch’s father had offered to foot the bill for a 450,000-a-year treatment center near Newport Beach, Calif., but it was unclear whether that’s where Couch will go. Couch cannot drive, drink alcohol or use drugs during his probation. If he violates the terms, he could be sentenced to up to 10 years behind bars, according to the Tarrant County district attorney’s office. “It is our hope that the attention drawn by this case highlights the dangers associated with driving while intoxicated and will ensure that a tragedy such as this one will never happen again,” prosecutor Riley Shaw said in a prepared statement. Defense attorney Reagan Wynn lauded Boyd for giving Couch probation, saying the judge recognized the possibility that he could be reformed better in a rehab facility that in prison. “We recognize that 16-year-old kids are different from 25-year-old adults,” Wynn said. On June 15, 2013, Couch had been partying at his parent’s second home in Burleson and got behind the wheel with seven people piled into his Ford pickup, authorities said. He swerved off the road, hitting and killing 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had broken down, and three others who had stopped to help: youth pastor Brian Jennings 41, and Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21. Teens Sergio Molina and Solimon Mohmand were riding in the bed of the pickup and were thrown out on impact, authorities said. Molina was left with a severe brain injury and is unable to move or talk. Mohmand suffered broken bones and internal injuries. Authorities said Couch, who was 16 at the time of the crash, had a blood alcohol content of 0.24 — three times the legal limit for an adult — and that he was driving 70 mph in a 40-mph zone. The sentence of probation drew national outrage, as did testimony by a psychologist called by the defense who said Couch suffered from “affluenza.” His family’s wealth and a dysfunctional relationship with his parents had left Couch without a sense of responsibility, the witness said in describing the diagnosis. Wynn said the focus on “affluenza” and the media’s reporting of the case had “so twisted the facts that were actually presented in court that I don’t think the truth will ever be able to come out now.” “It was ridiculous to think that we walked into court and said, ‘Oh, this is a rich white kid,’ and [Boyd] decided to probate him,” Wynn said. Prosecutor Richard Alpert called Wynn’s comments hypocritical, stating that it was Couch’s defense team that had presented the “affluenza” argument. “His witnesses don’t say things by accident,” Alpert said. “So they thought maybe that would help — that’s my interpretation — and it blew up on them. It was a stupid thing to say.” Couch has been in juvenile detention since he was sentenced Dec. 12, KXAS-TV (NBC5) reported. Six civil lawsuits that have been filed against Couch, his parents, Fred and Tonya Couch, and the family’s company, Cleburne Metal Works, have been consolidated and transferred into 96th state District Court, presided over by Judge R.H. Wallace, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Local media including The Dallas Morning News recently filed a request to be given a hearing on whether court proceedings in the Couch case should be open to the public. Boyd denied the request and closed Wednesday’s proceedings to the public and news media. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

(Associated Press) Ethan Couch, center, sits in juvenile court for a hearing about his future Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2014, in Fort Worth, Texas. Judge Jean Boyd again decided to give no jail time for Couch, who was sentenced... (Associated Press) Judge Jean Boyd again decided to give no jail time for Ethan Couch, defense attorney Reagan Wynn and prosecutors told reporters after the hearing, which was closed to the public. Prosecutors had asked Boyd to sentence him to 20 years in state custody on charges related to two people who were severely injured. The sentence stirred fierce debate, as has the testimony of a defense expert who says Couch's wealthy parents coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility. The expert termed the condition \\"affluenza.\\" Wynn and prosecutor Richard Alpert would not identify the facility where Couch will go or where it is located. The teen's family previously had offered to pay for Couch to go to a 450,000-a-year rehabilitation center near Newport Beach, Calif. Couch, who's currently in state custody, is expected to receive alcohol and drug rehab, and could face prison time if he runs away from the facility or violates any other terms of his probation, Alpert said. There is no minimum amount of time Couch must spend in the facility before his release, prosecutor Riley Shaw said. Wynn ripped the media and the public's focus on \\"affluenza\\" and said that his client was misunderstood. He said reporting of the Couch case had \\"so twisted the facts that were actually presented in court that I don't think the truth will ever be able to come out now.\\" \\"It was ridiculous to think that we walked into court and said, 'Oh, this is a rich white kid,' and she decided to probate him,\\" he said. But Alpert accused Wynn of hypocrisy, pointing out that a defense witness made the comment in the first place. \\"His witnesses don't say things by accident,\\" Alpert said. \\"So they thought maybe that would help — that's my interpretation — and it blew up on them. It was a stupid thing to say.\\" Couch's parents did not speak to reporters as they entered the courtroom. Several relatives of Couch's victims also attended Wednesday's hearing. \\"The families feel like the same way they felt the last time they were here,\\" Alpert said. Asking Boyd to give Couch jail time for intoxication assault was a last-ditch effort by prosecutors, who have said they have almost no way to appeal the judge's sentence in the case. Alpert said he hoped the Couch case would lead the Texas Legislature to allow juries to sentence some juvenile defendants. The case has already spurred calls for potential changes. Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who serves as president of the Senate, has asked for a study of sentencing guidelines in intoxication manslaughter cases. But Wynn lauded Boyd for giving Couch probation and recognizing the possibility that he could be reformed better in a rehab facility that in prison. \\"We recognize that 16-year-old kids are different from 25-year-old adults,\\" he said. Couch was 16 at the time of the accident. His blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit for an adult and there were traces of Valium in his system when he lost control of his pickup truck and plowed into a group of people helping a woman whose car had stalled. Seven passengers were riding in Couch's truck. One, Sergio Molina, is paralyzed and can communicate only by blinking. The other, Solimon Mohmand, suffered numerous broken bones and internal injuries. ____ Follow Nomaan Merchant on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/nomaanmerchant. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In 2013, Ethan Couch, a teenager from Texas, caused a drunk driving crash that resulted in the death of four people and injured two others.

In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Quail is a collective name for several genera of mid-sized birds generally placed in the order Galliformes. Old World quail are placed in the family Phasianidae, and New World quail are placed in the family Odontophoridae. The species of buttonquail are named for their superficial resemblance to quail, and form the family Turnicidae in the order Charadriiformes. The king quail, an Old World quail, often is sold in the pet trade, and within this trade is commonly, though mistakenly, referred to as a \\"button quail\\". Many of the common larger species are farm-raised for table food or egg consumption, and are hunted on game farms or in the wild, where they may be released to supplement the wild population, or extend into areas outside their natural range. In 2007, 40 million quail were produced in the U.S. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most Charadriiformes live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), some occupy deserts and a few are found in thick forest. - The Galliformes are an order of heavy-bodied ground-feeding birds that includes turkey, grouse, chicken, New World quail and Old World quail, ptarmigan, partridge, pheasant, junglefowl and the Cracidae. The name derives from \\"gallus\\", Latin for \\"cock\\" or \\"rooster\\". Common names are gamefowl or gamebirds, landfowl, gallinaceous birds, or galliforms. \\"Wildfowl\\" or just \\"fowl\\" are also often used for the Galliformes, but usually these terms also refer to waterfowl (Anseriformes), and occasionally to other commonly hunted birds. This group has about 290 species, one or more of which are found in essentially every part of the world's continents (except for the innermost deserts and perpetual ice). They are rarer on islands, and in contrast to the closely related waterfowl, are essentially absent from oceanic islandsunless introduced there by humans. Several species have been domesticated during their long and extensive relationships with humans. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - The king quail (\\"Excalfactoria chinensis\\"), also known as the blue-breasted quail, Asian blue quail, button quail, Chinese painted quail, or Chung-Chi, is a species of Old World quail in the family Phasianidae. This species is the smallest \\"true quail\\" and is quite common in aviculture worldwide. In the wild they range from southeastern Asia to Oceania with 10 different subspecies. - Coturnix is a genus of eight extant species and two known extinct species of Old World quail . They are related to the francolins , jungle bush quail , snowcocks and rock partridges . Species of Coturnix and the aforementioned genera belong to their own monophyletic clade , Coturnicinae , a subfamily within the family Phasianidae . Some authors consider this clade , together with a sibling assemblage , the Gallininae ( including the junglefowl , long - billed partridge and Chinese bamboo partridge ) warrants classification in its own family , Coturnigallusinidae . Quail of Coturnix live in pairs or small social groups and form larger groups during migration . Not all species migrate , but most are capable of extremely rapid , upward flight to escape from danger . Unlike related genera , Old World quail do not perch in trees . They devote much of their time to scratching and foraging for seeds and invertebrates on the ground . Typical habitats are dense vegetation such as grasslands , bushes alongside rivers and cereal fields . They are predated upon heavily by the diurnal hawks . - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Buttonquail or hemipodes are members of a small family of birds, Turnicidae, which resemble, but are unrelated to, the quails of Phasianidae. They inhabit warm grasslands in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia. There are 16 species in two genera, with most species being found in the genus \\"Turnix\\" and only one being found in the genus \\"Ortyxelos\\". - The New World quails or Odontophoridae are small birds only distantly related to the Old World quail, but named for their similar appearance and habits. The American species are in their own family Odontophoridae, whereas Old World quail are in the pheasant family Phasianidae. The family ranges from Canada through to southern Brazil, and two species, the California quail and the bobwhite quail, have been successfully introduced to New Zealand. The stone partridge and Nahan's partridge, both found in Africa, seem to belong to the family. Species are found across a variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to deserts, although few species are capable of surviving at very low temperatures. Thirty-four species are placed in ten genera. - The Phasianidae are a family of heavy, groundliving birds which includes pheasants, partridges, junglefowl, chickens, Old World quail, and peafowl. The family includes many of the most popular gamebirds. The family is a large one, and is occasionally broken up into two subfamilies, the Phasianinae, and the Perdicinae. Sometimes, additional families and birds are treated as part of this family. For example, the American Ornithologists' Union includes Tetraonidae (grouse), Numididae (guineafowl), and Meleagrididae (turkeys) as subfamilies in Phasianidae. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life.

The Egyptian Archaeological Mission working at... (Associated Press) SAQQARA, Egypt (AP) — Egypt on Saturday announced the discovery of a private tomb belonging to a senior official from the 5th dynasty of the pharaohs, which ruled roughly 4,400 years ago. Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani announced the find at the site of the tomb in Saqqara, just west of Cairo, which is also home to the famed Step Pyramid. He said drawings on the tomb's walls were \\"exceptionally well-preserved.\\" The drawings depicted the official and his family, he added. The tomb also contained a total of 45 statues carved in rock. Again, they depict the official and his family. In recent years, Egypt has heavily promoted new archaeological finds to international media and diplomats in the hope of attracting more tourists to the country. The vital tourism sector has suffered from the years of political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak. ||||| A 4,400-year-old tomb constructed for a \\"divine inspector\\" named \\"Wahtye\\" and holding at least 55 statues has been discovered at Saqqara in Egypt, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced this morning (Dec 15). The tomb is \\"exceptionally well preserved and [colorful] with sculptures inside,\\" Egyptian antiquities minister Khaled El-Enany said at the press conference. Beneath the tomb, archaeologists found five hidden shafts, one of which, they said, could hold Wahtye's sarcophagus. Wahtye was a high-ranking priest who carried the title of divine inspector, said Mostafa Waziri, the general secretary of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities who led the Egyptian team that discovered the tomb. Wahtye worked for a pharaoh named Neferirkare (reign ca. 2446–2438 B.C.), Waziri said. [See Photos of the Divine Inspector's Tomb at Saqqara] Neferirkare's pyramid is about 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) north of Saqqara at a site called Abusir. The tomb contains two levels with 24 statues on the upper level and 31 statues on the lower level, Waziri said. Most, if not all, of the statues, show humans or deities, with some appearing life-size and others appearing to be less than about 3 feet (1 meter) tall. The hieroglyphs discovered in the tomb often mention Wahtye's mother \\"Merit Meen,\\" a name that means \\"the lover of the god Min, the god of fertility in ancient times,\\" Waziri said. The hieroglyphs also mention Wahtye's wife \\"Nin Winit Ptah,\\" a name that means \\"the greatest of the god Ptah,\\" Waziri said. Ptah was a creator god associated with Memphis, an ancient Egyptian capital near Saqqara. This painting found in the tomb also appears to show Wahtye and his wife Nin Winit Ptah Credit: Photo courtesy Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities The tomb also contains numerous paintings, their colors still preserved despite the passage of millennia of time. The paintings show Egyptians engaged in a variety of activities, including cooking, drinking and construction work. [Photos: Ancient Egyptian General's Tomb Discovered in Saqqara] The team will start excavating the five shafts on Dec. 17, said Waziri, adding that he believes one of the shafts will lead to the sarcophagus of Wahtye and artifacts buried with him. Several other discoveries have been made this year at Saqqara. They include a 3,300-year-old tomb of a high general, a burial ground containing a 2,500-year-old mummy wearing a silver face mask gilded with gold and a tomb complex that has over 100 cat statues. Originally published on Live Science. ||||| SAQQARA, Egypt (Reuters) - Egypt unveiled a well-preserved 4,400-year-old tomb decorated with hieroglyphs and statues south of Cairo on Saturday, and officials expect more discoveries when archaeologists excavate the site further in coming months. The tomb was found in a buried ridge at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara. It was untouched and unlooted, Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters at the site. He described the find as “one of a kind in the last decades”. The tomb dates from the rule of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Archaeologists removed a last layer of debris from the tomb on Thursday and found five shafts inside, Waziri said. One of the shafts was unsealed with nothing inside, but the other four were sealed. They are expecting to make discoveries when they excavate those shafts starting on Sunday, he said. He was hopeful about one shaft in particular. “I can imagine that all of the objects can be found in this area,” he said, pointing at one of the sealed shafts. “This shaft should lead to a coffin or a sarcophagus of the owner of the tomb.” The tomb is 10 metres (33 ft) long, three metres (9.8 ft) wide and just under three metres high, Waziri said. The walls are decorated with hieroglyphs and statues of pharaohs. Waziri said the tomb was unique because of the statues and its near perfect condition. “The colour is almost intact even though the tomb is almost 4,400 years old,” he said. The tomb lies in a buried ridge that has only partially been uncovered. Waziri said he expects more discoveries to be made there when archaeologists start more excavation work in January. The Fifth Dynasty ruled Egypt from about 2,500 BC to 2,350 BC, not long after the great pyramid of Giza was built. Saqqara served as the necropolis for Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt for more than two millennia.

Egyptian officials made the announcement Saturday at the site of the discovery in Saqqara, outside of Cairo, according to multiple media reports. Photographs of the tomb show a narrow doorway leading to a rectangular room, its walls covered with carved symbols, images and human forms. Particularly striking are their well-preserved colors – light yellows, rich blues and a reddish-brown skin tone. \\"The color is almost intact even though the tomb is almost 4,400 years old,\\" said Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, according to Reuters.

The news site Egypt Today reports that the site honors Wahtye, a purification priest.

Another Fifth Dynasty tomb, one that belonged to Hetpet, a priestess to the goddess of fertility Hathor, was revealed in February. And last month, Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of 100 wooden feline statues and dozens of mummified cats. This latest tomb was uncovered on Thursday, Reuters reports, and still contains a number of sealed shafts that could lead to sarcophagi or other archaeological treasures. Excavation of those openings will begin Sunday. ||||| Summary:","output":"Archaeologists have discovered a 4,400-year-old tomb at the ancient necropolis of Saqqara in Egypt.

The truth value of this statement depends on whether such a situation is truly occurring or not. Depending on the context in which this statement is made, the truth value can be either true or false. 2. \\"The girl is playing with her doll\\": This statement portrays a distinct and unrelated situation where a girl is playing with her doll. Similar to the previous statement, the truth value of this statement depends on the context and whether such a situation is indeed happening. As an AI assistant, I can only provide a distinction between the two statements with the provided information. I cannot determine the truth value of either statement without any context or knowledge of the actual situations taking place. Now, if the question is asking whether both of these statements can be true at the same time, the answer is yes. It is possible for two men to be giving another a haircut while a girl is playing with her doll concurrently. However, both statements are independent of each other and the truth value for each statement still depends on whether those respective situations are occurring. In conclusion, the relationship between these two statements is independent, and the truth value of one statement does not necessarily determine the truth value of the other. The truth value of each statement depends on whether the respective situations are actually happening or not. If the question is asking if both statements can be true simultaneously, the answer is yes; but this still does not create a relationship or dependency between the two statements."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Brisbane for the following movie plot: Madeline Rose \\"Maddy\\" Phillips (Kristen Stewart) is a 12-year-old girl who loves to climb.

Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies.

The H-2A visa program is a non-immigrant visa program in the United States that allows agricultural employers to hire foreign workers temporarily for agricultural jobs when there is a shortage of U.S. workers. The H-2A program serves as a vital source of labor for the agricultural sector, providing an essential workforce for certain peak planting and harvesting times when demand for labor cannot be met by the domestic labor market. Under the H-2A program, the United States Department of Labor requires employers to provide certain minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions to foreign agricultural workers in order to participate in the program. These protections exist to prevent the exploitation of foreign workers and to ensure that the employment of foreign workers does not adversely impact the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed. Some of the key benefits, wages, and working conditions mandated for H-2A workers include: 1. Wages: Employers must offer H-2A workers a wage that is the highest of the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR), the prevailing hourly wage rate, the prevailing piece rate, or the federal or state minimum wage. 2. Housing: Employers must provide H-2A workers with free housing that meets federal safety and health standards. 3. Transportation: Employers are required to provide transportation to and from the worker's home country or country of last residence under certain conditions, as well as daily transportation between the provided housing and the worksite. 4. Meals: Employers must provide H-2A workers with three meals a day or furnish free and convenient cooking facilities. 5. Work contract: The job order or contract for an H-2A worker must specify the terms and conditions of employment, ensuring all parties have a clear understanding of the job requirements, wages, and benefits. 6. Workers' compensation insurance: Employers are required to provide H-2A workers with workers' compensation insurance coverage in accordance with state laws. 7. Guarantee of minimum work hours: Employers must provide the H-2A worker with a guarantee of at least 75% of the total work hours for the contract period to ensure that the worker receives sufficient work. 8. No discrimination: H-2A workers are protected under U.S. labor laws, which prohibit discrimination based on nationality, race, color, religion, sex, age, or disability. 9. Limited deductions from wages: Employers can only make certain authorized deductions from an H-2A worker's wages as required by law or specified in the work contract. In summary, the hypothesis \\"H-2A workers have to be given certain benefits\\" is true, as the H-2A program mandates certain minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions for foreign agricultural workers employed in the United States. These protections are designed to ensure fair treatment of foreign workers, prevent their exploitation, and protect domestic labor standards."},{"instruction":"Q:Given the following context: Brougham Castle (pronounced ) is a medieval building about 2 miles (3.2 km) south-east of Penrith, Cumbria, England. The castle was founded by Robert I de Vieuxpont in the early 13th century. The site, near the confluence of the rivers, Eamont and Lowther, had been chosen by the Romans for a Roman fort called Brocavum. The castle is scheduled as an Ancient Monument, along with the fort, as \\"Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle\\".In its earliest form, the castle consisted of a stone keep, with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only lords in the region who were loyal to King John. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in North West England, who also owned the castles of Appleby and Brough. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by Henry III. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the Clifford family through marriage. With the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence, in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. Robert's son, Roger Clifford, was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King Edward II of England, although they were returned once his son Edward III became king. The region was often at risk from the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who hosted King Edward I at a castle? A:","output":"The full name of the person who hosted King Edward I at Brougham Castle is Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford."},{"instruction":"Where would you find a toy soldier that is being played with?

Hypothesis: The statistics say men get pregnant more than women actually do. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. These are two separate statements addressing different aspects of the topic. Let us break down each statement for better understanding. Premise: \\"How many teen-age girls are getting pregnant in the first place?\\" This statement is asking for a statistical number or the prevalence of teen pregnancy. It is concerned with understanding the rate at which adolescent girls become pregnant. This issue can be important for various reasons, such as implications for public health, education, and socio-economic factors. Answers to this statement would involve gathering data on the number of teenage pregnancies worldwide or within specific regions. Hypothesis: \\"The statistics say men get pregnant more than women actually do.\\" This statement is a hypothesis making an unusual claim that men experience pregnancy more than women. It is important to note, however, that biologically, males cannot get pregnant. Pregnancy occurs in females, particularly those assigned female at birth, as they possess the reproductive system required to conceive, carry, and give birth to a child. This hypothesis appears to be either a misinterpretation or a misconceived notion. The relationship between the premise and hypothesis, therefore, is that both statements are discussing the topic of pregnancy. However, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis presented is not a correct claim, and it does not follow from the initial question regarding the frequency of teenage pregnancies. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, there needs to be a logical connection between the two, which does not exist in this case."},{"instruction":"Can you suggest a reputed US based SEO services company (not SEO tools / software) with an affiliate program I can signup for?

Question: suppose more fossil fuel pollution happens, how will it affect more visible prey. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"As an AI assistant, I will provide a detailed and long answer to the given question. The question focuses on the impact of increased fossil fuel pollution on more visible prey, and how the supposed perturbation influences the second effect mentioned, which is animals living in the forest having fewer places to hide. To answer this question, we must understand the broader environmental effects of fossil fuel pollution and how these can contribute to changing ecosystems and the subsequent implications for prey species. Fossil fuel pollution is caused by the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas, all of which release greenhouse gases – primarily carbon dioxide – into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to increased global temperatures – a phenomenon known as global warming or climate change. In addition to causing a rise in temperature, the burning of fossil fuels also releases harmful pollution in the form of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and other toxic compounds. The increased fossil fuel pollution will have several consequences for prey species, particularly when considering the previously mentioned environmental effects: 1. Habitat Loss: As global temperatures continue to rise, ecosystems around the world are experiencing significant shifts – causing disturbances in habitat structure, plant composition, and food availability. For more visible prey species, this is likely to result in a loss of hiding places, making them more vulnerable to predation. The increased pollution, coupled with the effects of climate change, may lead to further habitat loss, exacerbating the problem. 2. Shifts in Prey-Predator Interactions: Increases in fossil fuel pollution will indirectly alter the competition dynamics between prey and predator species by disrupting the delicate balance within ecosystems. As habitats change, prey may become more visible and less capable of avoiding detection and predation. Furthermore, predators may become more efficient at catching prey as their populations adjust to the changing environment, leading to a potential decrease in prey populations. 3. Changes to Prey Behavior: Changes in ecosystems driven by increased pollution and the resulting habitat loss may force prey species to adapt their behavior in order to survive. This could include searching for new hiding places, becoming more active during different times of the day, or even migrating to find more suitable habitats. While some species may successfully adapt to these changes, others may struggle, leading to declines in their populations. Now, to directly address the question of how the supposed perturbation – an increase in fossil fuel pollution – influences the second effect mentioned, which is animals having fewer places to hide: The increase in fossil fuel pollution will likely exacerbate the second effect mentioned by contributing to further habitat loss, destruction, and degradation. This increased degradation of forests, as well as changes in natural ecosystems, will mean that the animals will indeed have fewer places to hide, leading to a heightened vulnerability to predation. Additionally, the direct toxic effects of pollution on flora and fauna will further reduce the available hiding places, as increased pollution may lead to the death of vegetation or other structures that animals rely on for cover. In conclusion, the increased fossil fuel pollution will exert a greater effect on more visible prey by making them even more vulnerable to predation due to habitat loss, changes in prey-predator interactions, and behavioral adjustments. The supposed perturbation will exacerbate the second effect mentioned – fewer hiding places for animals – by contributing to further habitat degradation, vegetation loss, and alterations in ecosystem balance. Overall, this will have a potentially negative impact on prey populations and could cause a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, affecting both prey and predator populations."},{"instruction":"Sie ermöglichen die bessere Planung von Bestellungen und Lieferungen, effektivere Lagerhaltung und beschleunigen den Warenverkehr.

On July 8, 2011, Atlantis lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A in Florida. This historic mission marked the 135th and last flight of NASA's Space Shuttle Program, which began in 1981 with the launch of Space Shuttle Columbia. The primary objectives of STS-135 were to deliver critical supplies and spare equipment to the ISS, as well as to return a malfunctioning ammonia pump module for analysis. The mission was crucial to ensure the ISS had sufficient stock of supplies to last through 2012 as commercial resupply missions were still ramping up at that time. The crew of STS-135 consisted of four experienced astronauts: Commander Christopher Ferguson, Pilot Douglas Hurley, and Mission Specialists Sandra Magnus and Rex Walheim. This smaller-than-usual crew size allowed for increased cargo capacity in the shuttle's mid-deck to account for the increased supplies being transported to the ISS. Atlantis carried the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) named \\"Raffaello,\\" which was filled with over 9,400 pounds of supplies, including food, water, clothing, science equipment, and spare parts. Upon arriving at the ISS on July 10, the MPLM was attached to the space station's Harmony module using Canadarm2, the robotic arm on the ISS. The crew then spent several days transferring the supplies from Raffaello to the station before reloading the module with cargo to be returned to Earth. One of the key components delivered during the mission was the Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) payload. Developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the RRM aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of refueling satellites robotically in orbit. This technology could potentially extend the operational life of satellites and reduce the number of space debris-producing events. On July 19, after successfully finalizing their work at the ISS, the Atlantis crew bid farewell to the space station's occupants, and the hatch between Atlantis and the ISS was closed. The following day, the space shuttle undocked from the ISS and began its two-day journey back to Earth. On July 21, 2011, Atlantis made its final landing at the Kennedy Space Center, concluding the STS-135 mission and bringing an end to the Space Shuttle Program era. The shuttle's retirement marked the beginning of a new era in space exploration, with the focus shifting towards a combination of private enterprises and international collaboration to continue human presence in space and pursue deep space exploration. Atlantis is now displayed at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex as a testament to the achievements and legacy of NASA's Space Shuttle Program."},{"instruction":"This question has options.

According to a poll by research consultancy ComRes, released on the first anniversary of the Games, 69% of participants said it was a good investment of public money. But only 22% of the public feel the Games have had a positive impact on the local economy in their area, with 67% saying the Olympics had no impact at all. Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said there was an obvious boost to UK economic growth during the Games but it was too early to see a legacy benefit. He told CNN: \\"I think there are question marks over whether the Â£10 billion of public money spent on the games could have been better used... for example infrastructure projects such as transport, that could have yielded a higher economic return.\\" In the second-quarter of 2013, the U.K. grew by 0.6% -- double the rate of expansion for the first three months of the year -- suggesting Europe's third-largest economy is on track for a recovery. Tombs said the figures also showed growth in all areas of the economy, which he noted was was a first in recent years. The UK contracted for five consecutive quarters from the second quarter of 2008, and failed to grow for another nine months in late 2011 and early 2012 as the eurozone debt crisis raged. Although the cultural heritage of the Olympics is important, it could take years before we see its true economic value, according to Tombs. He said: \\"You often fail to see a boost in tourism for the years after the Games and obviously it's very hard to reuse the facilities that have been built.\\" Director of Economics at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Mark Ambler, said the benefits may not be evident for at least another 10 years. He told CNN: \\"On this basis, the evidence I have been involved in generating and that I have seen from others suggests strongly that the UK will get a good return on its investment, although I think important parts of it are still to come.\\" Investment boost. On Thursday, Mayor of London Boris Johnson said that the success of the Olympics and Paralympics has spurred investment in the U.K capital. Speaking at a press conference, he said: \\"Remember the fate of the Olympo-sceptics is all I would say to anyone tempted to doubt the legacy.\\" But according to Matthew Jaffa, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, not enough is being done in the wake of the Olympics to promote \\"Brand London\\" as an exporter. He added: \\"The Games have had more of an impact on London than the rest of the UK. 55% of the companies that won contracts, directly related to the Olympics, saw growth within the turnover of their business, which is positive.\\" Despite skepticism from some quarters of the business community, the ComRes poll -- which surveyed over 3,200 people -- also showed that nearly three-quarters of Britons would welcome the Olympic Games back given the opportunity. Andrew Simms, political economist and and co-author of the book 'London 2012 - How Was it For Us?' said the Games were \\"a triumph of public endeavour... it's a very good example of what a very dynamic and focused public sector can do.\\" Highlights:","output":"A lot of people in Britain, about 69%, think that spending money on the London Olympics was a good idea.

Research the origin and historical context of gun-free zones 2. Identify key legislation or events that established gun-free zones 3. Provide a concise answer based on the gathered information Step 1: Research the origin and historical context of gun-free zones I'll start by researching the concept of gun-free zones to understand their origins and the historical context. Step 2: Identify key legislation or events that established gun-free zones After researching the topic, I've found a significant piece of legislation in the United States, the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. This federal act targeted schools specifically and made it illegal to possess a firearm within 1,000 feet of the grounds of a primary or secondary school in the United States. The concept of gun-free zones can also be traced back to earlier policies, such as those in certain private establishments or workplaces that disallowed firearms beginning in the latter half of the 20th century. These policies were often implemented for public safety or liability reasons. Step 3: Provide a concise answer based on the gathered information Gun-free zones began to gain prominence in the United States in the latter half of the 20th century, with significant legislation such as the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990.

Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1). However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it. Output:","output":"What is unique about the title given to the third movement of Chopin's Sonata No. 2 compared to his other works?"},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: ground, kid, skateboard","output":"A kid is happily riding their skateboard on the ground, moving smoothly and having lots of fun."},{"instruction":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end): The 1990 European Cup Winners' Cup Final was a football match contested between Sampdoria of Italy and Anderlecht of Belgium.

The question is the last sentence in the input. These stories can be difficult due to their length and how each story has at least one of the three following scenarios: the first is when the individual's belief matches reality, the second is when the individual's belief does not match reality, and the third is when an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. The question will ask about the location of an object in the story with respect to either none or one of the three scenarios. Note that there are distractor sentences in each story that are unrelated to the question and are designed to confuse the reader. Problem:Evelyn entered the pantry. Mason entered the pantry. The celery is in the blue_cupboard. Mason exited the pantry. Evelyn moved the celery to the red_cupboard. Evelyn is in the pantry. Mason entered the pantry. The celery is in the red_cupboard.

Identify the story, the involved actions, and the individuals. 2. Interpret the question in the context of the story. 3. Check the scenarios: matching beliefs and reality, mismatching beliefs and reality, and false beliefs about others' beliefs. 4. Use the guidelines and the information in the story to answer the question. 5. Avoid falling for distractor sentences. Story analysis: - Individuals: Evelyn, Mason, William, and Ethan. - Objects: celery, green_pepper, and peach. - Events: movements of objects and people. Question interpretation: - Where does William think that Ethan searches for the peach? Step by step solution: 1. Focus on movements and beliefs concerning the peach: - The peach is originally in the red_bucket. - Ethan enters the living room. - William moves the peach to the blue_envelope. - The question asks about William's belief on Ethan's search for the peach. 2. Check the scenarios: - Since Ethan didn't witness William moving the peach, Ethan's belief does not match reality. - The question focuses on William's belief about Ethan's belief, making it the third scenario (false belief about others' beliefs). 3. Answer the question using the story information: - When Ethan entered the living room, the peach was still in the red_bucket. - So, William might think that Ethan would search for the peach in red_bucket, which was its original location. Conclusion: William thinks that Ethan searches for the peach in the red_bucket."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.
