Plot title: Bad Kids Go to Hell Movie plot: A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Megans inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before its found. Getting the internet to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by a General, Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school.

Apple today updated its homepage with an announcement teasing a major iTunes-related announcement to be made tomorrow at 10:00 AM Eastern time.      Tomorrow is just another day.      That you'll never forget.            Check back here tomorrow for an exciting announcement from iTunes.      There have been no specific hints as to what the announcement might entail, but Apple has of course long been rumored to be moving to a cloud-based iTunes where users' music would be stored on Apple's servers and streamed to a variety of Internet-connected devices. Apple has also been rumored to be working on a subscription-based music service that would complement the existing pay-per-download service.Either of those services could be supported by Apple's massive new data center in North Carolina that is set to go online by the end of the year. ||||| Could Tuesday be the day Apple (AAPL) lights up on its billion-dollar server farm in North Carolina, launching its entry into cloud computing? That's what the big tease that appeared on the front page of Apple.com Monday morning suggests. [UPDATE: See One more time: The Beatles on iTunes? and Behind the Beatles-iTunes deal.]      Among the threads that seem to be coming together this week:      The 500,000-square-foot data center in Maiden, N.C. -- nearly five times the size of Apple's giant data center in Newark, Calif. -- which COO Tim Cook has said is on track to open this year and could very well be ready to go this week.      Apple's purchase last December of Lala's streaming music service, which it shuttered five months later, presumably to replace it with a streaming version of iTunes.      The high-quality live web-streams of Steve Jobs' last two performances, suggesting that Apple may have developed the capability of streaming video as well as audio.      The latest version of iCal, which replaces locally stored data with calendars stored on Apple's servers.      The launch of the new MacBook Airs, which Jobs described as the shape of notebook computers to come. Their relatively small storage capacity (starting at 64 GB) suggests that in the future, Apple may expect users to store their files in the cloud, rather than on their hard drives.      The latest iteration of Apple TV, which replaces hard-drive storage with streaming video.      In a note to clients issued Monday morning, Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster had this to say about the \\"online iTunes-related event\\" scheduled for 10 a.m. EST (7 a.m. PST):      \\"We believe Apple could announce a cloud-based iTunes service for content streaming to connected devices. Apple is developing a data center in Maiden, NC that we believe could serve as the hub for such a service. The company has indicated that the data center is on track to be completed by the end of CY10 and it will begin using it then. With Apple's growing family of connected devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, and Macs) it only makes sense that Apple would deliver a cloud-based media service to leverage its competitive advantage in the space: devices. As part of this, the new Apple TV with limited storage, a lower price, and a focus on accessing content over the internet would fit in nicely. We see this device, and the potential iTunes cloud-based service, as a stepping stone for an all-in-one, connected Apple television.\\" See also:      [Follow Philip Elmer-DeWitt on Twitter @philiped] ||||| Apple has posted a cryptic message on its Web site, teasing the world about an “exciting” iTunes announcement that’s coming tomorrow. What could it be? I saw that someone had suggested The Beatles were finally coming to iTunes, but really, who cares? If you want The Beatles on your iPhone you can grab the newly remastered albums that came out last year, “rip, mix, burn,” then off you go. Not very exciting, no. What could be exciting, though, is a streaming music service. In an instant, Apple would have killed the MP3 once and for all. You hear that? That’s the sound of the RIAA thanking Apple over and over again.      A streaming music service would make all kinds of sense for Apple, and it wouldn’t be too bad for us consumers either. Streaming services have already seen much success, chiefly with Spotify in Europe and Rdio here in the U.S. But an iTunes Streaming service, probably given a slick name like “iTunes Stream,” would instantly take the idea of streaming from something only techie geeks care about to something the whole family can enjoy.      Think about it. Every song ever (deals with record labels permitting, of course), right there on your iPhone, your iPad, your Apple TV, your MacBook, on-demand and always at the ready. If you can access the Internet (“the Cloud”), then you can listen to your tunes.      And just like that, your MP3s are worthless. Why would you maintain a giant collection of hard drive-eating MP3 and AAC (the file format iTunes uses) files when you can access the same songs from a handy App?      Let’s see… gigabytes upon gigabytes of music files versus a single App that can stream any song with the touch of a button. Well, the touch of a screen, as it were.      It’s a no-brainer, and everybody wins.      Apple collects 10 per month (or whatever) from you, you get access to an entire Cloud’s worth of music, and the record labels no longer have to worry about pesky kids “trading files” any more. Not because illegally trading iTunes-purchased music was ever a problem for the record labels, but that iTunes Stream would represent a very clear change in the culture of music consumption. Kids wanting to listen to Kanye West’s “Monster” won’t think to look for an “MP3,” they’ll grow up learning to fire up iTunes Stream on their iPhone.      I can see audiophiles not particularly caring about any of this, complaining about the compression used in the streaming, never thinking to listen to music on a phone, but the number of people who listen to 24bit lossless vinyl rips (give me FLAC or give me death!) using Foobar2000 and 500 headphones is non-existent compared to people who are cool with listening to Nicki Minaj on YouTube (read: rubbish quality) using 10 earbuds.      And now we play the waiting game, waiting for Apple to kill the MP3 once and for all.      Hopefully. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Apple has teased a major iTunes-related announcement on its homepage, which has led to speculation that it may be related to a cloud-based music streaming service. The announcement could also be tied to the completion of Apple's massive data center in North Carolina, which is set to go online.

This would benefit Apple, consumers, and record labels, potentially signaling a shift in the culture of music consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. While visiting a friend, Ash got caught stealing one of their favorite toys.  Given the context: What will Ash want to do next? Answer:","output":"In the situation where Ash has been caught stealing one of their friend's favorite toys, Ash is likely experiencing a range of emotions, including guilt, embarrassment, and fear of losing the friendship. Here are some possible steps that Ash might want to take next in order to make amends and preserve the relationship: 1. Apologize sincerely: The first and foremost thing Ash should do is to genuinely apologize to their friend. They may want to express their regret for their actions, explain that they understand the impact and hurt caused, and assure their friend that it won't happen again. 2. Return the stolen item: Ash should immediately return the stolen toy to their friend. This is a necessary step to mend the situation and demonstrate their commitment to making things right. 3. Understand their friend's feelings: It is important for Ash to empathize with their friend and validate their emotions. Ash could ask their friend how they are feeling and genuinely listen to their response, acknowledging the hurt and violation of trust they have caused. 4. Make amends: In order to rebuild trust, Ash may want to do something to make up for the theft. This could be a kind gesture such as buying their friend a new toy, helping out with a chore, or spending time together doing an activity their friend enjoys. 5. Reflect on their own behavior: Ash should take some time to think about what led them to steal their friend's toy in the first place. They might want to consider the reasons behind their actions, and possibly work on addressing any personal issues that contributed to this behavior in order to prevent it from happening again in the future. 6. Seek forgiveness: After acknowledging their mistake and making amends, Ash can ask their friend for forgiveness. It is crucial that Ash demonstrates genuine remorse and is willing to make the necessary changes in their behavior to regain their friend's trust. 7. Rebuild trust: Trust is an essential component of any friendship. Ash must accept that it might take time to rebuild trust with their friend. Showing consistency, honesty, and reliability in their actions moving forward will be crucial in reestablishing a strong foundation for the friendship. 8. Learn from the experience: Lastly, Ash should take this incident as an opportunity to grow and learn. They can use this experience to become more aware of their actions, exercise self-control, and develop respect for other people's belongings. Learning from their mistakes is the best way to ensure that Ash does not repeat this behavior in the future. In conclusion, Ash's next steps should involve apologizing sincerely, returning the stolen toy, empathizing with their friend's feelings, making amends, reflecting on their own behavior, seeking forgiveness, rebuilding trust, and learning from their mistakes. By following these steps, Ash has the best chance of restoring their friendship and demonstrating that they are truly remorseful for their actions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned.

We have this puzzle:  47 * u - 206 * u = 130 * u + 289 Let's first simplify the left side by finding the oranges (u): (47 - 206) * u = -159 * u Now our puzzle looks like:  -159 * u = 130 * u + 289 Let's bring all the oranges (u) to one side of the puzzle. To do that, we add 159 * u to both sides:  -159 * u + 159 * u = 130 * u + 289 + 159 * u Which simplifies to: 0 = 289 * u + 289 Now let's get rid of that 289 on the right side. We will do this by subtracting 289 from both sides: 0 - 289 = 289 * u -289 = 289 * u Now to find the value of the orange (u), we need to divide both sides by 289 so that u is all by itself: u = -289 / 289 And we get: u = -1 So the answer is -1.

Taking her lawyer's advice, she copies financial records and several other files from her husband's computer onto a CD.

After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, who thinks his memoirs have been stolen, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for plastic surgery. When a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction and go horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation.

Oscar-winning actress Joan Fontaine died Sunday, her longtime friend Noel Beutel said Monday. She was 96. Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942.

Movie plot title: Once Upon a Time in the West Movie plot: The film portrays two conflicts that take place around Flagstone, a fictional town in the American Old West: a land battle related to construction of a railroad, and a mission of vengeance against a cold-blooded killer. A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men. Back at Sweetwater, construction materials are delivered to build a railroad station and a small town. Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it. Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction. He tries to buy the farm cheaply by intimidating the other bidders, but Harmonica arrives, holding Cheyenne at gunpoint, and makes a much higher bid based on his reward money for delivering Cheyenne to the authorities.

Answer the following question: which country in the uk has the highest population?","output":"England is the country in the United Kingdom that has the highest population. The United Kingdom is composed of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Among these countries, England is the largest in terms of both land area and population. Located in the southern part of Great Britain, England holds approximately 84% of the total population of the United Kingdom. According to the most recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the population of England is estimated to be around 56.29 million people as of mid-2020. This is a significant proportion of the UK's total population, which stands at around 67.1 million. The large population in England can be attributed to a combination of factors, including its historically large land area, fertile agricultural lands, and the influence of major historic events like the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution, in particular, led to rapid urbanization and the growth of major cities such as London, Manchester, and Birmingham. Today, London serves as the capital city of both England and the United Kingdom and has become one of the most culturally diverse and populous cities in the world, with an estimated population of over 9 million people. In contrast to England, the other countries of the United Kingdom have significantly smaller populations. According to the ONS, as of mid-2020, Scotland has an estimated population of around 5.47 million, Wales has approximately 3.17 million, and Northern Ireland has around 1.89 million residents. It is worth noting that population distribution within England is quite uneven, with the major cities and surrounding regions being especially densely populated, while rural areas, especially in the north, tend to have lower population densities.

The book covers the basics of a high school chemistry course but unlike most textbooks or internet resources, it tries to break down and simplify chemistry to make it more manageable. For example, I was having a difficult time explaining Lewis Dot structures or even finding a good resource for understanding it on the web. The author did a very good job of simplifying the approach whereby the generation of these structures made sense. The periodic table that is included in the book is detachable and also helpful. I would have liked a few more problems and some additional pictures may have been helpful but it was an excellent resource especially when combined with a number of the fine websites and interactive periodic tables on the web. It certainly made my life easier helping with homework and recommend it. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

Movie title: Brokeback Mountain Movie plot: In the summer of 1963, two young men meet when they find work sheep-herding for the summer on Brokeback Mountain, a fictional, picturesque setting in Wyoming. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is 19, engaged to be married in the fall, and aspires to someday run his own ranch, following in the footsteps of his parents, who died in a car crash and left young Ennis and his brother and sister alone to fend for themselves. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is about the same age and dreams of becoming the greatest rodeo cowboy alive. Both feel essentially alone in the world.While sharing a sheephand's backbreaking work load, facing the toil and troubles of the weather, shortages of food, and wild animal attacks, their working friendship eventually develops into something more. Breaking their employer's rule that one man must sleep with the sheep and one at the camp, one night after an evening of boozing and shooting the bull, they end up sharing the tent to avoid freezing. The bitter cold leads to their sleeping spooned, Jack initiates touching, and Ennis eventually responds. Over the next several days, the two increasingly give in to their attraction to one another.When the summer ends, the two men separate and continue with their lives. Ennis marries Alma (Michelle Williams), who soon gets pregnant and gives birth to two daughters, Alma Jr. and Jenny. Jack, by contrast, is still drawn to other men, and remains unmarried until he meets and, after a drunken one-night stand, has a son with feisty cowgirl Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway), whose father owns a profitable business selling farming machinery in Texas and openly looks down on Jack. Searching for acceptance, approval, and unconditional love, Jack writes to Ennis in 1967, when they arrange to meet again.When Jack arrives in Wyoming, both men passionately kiss. Ennis makes a weak attempt to be discreet, but the kiss is seen by Alma, who becomes sickened by it. From this point on Ennis and Jack's relationship rebuilds and develops even more deeply.Alma becomes...

Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  CHAPTER SUMMARY 36.1 Sensory Processes A sensory activation occurs when a physical or chemical stimulus is processed into a neural signal (sensory transduction) by a sensory receptor. Perception is an individual interpretation of a sensation and is a brain function. Humans have special senses: olfaction, gustation, equilibrium, and hearing, plus the general senses of somatosensation. Sensory receptors are either specialized cells associated with sensory neurons or the specialized ends of sensory neurons that are a part of the peripheral nervous system, and they are used to receive information about the environment (internal or external). Each sensory receptor is modified for the type of stimulus it detects. For example, neither gustatory receptors nor auditory receptors are sensitive to light. Each sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli within a specific region in space, which is known as that receptor’s receptive field. The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system. All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, enter the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex dedicated to processing that particular sense.

The massive tragedy claimed six lives as a Dodge Durango SUV plunged into a rain-swollen creek, and the surviving mom and dad now face the agonizing reality of losing five of their children. Adding to the devastating event, the father, who was behind the wheel, is currently hospitalized. The accident took place shortly after midnight on County Rd. 107. The area had seen significant rainfall, leading to the creek swelling beyond its usual confines. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is mourning the untimely loss of nine of its members as they desperately try to come to terms with the scale of the calamity. Local authorities and the community are rallying around the grieving family to provide support and comfort during this darkest of times. Despite the timing of the incident and the swollen creek, law enforcement authorities confirm that weather did not play a role in the occurrence. \\"This accident is not weather-related at all,\\" says the local sheriff, dismissing any connection between the rainfall and the tragedy.  As the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident, the father has understandably raised questions and concerns about his potential role in the devastating event. Preliminary investigations are underway, with alcohol testing results scheduled to be released on the same day as the funeral for the six victims. The potential role that intoxication could have had in the crash will be revealed alongside the grieving family saying their final goodbyes. The incident has shaken the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians to its core, as families come together to face the heartbreak. A sense of indescribable sadness has consumed the community, with friends and relatives supporting one another through the shared pain. The funeral for the six victims will be a day filled with tremendous sorrow and grief, not only for the mom and dad surviving the accident but also for the extended family and community mourning their loss. Amid continued investigations into the cause of the catastrophe, the family must also confront the possibility of fault lying with the father. As the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians come together in mourning, seeking solace and healing, it is vital that the necessary support and care are available for the bereaved family. The pain of losing five children is unimaginable, and the journey towards finding closure and peace will be a long and challenging one for the parents, siblings, grandparents, and other family members. In the wake of this tragedy, it is crucial for the community to be a source of kindness, understanding, and compassion, fostering strength in their unity and shared grief. As the investigations into the incident continue, it is imperative to find a balance between seeking answers and respecting the family's need for space and healing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Specificity: \\"Hate it\\" provides little information about the product or service being reviewed. It does not detail the reasons for the dissatisfaction or any particular aspect that the reviewer found objectionable. As a result, potential users cannot make an informed decision based on this review. Score: 1 2.

A brief review can still be useful if it highlights specific pros or cons, but \\"Hate it\\" offers no such insight. Score: 1 3. Spelling and grammar: The review contains only two words, and they are both spelled correctly. Grammatically, the statement is understandable, but it does not follow complete standard sentence structure. Nevertheless, it is still easy to comprehend. Score: 3 4.

Rumors have begun swirling around the fate of  John Kelly   the White House chief of staff  who has found  himself  at the center of a firestorm in recent days amid allegations that a top Trump administration staffer had abused his ex-wives.  Kelly  expressed to Trump on Friday that he was willing to resign over the ordeal  sources close to Trump told ABC News. The New York Times also reported that  Kelly  told West Wing officials that  he  was willing to resign. It's unclear whether Trump will ask for  his  resignation. Sources familiar with the situation told ABC they didn't believe  Kelly 's departure was imminent. Rob Porter  the former White House staff secretary  resigned on Wednesday after news outlets published his ex-wives' allegations. But the scandal continued to build after news surfaced that  Kelly  and others in the White House knew for months about the accusations â and built up Porter's role within the West Wing anyway. White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told CNN that  Kelly  has not offered his resignation. But Trump is reportedly furious with  Kelly  over his handling of the issue.  Kelly  issued a statement after the allegations were first published by the Daily Mail on Tuesday  vehemently praising Porter as a \\"man of true integrity and honor.\\" \\"I was shocked by the new allegations released today against Rob Porter  \\" Kelly  said. \\"There is no place for domestic violence in our society.\\"  Kelly  is on shaky ground Trump was so infuriated by the ordeal  he  even phoned Reince Priebus  the previous chief of staff who was ousted after  he  also attracted Trump's ire  to vent about  Kelly   The New York Times reported.

Video has circulated of him captured alive but injured, and leaders of the new Libyan government say he was shot and killed in a gun battle between his captors and his supporters.      BLOCK: Gadhafi's body was taken from Sirte to the city of Misrata, and that's where we've reached freelance reporter Marine Olivesi. Marine, I gather, you saw the body of Moammar Gadhafi.      MARINE OLIVESI: The bodies of both Moammar Gadhafi and his son Mutassim Gadhafi have been brought to an individual house about 15 minutes drive from the center of Misrata. It's really unclear how he ended up there. It's been very difficult to look at him exactly. There were several rumors about his location, but we saw him in the main hallway of that private house. His body is lying on a mattress. There are people around trying to take pictures with him. It's clear that he was injured to the chest. He received several gunshots to the chest. He is lying there just with pants on, and, again, people crowding around, trying to get a picture of themselves with the dead body of Moammar Gadhafi.      BLOCK: And the people who are crowding around, Marine, these are people who live in Misrata? These are fighters?      OLIVESI: These are all people from Misrata. A lot of them have been fighting. People in Misrata, it has a specific meaning to them that the body was brought here because, as one of the Misrati here told me, they have been waiting for that moment for so long, and the town has suffered so much through the Libyan revolution.      I mean, one person beside me couldn't wait to get a picture with Moammar Gadhafi so that he can show his mom because he lost two brothers in the siege of Misrata, and that would mean a lot to his mother to see for herself the dead body of Moammar Gadhafi. So there's a sense of closure, it felt like it, for a lot of people here, for who the death of Moammar Gadhafi marks the end of those eight months and the end of the Libyan revolution.      BLOCK: I've been talking with freelance reporter Marine Olivesi. She's in the Libyan city of Misrata, where the body of Moammar Gadhafi was taken today. Marine, thank you very much.

A number of photos and videos depicting Gaddafi both before and after his death have made their way onto the Internet. Getty has obtained a set of photos confirming the death, available below.      WARNING: The photos below are graphic.      Gaddafi was captured and eventually killed in the northern Libyan city of Sirte. His son Mutassim was also killed when the rebels captured the city, Reuters reports.      According to the Associated Press:      Arab broadcasters showed graphic images of the balding, goateed Gadhafi – wounded, with a bloodied face and shirt – but alive. Later video showed fighters rolling Gadhafi's lifeless body over on the pavement, stripped to the waist and a pool of blood under his head. While he was still alive, the fighters drove him around lying on the hood of a truck, perhaps to parade him in public. One fighter held him down, pressing on his thigh with a pair of shoes in a show of contempt.      Following the demise of one of the world's most notorious dictators, attention will turn to Libya's new government. |||||","output":"The body of former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi was displayed in a private house in Misrata after he was killed by Libyan rebels. The former leader, who ruled Libya for 42 years, was captured and killed in his hometown of Sirte, along with his son Mutassim. The death of Gadhafi marks the end of the Libyan revolution and turns attention to Libya's new government."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have this problem: -12 * o + 5 + 7 = 0 The first thing we need to do is add the numbers 5 and 7. Think of it like having 5 apples and 7 apples, how many apples do we have in total?

That's what's happening on the one side: -12 * o = -12 Now, to find \\"o\\", we have to get rid of the \\"-12\\" that's being multiplied by it. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -12. Just like sharing 12 cookies between 12 friends, each friend will get 1 cookie. In this case, we are sharing -12 by -12.

Write highlights for this article: The decision of English Premier League giants Manchester United to ban their players from signing autographs at the team's training ground won't affect the sports memorabilia market significantly, an industry expert says. Sorry kids: Manchester United will no longer be giving autographs at their Carrington training ground. The move to ban autographs was announced by Sir Alex Ferguson in the team's match day program for Saturday's 2-1 win over Blackburn Rovers at Old Trafford. Ferguson said in the program he wanted to put a stop to memorabilia dealers using the autographs for financial gain. \\"I offer apologies to fans who come to the Carrington training ground looking for autographs, he wrote. \\"The problem is that we have had too many opportunists selling on signed merchandise. They are not fans at all,\\" Ferguson said. While the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association declined to comment on the issue, a spokesman from a Kent-based supporters' club \\"Invicta Reds\\" said he was happy to agree with the manager's decision. \\"If Fergie (Sir Alex Ferguson) likes it then it's good for us all,\\" the spokesman told CNN. Do you feel autograph-hunters need to be targeted or is this unfair on other fans? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. The decision comes at a time when the market for replica jerseys and other autographed football memorabilia continues to grow significantly. A quick trawl of the UK's version of auction site eBay shows almost 16,000 autographed football items for sale. These items include signed jerseys, cards, photos, books and prints. Prices vary greatly, however, a David Beckham Manchester United shirt was selling for £300 (436) on Monday. Vice-president of operations at sportsmemorabilia.com, Mike Gallucci, speaking to CNN, estimated the autographed memorabilia industry was worth about 4 billion a year. \\"It has definitely been growing, it's big business. In the past, people hadn't realized the price they could get for some of these items. \\"The power of the Internet has changed this. However, with more players signing more autographs, the market is a little flooded with the items,\\" he said. Gallucci said less accessibility to players for some fans shouldn't alter the market too much as the items sourced from official routes were usually the most popular. \\"People who want a 100 percent genuine item will buy through a company where they can verify the authenticity,\\" he said. A spokeswoman for eBay said the trading of football memorabilia was very popular on the site and had grown in recent years. More than 90,000 items had been listed in the last three months, and eBay had noticed \\"a shift in people starting to sell their memorabilia on the site to make money,\\" the spokeswoman told CNN. In the U.S. market, players in sports such as baseball sometimes only signed autographed items on pre-arranged and contracted deals with memorabilia companies, Galluci said. A 2007 Forbes magazine list rating the top ten sports collectibles ranked baseball star Mark McGwire's record 70th home-run ball as the most expensive -- with an estimated value of 3,005,000. All of the top ten items on the list are baseball memorabilia. See the list here. Highlights:","output":"- Manchester United bans players from signing autographs at their Carrington training ground, as announced by Sir Alex Ferguson. - The decision follows growing concerns about opportunists selling signed merchandise for financial gain, rather than genuine fans collecting autographs. - Industry expert Mike Gallucci states the decision won't significantly affect the sports memorabilia market, which is worth about 4 billion annually. - The market for replica jerseys and autographed football memorabilia is rapidly growing, with eBay showing nearly 16,000 autographed football items available in the UK. - Gallucci suggests that less accessibility to players for autographs will not drastically change the market, as authentic items sourced through official routes are usually the most popular."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: The Mexican Movie plot: The story follows Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States. Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman), who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). Retrieving the gun will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship. Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck (David Krumholtz), the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire. Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival. Panicked but determined, Jerry buries the body and then calls Bernie to report on the situation, only for his vehicle to be stolen while he makes the call, the gun still inside. Jerry briefly has an uncooperative donkey as transportation to follow the thief, then buys an old, damaged truck. Meanwhile, Samantha gets kidnapped by a hit man named Leroy (James Gandolfini), who tells her that Jerry hired him to make sure she is safe from anybody that wants her dead. It is then revealed that Leroy is gay, which doesn't bother Samantha. They pick up a postal worker named Frank (Michael Cerveris), who then has a relationship with Leroy. Another hitman follows them to Las Vegas and kills Frank to make it look like a suicide. Leroy kills him in an act of vengeance, and flees with Samantha. Jerry...

Catches a mouse in its talons. Step 2: Understanding the perturbation hypothesis: The perturbation hypothesis states: \\"Suppose the owl is feeding less young.\\" This implies that the owl has fewer young ones to feed. Step 3: Assessing the effect of the perturbation hypothesis: We need to determine if this perturbation (feeding fewer young) has a direct or indirect effect on the process, particularly on the step, \\"The owl catches more mice.\\" Step 4: Consider the implications of the perturbation: If the owl is feeding fewer young, the demand for food might decrease. In other words, the owl would not need to catch as many mice as before to satisfy the hunger of its young. Step 5: Analyzing the potential effect on the process: a. The owl leaving its nest might not be affected. b. The owl flying out into the night might not be affected. c. The owl looking down at the ground might not be affected. d. The owls keen eyesight allowing it to see in the dark might not be affected. e. The owls sensitive hearing allowing it to locate hidden prey might not be affected. f. The owl swooping down might be affected indirectly, as the owl might swoop down less frequently if it needs fewer mice to feed its young. g. The owl catching a mouse in its talons might be affected indirectly. Since the owl has fewer young to feed, it may catch fewer mice in response to the reduced demand for food. Step 6: Concluding the effect of the perturbation hypothesis: The perturbation hypothesis affects the last two steps of the process (swooping down and catching mice) indirectly.

Having a semi-arid climate, it stretches across the south-central latitudes of Northern Africa between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea. The Arabic word \\"\\" literally means \\"shore, coast\\", while the word Sahara is derived from the Arabic word for ocean. Together, these names evoke an image of the Sahel's vegetation as a coastline on the Sahara's ocean of sand.  - Djenné (also Djénné, Jenné and Jenne) is a town and an urban commune in the Inland Niger Delta region of central Mali. The town is the administrative centre of the Djenné Cercle, one of the eight subdivisions of the Mopti Region. The commune includes ten of the surrounding villages and in 2009 had a population of 32,944.  - The Songhai Empire (also transliterated as Songhay) was a state that dominated the western Sahel in the 15th and 16th century. At its peak, it was one of the largest states in African history. The state is known by its historiographical name, derived from its leading ethnic group and ruling elite, the Songhai. Sonni Ali established Gao as the capital of the empire, although a Songhai state had existed in and around Gao since the 11th century. Other important cities in the empire were Timbuktu and Djenné, conquered in 1468 and 1475 respectively, where urban-centered trade flourished. Initially, the empire was ruled by the Sonni dynasty (1493), but it was later replaced by the Askiya dynasty (14931591).  - Timbuktu (pron.: ), also spelled as Tinbuktu, Timbuctoo and Timbuktoo (; Koyra Chiini: \\"Tumbutu\\"), is a historical and still-inhabited city in the West African nation of Mali, situated north of the River Niger on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. The town is the capital of the Timbuktu Region, one of the eight administrative regions of Mali. It had a population of 54,453 in the 2009 census.  - Askia Mohammad Benkan , also Askiya Muhammad Bonkana , was the 3rd ruler of the Songhai Empire from 1531 to April 1537 . Mohammad Benkan assumed power after Askiya Musa ( son of Askia Mohammad I ) was assassinated . Musa was assassinated in the village of Mansur on Wed 24 April 1531 , and on that same day , Mohammad Benkan became Askia . Shocked by Musa 's ruthless actions to eliminate rivals , his brothers conspired together and killed him . It was during this chaos that Benkan , the Kurmina - fari ( the Kurmina Governor ) and son of Umar Komadiakha ( brother of Askia Mohammad ) , seized control of the throne despite opposition from Alu ( one of the son 's of Askia Mohammad ) and took the position of Askia . To secure his position Benkan then banished Askia Mohammad , his paternal uncle to the island of Kangaba , in the River Niger to the west of Gao . He appointed his brother Uthman to his former position as Kurmina - fari . The Tarikh al - Sudan contains this description of his court : Askiya Muhammad Bonkana furbished the court splendidly , enlarging it , adorning it , and embellishing it with more courtiers than ever before . He supplied sumptuous garments , different types of musical instruments , and male and female singers . He gave out abundant largesse and benefactions . During his reign divine favours were bestowed , doors were opened , and blessings poured forth . Benkan tried to reverse his uncle 's policy of relying on the towns , preferring instead to gather support from the peasants . However after a series of military failures , most notably suffering a terrible defeat at the hands of Muhammadu Kanta , the Sarkin of Kebbi . Muhammad Benkan was himself deposed in 1537 , and was succeeded by Askiya Ismail son of Askiya al - hajj Muhammad . Muhammad Bonkana went blind before he died in around 1559 .

Please answer the following question: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked...

Article: A third concern with the Kinsey scale is that it inappropriately measures heterosexuality and homosexuality on the same scale, making one a tradeoff of the other. Research in the 1970s on masculinity and femininity found that concepts of masculinity and femininity are more appropriately measured as independent concepts on a separate scale rather than as a single continuum, with each end representing opposite extremes. When compared on the same scale, they act as tradeoffs such, whereby to be more feminine one had to be less masculine and vice versa. However, if they are considered as separate dimensions one can be simultaneously very masculine and very feminine. Similarly, considering heterosexuality and homosexuality on separate scales would allow one to be both very heterosexual and very homosexual or not very much of either. When they are measured independently, the degree of heterosexual and homosexual can be independently determined, rather than the balance between heterosexual and homosexual as determined using the Kinsey Scale. Question: What did the research performed in the 1970s show about masculinity and feminity?","output":"The research performed in the 1970s on masculinity and femininity showed that these concepts are more appropriately measured as independent concepts on separate scales rather than on a single continuum with each end representing opposite extremes.

The psychologist hates phonology.","output":"Yes, the given sentence \\"The psychologist hates phonology\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's break down the parts of the sentence to further evaluate its structure and meaning: 1. Syntax: The syntax of a sentence pertains to its grammatical structure and the arrangement of its words and phrases. In the given sentence, we have the following components: - Determiner: \\"The\\" - Noun (subject): \\"psychologist\\" - Verb (main action): \\"hates\\" - Noun (object): \\"phonology\\" This sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) sentence structure, which is common in English. The subject and object are both nouns, while the verb is properly conjugated according to the subject. In this case, the subject is in the third person singular form, so the verb \\"hate\\" is correctly conjugated to \\"hates.\\" 2. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. A sentence is said to be semantically acceptable if its words and phrases come together to form a coherent and logically sound meaning. In the given sentence, we have the following meanings: - Psychologist: A professional or academic expert in the study of the human mind and behavior. - Hates: A strong feeling of dislike or aversion. - Phonology: A branch of linguistics concerned with the study of the sound systems of languages and the organization of sounds in spoken words. These components convey a clear and meaningful idea: A psychologist holds a strong aversion or dislike for the study of phonology. While it might seem unusual for a psychologist to hate phonology, depending on their area of expertise or personal preference, it's not impossible. The sentence makes logical sense, therefore, it's semantically acceptable. In conclusion, the sentence \\"The psychologist hates phonology\\" is syntactically and semantically acceptable, as it follows the proper grammar rules, has an SVO structure, the verb is conjugated correctly, and the words convey a coherent and logically sound meaning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Piers Morgan , however, decided that this was a good time to share his theory that Ali said far more racist comments than presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump . Chris Brown , known for not being afraid to speak his mind, clapped back with a vicious rebuttal. And he wasn't the only musician who critiqued Morgan for his negative words on the late boxer.      Morgan tweeted out his thoughts about Ali just two days after his passing, and Chris Brown was having none of it.      Muhammad Ali said far more inflammatory/racist things about white people than Donald Trump ever has about Muslims. #fact      Breezy took Morgan to task in a expletive laden comment on Instagram: \\"Irrelevant BROADCASTING!!!!!

Over the weekend the outspoken host was met with a backlash when he claimed Ali was responsible for a number of 'racist' comments following his death on Friday.      He tweeted: \\"Muhammad Ali said far more inflammatory/racist things about white people than Donald Trump ever has about Muslims. #fact.\\"      Piers looked to be trying to justify his comments about the boxer when he presented Good Morning Britain on Monday.      (Image: ITV)      Speaking to barrister Miranda Brawn, he said: \\"There was another side to Ali, he was incredibly controversial.\\"      Piers continued: \\"His preferred world is segregated. Black people living with black people, white people living with white people.\\"      He then added that some of Ali's comments about race relations would receive 'an incredibly different reaction' if they were said now.      (Image: ITV)      But guest Miranda didn't let Piers' comments go uncontested as she set the record straight about Ali's racial agenda.      She instead reminded Piers that Ali was integral in helping improve self-pride amongst black people.      She explained: \\"If you look at the interview where he said that, he said we've got to get the black people sorted first. We've got to integrate black people and make them have a sense of pride.      She added: \\"He was one of the first black people to say being black is beautiful.\\"      (Image: ITV)      Piers would then try to agree, calling Ali a 'pivotal figure' and questioning why more black athletes don't follow his lead when it comes to political issues.

Less than 48 hours after Muhammad Ali’s death, Piers Morgan trolled Twitter by claiming that the boxing legend was more racist than Donald Trump — and John Legend and Chrissy Teigen were not having it.      On Sunday, June 5, the British journalist, 51, tweeted, “Muhammad Ali said far more inflammatory/racist things about white people than Donald Trump ever has about Muslims. #fact. Why sugar-coat what Ali said or stood for? He never did that to himself, or when speaking to others. I hope people don’t make me sound too perfect when I die. No coats of sugar please.”      Steve Granitz/WireImage.com; Paul Drinkwater/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images      The controversial post immediately made headlines as social media users slammed Morgan, who responded in a series of follow-up tweets, writing, “Why would stating that Muhammad Ali made a lot of inflammatory, race-charged statements in his life be remotely controversial? He did. I’m sorry for ‘saying inflammatory things for attention.’ That’s the last thing Muhammad Ali would have condoned.”            Legend, 37, came across the TV personality’s tweets and responded, “You could test us by announcing your retirement,” to which Teigen, 30, joined in, replying to her hubby, “From what? Trolling isn’t a job (I’ve tried).”            Focus on Sport/Getty Images      Morgan fired back at the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model, writing, “Maybe I should take up a proper job, like modeling?”            “It keeps me nice and not-racist so sure, give it a go,” she responded. The Daily Mail Online U.S. editor-at-large shot back, “I’m not racist either, so that makes two of us.”      But it was Teigen who got the last laugh, jabbing, “Remember when Bruce Willis didn’t know he was dead? It’s like that,” in reference to the surprising end of the actor’s 1999 film The Sixth Sense.            Morgan further discussed Ali’s death during an episode of Good Morning Britain on Monday, June 6. “There was another side to Ali. He was incredibly controversial,” the morning show host said of the legendary boxer, who died on Friday, June 3, at age 74, before adding, “People need to be unafraid to be bold.”      Later on Monday, Morgan reignited the feud with another tweet. “You may want to read my new column about Ali & racism, @johnlegend @chrissyteigen — you may learn something,” he wrote.            Teigen fired back, writing, “Sorry can’t read, just a model doing modeling. Troll recognize troll. I can’t tweet him anymore. He has fans somehow and they … they aren’t quite ‘all there’, as they say.”      She added, “My newborn just looked up at me and said ‘mommy, why is piers morgan so unequivocally douchy?’ i didn’t know what to say,” and “Piers Morgan searches his name every 4.8 seconds.

What you might not realize is that your blood is also affected by a lack of exercise. You can actually reduce your cholesterol levels by adding more exercise, and thus more fitness, to your life. Increasing your physical activity and fitness level has a direct impact on your body's ability to manage cholesterol. When you exercise, your body not only burns calories and strengthens muscles, but it also improves circulation and helps in removing LDL (low-density lipoprotein), or \\"bad\\" cholesterol, from your bloodstream and transporting it back to the liver. Simultaneously, exercise helps increase the levels of HDL (high-density lipoprotein), or \\"good\\" cholesterol, which plays a vital role in removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and reducing the risk of plaque build-up in your arteries. Here are some tips to effectively use increased fitness to lower your cholesterol: 1. Start with moderate-intensity exercises: Begin with activities such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling to gradually build up your stamina and endurance. 2. Incorporate strength-training exercises: Resistance exercises like weightlifting, yoga, or bodyweight exercises can significantly improve muscle strength and help in controlling your cholesterol levels. 3. Engage in aerobic activities: Ideally, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week to maintain good heart health. 4. Make exercise a daily habit: Create a routine that includes physical activity, aiming for at least 30 minutes of exercise daily. Consistency in exercise is key to reducing cholesterol levels. 5. Combine physical activity with a healthy diet: A balanced diet that is low in saturated fats and high in fiber can supplement your exercise efforts to maintain healthy cholesterol levels effectively. 6. Consult a healthcare professional: If you have existing health conditions or are new to exercise, it is important to discuss your fitness plan with a healthcare professional to ensure it is safe and suitable for your individual needs. By understanding the effects of exercise on blood cholesterol levels and putting these strategies into practice, you can significantly lower your risk of developing heart disease and improve your overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Art Spiegelman (; born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev on February 15, 1948) is an American cartoonist, editor, and comics advocate best known for his graphic novel Maus. His work as co-editor on the comics magazines Arcade and Raw has been influential, and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for The New Yorker, where he made several high-profile and sometimes controversial covers. He is married to designer and editor Hired by Tina Brown as a contributing artist in 1992, Spiegelman worked for The New Yorker for ten years. Spiegelman's first cover appeared on the February 15, 1993, Valentine's Day issue and showed a black West Indian woman and a Hasidic man kissing. The cover caused turmoil at The New Yorker offices. Spiegelman intended it to reference the Crown Heights riot of 1991 in which racial tensions led to the murder of a Jewish yeshiva student. Spiegelman had twenty-one New Yorker covers published, and submitted a number which were rejected for being too outrageous.  Within The New Yorker's pages, Spiegelman contributed strips such as a collaboration titled \\"In the Dumps\\" with children's illustrator Maurice Sendak and an obituary to Charles M. Schulz titled \\"Abstract Thought is a Warm Puppy\\". An essay he had published there on Jack Cole, the creator of Plastic Man, called \\"Forms Stretched to their Limits\\" was to form the basis for a book in 2001 about Cole called Jack Cole and Plastic Man: Forms Stretched to their Limits.  The same year, Voyager Company published a CD-ROM version of Maus with extensive supplementary material called The Complete Maus, and Spiegelman illustrated a 1923 poem by Joseph Moncure March called The Wild Party. Spiegelman contributed the essay \\"Getting in Touch With My Inner Racist\\" in the September 1, 1997 issue of Mother Jones.  Spiegelman's influence and connections in New York cartooning circles drew the ire of political cartoonist Ted Rall in 1999. In an article titled \\"The King of Comix\\" in The Village Voice, Rall accused Spiegelman of the power to \\"make or break\\" a cartoonist's career in New York, while denigrating Spiegelman as \\"a guy with one great book in him\\". Cartoonist Danny Hellman responded by sending a forged email under Rall's name to thirty professionals; the prank escalated until Rall launched a defamation suit against Hellman for 1.5 million. Hellman published a \\"Legal Action Comics\\" benefit book to cover his legal costs, to which Spiegelman contributed a back-cover cartoon in which he relieves himself on a Rall-shaped urinal.  In 1997, Spiegelman had his first children's book published: Open Me... I'm a Dog, with a narrator who tries to convince its readers that it is a dog via pop-ups and an attached leash. From 2000 to 2003 Spiegelman and Mouly edited three issues of the children's comics anthology Little Lit, with contributions from Raw alumni and children's book authors and illustrators. what happened?","output":"Art Spiegelman is an American cartoonist, editor, and comics advocate best known for his graphic novel Maus.

Paul won the match.  Which player had an increased hear rate before the match?  Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). Answer:","output":"Paul had an increased heart rate before the match, as he had plenty of time to do his warm-up properly which increased his blood flow to the muscles and heart rate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Cary Grant (born Archibald Alec Leach; January 18, 1904 - November 29, 1986) was an English-American actor, known as one of classic Hollywood's definitive leading men. He began a career in Hollywood in the early 1930s, and became known for his transatlantic accent, debonair demeanor, and light-hearted approach to acting and sense of comic timing. He became an American citizen in 1942. Born in Horfield, Bristol, Grant became attracted to theatre at a young age, and began performing with a troupe known as \\"The Penders\\" from the age of six. Context: Stirling refers to Grant as \\"one of the shrewdest businessmen ever to operate in Hollywood\\". His long-term friendship with Howard Hughes from the 1930s onward saw him invited into the most glamorous circles in Hollywood and their lavish parties. Biographers Morecambe and Stirling state that Hughes played a major role in the development of Grant's business interests, so that by 1939, he was \\"already an astute operator with various commercial interests\\". Scott also played a role, encouraging Grant to invest his money in shares, making him a wealthy man by the end of the 1930s. In the 1940s, Grant and Barbara Hutton invested heavily in real estate development in Acapulco at a time when it was little more than a fishing village, and teamed with Richard Widmark, Roy Rogers, and Red Skelton to buy a hotel there. Behind his business interests was a particularly intelligent mind, to the point that his friend David Niven once said: \\"Before computers went into general release, Cary had one in his brain\\". Film critic David Thomson believes that Grant's intelligence came across on screen, and stated that \\"no one else looked so good and so intelligent at the same time\\".  After Grant retired from the screen, he became more active in business. He accepted a position on the board of directors at Faberge. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career, a salary of a reported 15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about 50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working.  In 1975, Grant was an appointed director of MGM. In 1980, he sat on the board of MGM Films and MGM Grand Hotels following the division of the parent company. He played an active role in the promotion of MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas when opened in 1973, and he continued to promote the city throughout the 1970s. When Allan Warren met Grant for a photo shoot that year he noticed how tired Grant looked, and his \\"slightly melancholic air\\". Grant later joined the boards of Hollywood Park, the Academy of Magical Arts (The Magic Castle, Hollywood, California), and Western Airlines (acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1987). Question: what happend in 1940. Whats the answer?","output":"In 1940, many things happened around the world, but in relation to Cary Grant, he was acting in Hollywood and had started investing his money in shares and other businesses. This made him a wealthy man by the end of the 1930s. Grant's friend, Howard Hughes, helped him with his business interests, and during the 1940s, he also invested in real estate development in Acapulco, Mexico, with other famous people like Richard Widmark, Roy Rogers, and Red Skelton.

Instead, she likely called from Los Angeles, seemingly refuting earlier reports that the 14-year-old found her father unresponsive.      Medics rushed to the actor’s apartment before taking him to Lenox Hill hospital, NBC said. He was reportedly released after an hour of treatment at around 1 a.m.      According to a report from the New York Post, the initial 911 call came in as a“possible alcohol or drug overdose.” Sources told the newspaper that while he never actually ingested sleeping pills, Baldwin threatened to take them during a heated argument.      Matthew Hiltzik, a rep for Baldwin, tells Fox411 that the situation was a \\"misunderstanding on one person's part\\" and that actor is “completely fine and is at work today.\\"      Hiltzik added that Baldwin's quick release indicated that there were no serious health concerns.      \\"If there was any real issue or concern, he would not have been released from the hospital so quickly,\\" Hiltzik said.

This guy!\\" the actor yelled as he burst out of a lobby and grabbed New York Post photographer Tim Wiencis by the collar. Cops immediately pulled the actor off Wiencis and hustled him back inside.      A witness said Baldwin was pacing around the lobby muttering: \\"They are the lowest scum of the Earth. They are the lowest scum of the Earth.\\"      Meanwhile, an incredulous Wiencis told cops, \\"He just assaulted me.\\"      No charges were filed.      Baldwin's bizarre outburst capped a day that began at 12:55 a.m., when he was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital after his 14-year-old daughter, Ireland, dialed 911, sources said.      \\"I'm tired of this,\\" Baldwin said, his daughter told the dispatcher. \\"I'm going to take some pills. I'm going to end this.\\"      When cops arrived at Baldwin's pad on Central Park West, the actor told them he took an Ambien sleeping pill and had \\"no intention\\" of committing suicide, sources said.      Baldwin, who is due to emcee the Oscars on March 7, told cops he and Ireland had been arguing over the phone and that his daughter was \\"put up\\" to dial 911 by her mom, actress Kim Basinger, sources said.      Still, cops had Baldwin checked out and doctors released him after deciding he was no threat to himself, sources said.      When the \\"30 Rock\\" star returned home, he found reporters on his doorstep.      \\"This is another example of Kim's sickness,\\" a buddy of Baldwin's told the Daily News. \\"Alec came back from the hospital and there were cameras outside his house at 2 a.m. Gee, I wonder how they found out?\\"      Baldwin went to work at 7 a.m., and when he came home around 5:30 p.m. the reporters were still there.      It was then that Wiencis lightly tapped Baldwin on the arm and the actor exploded, according to witnesses.      \\"Don't touch me!\\" Baldwin yelled. \\"I'm calling the cops!\\"      There was no comment from Basinger, whose divorce from Baldwin has been a Hollywood horror show that has left their daughter torn between warring parents.      Baldwin and Ireland also have had a rocky relationship, a fact that was revealed in spectacular fashion when a voice mail of the actor calling his spawn a \\"rude, thoughtless little pig\\" was leaked in 2007.      csiemaszko@nydailynews.com      With Jonathan Lemire and George Rush ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Actor Alec Baldwin was taken to a New York City hospital after his daughter Ireland called 911, concerned for her father's health.

It's more this thing out there in society that has 10 million followers on Facebook and six million on Twitter. I mean, that's a social phenomenon.\\". It will look at business and marketing strategies, the role of old and new media, fans and live concerts, gay culture, religious and political themes, sex and sexuality, and the cities of New York and Hollywood, it says. Prof Deflem said he initially planned to call the course the Sociology of Fame or the Sociology of Celebrity, and to use Lady Gaga as an example. Also a fan of Frank Zappa, Prince, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Status Quo and Ritchie Blackmore, Prof Deflem says his interest in Lady Gaga began when he first saw her perform on television on 9 January 2009. \\"They don't have to be hardcore fans. The better fan will not necessarily be the better student. But you have to have some interest in the topic. So if you really don't like her, you probably shouldn't take the course.\\" Question: What is the passage mainly about? Options: A: Teaching achievements of Professor Mathieu Deflem.

Article: Drinking more than two alcoholic drinks daily in middle-age may raise your stroke  risk more than traditional factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes , according to new research in the American Heart Association journal Stroke. In a study of 11,644 middle-aged Swedish twins who were followed for 43 years, researchers compared the effects of an average of more than two drinks daily (\\"heavy drinking\\") to less than half a drink daily (\\"light drinking\\"). The study showed that: *Heavy drinkers had about a 34 percent higher risk of stroke compared to light drinkers. *Mid-life heavy drinkers (in their 50s and 60s) were likely to have a stroke five years earlier in life _ of genetic and early-life factors. *Heavy drinkers had increased stroke risk in their mid-life compared to well-known risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes. *At around age 75, blood pressure and diabetes appeared to take over as one of the main influences on having a stroke. Past studies have shown that alcohol affects stroke risk, but this is the first study to pinpoint differences with age. \\"We now have a clearer picture about these risk factors----how they change with age and how the influence of drinking alcohol shifts as we get older,\\" said Pavla Kadlecova, M.Sc., a statistician at St. Anne's University Hospital's International Clinical Research Center in the Czech Republic. Researchers analyzed results from the Swedish Twin Registry of same-sex twins who answered questionnaires in 1967-1970. All twins were under age 60 at the start. By 2010, the Registry had provided 43 years of follow-up, including hospital discharge  and cause of death data. Researchers then sorted  the data based on strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes and other cardiovascular  incidents. Almost 30 percent of participants had a stroke. They were categorized(......) as light, moderate, heavy or non-drinkers based on the questionnaires. Researchers compared the risk from drinking and health risks like high blood pressure, diabetes and smoking. Among... Question: What does the passage mainly tell us? Options: A: People without a stroke can drink more alcohol than those having a stroke in middle age B: There is a higher possibility that heavy drinkers will have a stroke in middle age C: Drinking alcohol has been regarded as the most dangerous factor in strokes D: The amount of alcohol taken by men should be twice than that taken by women.","output":"The passage mainly tells us that: B: There is a higher possibility that heavy drinkers will have a stroke in middle age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Symptoms of a cold become noticeable one or two days after you have been in contact with the virus. If your symptoms last for longer than 14 days, they may be caused by allergies, or you may have a bacterial infection. If your temperature is anywhere between 37.2°C to 37.8°C or 99°F to 100°F, then you have a low grade fever. When your body starts fighting off an infection, such as a cold virus, it releases pyrogens, which make your body’s temperature rise. Many microorganisms, including some cold viruses, cannot live through these increased temperatures. Infections can cause you to feel both tired and achy. This is because when your body is fighting off an infection, your muscles can become inflamed. This inflammation can be interpreted in your brain as pain, leading to you feeling tired and uncomfortable. When your body is dealing with an infection, your normal eating habits may change. This is particularly true when you have a fever. If your body temperatures get increased, the enzyme in your taste buds stops working, which in turn makes you feel less hungry. When you have a cold, your tear ducts can become blocked and inflamed because of the infection. That means that your tears can build up in your eye, leading to excessively watery eyes.

Write a summary based on this article: Spectacle seemed to delight visitors but zoo has been criticised in the past for keeping animals in ‘woefully inadequate’ conditions      Visitors to a newly reopened zoo in North Korea have been flocking to a new attraction: a smoking chimpanzee.      According to officials at the Central zoo in Pyongyang, which has been criticised for animal cruelty in the past, the 19-year-old female chimpanzee Azalea, Dallae in Korean, smokes a pack a day.      The chimpanzee can use a lighter to light her own cigarettes, or spark up from a lit cigarette. The zoo has insisted, however, that she does not inhale.      North Korea claims 'new liver medicine made at national zoo' Read more      The spectacle, which would shock animal rights campaigners, made visitors roar with laughter on Wednesday as the chimpanzee sat puffing away. Her trainer seemed to be encouraging the smoking and prompted her to touch her nose, bow thank you and do a simple dance.      The zoo is pulling in thousands of visitors a day to see attractions ranging from elephants, giraffes, penguins and monkeys to a hi-tech natural history museum.      NK News reported North Korea has stocked the zoo with animals from all over the world, with many of the deals being called into question by animal rights campaigners. The zoo has also been criticised in the past for keeping animals in “woefully inadequate” conditions.      Renovations at the zoo began in 2014 as part of efforts by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to create leisure centres around the capital.      Another popular attraction is the dog pavilion. The zoo also arranges performances featuring other animals trained to do tricks, including a monkey that slam dunks basketballs and doves that fly around and land on a woman skating on an indoor stage. ||||| She’s bananas for nicotine.      According to officials at the Pyongyang Zoo, 19-year-old chimpanzee Azalea, who goes by “Dallae” in Korea, smokes roughly one pack of cigarettes per day.      Not to worry, though, officials say she never inhales the smoke, but it seems has picked up the habit for fun.      The chill chimp is familiar with the routine of smoking and waits on her human trainer to toss a lighter her way when she needs one.      Bill stopping circus use of wild animals would show NYC is humane      If a lighter isn’t available, Azalea uses a lit cigarette as an alternative.      The newly-renovated zoo attracts thousands of visitors every day, as it features other fascinating animals and displays of the solar system and evolution of life.      Azalea, a Korean zoo chimpanzee, loves to smoke and entertain her guests by performing and dancing. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) (Wong Maye-E/AP)      Some viewers are outraged by the risky routine allowed by zoo officials, especially PETA, who recently released a displeased statement to TIME magazine.      Others are charmed, as the cute chimp also loves to entertain guests by performing and dancing — even taking a bow at their request.      According to ABC News, the zoo shows other animals that love tricks, such as doing slam dunks and even solving math equations.      The zoo orininally opened back in 1959, but its new distinctive demeanor developed in 2014. ||||| Officials at the zoo claim Azalea, whose name in Korean is \\"Dallae\\", doesn’t actually inhale the cigarette smoke.      AP witnessed entertained visitors at the zoo laughing as Azalea’s trainer encouraged her to smoke the cigarettes.      The trainer also prompted her to touch her nose, bow thank you and do a simple dance.      Animal rights group, the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), criticised the zoo for keeping the animals to ‘attract gawkers’.      “This exemplifies the problem with any captive wildlife displayed for profit,” said Carter Dillard, Director of Litigation for the ALDF. “They are made to do unnatural and freakish things to attract gawkers.      “The good news is that the civilised world is moving away from this, like the gradual elimination of orcas from places like Seaworld.”      Elisa Allen, Director PETA UK, said: “If we really needed any more proof that zoos are motivated by profit and not animal welfare, this is surely it.      “Smoking is as dangerous to Azalea the chimpanzee as it is to humans, and yet her ‘caretakers’ facilitate her habit – just for the sake of a few cheap laughs and more bodies coming through the gates.      “Anyone who cares about protecting animals should donate to programmes that help them in their natural habitats, where they're free to engage in natural behaviour, and stay away from these glorified prisons that objectify sensitive animals.” ||||| Summary:","output":"Visitors to the newly reopened Central zoo in Pyongyang, North Korea, have been surprised to find a new attraction – a smoking chimpanzee.

Question: When did Thayer return to Mexico to Film Movie plot title: And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself Movie plot: Mexico, 1912. Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa (Antonio Banderas) finds himself without adequate funding to finance his war against the military-run government. He also finds himself at odds with the Americans because of the Hearst media empire's press campaign against him. To counter both of these threats, he sends emissaries to movie producers in Hollywood to convince them to pay to film his progress and the actual battles. Producer D.W. Griffith (Colm Feore) is immediately interested and convinces Mutual Film Studios boss Harry E. Aitkin to send a film crew. Aitkin's nephew Frank Thayer is initially a mere errand boy for the studio, but he makes a good impression with Villa, who demands that Thayer be placed in charge of the project. Thayer and a camera crew team arrive in Mexico and film Villa leading his men to victory in battle. Despite the failure of this initial footage (which draws derisive laughter from potential backers) Thayer convinces Aitkin to invest even more money in a second attempt, and also convinces Villa to participate in making a more narrative film.Over a year later in 1913, Thayer returns to Mexico with a director, actors, producers, cameramen and screen writers, and begin to film Villa's previous exploits using a younger actor. The filming goes well, although Villa becomes angry that the screenwriters and the director have changed history to make a more dramatic film.Another few months later, Villa then assembles an army to attack a Federal held fort at Torreon. Thayer and his team go into film the action. After a skirmish on the way to the fort, Villa's army arrives at Torreon and lays siege to the fortress. Villa orders an attack and personally leads the charge. Villa's army is initially successful, but they suffer heavy casualties and are forced to withdraw.That night, Villa orders his army to bombard Torreon into submission, and, after a long, brutal bombardment, Villa's cavalry finish off the last of Torreon's Federal defenders.

His father is Irish and his mother is Jewish. A younger brother, Terence, was born in 1945. Ford's paternal grandparents, John Fitzgerald Ford and Florence Veronica Niehaus, were of Irish Catholic and German descent, respectively. On October 23, 1999, Harrison Ford was involved in the crash of a Bell 206L4 LongRanger helicopter (N36R). The NTSB accident report states that Ford was piloting the aircraft over the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita, California, on a routine training flight. While making his second attempt at an autorotation with powered recovery, Ford allowed the aircraft's altitude to drop to 150-200 feet before beginning power-up. The aircraft was unable to recover power before hitting the ground. The aircraft landed hard and began skidding forward in the loose gravel before one of its skids struck a partially embedded log, flipping the aircraft onto its side. Neither Ford nor the instructor pilot suffered any injuries, though the helicopter was seriously damaged. When asked about the incident by fellow pilot James Lipton in an interview on the TV show Inside the Actor's Studio, Ford replied, \\"I broke it.\\"  On March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California.

Consequently, a Sunday driver wasn't necessarily someone who was driving on a Sunday. A person could be a Sunday driver any day of the week. _ . The expression probably came about because there was a time when people would often decide to go for a relaxing drive on Sunday afternoons. A Sunday drive was a common occurrence years ago and especially on a nice warm sunny day. There were no stores open on Sunday because of the \\"blue laws\\", so you needed to be sure and fill up the gas tank and make any other needed purchases before Sunday arrived.

After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at Hyde Park.

Compare to the original, in which Chuck Heston's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events. The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation, and we never really wonder about his well being. Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in real jeopardy. Tim Burton should have used some of the f/x budget for some competent screenwriting. In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats. Let them walk.

As she began the process of redecorating her living space, she knew that it was crucial to ensure the new flooring was durable, stylish, and long-lasting. The old linoleum simply no longer met those requirements. (I) Linoleum was old. After considering various options, Sarah decided to go with tile floors. Despite being a little more expensive than linoleum, tile had many advantages. One of the main reasons Sarah chose tile was because of its durability. High-quality tile can last for decades, whereas linoleum usually needs to be replaced every 10-20 years. Moreover, Sarah wanted a more timeless and elegant look for her home. Tiles, especially natural stone or ceramic, are known for their classic beauty. They allow for a variety of designs and patterns, which gave Sarah the flexibility she needed to create a sophisticated and unique atmosphere in her living space. Being environmentally conscious, Sarah was also drawn to the eco-friendly aspects of tile. Many tiles are made from natural materials like clay, glass, and sand, whereas linoleum can be less environmentally friendly due to the presence of PVC in its composition. Tiles are recyclable and can be reused in a variety of creative ways, such as in garden paths or as decorative pieces. During the installation process, Sarah paid close attention to detail. She carefully selected a reputable tile contractor who helped her choose the best type of tile for her home based on her budget, lifestyle, and design preferences. Together, they evaluated factors such as water resistance, durability, and slip resistance. The process of installing the new tile floors took some time, but Sarah knew that the effort would be worth it. As the work progressed, she started to see the transformation of her living space. The old, worn-out linoleum had been replaced by elegant, modern, and practical tile floors. Once the floors were installed, Sarah took the time to find the right furnishings and decorations to complement the new flooring. She wanted to make sure that everything in her home worked well together and created a cohesive and stylish look. From area rugs to lighter-colored curtains, each element in the room was carefully chosen to create a balanced and inviting space. In the end, Sarah was thrilled with her decision to replace the old linoleum with tile floors. Her living area now boasted a sophisticated appearance that reflected her personal style and dedication to sustainability. Not only did the tile floors enhance the overall aesthetic of her home, but they also provided a durable and practical solution that made her living space more comfortable and enjoyable for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some days it was the stellar food we all came in to have at lunch and other days... not so good. To the point that the last three times were bad and the large group of us haven't gone back and probably won't. The food thing came down to if a certain chef was working - if he was there, good; if not, bad. Started asking the waitresses and figured out the trend.   Fast forward to today and that chef has left and no longer works there. Which leads me to understand why the last 3 times in a row the food has been subpar. Like what makes a tomato hard? wasn't green or unripe but hard like... tough to cut hard. wtf? I don't know enough to know this is a reason the food has got worse but typically if you're looking to franchise you get different food vendors that can deliver the same type of food to your locations all across the country.

Jessica Jerreat. PUBLISHED:. 23:32 EST, 15 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 00:36 EST, 16 June 2013. Ryan Ferguson was 21 when he sentenced to 40 years in prison for a murder his friend Chuck Erikson had implicated him in, despite Erikson not remembering any details of the night in question. The only evidence that linked Ferguson to the murder of a sports editor, found strangled in his office car park in Columbia, Missouri, was testimony from two witnesses who have since recanted their statements under oath. But despite the appeals and extensive campaigns spearheaded by Ferguson's father, Bill, and documentary on CBS's 48 Hours, the young man remains in prison for a crime he vehemently denies being involved in. Appeal: Ryan Ferguson has always denied that he was involved in the murder of Kent Heitholt. Two years after Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt was discovered strangled to death by his own belt in the early hours of November 1, 2001, Erikson told police he believed he was involved. He told police the pair, who had been 17 at the time, had been drinking underage at a nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in question. After reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was involved, saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked like him. In his police interviews Erikson, who was a drug user, was unable to give details of the crime, wrongly stating that Heitholt had been strangled by a shirt, or a bungee cord, before the detective questioning him tells Erikson it was a belt. He claimed however, that he struck the editor once, before Ferguson strangled him. 'The police threatened me to implicate Ferguson or else I would be solely responsible for Heitholt’s death and be charged with first-degree murder and possibly sentenced to death,' Erickson said in an affidavit. Confess: A mug shot of Chuck Erikson, right, who said he was involved after seeing a photofit, right, in a paper. Memory loss: Chuck Erikson, who says he cannot remember the night of the murder, recently retracted his statement that Ryan Ferguson was involved. Despite fingerprints, a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching Erikson or Ferguson, police arrested the young men. 'Everything is wrong about this case,. everything's wrong about it. It makes absolutely no sense,' Kathleen. Zellner, who is working of Ferguson's appeal, told the court. Ferguson has denied being involved in the case, throughout his arrest, trial and seven appeals. He stated to police that on the night Heitholt was killed, he and Erikson had gone to a bar and then he drove them home. When his latest appeal was denied, Ferguson told CBS: 'I just sat in this room by myself. And. just stared at the floor ... and it's frustrating because you don't know,. even with all the facts, if you'll ever get your life back.' The appeal last year centered around the two witnesses who had implicated Ferguson both admitting they lied. Tribute: Victim Kent Heitholt was the sports editor at the Columbia Daily Tribune and a father of two. Crime scene: The sports editor was leaving his office after 2am when he was strangled in the car park. Erikson, who is serving a. 25-year-sentence, is now saying that although he still has no memory of. the night in question, he believes he acted alone. Tribune janitor Jerry Trump, who said. he saw the young men at the scene, also later admitted under oath that. he had falsely identified them from a picture he was shown. In his police interview, Erikson said: 'I could just be fabricating it all and not know. This is after reading the newspaper article in October and this is kinda what I put together with what could've happened.' He went on to say: 'From there on I'm just presuming what happened. I'm making presumptions based on what I read in the newspaper.' According to the Columbia Daily Tribune, a key witness who was the last person to see the victim alive, was never thoroughly investigated. Fellow sportswriter Michael Boyd had left the office the same time as Heitholt, who was married with two children. He says that he drove off before Heitholt. The 1991 blue Oldsmobile he was driving that night was never searched, and he traded it shortly afterwards. Police have never been able to trace it. A forensic pathologist, Dr Larry Blum, has examined evidence from the trial for Ms Zellner, CBS said. He claims that the tire tool Erikson said he used to beat his victim did not fit the injuries. He added that the struggle lasted between six to eight minutes, meaning Mr Boyd put himself at the scene very close to the time. the crime was reported. According to CBS Mr Boyd said he left the car park at about 2.20am,. only six minutes before 911 was called. Campaign: Ryan Ferguson, left, with his father Bill and sister, Kelly, who are trying to have him released. Mr Boyd, who has always cooperated with investigators and denied having anything to do with the crime, told 48 Hours that he returned to. the car park later that night after hearing about the murder. Ferguson's family and lawyer continue to fight for the young man's conviction to be overturned. 'I've always felt that the system works,' Ms Zellner said, as she explained her determination to have him freed. 'He is absolutely innocent. ...I don't want to be part of a system that cannot recognize and correct an error.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article discusses the critical details of a true-crime case involving Ryan Ferguson, who was sentenced to life imprisonment due to his alleged involvement in the murder of Kent Heitholt, the sports editor of the Columbia Daily Tribune in 2001.  The main points can be summarized as follows: 1. Circumstances of the crime: In November 2001, Heitholt was found strangled to death by his own belt in his office car park in Columbia, Missouri. The case remained unsolved for two years until Ferguson's friend, Chuck Erikson, alleged he and Ferguson were involved in the murder. Erikson and Ferguson were 17 at the time and had been drinking underage on the night of the murder. 2. Erikson's testimony: Erikson, who could not remember the details of the night due to his alcohol and drug consumption, wrongfully shared certain details about the crime, which differed from the actual facts. He alleged that he and Ferguson were responsible for the murder when he became convinced that a photo-fit image of a man seen at the scene resembled him. 3. Ryan Ferguson's involvement and denial: The only evidence that linked Ferguson to Heitholt’s murder was Erikson's testimony and that of two other witnesses. Despite these testimonies, Ferguson has vehemently denied involvement in the murder.  4. Evidence at the crime scene: A range of forensics, including fingerprints and a bloody footprint, found at the scene, did not match either Erikson or Ferguson. However, police arrested them anyhow based on the testimonies. 5. Recanted Testimonies: The two witnesses who initially implicated Ferguson in the crime later recanted their statements under oath. Even Erikson, who is serving a 25-year sentence, has now stated that he believes he acted alone and that implicating Ferguson was a mistake. 6. Flaws in the investigation: Many questions have been raised about the process of investigation, including the failure to thoroughly investigate Michael Boyd, the last person to see Heitholt alive.  7. Ferguson's Fight: Ryan’s father, Bill Ferguson, along with his daughter, Kelly, have launched extensive campaigns to have the conviction overturned. They are being assisted by attorney Kathleen Zellner, who claims that the case is laden with numerous flaws and strongly believes in Ryan’s innocence. Despite the inconsistencies and faulty testimonies in the evidence against him, Ryan remains in prison.  This case has captivated many due to the lack of concrete evidence against Ferguson, the recantation of critical testimonies, and the ongoing campaign spearheaded by his family and lawyer for his release. It also raises serious questions about the American criminal justice system, highlighting potential issues of wrongful convictions due to false confessions or testimonies, inadequate investigation, and judicial errors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If your debt-to-income ratio is higher than this percentage, you might have difficulty securing a loan until after that percentage drops.  A ratio of 19 percent or less is ideal, and if you can secure this level of financial security, you should have very little problem securing loans or taking on new credit. A ratio between 20 and 36 percent or less will usually be deemed healthy enough to secure a loan from most lenders, but you should begin cutting back once you . If your debt-to-income ratio is between 37 and 42 percent, you are in a state of minor financial crisis and may not be able to get any loans or new lines of credit. At a ratio between 43 and 49 percent, you will likely begin seeing financial difficulties in your everyday life in the near future. If your ratio is 50 percent or higher, you need to seek professional help to quickly reduce your debt. These are terms that are used when you are looking to secure a mortgage loan. Front-end debt ratios only use proposed monthly housing expenses, while back-end debt ratios use all existing debt and any new projected monthly mortgage payments.  For most purposes, you should look at your back-end debt. Many lenders will usually look at front-end debt, but as a borrower, you should look at both front-end and back-end debt to determine how much you can actually afford regarding new loans and credit. Front-end debt-to-income ratios are also known as housing-expense-to-income ratios. This percentage should be at or below 28 percent, while a back-end debt-to-income ratio should be at or below 36 percent. If your debt-to-income ratio is higher than you would like it to be, you can help lower it by implementing lifestyle changes that decrease your debt levels.  Increase the amount of money you pay toward your debts. If you can manage it, make extra payments toward your loan, house, car, or any other debt for which there is a principle you must pay off in addition to interest. Make sure that the payment goes toward your principle. This will lower your overall debt faster. Do not take on more debt. Put away the plastic and avoid making more purchases on your credit card. Do not apply for any other loans or lines of credit, either. Avoid making any large purchases. If you do not have much savings built up right now, wait until you do. This will allow you to make a larger down payment, and as a result, less of your purchase will be funded with credit and you can reduce the amount of debt you accumulate. Whether your debt-to-income ratio is healthy or not, monitoring it continually can help you avoid major credit problems. You should keep an eye on it even if you do not plan to make a major investment any time soon.  If you know that your debt-to-income ratio is on the high end, keep tabs on it every month. Otherwise, checking the ratio once or twice a year should suffice. Having too much debt can lower your credit score, causing your lending limits to decrease and your interest rates to increase. Monitoring this ratio can help you make better decisions about buying on credit and taking loans out. It can also make the benefits of making more than your minimum credit card payments more evident and allow you to avoid major credit or financial problems in the future. If your debt-to-income ratio rises too high, you could have difficulty making major purchases and you might lose out on the lowest interest rates and best credit terms. Summary:","output":"A debt-to-income ratio is crucial for securing loans and taking on new credit, with 36% or less generally considered acceptable by creditors and lenders. Having a ratio of 19% or less is ideal, while ratios above 37% can lead to a minor financial crisis and difficulty obtaining loans or credit. When securing a mortgage, both front-end (housing-expense-to-income) and back-end debt ratios should be considered, with percentages at or below 28% for the former and 36% for the latter. To lower your debt-to-income ratio, you can make lifestyle changes, such as increasing debt payments, avoiding new debt, and postponing large purchases. Monitoring your ratio regularly can help maintain a healthy financial state and make better credit decisions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: \\"New Humanist\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to? Answer:","output":"The term \\"New Humanist\\" does not directly belong to a single category among the given choices, as it is a broader intellectual and cultural movement. However, the term can be closely related to an educational institution, artist, or a written work due to its historical and cultural implications. To provide a detailed answer, let's break it down into these three related categories. 1. Educational institution: In the context of an educational institution, New Humanist can be associated with academic programs and institutions that promote the study and development of humanism, a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively. These institutions might focus on subjects like literature, history, philosophy, and arts, fostering a deeper understanding of humanism and its impact on society. 2. Artist: New Humanist can also refer to a group of artists or intellectuals who have adopted and promoted humanist values and ideas in their work. These artists may be writers, philosophers, painters, or performers whose creative productions emphasize the potential, dignity, and beauty of human beings, as well as our capacity for rational thinking, moral and ethical understanding, and human-based solutions to complex problems. Artists influenced by humanism tend to reflect on cultural, social, and historical contexts to create thought-provoking and meaningful works of art. 3. Written work: In the context of a written work, New Humanist could be either a collection of essays, articles, or books that discuss and explore aspects of humanism or a single piece of literature that embodies humanist themes and values. \\"New\\" in this context might imply a more contemporary approach to humanism, focusing on modern issues and challenges from a humanistic perspective. Such a work would engage with questions of ethics, morality, reason, and the unique qualities of human beings, analyzing how these concepts apply to the contemporary world. In conclusion, the title \\"New Humanist\\" does not fit neatly into a single category from the given list. Instead, it can be related to an educational institution, artist, or written work due to its affiliations with the intellectual and cultural movement of humanism. Examining the term through these perspectives not only highlights its potential meanings but also further demonstrates the importance of humanism in various aspects of Western thought and culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In the 1920s and 30s the airlines were just beginning. It was unusual for people to travel by air because it was expensive and dangerous. In those days, there were no flight attendants to look after the passengers. Young men ,or \\"stewards\\" helped the passengers onto the airplane and carried the passengers' luggage but they did not provide food and drinks. _  Ellen Church was born in 1904 on a farm in Iowa. She was a different child. She didn't want to work on a farm or marry a farmer --she wanted a more adventurous life. Ellen studied to be a nurse at the University of Minnesota and then got a job in a hospital. For the next few years she stayed at the hospital but also took flying lessons and got her pilot's license. Ellen was twenty-five years old when she first got in touch with Boeing Air Transport. She loved flying but she understood that airlines were a man's world. Although women like Emelia Earheart were becoming famous, she realized it was impossible for a woman to have a career as a pilot .But she had another idea. Most people were frightened of flying because. flying was still an unreliable  way to travel. There were often delays ,many crashes and the bad weathers made many passengers sick. Ellen thought nurses could take care of passengers during flights and B.A.T. agreed. The young woman from Iowa and seven other nurses became the first air stewardesses. At first pilots were unhappy because they did not want stewardesses on airplanes, but passengers loved the stewardesses. In 1940 there were around 1000 of them working for different airlines. The early \\"stewardesses\\" had to be under twenty-five-year-old, single and slim. When a woman joined an airline, she had to promise not to get married or have children. It was hard job and not well paid. They worked long hours and earned 1 an hour. In the 1970s, stewardesses were unhappy in their job and airlines had to make some changes. Since the 1970s, \\"stewardesses\\" have been called flight attendants. They are well paid and work fewer hours than in the past.

Diatoms are unicellular, although they can form colonies in the shape of filaments or ribbons (e.g. \\"Fragilaria\\"), fans (e.g. \\"Meridion\\"), zigzags (e.g. \\"Tabellaria\\"), or stars (e.g. \\"Asterionella\\"). The first diatom formally described in scientific literature, the colonial \\"Bacillaria paradoxa\\", was found in 1783 by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller. Diatoms are producers within the food chain. A unique feature of diatom cells is that they are enclosed within a cell wall made of silica (hydrated silicon dioxide) called a frustule. These frustules show a wide diversity in form, but are usually almost bilaterally symmetrical, hence the group name. The symmetry is not perfect since one of the valves is slightly larger than the other, allowing one valve to fit inside the edge of the other. Fossil evidence suggests that they originated during, or before, the early Jurassic period. Only male gametes of centric diatoms are capable of movement by means of flagella. Diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring environmental conditions, past and present, and are commonly used in studies of water quality.  - Trigonella is a genus from the family Fabaceae. The best known member is the herb fenugreek.  - Clover or trefoil are common names for plants of the genus Trifolium (Latin, \\"tres\\" \\"three\\" + \\"folium\\" \\"leaf\\"), consisting of about 300 species of plants in the leguminous pea family Fabaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution; the highest diversity is found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants. Clover can be evergreen. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely quatrefoiled, cinquefoil, or septfoil), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include \\"Melilotus\\" (sweet clover) and \\"Medicago\\" (alfalfa or Calvary clover).  - Alfalfa , Medicago sativa also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop. The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 1020 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Alfalfa sprouts are a common ingredient in dishes made in South Indian cuisine.  - Nitrogen fixation is a process by which nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere is converted into ammonia (NH) or other molecules available to living organisms. Atmospheric nitrogen or molecular dinitrogen (N) is relatively inert: it does not easily react with other chemicals to form new compounds. The fixation process frees nitrogen atoms from their triply bonded diatomic form, NN, to be used in other ways.  - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs.  - Melilotus, known as melilot, sweet clover, and kumoniga (from the Cumans), is a genus in the family Fabaceae (the same family that also includes the \\"Trifolium\\" clovers). Members are known as common grassland plants and as weeds of cultivated ground. Originally from Europe and Asia, it is now found worldwide.  - Medicago is a genus of flowering plants, commonly known as medick or burclover, in the legume family. It contains at least 87 species and is distributed mainly around the Mediterranean basin. The best-known member of the genus is alfalfa (\\"M. sativa\\"), an important forage crop, and the genus name is based on the Latin name for that plant, \\"medica\\", from median (grass). Most members of the genus are low, creeping herbs, resembling clover, but with burs (hence the common name). However, alfalfa grows to a height of 1 meter, and tree medick (\\"M. arborea\\") is a shrub. Members of the genus are known to produce bioactive compounds such as medicarpin (a flavonoid) and medicagenic acid (a triterpenoid saponin). Chromosome numbers in \\"Medicago\\" range from 2\\"n\\" = 14 to 48.  - Rhizobium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria that fix nitrogen. \\"Rhizobium\\" species form an endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing association with roots of legumes and \\"\\".  - Medicago falcata is a plant species of the genus Medicago . It is native to the Mediterranean basin , but is found throughout the world . It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti , which is capable of nitrogen fixation . Its common names include blue alfalfa , sickle alfalfa , sickle medick , yellow lucerne , and yellow - flowered alfalfa .  - Triterpenoid saponins are triterpenes which belong to the group of saponin compounds. Triterpenes are a type of terpene containing 30 carbon atoms. Triterpenes are assembled from a five-carbon isoprene unit through the cytosolic mevalonate pathway to make a thirty-carbon compound. Some triterpenes are steroidal in nature. Cholesterol, phytosterols and phytoecdysteroids are triterpenes. The triterpenes are subdivided into some 20 groups, depending on their particular structures. Some triterpenoid compounds are found as saponin glycosides which refers to the attachment of various sugar molecules to the triterpene unit. These sugars can be cleaved off in the gut by bacteria, sometimes allowing the aglycone (triterpene) to be absorbed into the bloodstream or to insert into cell membranes.   - Flavonoids (or bioflavonoids) (from the Latin word \\"flavus\\" meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of plant and fungus secondary metabolites.  - Root nodules occur on the roots of plants (primarily Fabaceae) that associate with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, capable plants form a symbiotic relationship with a host-specific strain of bacteria known as rhizobia. This process has evolved multiple times within the Fabaceae, as well as in other species found within the Rosid clade. The Fabaceae include legume crops such as beans and peas.  - Sinorhizobium meliloti is a Gram-negative nitrogen-fixing bacterium (rhizobium). It forms a symbiotic relationship with legumes from the genera \\"Medicago\\", \\"Melilotus\\" and \\"Trigonella\\", including the model legume \\"Medicago truncatula\\". This symbiosis results in a new plant organ termed a root nodule. The \\"S. meliloti\\" genome contains three replicons: a chromosome (~3.7 megabases) and two chromids, pSymA (~1.4 megabases) and pSymB (~1.7 megabases). Five \\"S. meliloti\\" genomes have been sequenced to date: Rm1021, AK83, BL225C, Rm41, and SM11  - Medicago truncatula, the barrelclover, strong-spined medick, barrel medic, or barrel medick, is a small annual legume native to the Mediterranean region that is used in genomic research. It is a low-growing, clover-like plant 1060 cm tall with trifoliate leaves. Each leaflet is rounded, 12 cm long, often with a dark spot in the center. The flowers are yellow, produced singly or in a small inflorescence of two to five together; the fruit is a small, spiny pod.  - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.

Movie title: Sucker Punch Movie plot: In the 1960s,[9] a young woman[9] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after she is blamed for her younger sister's death. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancersÂ â Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to \\"escape\\", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require \\"a deep sacrifice\\" but bring a \\"perfect victory\\". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed Blue and other onlookers.

Sentence 1: The wee small voice of conscience. Sentence 2: The incessant voices of the artillery. Does voice mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"To determine if the word \\"voice\\" means the same thing in these two sentences, I'll analyze the context and usage in each sentence and compare them. Step 1: Analyze the context of \\"voice\\" in Sentence 1. - Sentence 1: \\"The wee small voice of conscience.\\" - In this sentence, \\"voice\\" refers to an inner, often quiet, guiding or prompting thought that represents someone's conscience, moral compass, or sense of right and wrong. This usage is often metaphorical or abstract, as it does not literally relate to the sound produced by a person or thing.  Step 2: Analyze the context of \\"voice\\" in Sentence 2. - Sentence 2: \\"The incessant voices of the artillery.\\" - In this sentence, \\"voice\\" refers to the loud, continuous sounds produced by the firing of artillery. This usage is more literal, as it directly relates to the auditory aspect of the word \\"voice.\\" Additionally, the word \\"voices\\" is plural in this context, referring to multiple instances or sources of sound. Step 3: Compare the meanings of \\"voice\\" in the two sentences. - The meaning of \\"voice\\" in Sentence 1 is metaphorical and relates to an inner prompting or conscience, while in Sentence 2 it has a more literal meaning, referring to the sounds of artillery.

These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.[3] Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.[4]  Paragraph: Thomas and Joseph, two experienced squash players, are having a disagreement about which types of squash balls they should use in their match. Both have different preferences for the type of ball used. Joseph prefers a ball that bounces less and travels more slowly. Thomas, on the other hand, prefers a ball that travels more quickly and bounces more.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which player enjoys the speed of game less as it progresses?

The pig spent more time in the barn than out in the pen because it was hotter in the","output":"barn, and it was fond of the heat. The barn provided a warm and cozy environment, a stark contrast to the unpredictable outside world. With a steady supply of food and a secure place to rest, the pig soon found itself saturated in a world where its demands were regularly met without so much as a snout's worth of effort. It spent its days basking in the warmth emanating from the barn's wooden walls, indulging in the sweet scent of hay that filled the air. During the sweltering summer months, the pen outside would often become unbearable. The sun's rays beat down mercilessly on the pig and its companions, leaving them tired and parched. Their cloven feet would sink into the muddy ground, encased in thick mud as flies buzzed loudly around them. On the other hand, the barn's thick walls, made of solid aged wood and layers of insulating hay, kept them comfortably protected from the relentless heat. While the pig understood that its life was vastly different than others', it did not feel the need to venture out into the pen often. It had grown quite accustomed to the pleasantries of its barn life, and even the temptation of the mud baths that the other pigs so adored was not enough to entice the pig out of its comfort zone. It had also developed a camaraderie with the other animals who called the barn their home—the goats with their curious nature, the clucking of hens, and the calming sound of the cow's unhurried munching on cud. As fall approached, the pig anticipated that the temperature in the barn would drop and the wind would blow colder outside. It might have felt a longing for the warmth of the barn as it carried on its existence in the pen, wistfully watching the barn door swing open and closed. This seasonal change would bring new experiences and challenges that the pig would have to face. There would be the arrival of new animals, all bringing their unique energy and presence to the barn. There would be new farmhands making their way through the farm, tending to the needs of the animals and keeping everything in working order. The pig would find itself learning from these changes, growing more adaptable and building resilience. It would find strength in these adaptations, showing itself that it could venture out into new territory and still find solace in the warmth it so cherished. And perhaps, in time, the pig would learn to appreciate the balance between the comfort of the barn and the excitement of the pen, for each had its own unique gifts to offer. And so, as the seasons changed and brought with them countless opportunities for growth and exploration, the pig would come to cherish both the barn and the pen. Though the warmth and comfort of the barn would always hold a special place in the pig's heart, it would learn to embrace the unpredictability and adventure that life in the pen had to offer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A Battery's Nightmare Portable electronics that can be carried about easily are only as good as their batteries   and, let's face it, batteries aren't very good, especially when compared with, say, petrol, which packs 100 times a battery's energy into an equal space. That's why a large group of mechanical engineers (centered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but with partners at other universities and companies) are hard at work in an effort to replace batteries with a tiny engine that runs on fuel. Imagine a battery-free life! When the fuel runs out in your mobile phone, you just fill up and go. The engine---about the size of a ten-cent coin---starts with a combustion chamber   that burns hydrogen. Its tiny parts are etched   onto silicon wafers   in the same manner that computer parts are etched onto integrated circuits  . The first engine is made up of five wafers. And since these wafers could be produced in much the same way as computer chips, they could probably be produced quite cheaply. But the _ in all this nice detail is efficiency. Tiny engine parts don't always behave like the bigger parts of the first engine. Something between the parts can slow down the works, according to Columbia University Professor LucFrechette, one of the engine's designers. Extreme heat from the combustion chamber is also a problem, often leaking to other parts of the engine. The scientists' goal is to create an engine that will operate 10 times better than batteries operate. Frechette says that a complete system, with all parts in place and working, will be set up in the next couple of years, but commercial models aren't likely until at least the end of the next ten years. Answer:","output":"Which of the following best describes the goal of the tiny engine project being developed by mechanical engineers? A.

Continue the following story. In the Winter, Craig never gets sick, but Jason always has a cold.","output":"In the small town of Willowbrook, Winter was a season of frosty mornings, hot chocolate, and snowball fights in the park. For Craig and Jason, two best friends since childhood, Winter meant ice skating on the frozen lake, building snow forts, and the unrestrained joy of school closures due to heavy snow. But there was something unusual about this duo: while Craig never fell ill during the winter months, Jason was burdened with a never-ending cold. Craig, an athletic young man with an affinity for winter sports, embraced the season wholeheartedly. His energy levels seemed to increase as the days grew colder, and as a result, he became the neighborhood's Winter Wonder-kid. His immune system was like a fortress, and no pesky cold or flu could breach its defenses. Jason, on the other hand, became the town's human tissue box during winter. Despite bundling up in layers of clothing and taking his vitamins religiously, he invariably fell prey to a stubborn cold that would last the entire season. Runny nose, cough, sneezing - the poor boy endured it all. The dichotomy in their health never affected their camaraderie, though. Craig and Jason supported each other through thick and thin. In an act of solidarity, Craig would always carry extra hand sanitizers and tissues for his friend. On particularly bad days, when going outdoors was out of the question for Jason, Craig would come over, armed with chicken soup and funny movies to make his friend feel better.  As the years went by, the people of Willowbrook grew accustomed to this unlikely pair and their endearing dynamic. Many wondered about the factors that contributed to the stark contrast in the boys' health. Several theories were offered: genetics, upbringing, and exposure to germs in childhood, to name a few. Towards the end of their senior year in high school, Craig and Jason decided to participate in the science fair by researching the factors behind their contrasting winter health. They compared their lifestyles, food choices, exercise habits, family medical histories, and many other variables. They even had blood tests conducted to check for any significant differences in their immune systems. Their findings surprised everyone, including themselves. It turned out that Craig's active lifestyle and love for outdoor sports, especially in winter, boosted his immunity. His dedication to exercise and frequent exposure to colder temperatures helped train his immune system to ward off infections better than his peers. Jason, on the other hand, grew up in a family that tended to stay indoors during winter. They relied on artificial heating and minimized outdoor activities, which contributed to his body's relatively weaker defense against infections during winter months. The lack of exposure to natural elements made his immune system more vulnerable to the season's cold and flu. Armed with this newfound knowledge, Craig and Jason decided to take action. In their last year of high school, they planned to start \\"Project Winter Warrior,\\" an initiative for the entire town to engage in outdoor activities, exercise, and healthier lifestyle choices during the snowy season. They hoped that by encouraging their community to embrace the outdoors and to stay active during winter, they could minimize the instances of seasonal illness and offer residents a healthier, happier winter experience. And so, Willowbrook witnessed a remarkable transformation during the subsequent winters. Families braved the cold to ice skate, sled, and participate in snowball fights together. Exercise classes were organized, with Craig often leading the pack, and Jason, no longer the permanent tissue box, finally enjoyed winters with his best friend in the cold, fresh air. They succeeded in making their beloved town stronger and more resilient, not only to the common cold but also to the overwhelming power of togetherness and shared experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: Who does the Devil take to hell with his minions? Movie title: The Devil and Daniel Mouse Movie plot: The animated short is loosely based on the story \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster.\\"The story starts with two mice named Dan and Jan. Both are folk song artists, whose latest gig at a small music club fails to impress the owner and draw a crowd. The owner fires them and declares that since everyone seems to prefer 'rock and roll' and 'disco dancing,' he's decided to turn his place into a Rock Club.Dan and Jan then find themselves on the street with little money. Dan takes his guitar to a pawn shop to get money for food, leaving Jan alone in the woods. As she sits there, she laments how she'd give anything to be a rock star, feeling that if she was one, people would listen to her music.Suddenly, the Earth shakes, and in a puff of smoke, a large, red-skinned creature appears, clad in a white suit. He presents Jan with his card, which claims him to be B.L. Zebub, the head of 'Devil May Care Productions.' B.L. then introduces his assistant, Wheez Weasel, who shows Jan a contract. However, the enormous amount of paperwork leaves Jan's head spinning, and she decides to sign without having thoroughly read the paperwork. After signing in her own blood, Jan is taken from the wooded area, just as Dan comes back.Wheez is put in charge of managing Jan, and conjures a band up for her. Jan's musical career spans several different music styles, and soon, she has amassed fame and fortune, and is one of the most talked-about performers on stage. Dan continues to try and see her, but is foiled at every turn by Wheez.At an outdoor amphitheater at the height of her fame, Jan performs several different genres of music, before the moon overhead is blotted out by a large bird, which happens to be B.L., come to collect her.Jan rushes out of the amphitheater, with B.L. following her and changing shape depending on where she goes. When he finally catches her, he explains the clause in her contract that states that her soul now belongs to him, given that she has achieved superstardom. Jan then points out that this takes effect at midnight,... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"The Devil and Daniel Mouse,\\" the Devil, also known as B.L. Zebub, attempts to take Jan Mouse to hell with his minions. This occurs because Jan signs a contract with B.L. Zebub, the head of 'Devil May Care Productions,' in exchange for fame and fortune as a rock star, without thoroughly reading the paperwork. As a result, when Jan achieves superstardom, B.L. comes to collect her soul as part of the contract agreement. However, Dan Mouse, who has been trying to see Jan against the efforts of Wheez Weasel (B.L.'s assistant), eventually comes to Jan's aid. Dan challenges the Devil to a musical duel in order to save Jan's soul. The duel is judged by a neutral third party, a jazz-playing bluebird. In the end, Dan's genuine and heartfelt performance outshines the flashy and elaborate performance put up by the Devil and his minions. Consequently, Jan's soul is spared, and she is not taken to hell by the Devil and his minions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: Having not seen all the films released in 2002, I can't say that this is the best film of the year. I can say that it is the best film I have seen all year.  Most American films featuring black people either obsess over the American preoccupation with \\"race relations\\", or fall into the cliches of the inner city ghetto, with every sterotype imaginable spouting ebonic-phrased slang. Antwone Fisher stands proudly alone in this regard: race is irrelevant, save for one fight that may, or may not, have been provoked by a racial slur. Antwone Fisher's story is one that should find resonance with any empathic individual. He is understatedly, and thoughtfully, portrayed by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while obviously using his star power to have the film made, sticks to the background for the most part, and allows the film to be the Antwone Fisher story.  At a time when BET, and popular culture in general want to maintain the ghetoization of a large number of Americans (and Canadians too, you know), this is a film that speaks to the humanity in all of us. I just hope that the non-Black audience will go see this film for that humanity, rather than avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie whom they can identify with. That would be a sad commentary on race-relations in North America in and of itself.   What is the sentiment of this review?

Context: The air exploded in a flash of bone and steel and blood. The clash of metal rang through the forest. An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge. Ranur paused and then spoke low. \\"He bit me.\\" Char picked Lorfel and Ranur as his hunting partners for their speed and sharpness in battle. They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures. The old man dropped his curved sword, drew his bow, and fired. The arrow hammered into Ranur's chest, burying itself in his heart. Lorfel saw the gleaming arrow head sticking almost a foot out of his companion's back. Ranur fell face first to the ground.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is there 500 acres of on Upper Table Rock?  Starting approximately 40 million years ago in the middle Eocene, a braided river system called the \\"Ancestral Rogue River\\" flowed through the region where the Rogue Valley is now carved. For about 2.1 million years, the river deposited what is now known as the Payne Cliffs Formation by laying down a thin conglomerate, followed by arkosic sandstone and siltstone. Between 10 and 20 million years ago, the uplift that created the nearby Klamath Mountains caused an incision that formed the Rogue River valley. Vertical erosion, or downcutting of the Rogue River continues to keep pace with the recent uplift, with about 690 feet (210 m) of erosion occurring in the past seven million years.Approximately seven million years ago in the upper Miocene, a 44-mile (71 km) long trachyandesitic lava flow that likely came from Olson Mountain near present-day Lost Creek Lake flowed down the Ancestral Rogue River and its tributaries and spread throughout the valley. This lava formed a hard cap over the Payne Cliffs Formation. At Lost Creek Lake, the lava attained its maximum thickness of 730 feet (220 m) and thinned to about 100 to 200 feet (30 to 61 m) to the north of Medford.   Since the Olson eruption, the Rogue River has eroded 90 percent of the solidified lava. Though the andesite prevented much erosion to the caps of the Table Rocks, the andesite-capped cliffs eroded from the side as the softer sedimentary units of the Payne Cliffs Formation gave way. This erosion created expansive talus fields which surround the plateaus on all sides, creating slopes capable of supporting abundant plant and animal life. Upper and Lower Table Rock both stand 800 feet (240 m) above the valley floor, and just over 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level. There are approximately 300 acres (120 ha) of level ground on Lower Table Rock, and 500 acres (200 ha) on Upper Table Rock.The Table Rocks offer an example of inverted relief, in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after the erosion... The answer is:","output":"There are approximately 500 acres of level ground on Upper Table Rock."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: \\"If a government is not considered just, what might it be?\\"  Context: \\"If the highest echelons of the governments also take advantage from corruption or embezzlement from the state's treasury, it is sometimes referred with the neologism kleptocracy. Members of the government can take advantage of the natural resources (e.g., diamonds and oil in a few prominent cases) or state-owned productive industries. A number of corrupt governments have enriched themselves via foreign aid, which is often spent on showy buildings and armaments.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"If a government is not considered just, it can be referred to as a kleptocracy, autocracy, plutocracy, or oligarchy, depending on the specific features it exhibits. These terms, while distinct, can overlap in certain cases, and may often share common characteristics, such as corruption, repression, and a lack of regard for the welfare of citizens. 1. Kleptocracy: As mentioned in the question, a kleptocratic government is one in which the ruling class enriches itself through corruption and embezzlement of public funds, often at the expense of the nation's welfare. Such governments prioritize their own interests and accumulation of wealth, suppressing dissent and exploiting both natural resources and foreign aid. Kleptocracies frequently have rampant corruption, with members of the government taking bribes or engaging in other illegal activities to maintain power and wealth. 2. Autocracy: An autocratic government is one in which a single person, such as a dictator or a despot, holds absolute and unaccountable power over all aspects of the state. This type of government often suppresses opposition, imposes strict control over the media, and has little to no separation of powers or democratic processes. While not every autocratic regime is necessarily characterized by large-scale corruption, the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals often leads to a lack of transparency, creating an environment in which corruption can thrive. 3. Plutocracy: A plutocracy is a government controlled by the wealthy, either through direct rule or by influencing or manipulating political processes. In this system, wealth serves as the primary determinant of power, often resulting in policies that disproportionately benefit the rich at the expense of the broader population. These governments may manipulate the electoral system, use their wealth to buy favorable media coverage, or engage in other activities that promote their interests while marginalizing the needs of the majority. The concentration of wealth and power in a plutocracy can contribute to corruption, as the wealthy may use their influence to avoid prosecution or accountability for their actions. 4. Oligarchy: Similar to a plutocracy, an oligarchy is a form of government in which a small group of individuals—typically drawn from a specific class, such as business elites or military officers—holds significant power. This type of government often lacks transparency and accountability, as those in power rule in their own interests and may be prone to corruption or exploitation of public resources. Oligarchies can suppress dissent in order to maintain their rule, resulting in a lack of political freedom and limited opportunities for the broader population to participate in the political process. In summary, a government that is not considered just might be a kleptocracy, autocracy, plutocracy, or oligarchy. Each of these terms highlights specific features of an unjust government, often characterized by corruption, suppression of dissent, and a lack of accountability. Such governments prioritize their own interests above those of the citizens they are meant to serve, resulting in social, economic, and political inequalities that may ultimately hinder the nation's progress and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To be published on Sept. 14 by Dey Street Books, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers.      I was shaking, still riding the rush.      The appointment I’d just left was one of the fanciest hotel suites in Las Vegas. My body was still glowing with pleasure. This is way better than winning a race, I thought. This is better than competing in the Olympics. If I’d known how amazing this felt, I never would have wasted all that time.      My old life with my parents and husband and daughter still waited for me in Wisconsin, but I went home less and less. I was Kelly now, one of the most sought-after escorts in Vegas. Suzy, the former professional athlete, the Realtor, the wife, the mom—she had disappeared.      I flashed back to the luxurious penthouse suite where I’d spent the past two hours. It had been my first appointment with this handsome client, but I’d walked in and given him a kiss straightaway, letting my mouth linger on his. I wanted him to imagine I’d been aching to see him all day. I’d taken him to the bed, showing him that I was the one in charge. He’d liked it. Ceding control turned him on, in contrast to his daily life as the CEO of a major corporation.      I had earned 1,200 doing something I loved. I thought of my next appointment, later that night. By then I’d be buzzing even more, telegraphing that I was the kind of wild girl who could make his dreams come true.      Now that I’d devoted myself to sex, my need to be unsurpassed in the bedroom had replaced the need to be best on the track. But this was even better, because I’d hated the competition necessary to win a race. Everything about being an escort was enjoyable. I didn’t want to go back to my old life. Not ever.      Brian Lowe for Sports Illustrated      *****      As a child, I had a very active imagination, which made it nearly impossible for me to concentrate on reading or school. I had to be moving. If I was still, anxiety and self-doubt crept into my head.      My family—my parents, older brother, two older sisters and I—lived near a small ski hill in Stevens Point, Wis. My brother, Dan, raced competitively. He loved the speed and the adrenaline rush, and he chased the thrill of dangerous activities. The older he got, the more erratic his behavior became.      When Dan’s high school girlfriend died of a rare condition, Reye’s syndrome, he was devastated. His mood swings and aggressive behavior worsened. He was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given shock treatment and lithium. After the treatment he self-medicated with liquor. One day when I was 12 and he was 18, my mom and I found him passed out, clutching an empty vodka bottle. Another time my dad found Dan, drunk, pointing a shotgun at his head.      No one in my family talked about these anguishing scenes, and a shadow crept over our house. To me, ours was a family of secret pain. I wanted to make up for it. I decided to be perfect.      *****      When I discovered running, I loved that it was so pure, just my body and me. By the time I joined my middle school track squad, in seventh grade, I was so much faster than the other girls that our coach had me run with the boys’ team. But I was already faster than most of the boys, too. I didn’t like being singled out like that, and track practice became anxiety-inducing. I wanted to win, but I hated not being able to blend in.      The accolades that came with track made my parents proud. I saw that I could distract them from their stress and fears about Dan. But that made me feel more pressure to win. My freshman year at Stevens Point Area Senior High, I won the mile and two-mile races at the statewide meet. I was miserable. I thought, Now I have to win every state meet. If I were to lose, I’d let everyone down.      Feeling out of control, I found one thing over which I did have power: what I ate. Or how little I ate. Between the minuscule amount of food I was eating and the excessive training, my body was starving itself. But I was running faster. Still, with all my training, starving myself wasn’t sustainable, so I became bulimic. I would binge on a tray of brownies or a bunch of pasta and then purge.      The bulimia was full blown by the time I started college, at Wisconsin, in 1986. No matter how skinny I was, I always felt heavy, especially because I didn’t have what I thought of as the perfect running body. I did everything to hide my large breasts, ordering a team shirt that was too large and altering it to hang even more loosely on me. My shame turned to rage later in my college career when I learned that a coach of the men’s track team had shown his runners video of my breasts bouncing as I ran. In 1993, I would secretly pay 8,000 for breast-reduction surgery.      *****      Hamilton (3838) ran poorly in the 800 in Atlanta. Bill Frakes for Sports Illustrated      In January of my freshman year a friend fixed me up with one of his baseball teammates, a freshman pitcher from California, Mark Hamilton. He looked like Val Kilmer in Top Gun, with that same flattop. I thought he was gorgeous.      Mark was open-minded and wanted to talk about everything. Although he never asked me about my bulimia, he gently urged me to eat when we were together, and he noticed when I’d skip a meal. Eventually I opened up to him. With his support I stopped purging and adopted a more balanced diet.      On the track, meanwhile, I worked with Peter Tegen, the greatest coach I would ever have. He knew it was important for his runners to compete against international athletes early to have a shot at the Olympics. He persuaded the university to pay for the team to travel to Europe and race in the summers. There I saw I could hold my own against the world’s best runners. Back in college I won every national track championship I entered—nine in all, at the time the most NCAA titles for any athlete.      In January of my senior year I signed a six-figure, five-year contract with Reebok. A week after Mark and I graduated, we got married. We moved from Madison to Malibu. Mark would attend Pepperdine’s law school while I trained for the 1992 Olympics.      In the 1,500-meter final at the U.S. trials I edged my childhood idol, Mary Decker Slaney, to finish third and qualify for Barcelona. My parents were overjoyed. Signs went up all over my hometown, cheering me on to the Olympics. The expectations turned my euphoria into the greatest anxiety of my racing life.      By the night before my 1,500 preliminary in Barcelona, I was back in the dark, negative head space that often plagued me during competition. Not only that, but the Olympic Village was a chaos of loud music, drunken shouts and laughter. I lay in bed seeing myself fail again and again. I don’t think I slept at all. I would rather have done anything but run an Olympic race.      I could barely focus as I took my position. And then I started to run. I didn’t feel like I belonged among these elite athletes. I tightened up with a lap and a half to go, living the nightmare of many runners: I felt as if I were dragging my arms and legs through quicksand. The other racers flew past. I finished last.      At the 1996 Games, Suzy ran the 800 meters and failed to make the final. She and Mark moved back to Madison, and she continued to run professionally. Then, in ‘99, Dan Favor died by suicide.      *****      The shadow of Dan fell over an already high-stakes year for me. I was 32 in 2000, and it would be my third Olympics. I felt as if I had to finally make good on all the sacrifices that Mark, my parents and my coaches had made for so many years.      I came in second in the 1,500 meters at the U.S. trials. I was running great—too great. I peaked in Oslo just after the trials, running the 1,500 in 3:57, a couple of tenths of a second off Slaney’s U.S. record. That established me as the favorite in Sydney. But in the Olympic semifinals I ran second and felt terrible, as if I were already spent. Before the final I wanted to flee.      I was assigned to be the first runner, closest to the inside rail. This meant I had to get off to a fast start to avoid getting boxed in. My heart felt as if it would pound itself to dust. When the gun went off, my newly sharpened spikes gripped the track. Running in sheer panic, I pushed my way into [the lead], but with every stride my only thought was, I just want this nightmare to be over.      With one lap to go the exhalations of the runners behind me grew louder, making me feel as if I were being hunted like an animal. My legs grew heavy, and with 150 meters left the other runners passed me one by one. I was going to come in last, in my last Olympic race. No gold for Mark, for Coach Tegen, for my parents, for my brother’s memory. Heartbroken, I told myself to fall, and then I fell.      I felt like an idiot, but at least I didn’t have to run anymore. Then I realized I couldn’t leave this race unfinished. I made myself get up and cross the line, but when the media crowded around me, I couldn’t bear the shame and collapsed again. I closed my eyes and felt the medics lift me into the air.      Suzy and Mark had a daughter, Kylie, in 2005 and began working together in real estate. Suzy suffered from postpartum depression and often felt consumed by anxiety, which placed stress on her marriage.      With leaden legs, Hamilton came in last in her 1,500-meter preliminary in Barcelona. Bill Frakes for Sports Illustrated      ​      *****      By March 2007, I was barely holding it together. As soon as Mark left for the office in the morning, I fell apart. I rocked back and forth, unable to stop. It’s all too much, I thought. I have this child. I have this job. I hate real estate. I don’t get along with my husband. I want it all to end.      Driving home from an appointment with a client one night, I gripped the steering wheel and prepared to drive off the road and into a tree. I was just at the point of no return, pressing the gas pedal hard, when I thought, What if it doesn’t work? I can’t be in a hospital bed for the rest of my life. Kylie’s face kept rising from the chaos in my mind, reminding me that I had something important to live for. I was wrung out by the time I parked in front of the house. I was in a fog that whole night. Mark asked, “What is with you, Suzy?”      “Well, I almost killed myself tonight,” I said.      Mark immediately softened. He hugged me. “I want you to call the doctor,” he said. “And if you don’t, I’m calling for you.”      After Suzy went on antidepressants, she and Mark decided to take a trip to celebrate their 20th anniversary.      *****      I said to Mark, “Let’s go to Vegas.” I’d come up with what I considered a wild anniversary celebration. “First, I think we should go skydiving,” I said. “And then”—I paused for drama—”I was thinking, maybe we could hire an escort and have a threesome like we’ve always talked about.”      Mark knew I’d always felt some attraction to women, although I’d been only with him. “Yeah ... O.K.,” he said, grinning.      I was beside myself with excitement as we pulled up at the airfield. We were doing a tandem jump, which meant we’d each have an instructor strapped to our backs. In the plane we reached our jumping altitude, and in a flash I was falling through the air. Inside, though, I was soaring. It was the most powerful rush possible. I could see all the way to Lake Mead, 30 miles away. It was spectacular. I whooped with joy.      I was giddy with endorphins from skydiving when we got back to our hotel room just after six o’clock. At exactly 7 p.m. there was a knock on our door. Our escort, Pearl, strolled in looking happy and relaxed, as if she’d known us forever. She was beautiful; there was a golden glow about her. She sat down close to me on the couch. “Is this your first time in Vegas?” she asked, flirtatiously indicating there was more to that question.      “We love Vegas,” I said. “We’ve been here a few times now.”      “And what’s the occasion for this trip?” she asked.      “It’s our 20th wedding anniversary,” Mark said.      “No,” she teased. “You don’t look old enough.”      My nerves evaporated. I really liked this woman. She looked at me with real warmth. And then, still holding my gaze, she slowly stood up. “Shall we?” she asked.      As Pearl moved things along in the bedroom, she seemed sweet and classy, and I felt myself connecting with her. I also felt closer to Mark than I had in a long time.      Suzy returned to Vegas alone several times with the reluctant acquiescence of Mark, who urged her to be discreet.      *****      Hamilton returned to Las Vegas many times after her first encounter with an escort. Here she runs in the Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Stiletto Dash. Getty Images file      The Rock ‘N’ Roll Marathon asked me to take part in its events in Las Vegas on Dec. 3 and 4, 2011. They flew Mark out as well. I arranged to meet with Bridget, our contact at the high-end escort screening service that had set up our threesome. Pearl had flipped a switch inside me, awakening a certainty that I could please clients even more than she’d pleased me. I told Mark that because the service did a background check on all its clients, becoming an escort was the best way to ensure that no one ever found out about my double life. And I said I had to do this if I was going to be happy. Somehow he agreed.      I wanted to have occasional trysts, with just a couple of Bridget’s highest-rolling, most discreet clients. When she asked me why, I said, “Well, I was a professional runner for many years. It could be very damaging to my reputation if anyone found out I was sleeping with a man who wasn’t my husband.”      The next day, a few hours before I was due to run the Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon’s first Stiletto Dash, my throwaway phone buzzed. “Can you make an appointment in an hour?” Bridget said.      The next thing I knew I was in our hotel room, scrambling to get ready. “Mark, you have to take me to [the client’s hotel],” I said. “I don’t know where it is.” He looked up at me for a long moment, sighed and then explained how to get there. I thanked him and gave him a kiss goodbye. I left my husband of more than 20 years and went to have sex with a stranger for money.      I was Kelly now. This was the name I had chosen, but it was more than that. Kelly was my new personality: a confident, powerful woman who made her own decisions.      *****      My client on my next trip to Vegas was a good-looking, very wealthy Midwestern corn farmer, Bob, who was in his mid-60s. He had silver-gray hair and a confident, seductive air. “Have you ever been to Denver?” he asked me over drinks.      “Oh, sure,” I said. “I’ve been all over the West and Midwest. I went to the University of Wisconsin.”      I was too new at escorting to know that the men coveted information about the girls they saw. And I hadn’t yet learned to be careful with my words. I wanted to feel my clients and I were friends; that connection was a huge part of the turn-on. Later that night, without thinking, I referred to myself as Suzy. I hoped he had not caught it.      “I want to see you again,” Bob said. I loved the fact that I already had regulars, and I was excited to see Bob on another visit to Vegas. When I walked into his suite, though, he dropped a bombshell. “I know who you are,” he said. “You’re Suzy Favor Hamilton when you’re home in Wisconsin.”      Mark had warned me that this would happen, but I wasn’t worried. “I’ll never tell anybody,” Bob said. “Now let’s go get you some new lingerie.”      New York Daily News/Getty      Having men spend money on me was a thrill. From a young age I’d been told I was destined for greatness, and I had chased that dream on the track. Now, as Kelly, I was looking to be No. 1 again. I became obsessed with the rankings that clients gave escorts on the website Erotic Review. I thought of regulars from whom I could receive 10s, and I went the extra mile for new clients so they would write me positive reviews.      Fortunately I had a wonderful husband at home covering for me. He got Kylie up and off to school, devoted himself to our business during a nonstop workday, took Kylie to her after-school activities and made sure she was fed and bathed and tucked into bed.      Later, when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was given a list of common symptoms. None resonated more than this one: increased sex drive. Not only that, but a tendency toward risky sexual behavior with potentially dire consequences.      I had started expanding the range of things I was willing to do with clients, but when pushing the sex boundary lost its thrill, I occasionally told them who I was. I loved seeing how excited they got when they learned I was a famous Olympian. I didn’t think it was risky. We had a special bond. None of them would betray me. I was sure of it.      In December 2012 the website The Smoking Gun ran a story providing evidence that Kelly was Suzy Favor Hamilton. The next month Suzy was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder.      *****      Brian Lowe for Sports Illustrated      It is a crisp fall morning. I’ve dropped Kylie off at school. I look forward to this time, when I can move in the way my body knows best, wind in my hair, finding the rhythm that feels as natural as breathing. I am constantly in motion: running, on my bike, on my yoga mat. At those times I am myself, living the life I want, not the one that others expect from me or the one that I created out of fantasy. It isn’t perfect, but it’s a life of contentment, and for this I am incredibly grateful.      I am grateful for the little moments, such as walking my daughter to school, sharing a family meal, dancing to our favorite songs while we bake chocolate chip cookies. I am grateful that the love of my life stood by me through the destruction that was my illness. The year that followed my diagnosis was actually the most challenging of all. It took months to find the right dosage of Lamictal, the drug that finally quieted my mind. With the help of a skilled mental health team, I identified the triggers that set me off: my job, my family, certain aspects of my marriage. We cleaned up the wreckage I had created and paid the taxes I owed for my escorting.      As I run, I feel my muscles loosen. It was running that made me a role model, even though I had little desire for that burden. I came to hate the thing I loved most. But now I have a new purpose. I want to share my story. I want to have the courage to keep fighting. I want to show others, especially my daughter, that you have to live for yourself, and that with love and help you can claw your way back from a dark place. ||||| NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER      The former middle distance Olympic runner and high-end escort speaks out for the first time about her battle with mental illness, and how mania controlled and compelled her in competition, but also in life. This is a heartbreakingly honest yet hopeful memoir reminiscent of Manic, Electroboy, and An Unquiet Mind.      During the 1990s, three-time Olympian Suzy Favor Hamilton was the darling of American track and field. An outstanding runner, a major sports apparel spokesperson, and a happily married wife, she was the model for an active, healthy, and wholesome life. But her perfect facade masked a dark truth: manic depression and bipolar disorder that drove her obsession to perform and win. For years after leaving the track, Suzy wrestled with her condition, as well as the loss of a close friend, conflicted feelings about motherhood and her marriage, and lingering shame about her athletic career. After a misdiagnosis and a recommendation for medication that only exacerbated her mania and made her hypersexual, Suzy embarked on a new path, and assumed a new identity. Fueled by a newfound confidence, a feeling of strength and independence and a desire she couldn’t tamp down, she became a high-priced escort in Las Vegas, working as “Kelly.”      But Suzy could not keep her double life a secret forever. When it was eventually exposed, it sent her into a reckless suicidal period where the only option seemed out. Finally, with the help of her devoted husband, Suzy finally got the proper medical help she needed. In this startling frank memoir, she recounts the journey to outrun her demons, revealing how a woman used to physically controlling her body learned to come to terms with her unstable mind. It is the story of a how a supreme competitor scored her most important victory of all—reclaiming her life from the ravages of an untreated mental illness. Today, thanks to diagnosis, therapy, Kelly has stepped into the shadows, but Suzy is building a better life, one day at a time. Sharing her story, Suzy is determined to raise awareness, provide understanding, and offer inspiration to others coping with their own challenges. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Three-time Olympian Suzy Favor Hamilton reveals her secret life as a Las Vegas escort and her struggle with bipolar disorder in her memoir, Fast Girl.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.  I am facing a new situation today: John has just started working at a new company. Although he has been in the workforce for many years, this is a new position for him, and he is excited for it. Two weeks after starting, John's branch of the company is hosting a retirement party for one of the longest tenured employees at the office, Brad. Although Brad has enjoyed his time at the company, he says he is excited to be able to take time to himself and relax each day instead of coming into the office.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person will have a faster reflex time? A:","output":"A: John will have a faster reflex time. Since old age begins in the mid-60s and is characterized by a decline in stamina, strength, reflex time, and senses, it is more likely that John, who has just started working at a new company and is still in the workforce, will have a faster reflex time compared to Brad, who is retiring and most likely older. As people age, their reflexes tend to slow down, so it can be inferred that John, being younger and not at the retirement stage, will have better reflexes than Brad."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the two facts above, what is a reason to work with used materials during manufacturing? The answer is:","output":"Working with used materials during manufacturing is advantageous for numerous reasons, given the two facts provided: 1. Conservation of resources: By utilizing used materials, manufacturers can significantly reduce the demand for raw materials required to create new products. This has a positive impact on the environment, as the extraction, transportation, and processing of natural resources can often cause deforestation, habitat destruction, and pollution. In addition, finite resources, such as metals and fossil fuels, can be preserved for future generations. 2. Energy savings: Recycling and reusing materials utilizes less energy as compared to producing products from virgin materials. The energy consumed in the manufacturing process includes the energy utilized during the production, refinement, and transportation of raw materials. By reusing materials that have already gone through these processes, industries contribute to energy conservation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. 3. Reduced waste: Working with used materials helps manufacturers reduce the amount of waste generated. By recycling and reusing materials in the manufacturing process, there is less need to dispose of valuable resources, thereby minimizing the waste that ultimately ends up in landfills or incinerators. This reduction in waste also slows down the depletion of natural resources. 4. Cost-effectiveness: In many instances, using recycled materials can be more cost-effective for manufacturers than acquiring and processing virgin materials. The reduced costs can be attributed to the savings in energy consumption, transportation, and maintenance of raw material sources. Lower production costs can lead to financial gains and competitive advantages for businesses that use recycled materials in their manufacturing processes. 5. Job creation: The recycling sector often generates more employment opportunities than the traditional waste disposal and raw material extraction industries. By working with used materials during manufacturing, companies may promote job growth and contribute to local economic development. 6. Brand reputation and customer confidence: Many consumers today are consciously making eco-friendly choices and prefer to support businesses that demonstrate environmental stewardship. By incorporating recycled materials in their products, manufacturers can improve their brand reputation and build customer loyalty. In conclusion, working with used materials during manufacturing is an environmentally responsible, cost-effective, and resource-efficient approach that benefits manufacturers, consumers, and the planet. By reusing materials in manufacturing processes, companies can conserve resources, save energy, reduce waste, and ultimately contribute to a sustainable future for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Elephant shrews, or jumping shrews, are small insectivorous mammals native to Africa, belonging to the family Macroscelididae, in the order Macroscelidea, whose traditional common English name comes from a fancied resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of an elephant, and an assumed relationship with the shrews (family Soricidae) in the order Eulipotyphla. Nonetheless, elephant shrews are not classified with the superficially similar true shrews, but are instead more closely related to elephants and their kin within the newly recognized Afrotheria; the biologist Jonathan Kingdon has proposed they instead be called sengis (singular \\"sengi\\"), a term derived from the Bantu languages of Africa.  - Eutheria (from Greek -, eu- \\"true/good\\" and , thríon \\"beast\\" hence \\"true beasts\\") is one of two mammalian clades with extant members that diverged in the Early Cretaceous or perhaps the Late Jurassic. Except for the Virginia opossum, from North America, which is a metatherian, all post-Miocene mammals indigenous to Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America north of Mexico are eutherians. Extant eutherians, their last common ancestor, and all extinct descendants of that ancestor are members of Placentalia.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - In terrestrial zoology, megafauna (Ancient Greek \\"mégalo\\" \\"large\\" + New Latin \\"fauna\\" \\"animal\\") are large or giant animals. The most common thresholds used are weight over , over , or over a metric ton . This includes many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such as white-tailed deer, red kangaroo, and humans.  - Ground sloths are a diverse group of extinct sloths, in the mammalian superorder Xenarthra. The term \\"ground sloth\\" is used as a reference for all extinct sloths because of the large size of the earliest forms discovered, as opposed to the extant \\"tree sloths.\\" However, this is a historical convention and should not imply that all extinct sloths were strictly terrestrial in nature. Their most recent survivors lived in the Antilles, where it has been proposed they may have survived until 1550 BCE; however, radiocarbon dating suggests an age of between 2819 and 2660 BCE for the last known occurrence of \\"Megalocnus\\" in Cuba. Ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of North and South America for 10,000 years or more. Their later survival in the Caribbean correlates with the later colonization of this area by humans. Some insular sloth populations persisted 5,0006,000 years longer than their continental mainland relatives, in congruence with the global pattern of late Quaternary large vertebrate extinction due to human dispersal.  - Placentalia (\\"Placentals\\") is one of the three extant subdivisions of the class of animals Mammalia; the other two are Monotremata and Marsupialia. The placentals are primarily distinguished from other mammals in that the fetus is carried in the uterus of its mother where it is nourished via a placenta, until the live birth of a fully developed offspring occurs.  - Sloths are mammals classified in the families Megalonychidae (two-toed sloths) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloths), including six extant species. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem slow and lazy at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptations for conserving energy. Aside from their surprising speed during emergency flights from predators, other notable traits of sloths include their strong body and their ability to host symbiotic algae on their furs.  - The superorder Xenarthra is a group of placental mammals, extant today only in the Americas and represented by anteaters, tree sloths, and armadillos. The origins of the order can be traced as far back as the Paleocene, as early as 59 million years ago in South America. Xenarthrans developed and diversified extensively in South America during its long period of isolation in the early to mid Cenozoic Era. They had invaded the Antilles by the early Miocene and, starting about 9 Mya, spread to Central and North America as part of the Great American Interchange. Nearly all of the formerly abundant megafaunal xenarthrans, such as ground sloths, glyptodonts, and pampatheres, became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Metatheria is a mammalian clade that includes all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals (such as sparassodontans). First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880, it is a slightly more inclusive group than the marsupials; it contains all of the living mammals with abdominal pouches (most female marsupials) as well as their more primitive ancestors and relatives. Metatherians are one of three main classes of extant mammals: monotremes (egg laying mammals like the platypus and the echidna), metatheria (or marsupials, which includes the three American orders (Didelphimorphia, Paucituberculata and Microbiotheria) and the four Australasian orders (Notoryctemorphia, Dasyuromorphia, Peramelemorphia and Diprotodontia)), and the eutherians (or placental mammals) consisting of twenty-one orders, divided into four superorders. Metatherians belong to a subgroup of the northern tribosphenic mammal clade or Boreosphenida. They differ from all other mammals in certain morphologies like their dental formula, which includes about five upper and four lower incisors, a canine, three premolars, and four molars. Other morphologies include skeletal and anterior dentition, such as wrist and ankle apomorphies; all metatherians share derived pedal characters and calcaneal features.  - The aardvark (; \\"Orycteropus afer\\") is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa. It is the only living species of the order Tubulidentata, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. Unlike other insectivores, it has a long pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. It receives a \\"least concern\\" rating from the IUCN, although its numbers seem to be decreasing.  - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.  - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\".  - In common cladistic usage, a monophyletic group is a taxon (group of organisms) which forms a clade, meaning that it consists of an ancestral species and all its descendants. The term is synonymous with the uncommon term holophyly. Monophyletic groups are typically characterized by shared derived characteristics (synapomorphies).  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - Anteater is a common name for the four extant mammal species of the suborder Vermilingua (meaning \\"worm tongue\\") commonly known for eating ants and termites. The individual species have other names in English and other languages. Together with the sloths, they are within the order Pilosa. The name \\"anteater\\" is also colloquially applied to the unrelated aardvark, numbat, echidnas, pangolins and some members of the Oecobiidae.  - Euarchontoglires (synonymous with Supraprimates) is a clade and a superorder of mammals, the living members of which belong to one of the five following groups: rodents, lagomorphs, treeshrews, colugos and primates.  - Golden moles are small, insectivorous burrowing mammals endemic to Southern Africa, where their Afrikaans names are gouemolle or kruipmolle (singular \\"gouemol\\" or \\"kruipmol\\"). They comprise the family Chrysochloridae and as such they are taxonomically distinct from the true moles, family Talpidae, and other mole-like families, all of which, to various degrees, they resemble as a result of convergence.  - Afrotheria is a clade of mammals, the living members of which belong to groups that are either currently living in Africa or of African origin: golden moles, elephant shrews (also known as sengis), tenrecs, aardvarks, hyraxes, elephants, sea cows, and several extinct clades. They share few anatomical features but many are partly or entirely African in their distribution. This probably reflects the fact that Africa was an island continent through the early Cenozoic. Because the continent was isolated by water, Laurasian groups such as insectivores, rabbits, carnivorans and ungulates could not become established. Instead, the niches occupied by those groups were filled by tenrecs, hyraxes and elephants that evolved from the ancestral afrothere. This adaptive radiation may have occurred in response to the CretaceousPaleogene mass extinction.  - A tenrec is any species of mammal within the family Tenrecidae, found on Madagascar and in parts of the African mainland. Tenrecs are widely diverse; as a result of convergent evolution they resemble hedgehogs, shrews, opossums, mice and even otters. They occupy aquatic, arboreal, terrestrial and fossorial environments. Some of these species, including the greater hedgehog tenrec, can be found in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests.  - Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") and the Asian elephant (\\"Elephas maximus\\"), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (\\"L. africana\\" and \\"L. cyclotis\\" respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of and weigh . All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - Laurasiatheria is a superorder of placental mammals that originated on the northern supercontinent of Laurasia 99 million years ago. The superorder includes shrews, pangolins, bats, whales, carnivorans, odd-toed and even-toed ungulates, among others.  - Ungulates (pronounced ) are any members of a diverse group of primarily large mammals that includes odd-toed ungulates such as horses and rhinoceroses, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, deer, and hippopotami. Most terrestrial ungulates use the tips of their toes, usually hoofed, to sustain their whole body weight while moving. The term means, roughly, \\"being hoofed\\" or \\"hoofed animal\\". As a descriptive term, \\"ungulate\\" normally excludes cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), as they do not possess most of the typical morphological characteristics of ungulates, but recent discoveries indicate that they are descended from early artiodactyls. Ungulates are typically herbivorous (though some species are omnivorous, such as pigs), and many employ specialized gut bacteria to allow them to digest cellulose, as in the case of ruminants. They inhabit a wide range of habitats, from jungles, plains and rivers.  - Atlantogenata is a proposed clade of mammals containing the cohorts or superorders Afrotheria and Xenarthra . These groups originated and radiated in the South American and African continents , presumably in the Cretaceous . Together with Boreoeutheria , they make up Eutheria . The monophyly of this grouping was supported by some genetic evidence . Alternative hypotheses are that Boreoeutheria and Afrotheria combine to form Epitheria ( as generally supported by anatomical and other physiological evidence ) or that Boreoeutheria and Xenarthra combine to form Exafroplacentalia or Notolegia . Updated analysis of transposable element insertions around the time of divergence strongly supports the fourth hypothesis of a near - concomitant origin ( trifurcation ) of the three superorders of mammals .  - Armadillos are New World placental mammals with a leathery armour shell. The Chlamyphoridae and Dasypodidae are the only surviving families in the order Cingulata, part of the superorder Xenarthra, along with the anteaters and sloths. The word \\"armadillo\\" means \\"little armoured one\\" in Spanish. The Aztecs called them \\"ytchtli\\" , Nahuatl for \\"turtle-rabbit\\": \\"ytl\\" (turtle) and \\"tchtli\\" (rabbit). The Portuguese word for \\"armadillo\\" is \\"tatu\\" which derives from the Tupi language. Similar names are also found in other, especially European, languages.  - Boreoeutheria (synonymous with Boreotheria) (Greek:  \\"north\\" +  \\"good\\" +  \\"beast\\") is a clade (magnorder) of placental mammals that is composed of the sister taxa Laurasiatheria (most hoofed mammals, most pawed carnivores, and several other groups) and Euarchontoglires (Supraprimates). It is now well supported by DNA sequence analyses, as well as retrotransposon presence or absence data.  - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping.  - Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. Flint (a type of chert unique to chalk) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint).

Write a title for this article: Editor's note: Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \\"Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in America.\\" She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- Ah, Cliven Bundy -- poster boy for the anti-government, rugged-individualist crowd. The Marlboro Man for the conservative fantasy world. Cliven Bundy is so bizarre he leaves late night comedians spluttering. (Just check out one of Jon Stewart's riffs.) His comments about race were so embarrassing that Sean Hannity, who had called Bundy \\"a friend and frequent guest of the show,\\" had to do a \\"protest too much\\" denouncement. Yes, Hannity called Bundy's words \\"beyond repugnant\\" -- but only after first promoting him as a patriot par excellence. Republican office-holders, such as Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who had been cheerleading Bundy and his rabble also had to distance themselves, many of them fumbling with their rhetorical pom-poms in the process. Here's the basic background: Bundy is a wealthy Nevada rancher who believes he has \\"beneficial use\\" claim to grazing lands owned by the federal government. Ownership of the land is not a matter of dispute. Bundy has been in and out of protracted court battles for decades, and he's lost every time. In 1993, Bundy stopped paying the grazing fees for using federal Bureau of Land Management land. His fees accumulated to 1 million. Finally, after two courts ruled in the bureau's favor, it moved to seize Bundy's cattle, planning to sell them at auction to pay for the 20 years' worth of grazing fees. On April 5, the bureau brought in armed federal agents and began removing Bundy's cattle. Bundy's son Dave was arrested for refusing to leave. That night, Bundy sent a message: \\"They have my cattle and now they have one of my boys. Range War begins tomorrow.\\" Visions of the Wild West, anyone? Frontier justice? Or not. Bundy's supporters rallied around him, traveling from out of state. That's when the bizarre started. Richard Mack, a former Arizona sheriff, said, \\"We're actually strategizing to put all the women up at the front. If they are going to start shooting, it's going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers.\\" How's that for a jaw-dropper? The standoff lasted a week, until the bureau announced on April 12 that it would return the seized cattle because of its \\"grave concern about the safety of employees and members of the public.\\" Well, not all of them. You see, Bundy based his claim that he did not have to pay the grazing fees because -- well, here are his words: \\"I believe this is a sovereign state of Nevada. And I abide by all Nevada state laws. But I don't recognize the United States government as even existing.\\" You see, Bundy is violating the Constitution of Nevada, and therefore the state's laws. Article 1, Section 2 of that state's constitution reads, in part: \\"...the Paramount Allegiance of every citizen is due to the Federal ...and no power exists in the people of this or any other State of the Federal Union to dissolve their connection therewith...\\" Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer told Fox News: \\"This is a man who said that he doesn't recognize the authority of the United States of America. That makes him a patriot? I love this country, I love the Constitution, and it is the Constitution that established a government that all of us have to recognize. And for him to reject it was the beginning of all of this. And now what he said today is just the end of this.\\" That's the point. We can disagree about policies and politics, and even whether baseball or football is \\"America's sport.\\" Hopefully we'll again get to a place in our civic discourse where we can be civil and compromise for the common good, to move toward that \\"more perfect Union\\" the Constitution mentions. But denying the very existence of the United States? Still, that's not what had other Republicans and conservative pontificators going, \\"oops.\\" It was Bundy's obscene, racist remarks: \\"And because they [Blacks] were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\\" That's why Republicans are distancing themselves from Bundy. Because Bundy's words destroy their argument that we shouldn't talk about race. Bundy's remarks, following so closely on the Supreme Court's Schuette decision, refute Chief Justice John Roberts' misguided insistence that \\"racism will end when we stop helping minorities\\" and prove Justice Sonia Sotomayor right when she says that the act of ignoring pervasive structural racism is an abdication of judicial responsibility. Thanks to the federal government and men and women of valor who fought for those words written in our Constitution, we can have this debate. And it is that same Constitution that gives even a racist idiot like Bundy freedom to spew his lunacy while riding his horse and waving his American flag, even if some Republicans now pretend they've never heard of the guy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: Two groups of soldiers started different training programs. Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group.  and a hint : In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.  Please answer this question : Which group didn't increase the size of their muscles? Answer:","output":"The Brown group, which participated in running 3 miles a day for three months, did not significantly increase the size of their skeletal muscles in comparison to the Blue group, which underwent weight training for the same period. Although both groups engaged in physical exercises, their respective training programs focused on different outcomes and targeted different muscle groups. The Blue group's weight training program took advantage of resistance training, which specifically targeted the growth and strengthening of skeletal muscles. Resistance training, such as weight lifting, puts stress on skeletal muscles, causing microscopic damage to muscle fibers. As the body repairs these fibers, it adds more protein, resulting in increased muscle size and strength. The Blue group's training program focused on progressing the amount of weight lifted over time, providing a continuous challenge for the skeletal muscles, leading to increased muscle size. In contrast, the Brown group's running program focused primarily on cardiovascular fitness and endurance. Running 3 miles a day over an extended period strengthens the cardiac muscle by promoting a faster contraction rate and a greater capacity for pumping blood. This results in improved heart strength and efficiency. While running does engage the leg muscles and leads to some degree of muscle toning and endurance, it does not generally lead to a significant increase in muscle size. This is because running as a form of aerobic exercise primarily utilizes slow-twitch muscle fibers that are fatigue-resistant but have less potential for significant muscle growth compared to the quick-twitch fibers targeted by weight training exercises. Therefore, the group that did not experience a significant increase in muscle size was the Brown group, who focused their training on running and cardiovascular endurance rather than resistance training for muscle growth. However, it is essential to consider that both activities—weight training and running—provide different yet equally important health benefits and should be included in a well-rounded fitness program."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Republican Bevin wins Kentucky governor's race Matt Bevin's triumph comes less than 2 years after an embarrassing defeat against Mitch McConnell.      Republican Matt Bevin easily won Kentucky’s governorship on Tuesday as the GOP made major inroads in a state that had stubbornly resisted the party at the state level even as it voted reliably Republican in federal contests in recent years.      Bevin, a self-funding investment manager, rode a late surge of outside support from national Republicans to defeat Democrat Jack Conway, 53 percent to 44 percent, according to The Associated Press. Bevin will become just the second Republican to inhabit the governor’s mansion in Frankfort in more than four decades.      Story Continued Below      Polls prior to the vote showed a close race, with most surveys giving Conway, the state's sitting attorney general, a slight advantage.      Bevin's victory capped a successful night for Republicans, who picked up four of the six independently elected statewide positions despite going into Tuesday with just one GOP officeholder. Their victories included ousting state Auditor Adam Edelen, who was thought to be Democrats' top pick to challenge GOP Sen. Rand Paul next year.      It also marked a stunning political turnaround for Bevin, who has spent 7 million trying to win elected office between this run and his failed 2014 Senate primary against now-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In 2014, he lost the primary to McConnell by 25 percentage points and was mocked by fellow Republicans as an \\"East Coast Con Man\\" and a supporter of cockfighting. He entered the governor's race just hours before the filing deadline and won a May primary against two more establishment-oriented Republicans by a mere 83 votes.      McConnell even took to the Senate floor on Wednesday morning to congratulate his one-time rival.      \\"I remember when the Republican nomination was hardly worth having in Kentucky,\\" McConnell said. \\"We used to have to beg people to run. So it says something when we see spirited competition for it, which we had in the primary back in May. The governor-elect and I certainly are no strangers to spirited competition, but we're also conservative Kentuckians happy to see some change coming to Frankfort.\\"      The general election was ugly, with both candidates repeatedly impugning the other’s integrity and Conway repeatedly blitzing Bevin with negative ads branding the eventual victor as a hypocrite and a liar. Bevin was outspent for most of the contest and had his tactics consistently questioned by his fellow Republicans. But a late 2.5 million spending blitz from the Republican Governors Association helped Bevin close the gap in television advertising in the final weeks.      \\"We need a fresh start. We truly do,\\" Bevin said in his victory speech. \\"We've run this race our way. We have not chosen to go into the trough. We've taken the proverbial high road.\\"      Bevin, who has often clashed with the party establishment in the state, said he was happy Republicans swept into state offices, but noted he was even \\"more grateful tonight was such a good night for conservatives in Kentucky.\\"      Bevin's win throws into doubt the future of KyNect, the state's Obamacare exchange, and Medicaid expansion in the state. It also means that an expansion of early childhood education — something Conway had made a priority — is unlikely in the near future.      The Republican gains continue two distressing Obama-era trends for Democrats. The party will now hold just 17 governorships, down from 29 in 2008. Only one of those governors — Virginia's Terry McAuliffe — hails from the South. (Democrats will have a chance to pick up a governor's mansion in the South on Nov. 21, when Democrat John Bel Edwards faces GOP Sen. David Vitter in Louisiana's gubernatorial race.)      The Democratic Governors Association suggested that Conway was not to blame for the loss, chalking it up to an outsider-friendly environment the group dubbed \\"Trump-mania.\\"      \\"Attorney General Jack Conway ran a strong campaign focused on the issues that matter to Kentuckians: good schools, good-paying jobs and economic opportunity,\\" DGA Executive Director Elisabeth Pearson said. \\"Unfortunately, he ran into the unexpected headwinds of Trump-mania, losing to an outsider candidate in the Year of the Outsider. While Jack Conway came up short tonight, his presence in this race strengthened the issues debate in Kentucky.\\"      Jack Conway Kentucky governor concession speech: We 'respect' the result Jack Conway delivers his concession speech after losing the Kentucky governor's race Tuesday. poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201511/3205/1155968404_4596406753001_151104-conway-Still001.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\"      Despite Bevin's unorthodox, underfunded and oft-criticized campaign — as recently as mid-October, national Republicans were not spending money in the contest — his team insisted throughout the race that its candidate's ideological leanings on everything from abortion rights to Obamacare to school choice were more in line with Kentucky voters and would allow them to survive a huge monetary disadvantage. Even with the late help from the RGA, Democrats outspent Republicans in the contest, 8.75 million to 5.5 million. Bevin refused to spend heavily out of his own pocket in the general election and struggled to build a war chest while dealing with Kentucky's low, 1,000 contribution limits.      Even late in the race, when Conway's campaign was airing purely negative ads, Bevin's campaign mostly focused on \\"contrast\\" spots, mixing attacks on Conway with positive biographical information about Bevin, noting he was a \\"Christian conservative\\" who served in the military. They repeatedly said he was an \\"outsider businessman\\" running against Conway, a \\"career politician\\" and insider.      \\"Jack Conway is spending millions lying about me. It’s all he’s got,\\" Bevin said in his closing argument ad. \\"That’s because Conway is a career politician who supports Obama’s agenda.\\"      The RGA congratulated Bevin on the victory and boasted of its 6 million investment in the race, including 2.5 million on digital, direct mail and television in the contest's final two weeks.      \\"Matt Bevin’s election tonight marks a fresh start for Kentucky,\\" Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, chairman of the RGA, said in a statement, adding: \\"Under Bevin’s leadership, Kentucky will prosper with a new direction and enjoy the success that comes from having the leadership of a Republican governor.\\"      Bevin, an engaging speaker and retail politician, also spent more time on the stump than the sometimes-awkward, Duke-educated Conway, who focused on fundraising to power his broadcast assault. Conway's political career is now marked by three high-profile losses, first in a 2002 House race, then to Paul in a 2010 Senate race and finally to Bevin.      \\"This is not the result we were hoping for, but it is a result we respect,\\" Conway said in his concession speech, before turning to his two young daughters: \\"Daddy's going to be home a lot.\\"      While Republicans have dominated the Bluegrass State on the federal level, Bevin's victory was far from guaranteed. The state's last Republican governor, Ernie Fletcher, was tossed out of office in 2007 after one scandal-marred term. Before Fletcher, the last Republican governor had been Louie Nunn, who left office in 1971.      The incumbent governor, Steve Beshear, is a Democrat, as is every other statewide officeholder except outgoing Agriculture Commissioner James Comer. Democrats also control one chamber of the state legislature.      The Democratic gloom spread down-ballot as well. Edelen, who was widely expected to run for Senate against Paul next year if he won reelection, was defeated by GOP state Rep. Mike Harmon, 52 percent to 48 percent.      National Republican strategists had begun to worry about Paul's Senate seat as he mounts simultaneous bids for president and reelection. But a statement from the Kentucky Democratic Party hinted Edelen may return to the political scene.      \\"Adam has proven time and again that he is a proven champion for Kentucky’s hardworking families,\\" Kentucky Democratic Party Chairman Patrick Hughes said. \\"His record of rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse and protecting our tax dollars have set a new standard of excellence for the Auditor’s office. We are confident that he will continue to serve as a strong voice for Kentucky families.\\"      Democrats, though, may now turn to Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer to challenge Paul following Edelen's defeat.      Republicans on Tuesday also picked up the state treasurer's office and held on to the agriculture commissioner spot.      Democrats managed to hold onto two statewide offices: Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, who lost to McConnell in a 2014 Senate race, narrowly defeated Republican Stephen Knipper. And Andy Beshear, the son of the outgoing governor, won a razor-thin victory in his bid to succeed Conway as attorney general.      In other races across the country on Tuesday:      — Republicans beat back Democrats' efforts to win control of the Virginia state Senate, keeping the General Assembly in GOP hands to counter McAuliffe.      — Ohio voters handily rejected a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. More than 65 percent of voters opposed the measure in early returns.      — Republican Gov. Phil Bryant was elected to a second term in Mississippi.      — Democrat Jim Kenney was elected mayor of Philadelphia.      — Voters in Houston rejected an ordinance that would have prohibited discrimination against gay and transgender people.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What did Reznor think he should have just written himself? , can you please find it?   A remix album, titled Year Zero Remixed, was released in November 2007. Due to the expiration of his contract with Interscope Records, the album's release, marketing, and promotion were completely in Reznor's control. The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website.  Instrumental versions of the songs on Year Zero are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including MP3, WAV, GarageBand, and Ableton Live formats. A planned film adaption of Year Zero became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is \\"still churning along\\", and that he had begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender. In 2010, Reznor started developing the Year Zero miniseries with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf to create the science fiction epic.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Would Neil's Comet be visible or not visible on December 21, 2020?  Stargazers across the world wait for 2020 when newly discovered very bright Neil's comet would start to pass through the inner solar system On December 21, 2020. After December 27, 2020 the comet would leave the inner solar system. Like many other enthusiasts Ken bought a telescope for the event. His friend Mike is interested in that event too, but is too busy to buy a telescope.  Hint: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Answer:","output":"Neil's Comet would be visible on December 21, 2020. The paragraph states that the comet would start to pass through the inner solar system on December 21, 2020, and would leave after December 27, 2020. Since a comet's tail and coma become visible when it passes through the inner solar system and is illuminated by the sun, Neil's Comet would be visible during that time. Additionally, it is mentioned that this is a very bright comet, which further supports its visibility during this period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Dr. Kenneth L. Lay Chairman of the Board Enron Corp.   \\tDear Dr. Lay,  We met less than a week ago, on Wednesday 16 May 2001, during the OECD Forum 2001 in Paris. I'm an independent consultant and innovator, with a special interest in energy and new technologies. I have more than ten years experience in research and innovation in economics, business and technology. I attended the session on energy you chaired during that OECD Forum. After the session, I had a discussion with you. Unfortunately, your time was too short. You gave me your card and asked me to write you. As I told you, I think I can add value to your staff, bring new lines of businesses to Enron and with them, many new clients. And above all, unprecedented profits. I am writing you to propose my contribution in these purposes. I'm mainly making three proposals to Enron. 1.- Working for Enron as an external consultant. Here, I would rather like to work on assignments, medium or long term, with a preference for the following jobs: risk assessment and/or management, strategic analysis on geopolitical, macroeconomics and societal issues. I think these are important tasks for a company like Enron. The current problems with Enron's Dabhol power plant in the Maharashtra state in India stresses the kind of importance I'm mentioning. I can also conduct surveys and provide Enron with technical and fruitful information and policy recommendations. I've done a job like that recently, on the oil-pipeline project in Chad and Cameroon. As you may already know, this is a 4 billion project recently launched, with the support of the World Bank, and led by three major energy firms: Exxon and Chevron of the USA, and Petronas of Malaysia. I wrote a detailed and long report, which combined public and private sectors' concerns, and also communities' interests. Having operations worldwide, Enron I think needs the type of technical works I've done on that major energy project. I have a good expertise in energy economics. I attend international congresses on that subject, for instance in Boston in January 2000. Since more than five years, as a journalist or as an independent consultant, I have been covering the works and studies of, or participated to workshops and seminar organized by, the IEA (International Energy Association). I know Mr. Robert Priddle, IEA chair, who also attended that energy session during the OECD Forum 2001. I know the work he and his team of experts have been doing. 2.- Being fully employed by Enron. In this respect, I would prefer to work as a researcher for either Enron Project Development and Management or Capital and Risk Management departments. In these fields, I've also innovated. I've created among concepts, tools and processes. For instance, the \\"Sensible Guide for Action\\". This is a tool theoretically powerful and practically very efficacious. It's main goal is to help decision-makers, in both private and public sectors. The Sensible Guide for Action assists them in their approach to solve technical problems. The SGA is a five-leaf bough. I've also created a method to assess a firm capacity to create wealth. This method can be adapted to fit some particular projects. The method is very useful in countries where there's no stocks market, and where capital markets are not sufficiently large. That's the case of underdeveloped countries in general, where yet the energy demand if forecast to grow the most in the coming decades. Enron cannot overlook this, or miss the business and profit opportunities in this growth. 3.- The Business of Businesses. Dear Dr Lay, if you accept this third proposal, it will probably be the best investment Enron has ever made. I'm an independent researcher and entrepreneur, with a strong quantitative analysis competence, and a multidisciplinary background, both by education and professionally. I'm a graduate in mathematics and in mechanical engineering (University of Paris) and also in business and economics (Institut d'Etudes Politiques of Paris). In this third proposal I'm bringing to Enron two key inventions I've made, two types of financial products targeting consumers and companies. I believe they will interest Enron. These products have a market potential worldwide, unlimited. They will create an entirely new industry: the business of businesses. I'm currently looking for investors with whom I can launch those products. We will be the world leader here, and remain in that position for a long time before copycats try to reach us. I've created the products, and nobody knows about them or about their extraordinary markets. I started to talk to you about these products when we met, but you were hurrying, and the many solicitations and noises of the Forum made it difficult to explain my point. I'm writing you as you asked me, because firstly I believe these products will interest Enron. Secondly I know how these products will boost three types of Enron services: Online Marketplace; Broadband Services; and Energy & Commodities. Plus, these products, and the business of businesses they create are an excellent placement for Enron. Among the many reasons why I believe my products will interest Enron are these:  (i) Their market is global. (ii) They are directly related to consumption and savings. (iii) They're excellent saving vehicles, for instance for pension or life insurance. (iv) They concern payment transactions and transmissions (And thanks to information technology, costs here decrease while productivity will grow). (v) They are both offline and online business (These products will be excellent for Enron e-business). (vi) I want to be and remain a global leader. (vii) The products' growth potential is borderless (viii) There's no competitor and before copycats arrive we would have strongly imposed ourselves as The Leader and the Reference, increasing chances that customers remain faithful to us. (ix) My products will allow Enron to beat its competitors. (x) Enron will earn a lot of revenues, many new clients, and very big and unprecedented profits. I'm looking for investors willing to put around 7 million. Given that the revenues generated can very rapidly reach the range of 500 million to 1 billion, that initial 7 million is a wise and very profitable investment. If you're interested, I'm ready to present the products and its business scenario to you. The business model is very innovative, unprecedented. These products' market is the whole world. But the first three markets I would like to attack are the UK, Germany and moreover, Japan. Today's news about Japan is rather bad. Economists and many observers see a declining Japan. Me not. They may be right from a pure statistical and macroeconomic viewpoint. But they fail to see deeper. They overlook the other face of Japan. For my part, I see great business opportunities in Japan, today and for the coming decade. Particularly for the financial products I'm proposing. These financial products I want Enron to launch with me in Japan, perfectly fit Japanese consumption manners, their problematic pension system, and life insurance structure there. Public pension systems are under pressure every where, particularly in Japan. In Germany they are trying to reform it. But there's no consensus in the governments (federal and states') or in the Parliaments (federal and states'). Last week, Chancellor Gerhard Schr?der won some parliamentary approval. But the package he proposed is far from solving the issue. In the meantime, problems may accumulate, the situation could worsen. What seems sure is that in a foreseeable future, governments, not only in Germany but in all developed and ageing countries, will no longer be able to pay pensions at the level they have promised or are continuing to promise. An additional bad news, even company pensions will suffer. In today's \\"Financial Times\\" (Tuesday 22 May 2001, page 17), Peter Thompson, incoming chairman of the British National Association of Pension Funds \\"warned UK workers that they would no longer rely on comfortable company\\".

Answer:","output":"Title: The Whispering Stones Genre: Mystery, Drama, Adventure Plot: In the once-peaceful town of Arcadia, the enigmatic Whispering Stones have been a symbol of solace and power for centuries. These ancient mystic stones, nestled deep within the mountain range surrounding the town, are believed to contain a hidden power that can exonerate one from their sins, crimes, and wrongdoings - thus granting them innocence. As the residents of Arcadia have gone through countless generations, the legend of the Whispering Stones has seamlessly blended into their folklore. Throughout history, the townsfolk witnessed an unexpected cleansing of the accused whenever the stones disappeared mysteriously. These odd events have only strengthened their belief in the stones' miraculous abilities. The protagonist Soraya is a young, free-spirited woman born and raised in Arcadia. Though she possesses immense knowledge about the town's rich history, she secretly doubts the credibility of the stones and dismisses them as mere superstitions. Despite her skepticism, she honors the town's traditions out of respect for her elders. One fateful day, her life takes a turn for the worse when she is falsely accused of a heinous crime. The town's people turn against her, and Soraya is shunned by her neighbors and even her own family. Distraught and filled with despair, she seeks guidance from her late grandmother's journals, which reveal hidden secrets about the Whispering Stones and a long-lost cavern said to contain the stones' true power. Armed with this newfound knowledge, Soraya embarks on a treacherous journey to seek the missing stones and prove her innocence. Along her path, she uncovers ancient relics containing cryptic messages etched by her ancestors and stumbles across challenging enigmas. Through a series of trials and tribulations, she begins to unravel the web of secrets surrounding the stones. Soraya comes to realize the stones aren't her town's only secret when she learns about a hidden underground society. This clandestine group has long manipulated Arcadia and its people, exploiting the Whispering Stones' legend for their gain. They've seized the stones with the intent of controlling the townspeople by deciding who should be cast out or pardoned. As she delves deeper into the town's buried past, Soraya is forced to confront her own demons. With each step she takes on her quest, she struggles to reconcile the faith she'd placed in Arcadia's beliefs and her urge to expose the manipulation and deceit permeating the town's core. In the climax of the story, Soraya bravely confronts the underground society and outwits them using her knowledge of the stones' original resting place. She manages to confiscate the Whispering Stones, using their enigmatic power to clear her name and provide evidence to expose the wrongdoings of the secret society. Despite the validity of the stones' ability to bestow innocence, Soraya is forced to reveal the truth about their origin and the dark history lurking beneath Arcadia's facade. Upon the film's conclusion, Soraya develops into a leader in her community as she sets out to rebuild trust and unity amongst the now-distrustful townsfolk. Arcadia finally accepts the truth about the Whispering Stones and chooses to transition towards a more transparent and egalitarian society. Soraya's journey to find the truth serves as a metaphor for humanity's unrelenting quest for authenticity and courage amid adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The four-act Saul og David (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul's jealousy of the young David while Maskarade (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. Saul and David received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 Masquerade was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \\"old Copenhagen\\" atmosphere.Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed Hymnus amoris (Hymn of Love), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style.  Writing in the newspaper Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \\"a decisive victory\\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of Nationaltidende welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the Berlingske Tidende reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905. Fynsk Foraar (Springtime on Funen), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside.  answer the following question:  What composition premiered in March 1905?

Article: BANGKOK — In its most significant prisoner release to date, Myanmar on Friday freed a number of prominent political activists in a step toward meeting the demands of Western nations as they move toward more cooperative relations with the country’s new military-backed civilian government, according to news reports.      The releases were part of a presidential pardon for 651 detainees and included Min Ko Naing, a student leader from the 1988 pro-democracy uprising who served two long terms in prison. Television images showed large groups of family members and supporters greeting prisoners as they emerged from detention.      The Irrawaddy magazine, a Thailand-based Burmese exile magazine known to have good sources, reported that other notable prisoners released included Htay Kywe, Mya Aye, Nilar Thein and Ko Ko Gyi, all of whom were also leaders of the 1988 protests.      It was in 1988 that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader, first rose to prominence. The government has engaged her in a dialogue since her release from house arrest in November 2010 and she has announced that she will run for a vacant parliamentary seat in April.      The Democratic Voice of Burma, a dissident news organization based in Norway, also reported that former Prime Minister Khin Nyunt was released, along with members of the Karen National Union, a leader of the Shan ethnic group, monks arrested in the August 2007 anti-government protests, former military intelligence officials and various journalists, including five from its own organization.      Friday’s release appeared to advance recent steps by the government to move toward national reconciliation and improve relations with the outside world. Since it took office last March, ending nearly 50 years of military rule, the government has held talks with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, approved the registration of her political party and her candidacy in April’s by-election, and suspended plans for a huge Chinese-backed dam that drew strong opposition both from within and outside Myanmar, which was once known as Burma.      In another gesture that sought to address the demands of Western nations, the government on Thursday announced a cease-fire with ethnic Karen rebels who have been fighting for autonomy since shortly after the country achieved independence in 1948 from Britain.      Should Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi win a seat in the election in April, her party, the National League for Democracy, would enter the new political structure for the first time.      A party spokesman said Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi would seek one of 48 seats that became vacant after a parliamentary election in November 2010, mostly when members were appointed to cabinet positions. ||||| Myanmar freed some of its most famous political inmates Friday, sparking jubilation outside prison gates while signaling its readiness to comply with demands of the U.S. and its allies for a lifting of economic sanctions.

(Associated Press)      A Myanmar political prisoner waves his hand to his colleagues as he comes out of the Insein prison in Yangon, Myanmar, Friday, Jan. 13, 2012. Myanmar freed many of its prominent political prisoners Friday... (Associated Press)      Among those released were prominent political activists, the leaders of brutally repressed democratic uprisings, a former prime minister, ethnic minority leaders, journalists and relatives of the former dictator Ne Win. The releases were part of a presidential pardon for 651 detainees that state radio and television said would take part in \\"nation-building.\\"      It was the latest in a flurry of accelerating changes in Myanmar sought by the West, including the recent launching of a dialogue with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Thursday's signing of a cease-fire in a long-running campaign against Karen insurgents.      Myanmar likely now feels the ball is the West's court to lift the crippling economic measures.      But the United States and allies may take a wait-and-see approach, to see if government truces with various ethnic rebel groups hold, discussions with Suu Kyi move forward and scheduled April elections appear free and fair.      \\"I think we are close to the removal of Western sanctions,\\" said Monique Skidmore, a Myanmar expert at the University of Canberra, adding that the U.S. and others might first wait to see Aung San Suu Kyi take a seat in parliament. \\"There's a sense that there's still more to go before the sanctions will be removed.\\"      Human Rights Watch called Friday's release \\"a crucial development\\" in promoting human rights in Myanmar but stressed that an unknown number of political prisoners still remain detained. The group called for their release and urged the government to allow international monitors to enter prisons to verify the numbers and whereabouts of those still jailed.      Until Friday, as many as 1,500 political prisoners were believed to be behind bars, by some counts, and the exact tally of those released Friday will likely take several days. Suu Kyi's party said it was expecting the release of many of the 600 dissidents it tracks.      \\"The release of such a large number of political prisoners demonstrates the government's will to solve political problems through political means,\\" said Win Tin, a senior member of Suu Kyi's party who previously spent 19 years in prison but was released under a 2008 amnesty.      Among the high-profile inmates released were Min Ko Naing, a nearly legendary student leader from Myanmar's failed 1988 pro-democracy uprising.      Cheers and applause erupted outside the Thayet prison, 545 kilometers (345 miles) north of Yangon, where a huge crowd gathered to see the charismatic activist. Min Ko Naing, leader of the \\"88 Generation Students Group,\\" was serving a 65-year prison sentence. His most recent arrest came in August 2007 along with 14 other student leaders at a protest against fuel price increases that preceded the monk-led Saffron Revolution, which was violently suppressed.      Activists arrested after the abortive 2007 Saffron Revolution _ named for the color of the robes worn by the country's Buddhist monks _ were also freed Friday. Among them were Shin Gambira, 32, a militant monk who helped lead the anti-government protests. Family members said that he told them he was in good health.      Also freed was ethnic leader Khun Tun Oo, the chairman of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, who was serving a 93-year sentence. He was arrested along with several other Shan leaders in February 2005 and charged with treason.      Traditional Shan music blasted from speakers outside Khun Tun Oo's family home in Yangon, where a crowd danced as they awaited his return from prison.      The government recently signed a preliminary cease-fire agreement with Shan rebels, among several other pacts to end ethnic fighting. The Shan Herald Agency for News, an online news site close to the rebels, said five or six Shan political prisoners were freed Friday.      Jailed former Prime Minister Khin Nyunt also was freed. He was ousted in 2004 after falling out of favor with the junta and convicted a year later of insubordination and corruption and sentenced to 44 years under house arrest.      \\"The democratic process is on the right track,\\" the 73-year-old Khin Nyunt told reporters in Yangon, saying he did not plan to return to politics.      The United States, members of the European Union and Canada are among nations that have imposed sanctions on Myanmar. The U.S. and Britain have previously said they would remain in place until more political prisoners are released.      \\"The United States wants to be a partner with Burma,\\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during her recent historic visit to Myanmar. \\"We want to work with you as you further democratization, as you release all political prisoners, as you begin the difficult but necessary process of ending the ethnic conflicts that have gone on far too long, as you hold elections that are free, fair, and credible.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Myanmar's government has released a number of prominent political activists, including leaders of the 1988 pro-democracy uprising, as part of a presidential pardon for 651 detainees.

The peace treaty referred to in the statement is the Treaty of Chang'an or the \\"Sino-Tibetan Treaty of 821-822\\". The treaty marked the end of a long-standing conflict between the two neighbors and established peace and stability along their shared borders. The treaty was negotiated between the Chinese Tang Dynasty and the Tibetan Empire, which were two of the most powerful empires at that time in Asia. The negotiations took place in the Chinese capital Chang'an (now known as Xi'an) after both sides realized that the ongoing conflict was becoming detrimental to their respective empires. The Treaty of Chang'an consisted of various articles addressing mutual non-aggression, the return of captured territories, and rules for diplomatic relations and trade. The treaty highlighted the idea of \\"lasting peace\\" and mutual respect between the two empires. An important aspect of the treaty was that it recognized the existence and borders of both the Tibetan Empire and the Tang Dynasty and stipulated that neither empire would attempt to impose its own political or cultural influence on the other. This acknowledgment of the sovereignty and equality of the two empires was crucial in maintaining a peaceful relationship for several decades following the treaty's implementation. The Treaty of Chang'an was inscribed on three stone pillars – one in Chinese, one in Tibetan, and the third in a hybrid script. These stone pillars were erected in the capitals of the respective empires – Chang'an in China, Lhasa in Tibet – and at a border pass between the two nations. The pillar in Lhasa, known as the Doring Chima or Lhasa Treaty Pillar, still stands today as a testament to this historic agreement. The Treaty of 821-822 CE marked a significant milestone in Sino-Tibetan history, leading to a period of relative peace and cooperation between the two nations. While the geopolitical landscape has changed dramatically since the time of the treaty, the legacy of the Treaty of Chang'an continues to shape the historic narrative and ongoing discussions about the complex relationship between China and Tibet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the Wicked Witch of the West is melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy is sent back to her world, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, decides to revive the Wicked Witch and remove her powers by storing them in a magic broom. Glinda then gives the magical broom to Dorothy's friends, Tin Woodman, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow, and they become the guardians of the broom. Evilene, the Wicked Witch, conspires with her Flying Monkeys to retrieve her broom. However, a friendly little monkey named Ozzy forgets to close the gate of the castle and a battle ensues between the flying monkeys and the 'Bums of Oz.' Evilene retrieves her broom and repels the Champions of Oz from the castle. She then punishes Ozzy's father, transforming him into a chicken. Angered by the witch's spell on his father, Ozzy steals the broom from Evilene and runs away from the palace. Ozzy reaches Glinda to find she has been paralyzed by accidentally drinking a magic potion created by her niece Gabby, who is unable to create an antidote without a vital ingredient based on wood. Gabby and Ozzy set off to find the Champions of Oz. They are pursued by the other Flying Monkeys. They soon find Cowardly Lion, who is out of sorts due to the witch's spell, but with some effort they guide him to the north town, where they find the Tin Woodman, who is extremely depressed by the spell. The spell-raged Lion smashes the Tin Man to bits, but calms down when Ozzy accidentally hits him with the magic broom. Ozzy, Gaby, and the Cowardly Lion take the Tin Man's parts to the Library of Oz where (due to the spell) Scarecrow is obsessively reading books in an effort to become more intelligent. He quickly repairs Tin with the help from a clue. However, the group is attacked by the Flying Monkeys, and in the chaos Ozzy cures Scarecrow of the spell's effects, but they are unable to save Gabby from being whisked away by the Flying Monkeys.

The office smelled like money. Brand new carpet, somebody's expensive perfume still hanging in the air. The chairs in the waiting room are leather and the copy machine has a million attachments and there's pictures on the wall that I don't know what they're supposed to be. Made me ashamed of the shirt I was wearing, the cuffs all frayed and some of the buttons don't match. The secretary is a knockout and I figure Dennis has got to be getting in her pants. Red hair and freckles and shiny skin that looks like she just got out of a hot shower. A smile like she really means it. My name was in the book and she showed me right on in. Dennis shook my hand and put me in a chair that was slings and tube steel. The calendar next to his desk had a ski scene on it. Behind him was solid books, law books all in the same binding, also some biographies and political stuff. \\"Too bad you couldn't make the reunion,\\" Dennis said. \\"It was a hoot.\\" \\"I just felt weird about it,\\" I said. I still did. It looked like he wanted me to go on, so I said, \\"I knew there'd be a bunch of y'all there that had really made good, and I guess I...I don't know.

Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20.

During construction on the London Underground, workers penetrate an underground cave. A huge dragon emerges from hibernation, incinerating the workers with its breath. The only survivor is a boy, Quinn Abercromby (Ben Thornton), whose mother, Karen (Alice Krige) -- the construction crew chiefâis crushed to death protecting him. The dragon flies out of the Underground, and soon more dragons appear.

They are starving while awaiting harvest. Although most trust Quinn, some are restless and defiant. Eddie (David Kennedy) and his group steal a truck to pick tomatoes, though it is too soon for harvest. They are attacked by a dragon; one man is killed, and the rest are surrounded by fire. Quinn, Creedy (Gerard Butler), and Jared (Scott Moutter) rescue them with old fire engines, but the dragon kills Eddie's son before escaping.

Throughout the history of the European Union (EU), there have been various instances of peaceful protests in different countries across the region. People in these countries have united to express their opinions, concerns, and demands on a wide range of issues, from politics and social justice to environmental protection and economic reforms.  Peaceful protests serve as a manifestation of the democratic values embraced by the European Union. Citizens have the right to assemble, express themselves, and petition the government to address the problems they face. As a result, governments across the European Union try to create an environment that respects these democratic rights, while maintaining order and ensuring safety for all involved.  Some notable examples of peaceful protests in the European Union include: 1. The \\"Indignados\\" movement in Spain (2011): This movement, which later inspired the global \\"Occupy\\" movement, saw thousands of people gather in various cities across the country to peacefully demonstrate against economic inequality, political corruption, and the lack of governmental response to the global financial crisis. 2. The \\"Gilets Jaunes\\" (Yellow Vests) protests in France (2018): These protests began as a response to fuel tax increases but expanded into a broader movement against economic inequality and the government's perceived disconnection from the everyday struggles of French citizens. The vast majority of \\"Yellow Vest\\" protests were peaceful, with some instances of violence and vandalism occurring in certain locations. 3. The \\"Fridays for Future\\" climate strikes (2019): Led by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and inspired by her example, millions of students around the world, including those from EU countries, participated in peaceful protests calling for stronger government action against climate change. These events saw young people demand that their futures be taken seriously by those in power. 4. The Polish \\"Women's Strike\\" (2020): In response to a controversial ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal that further restricted access to abortion, thousands of people, predominantly women, organized peaceful demonstrations across Poland. These protests aimed to communicate that the decision would have grave consequences for women's reproductive rights, and women's well-being overall. In conclusion, the European Union has experienced a range of peaceful protests throughout its existence, addressing a multitude of issues central to the lives of its citizens. These events have allowed people to express their dissatisfaction, demand change, and hold their governments accountable in a non-violent manner. Peaceful protests are an essential aspect of any democracy, and they showcase the collective power of citizens when they unite in the pursuit of positive change."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

After a passionate embrace, John explains to the youthful milliner that he had abandoned their romance because Vergie's father had told him that she was pregnant by laborer Hugo McQueen and would be forced to marry. Vergie then tells John that, to keep her from marrying John, Laura's father had paid her father 10,000 to tell him that devastating lie.

Born Florence Annie Bridgwood in Hamilton, Ontario, she was youngest of three children of George Bridgwood, an English-born carriage builder and Charlotte \\"Lotta\\" Bridgwood (nee Dunn), a vaudeville actress. Charlotte Bridgwood had emigrated to Canada from Ireland after the Great Famine with her family as a child. She was known professionally as Lotta Lawrence and was the leading lady and director of the Lawrence Dramatic Company. At the age of three, Lawrence made her debut onstage with her mother in a song and dance routine. Finding themselves \\"at liberty,\\" Lawrence and Solter in 1909 were able to join the Independent Moving Pictures Company of America (IMP). The company, founded by Carl Laemmle, the owner of a film exchange (who later absorbed IMP into Universal Pictures, which he also founded and also the president), was looking for experienced filmmakers and actors. Needing a star, he lured Lawrence away from Biograph by promising to give her a marquee. First, Laemmle organized a publicity stunt by starting a rumor that Lawrence had been killed by a street car in New York City. Then, after gaining much media attention, he placed ads in the newspapers that announced, \\"We nail a lie\\", and included a photo of Lawrence. The ad declared she is alive and well and making The Broken Oath, a new movie for his IMP Film Company to be directed by Solter.  Laemmle had Lawrence make a personal appearance in St. Louis, Missouri in March 1910 with her leading man to show her fans that she was very much alive, making her one of the first performers not already famous in another medium to be identified by name by her studio.  Laemmle generated attention by falsely claiming that Lawrence's St. Louis fans were so excited to learn that she had not died that they rushed her in a frenzy and tore her clothes off. Partially due to Laemmle's ingenuity, the \\"star system\\" was born and before long, Florence Lawrence became a household name. However, her fame also proved that the studio executives who had concerns over wage demands soon had their fears proved correct. Laemmle managed to lure William Ranous, one of Vitagraph's best directors, over to IMP. Ranous introduced Laemmle to Lawrence and Solter, and they began to work together. Lawrence and Solter worked for IMP for eleven months, making fifty films. After this, they went on vacation in Europe.  When they returned to the United States, they joined a film company headed by Siegmund Lubin, described as the \\"wisest and most democratic film producer in history\\". She once again teamed with Arthur Johnson, and the pair made 48 films together under Lubin's direction. At the time, the film industry was controlled by the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), a trust formed by the major film companies. IMP was not a member of the MPPC, and hence operated outside its distribution system. Theaters found showing IMP films lost the right to screen MPPC films. IMP, therefore, had powerful enemies in the film industry. It managed to survive largely due to Lawrence's popularity.","output":"This text is about Florence Lawrence, who was also known as Florence Annie Bridgwood.

Does the sentence \\"Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.\\" answer the question \\"Where does informal learning occur?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.\\" does answer the question \\"Where does informal learning occur?\\" The sentence provides a comprehensive overview of the various contexts in which informal learning can take place. However, it is possible to provide an even more detailed answer to offer a better understanding of the concept: Informal learning refers to the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that occurs outside of structured educational and training settings. This type of learning typically takes place naturally, as individuals engage with their environment and interact with others. Informal learning can be both intentional and unintentional, and since it happens in various settings, it plays a critical role in shaping an individual's knowledge, skills, and abilities. Here are some contexts where informal learning occurs: 1. At Home: A significant portion of informal learning occurs within the family context. Children learn from their parents and siblings through observation, imitation, and participation in various activities such as cooking, cleaning, gardening, and discussions on different topics. 2. In the Community: Interactions with peers, neighbors, and community members provide valuable learning experiences. These relationships foster socialization, communication, problem-solving, and cultural understanding. 3. At Work: On-the-job learning is an essential aspect of informal learning. Employees learn practical skills, work-related knowledge, professional norms, and organizational culture through their daily interactions with colleagues and supervisors, and by performing their tasks. 4. Through Hobbies and Leisure Activities: Engaging in activities such as sports, arts, travel, or reading exposes individuals to new knowledge and skills, which contribute to their overall development and learning. 5. Media and Technology: In the digital age, informal learning has been enhanced by the availability of various forms of media and technology. Individuals can access information, engage with online communities, and learn new skills through websites, social media, videos, podcasts, blogs, and other online platforms. 6. Volunteering and Community Service: Participation in volunteering and community service activities not only enhances social awareness but also provides opportunities for individuals to learn project management, teamwork, leadership, and communication skills. 7. Through Mentoring and Coaching: Informal mentoring relationships can develop between individuals in various contexts, such as work, community, or sports. These relationships provide opportunities for learning through guidance, feedback, and support. 8. Cultural and Spiritual Practices: Individuals can learn about their cultural heritage, values, beliefs, and traditions through participation in cultural and spiritual practices, events, and rituals. It is crucial to recognize the importance of informal learning, as it complements and enriches formal education and training, ultimately contributing to an individual's lifelong learning journey. By being aware of the various contexts in which informal learning occurs, individuals can further seek diverse learning opportunities and experiences that help them grow and develop in both personal and professional aspects of their lives."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Problem:Question: I once read that JRR Tolkien, a linguist by profession and of The Lord of the Rings fame, wrote his masterpiece using elements of archaic English to emulate the Bible. Following a question on writers.SE, and comments below, this statement is not as clear as I took it. As non-native speaker, I stumbled upon a few words the first time that I read the book (in original version). It is clear that he did use a few words that, IMHO, were deemed archaic already by the time the novel was published in 1954. Most notably amongst them are the use of thou and thee. He also used less common or less modern words (or meanings), as can be seen in this list. It is even the subject of a book. As an illustration \\"Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!\\" A cold voice answered: 'Come not between the Nazgul and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.\\" A sword rang as it was drawn. \\"Do what you will; but I will hinder it, if I may.\\" \\"Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!\\" Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It seemed that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of steel. \\"But no living man am I!\\" -- J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings (source) Tolkien is known to have written a story to give life to made-up languages. And I have the feeling he used (somewhat) old(er) English for the speech of the Elves with Men, equally for educational purpose. I understand that one needs to define some terms, in particular \\"archaic\\". I would say that archaic words and/or expressions are words and/or expressions that would be out of place (due to it being too old) in a conversation of the time, and which would be noticed by the participants of the conversation as such. Or hasn't been used commonly for 50-100 years. Now, from the elements above, did Tolkien use archaic elements of language when writing the Lord of the Ring? Or do these words strike me as old because I am non-native and/or they are not so much in use today, but were faily common back then (when he wrote it) at least in University circles where he was. PS. I did hesitate to ask this question in Writers.SE, SciFi.SE, ELL.SE or here. But ultimately as it is about English language as such I thought it was better here. But please to tell me if I should ask it somewhere more appropriate? PPS. I hope I managed to limit the \\"opinion-based\\" part of the question.  Answer: The basic answer to your question of whether he used archaic language to emulate the Bible is no, of course not. There is one specific exception, however, which I explain further on. The Lord of the Rings is composed entirely in Modern English using all manner of style and register. This is deliberate. (I will exempt Eomer's \\"Westu Theoden hal!\\" taken directly from Beowulf's \\"Ws u, Hrogar, hal\\", as that actually is Old English. Nothing else is.) Tolkien himself specifically explains exactly why he resorts to the second-person singular in certain situations. Please read Appendix F, section II, \\"On Translation\\" for this and a great deal more about what he was doing, and why, when he attributed different styles of speech to different characters at different times. The Witch-king's use of the second person was intended to be belittling. In Tolkien's letter to Milton Waldman, while attempting to present a summary of the book's plot and character, Tolkien states that: . . . even in style it is to include the colloquialism and vulgarity of the Hobbits, poetry and the highest style of prose. So his mixing of low and high, and even of poetry and prose, was done with full awareness and intent. Indeed, in the same Waldman letter he also wrote: Hardly a word in its 600,000 or more has been unconsidered. And the placing, size, style, and contribution to the whole of all the features, incidents, and chapters has been laboriously pondered Perhaps the best explanation for why Tolkien ever used archaic phrasing can be found in his Letter #171, wherein he takes up the accusation of gratuitous \\"tushery\\" (archaism). He addresses the point of why one would use archaic language to represent what was (purported to be) spoken by an archaic people in this way. Dear Hugh, ....Don't be disturbed! I have not noticed any impertinence (or sycophancy) in your letters; and anyone so appreciative and so perceptive is entitled to criticism. Anyway I do not naturally breathe an air of undiluted incense! It was not what you said (last letter but one, not the one that I answered) or your right to say it, that might have called for a reply, if I had the time for it; but the pain that I always feel when anyone in an age in which almost all auctorial manhandling of English is permitted (especially if disruptive) in the name of art or 'personal expression' immediately dismisses out of court deliberate 'archaism'. The proper use of 'tushery' is to apply it to the kind of bogus 'medieval' stuff which attempts (without knowledge) to give a supposed temporal colour with expletives, such as tush, pish, zounds, marry, and the like. But a real archaic English is far more terse than modern; also many of things said could not be said in our slack and often frivolous idiom. Of course, not being specially well read in modern English, and far more familiar with works in the ancient and 'middle' idioms, my own ear is to some extent affected; so that though I could easily recollect how a modern would put this or that, what comes easiest to mind or pen is not quite that. But take an example from the chapter that you specially singled out (and called terrible): Book iii, 'The King of the Golden Hall'. 'Nay, Gandalf!' said the King. 'You do not know your own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front of battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.' This is a fair example moderated or watered archaism. Using only words that still are used or known to the educated, the King would really have said 'Nay, thou (n')wost not thine own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall...' etc. I know well enough what a modern would say. 'Not at all, my dear G. You don't know your own skill as a doctor. Things aren't going to be like that. I shall go to the war in person, even if I have to be one of the first casualties' and then what? Theoden would certainly think, and probably say 'thus shall I sleep better'! But people who think like that just do not talk a modern idiom. You can have 'I shall lie easier in my grave', or 'I should sleep sounder in my grave like that rather than if I stayed at home' if you like. But there would be an insincerity of thought, a disunion of word and meaning. For a King who spoke in a modern style would not really think in such terms at all, and any reference to sleeping quietly in the grave would be a deliberate archaism of expression on his part (however worded) far more bogus than the actual 'archaic' English that I have used. Like some non-Christian making a reference to some Christian belief which did not in fact move him at all. Or p.127, as an example of 'archaism' that cannot be defended as 'dramatic', since it is not in dialogue, but the author's description of the arming of the guests which seemed specially to upset you. But such 'heroic' scenes do not occur in a modern setting to which a modern idiom belongs. Why deliberately ignore, refuse to use the wealth of English which leaves us a choice of styles without any possibility of unintelligibility. I can see no more reason for not using the much terser and more vivid ancient style than for changing the obsolete weapons, helms, shields and hauberks into modern uniforms. 'Helms too they chose' is archaic. Some (wrongly) class it as 'inversion', since normal order is 'They also chose helmets' or 'they chose helmets too'. (Real mod. E. 'They also picked out some helmets and round shields.) But this is not normal order, and if mod. E. has lost the trick of putting a word desired to emphasize (for pictorial, emotional or logical reasons) into prominent first place, without addition of a lot of little 'empty' words (as the Chinese say), so much the worse for it. And so much the better for it the sooner it learns the trick again. And some one must begin the teaching, by example. I am sorry to find you so affected by the extraordinary 20th C. delusion that its usages per se and simply as 'contemporary' irrespective of whether they are terser, more vivid (or even nobler!) have some peculiar validity, above those of other times, so that not to use them (even when quite unsuitable in tone) is a solecism, a gaffe, a thing at which one's friends shudder or feel hot under the collar. Shake yourself out of this parochialism of time! Also (not to be too donnish) learn to discriminate between the bogus and genuine antique as you would if you hoped not to be cheated by a dealer! He does not actually write archaic language, or not fully archaic, for he would have lost the reader. What he does do at times is watered or moderated archaism, and he does this for a distinct reason given above. Every linguistic effect he used has a specific purpose that makes good sense in that context. Tolkien was a master of this, and if you think it all archaic, you haven't been reading closely enough. Look at the rustic speech of the hobbits or the coarse speech of the orcs and trolls: all styles and registers are represented in the book, from the low to the very highest. I would say that most uses of archaic language in fantasy literature written today are fake. That's because there is so much of it, and Sturgeon's Law applies. They are the very embodiment of what Tolkien complained of in his letter to Hugh Brogan. He himself doesn't do that because he actually knew what he was writing. Most people do not, and so their would-be antique language comes off sounding bogus, not authentic. About that exception. The one, and I believe only, place where Tolkien deliberately echoed the KJV is in the chapter \\"The Stewart and the King\\" from Book VI. The eagle's song found there is quite obviously cast in the stylized language of the Psalms. I believe Tolkien felt that nothing short of Biblical language could suitably convey the \\"sudden joy as poignant as grief\\" of the unexpected eucatastrophe after all but the wannest of hopes had been forgotten. You really should read Tom Shippey's The Road to Middle-Earth: How J. R. R. Tolkien Created a New Mythology, preferably the 2003 edition. Shippey discusses Tolkien's use of language at length. He also shows that all modes of Frye's Anatomy of Criticism are present based on the characters involved, all the way from the mythic to the ironic. Solution:","output":"yes"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In February 1998, the 40-year-old Saudi exile Usama  Bin Laden and a fugitive Egyptian physician, Ayman al Zawahiri, arranged from their Afghan headquarters for an Arabic newspaper in London to publish what they termed a fatwa issued in the name of a \\"World Islamic Front.\\" A fatwa is normally an interpretation of Islamic law by a respected Islamic authority, but neither  Bin Laden, Zawahiri, nor the three others who signed this statement were scholars of Islamic law. Claiming that America had declared war against God and his messenger, they called for the murder of any American, anywhere on earth, as the \\"individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it.\\" Three months later, when interviewed in Afghanistan by ABC-TV,  Bin Laden enlarged on these themes. He claimed it was more important for Muslims to kill Americans than to kill other infidels.\\" It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities,\\" he said. Asked whether he approved of terrorism and of attacks on civilians, he replied:\\"We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind. We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all targets.\\" Note: Islamic names often do not follow the Western practice of the consistent use of surnames. Given the variety of names we mention, we chose to refer to individuals by the last word in the names by which they are known: Nawaf al Hazmi as Hazmi, for instance, omitting the article \\"al\\" that would be part of their name in their own societies. We generally make an exception for the more familiar English usage of \\"Bin\\" as part of a last name, as in  Bin Laden. Further, there is no universally accepted way to transliterate Arabic words and names into English. We have relied on a mix of common sense, the sound of the name in Arabic, and common usage in source materials, the press, or government documents. When we quote from a source document, we use its transliteration, e.g.,\\"al Qida\\" instead of al Qaeda. Though novel for its open endorsement of indiscriminate killing,  Bin Laden's 1998 declaration was only the latest in the long series of his public and private calls since 1992 that singled out the United States for attack. In August 1996,  Bin Laden had issued his own self-styled fatwa calling on Muslims to drive American soldiers out of Saudi Arabia.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What reasons does  Bin Laden give for issuing a fatwa on all Americans?\\" is \\"He claimed that America had declared war against God and his messenger\\"?","output":"Yes, that's right!

Hill town was full of gasoline powered vehicles, while Valley town 50 miles away, banned all gas powered vehicles and allows only electrical vehicles or horse-and-buggies.  Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.

Write a title for this article: WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve agreed Tuesday to raise the amount of capital that big banks must hold to prevent their collapse and reduce the threat they pose to the broader financial system. The higher capital requirements were mandated by Congress in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. They are also in accordance with international standards agreed to after the downturn. Banks had lobbied to modify the requirements on higher capital, saying they could hamper their ability to lend. But experts said most big banks have already increased their capital reserves. ‘‘With these revisions to our capital rules, banking organizations will be better able to withstand periods of financial stress, thus contributing to the overall health of the US economy,’’ said Fed chairman Ben Bernanke. But critics say the rule failed to go far enough and kept taxpayers at risk of having to bail out banks again, should they suffer the kinds of losses incurred during the crisis. ‘‘The rule announced by the Federal Reserve today fails to learn the lesson of the most recent crisis and makes the next crisis — and more bailouts — more likely,’’ said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets Inc., a nonprofit bank watchdog group. Hundreds of US banks received federal bailouts during the financial crisis that struck in 2008 and triggered the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. The list included the nation’s largest financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. The banking industry has been recovering steadily since then, with overall profits rising and banks starting to lend more freely. Under the rule, all banks will need to maintain a level of high-quality capital equal to 4.5 percent of their loans and other assets, weighted by how risky those assets are. A Fed staff memo said that banks with more than 10 billion in assets and more than 95 percent of those with less than 10 billion in assets would meet the 4.5 percent capital requirement. There is currently a 4 percent requirement for capital but it is not restricted to just high-quality capital, such as bank stock or retained earnings. The nation’s 19 largest banks with assets of 250 billion or more will have to start meeting the requirements by Jan. 1. All other banks will have to begin meeting the requirements a year later. The rules will be fully phased in by the end of 2018. The final rule dropped a provision from an earlier draft that required banks to hold higher amounts of capital for mortgage loans judged to be risky. The change was made after the housing industry and smaller community banks argued against this rule.

Sentence 2: The Congress shares veto powers with the Senate.

These factors contributed to a slower start for the 107th Congress in establishing their legislative agenda and policy-making roles.  The second sentence claims that \\"the Congress shares veto powers with the Senate.\\" This statement is not entirely accurate, as it seems to misunderstand the structure and functioning of the United States legislative branch.  The U.S. legislative branch consists of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Collectively, they are known as Congress. Therefore, stating that \\"Congress shares veto powers with the Senate\\" is inaccurate because the Senate is a part of Congress.  Moreover, veto powers are typically not associated directly with Congress in the U.S. political system. Veto powers are primarily held by the President of the United States. Congress can pass a bill, but the President has the authority to veto it. If a bill is vetoed, Congress can override the President's veto by achieving a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers (Senate and House of Representatives). In this sense, Congress has the power to override a presidential veto, but they do not possess direct veto powers like the President. In conclusion, the second sentence is not true if we consider the overall context of the U.S. legislative branch and the separation of powers. The first sentence does not provide any relevant information to determine the accuracy of the second sentence, and upon further analysis, the second sentence is found to be incorrect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.  - Irises is one of many paintings and prints of irises by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh . Irises was painted while Vincent van Gogh was living at the asylum at Saint Paul - de - Mausole in Saint - Rémy - de - Provence , France , in the last year before his death in 1890 . It was painted before his first attack at the asylum . There is a lack of the high tension which is seen in his later works . He called the painting \`\` the lightning conductor for my illness '' because he felt that he could keep himself from going insane by continuing to paint . The painting was influenced by Japanese ukiyo - e woodblock prints like many of his works and those by other artists of the time . The similarities occur with strong outlines , unusual angles , including close - up views , and also flattish local colour ( not modelled according to the fall of light ) . He considered this painting a study which is probably why there are no known drawings for it , although Theo , Van Gogh 's brother , thought better of it and quickly submitted it to the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in September 1889 , together with Starry Night Over the Rhone . He wrote to Vincent of the exhibition : \`\` ( It ) strikes the eye from afar . The Irises are a beautiful study full of air and life . ''  - Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.

One of them suggested everyone be searched, to which all agreed, except Blustering. \\"You refuse, then?\\" asked Grandin. Blustering said with a red face, \\"Yes, I cannot allow it.\\" One by one, the others turned out their pockets. When the coin failed to appear, attention was focused on poor Blustering.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What group of people were the most abundant in Brazil in 1872?  White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians. The answer is:","output":"In 1872, the most abundant group of people in Brazil were the \\"browns,\\" also known as \\"mulattoes\\" or people of mixed-race background, comprising 38.3% of the population.

The second most abundant group were the \\"whites,\\" or White Brazilians, which made up 38.1% of the population and were mainly descended from the original Portuguese settlers and other European immigrants such as Italians, Spaniards, and Germans. It is important to note that the data available for this period might be problematic due to the lack of reliable information prior to 1872.

No thorns in Synetic’s wordless yet enchanting ‘Sleeping Beauty’ When Irina Tsikurishvili slowly enters as the malevolent witch in Synetic Theater’s new wordless staging of “Sleeping Beauty,” she moves like smoke. The mesmerizing Tsikurishvili is even dressed like smoke, in filmy black layers that practically float around her as the nameless witch — not called Maleficent — infiltrates and darkens this evergreen fairy tale. That’s just one of many stylish elements in Synetic’s quick-moving and largely pretty “Sleeping Beauty.” The fable is reinvented by adapter Nathan Weinberger to give the witch a sympathetic backstory and a son who falls for Sleeping Beauty, here named Briar Rose. But it’s also told with an enchanting sense of magic that should appeal to adults and kids, even though the only thing Disney-like about Paata Tsikurishvili’s production is an underlying faith that in fairy tales, everything can be alive. That certainly goes for Phil Charlwood’s set, which is dominated by a dozen floor-to-ceiling strips of fabric that become everything from wind to fire to ghosts bedeviling the prince. The ghosts are a particularly neat trick, with hidden actors pressing their faces into the fabric. The imprints vanish — poof! — when the prince tries to touch them. Other nifty visuals include shadow play as the witch foretells her curse that the king and queen’s daughter, Briar Rose, will prick her finger on a spindle. The show is launched with the witch, in happier times, blessing her own baby with what seems to be stardust depicted by Riki Kim’s fine projections. The tale is powered by an original score from Synetic’s Konstantine Lortkipanidze, whose electronic soundtrack could be called cinematic or balletic, depending on whether the performers are dancing a pas de deux or impersonating frightened deer as a forest burns. It’s not really a dance show, although Irina Tsikurishvili, doubling as choreographer, does create a swirling romantic encounter for Briar Rose (Eliza Smith) and the prince (Zana Gankhuyag), and although the trio of klutzy fairy godmothers (daffily depicted by Kathy Gordon, Francesca Blume and Emily Whitworth) seem to be elegant dancers in their own minds. It is, of course, a perpetual-motion show, with performers taking cues from a lush and shifting environment that includes Brian Allard’s busy guiding lights. The snappy look even extends to Kendra Rai’s flattering costumes hugging the actors’ bodies or flowing as they move: Note the witch’s wispy black strands, the prince’s floor-length greatcoat and the fetching, fluttering winged outfits for the three fairies trying to keep Briar Rose in line. Smith’s Briar Rose is a young princess just coming into her own; her movements are nimble and fluid, with an elegance that feels fresh, slightly unsteady and exciting. Gankhuyag’s prince is robust but more generically heroic — and generic, unfortunately, is the word for the big Hollywood-style faceoff at the end, with actors flexing and punching the air as the lights and score roar into overdrive. That’s just about the only wrinkle. Irina Tsikurishvili is a sinewy, sinister spellbinder as the witch. The show seems to slow down and expand around her each time she appears. And for most of the evening the rest of “Sleeping Beauty” capers along inventively, an appealing addition to Synetic’s body of work. Sleeping Beauty adapted by Nathan Weinberger.

Write an article with the title: \\"Love may be as good as morphine\\"","output":"Title: Love May Be as Good as Morphine Introduction Love, a powerful yet enigmatic emotion, has had poets, philosophers, and psychologists delving into its mysterious depths for centuries. This profoundest of emotions not only has the potential to change lives and make hearts swoon but also stands unmasked as a potent analgesic. Recent research suggests that love, like morphine, may play an essential role in pain management, turning it into a surprising contender for other more conventional pain treatments available today. The aim of this article is to discuss the neurochemistry and psychology behind love's pain-relieving effects and contemplate the applications of this knowledge in practice. The Science of Love: A Potent Pain Relief Source A growing body of evidence from numerous scientific studies conducted over the years indicates that love holds powerful pain-relief properties. Romantic love, in particular, triggers the release of specific neurotransmitters and hormones, such as oxytocin, dopamine, and endorphins, in the brain which are known to have analgesic effects. Oxytocin, popularly referred to as the \\"love hormone\\" or \\"cuddle hormone,\\" is a neuropeptide released by the hypothalamus and most commonly associated with childbirth and lactation. But its powerful effects transcend maternal and romantic connections. It is known to promote social bonding, trust, and relaxation, and it has been shown to reduce anxiety and pain perception. Oxytocin essentially plays a key role in forming an emotional buffer against stress and pain. Similarly, dopamine, a neurotransmitter often referred to as the \\"feel-good\\" hormone, plays an essential role in our experience of pleasure, motivation, and reward. When you are in romantic love, the brain releases surges of dopamine, making you feel euphoric and motivated. The increased dopamine levels in our brains can have a marked analgesic effect, reducing our perception of pain. Lastly, endorphins, chemicals produced in the brain, function as natural painkillers and are structurally similar to morphine, which is a potent opioid. The release of endorphins can create a sense of well-being and even euphoria, making them an essential component in the brain's natural system for alleviating pain. Love vs. Morphine: Pain Relief Properties Morphine and other opioids are known to provide powerful alleviation from pain and discomfort by binding to and activating opioid receptors in our body. But the downside is their potential to cause addiction, dependence, and harmful side effects. In contrast, the natural, pain-relieving neurochemical cocktail released when we experience love is not overshadowed by such negative consequences. Furthermore, love, unlike morphine, is not restricted to specific physiological processes. It extends beyond the mere alleviation of physical pain and fosters emotional healing and psychological well-being, creating a sense of connection, trust, and emotional resilience that may promote faster recovery from illness, injury, or surgery. Application and Future Prospects In light of this knowledge, healthcare professionals and patients alike might explore the potential of love's therapeutic effects to manage pain. Although it may not replace conventional pain treatment options, incorporating love and nurturing environments into pain management practices could be a valuable adjunct, with little or no side effects. The understanding of love's powerful pain-relieving properties also poses an interesting challenge to therapists, social workers, and psychologists. They might develop methods to harness the emotions and human experiences associated with love, facilitating social bonding, and creating nurturing environments to improve pain management and overall mental well-being. Conclusion Though much remains to be uncovered about this fascinating connection, love's potential as an alternative or added pain relief option cannot be understated, with the tantalizing possibility of benefits that conventional drugs cannot promise. Love, this most mysterious human emotion, might indeed be as good as, if not better than morphine, paving the way for new approaches to pain management and promoting holistic healing through nurturing connections and emotional resilience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both directors have made significant contributions to the world of cinema, but they hail from different countries in Europe, with distinct cultural backgrounds and filmmaking traditions. Fritz Lang was born on December 5, 1890, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now Austria). He is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, particularly for his pioneering work in German Expressionist cinema. Lang began his career in the 1910s and gained international recognition for films such as \\"Metropolis\\" (1927), \\"M\\" (1931), and \\"The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\\" (1933). As his career progressed, Lang moved to the United States in the 1930s, where he continued to direct films until the early 1960s. Despite spending a significant portion of his career in the United States, he is primarily identified with his homeland of Austria and Germany due to his early work in the German film industry. Christophe Gans, on the other hand, was born on March 11, 1960, in Antibes, France. He is a French film director, screenwriter, and producer known for his work in various genres, including action, horror, and fantasy. Gans is an avid fan of Japanese culture, manga, and anime, which have influenced a number of his films. Some of Gans' most notable works include adapting the video game \\"Silent Hill\\" into a successful horror film in 2006 and directing the French fantasy action film \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\" (2001), which received both critical acclaim and box office success. Gans is primarily associated with the French film industry, drawing from the country's rich cinematic tradition. In conclusion, Fritz Lang and Christophe Gans are not from the same country. Lang was born in Austria and is primarily associated with the Austrian and German film industries, while Gans was born in France and has been an active figure in French cinema. Although both directors share a passion for filmmaking, their geographical origins and cultural influences set them apart."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

There'd be a riot every time.\\" At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, 50 National Guardsmen were added to the police security to ensure that the crowd would not cause a ruckus.

The album includes \\"Old Shep\\", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA session. According to Guralnick, one can hear \\"in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique.\\" Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from \\"That's All Right\\" through Elvis, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that \\"these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become.\\"Presley returned to the Sullivan show at its main studio in New York, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy. His first motion picture, Love Me Tender, was released on November 21. Though he was not top billed, the film's original title—The Reno Brothers—was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: \\"Love Me Tender\\" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who do Mrs. Travers and Foljame regard as their masters?  In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles. Charles persuades the khedive to accept Myers' cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to Clarissa.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Palermo The majority of Sicilians preferred independence to the Savoia kingdom; in 1866, Palermo became the seat of a week-long popular rebellion, which was finally crushed after Martial law was declared. The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo, for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families, like the Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio, and others. In the early twentieth century Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libertà. These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the Art Nouveau style. Many of these were designed by the famous architect Ernesto Basile. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family, is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge Teatro Massimo was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, and built by the Rutelli & Machì building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What was given to Napoleon's force?\\" is in \\"Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the Armée d'Angleterre, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

News article: It was so horrific it became national news: Two years ago my three little girls were killed when my sister-in-law drove the wrong way down a New York highway. People wonder how you can go on after a tragedy like that. The answer is, you have to.      How It Happened      My life changed so dramatically on July 26, 2009, that I sometimes wonder if I'm still the same person. I used to hear stories of awful tragedies and think of all the reasons it could never happen to me. I found out that the unthinkable can happen to any of us.      On that Sunday afternoon Diane Schuler drove a minivan the wrong way on the Taconic Parkway in New York and slammed headfirst into an oncoming SUV. Eight people died in the collision, including three little girls who were sitting in the minivan's backseat.      I am the mother of those beautiful girls: Emma, Alyson, and Katie, ages 8, 7, and 5.      The girls had gone off for a weekend camping trip with their aunt Diane, uncle Danny, and cousins Bryan and Erin, ages 5 and 2. They had been excited about this annual event, and they checked in with us many times over the weekend to tell us how much fun they were having. I missed them but I felt confident that they were safe, since my husband, Warren, and I had sent them away with my sister-in-law, the most responsible person I knew. Then came the conversation that I replay in my head a dozen times a day.      On the drive back home, Emma, our oldest, called us from the car and said, \\"Something is wrong with Aunt Diane.\\" I heard other children crying in the background and then the phone cut out. Warren called back immediately and when he spoke to his sister, she didn't sound right. He told her not to drive -- to pull over right away. We thought she was having a stroke. He got Emma on the phone to describe exactly where they were. I stayed home and called 911; Warren raced off to try to find them.      But by then it was too late. Instead of stopping, Diane drove the wrong way down an exit ramp, continued along the highway and hit the SUV. My three kids, Diane and her daughter, Erin, 2, were all killed. The three men in the SUV also died. Only my nephew Bryan, now 7, survived the crash.      When something this terrible happens, your brain simply can't process it -- or at least mine couldn't. For weeks after the accident I'd wake up thinking it was that Sunday again and that the girls were heading home. And every day my husband or one of my friends would have to tell me the awful news all over again.      For the first month friends stayed at my house 24 hours a day -- sleeping on the couch or sitting outside our bedroom door. It wasn't just to keep me company. I was so dazed with grief that I'd wander out of my room or out of the house at all hours. I don't know what I was doing -- searching for the girls? My friends and family would gently steer me back where I belonged. They were amazing, helping with everything, including dealing with all the phone calls from Oprah and Dr. Phil and other talk shows. News helicopters were circling over my house and police had to rope off our street since so many reporters had gathered. But I didn't talk to anyone. I couldn't.      Since the accident I've spoken to other moms who've lost a child, and they usually say that they needed to stay strong for the children they still have. I didn't even have that. All I could think about was Emma, Alyson, and Katie, my three beautiful girls, and all the wonderful things they'd never do, never see.      The girls were very different, but they had an incredible bond. Emma was a good student and was into sports, everything from gymnastics to basketball. She enjoyed performing onstage, but the role she took most seriously was being a big sister. Alyson loved a good time and wanted to be sure everyone was included in it -- which they always were, since her smile and laugh were contagious. And Katie, the baby, was all about the hugs and kisses, which she gave freely and asked for often. And she idolized her older sisters. My girls were more than just siblings. They were best friends.      We're family, so we buried the girls next to Diane and Erin. But I had no idea at the funeral what we would find out later. Toxicology reports showed that Diane had a blood alcohol level double the legal limit, along with evidence she'd been smoking marijuana. Warren and I were stunned.      People always ask how I feel about Diane. You can't imagine how complex that question is. How does a person go from being like a sister to me -- adored by my girls and cherished by my husband -- to being the one who ruined our lives? How could this person I trusted completely have done something so unthinkable that I couldn't -- and still can't -- wrap my head around it? I pray every day that there is another explanation. To not have any answers is torture. I don't know how to describe that pain.      When something like this happens, you want to be able to hate someone. When I see the misery in Warren's eyes, I know what he's thinking. It was his sister who did this, his sister who destroyed our lives. I can't blame him for her actions. And since Diane's not here, I can't take out my anger, my confusion, or my heartache on her. There's no one left to hate. And anyway, we both loved her very much.      Warren and I have struggled with our grief, and the differences in how we grieve, from the first day. He copes by staying busy and trying not to think about it. I'm the opposite: I need to talk. We are different people, but we're both broken. I need someone to help me to take the pain away. But how can Warren do that for me when he is in the same place, struggling with his own pain? When I look to him for strength, all I see is heartache.      People are always quoting the statistics on how few marriages survive the death of a child. When you factor in our extraordinary circumstances, you really begin to wonder how Warren and I can hold on. But I love him very much -- that part hasn't changed. For that reason, and for the love of my daughters and the family that I cherished, I am holding on to my husband and to the idea that we can survive this. But I have to admit that it's not easy to do.      The split in our extended family makes it even harder. Warren and I have remained private until now, but Diane's husband, Danny, went public to defend her reputation and to search for another explanation for what happened to her. As I write this, I know that a television special made with his permission is about to air on HBO. I can't imagine what it will say. I hope there are answers to all our questions, but I don't know if I'll even be able to watch it. The film is called There's Something Wrong with Aunt Diane. The fact that they used my daughter Emma's last words as a title only makes it that much more painful.      I miss my niece, Erin. And my godson, Bryan, the only survivor -- I love him and think of him every day. I am hoping I get strong enough to have a relationship with him again. He was in the car, the last person to see and hear my girls. I have so many questions, too many for a little boy to answer. I have to be able to trust myself around him and right now I don't. I want to reach out and hug him and at the same time try to shake answers out of him, answers he doesn't have. So for now, I stay away.      After the accident, desperate for answers, I visited many priests and asked why all my girls were taken. \\"They needed to be together,\\" I was told over and over again. That just made me angrier.

How could I believe that God had been listening to my prayers? ||||| Two years ago, Jackie Hance lost everything when all three of her daughters died in a gruesome wrong-way car crash on New York's Taconic Parkway. But today, she is pregnant again after undergoing in vitro fertilization in a twist of fate that she says came from a dream about her beloved daughters.      Hance, 40, of Floral Park, N.Y., announced her pregnancy just as HBO is ready to air its own documentary, \\"Something's Wrong With Aunt Diane,\\" on the drunk-driving accident.      The girls were killed on their way home from a camping trip in upstate New York when their aunt, Diane Schuler, 36, drove 70 mph down the wrong side of the parkway for two miles before slamming her SUV head-on into another vehicle.      Toxicology reports showed that Schuler's blood alcohol level was twice the limit -- the equivalent of 10 shots of vodka -- and she was high on marijuana.      Just minutes before the deadly crash, Hance's daughter, Emma, had called her mother to say, \\"Something's wrong with Aunt Diane.\\"      Hance's girls, Emma, 8; Alyson, 7; and Katie, 5, as well as Schuler and her 2-year-old daughter Erin died instantly. Three men in the other vehicle also died, a total of eight people. The only survivor was Schuler's son Bryan, 5.      \\"Parenting is not something you can ever let go of, even if your children are gone,\\" Hance wrote in the Ladies Home Journal this week.      Hance is expecting her baby in September. But psychologists say having a baby too soon after the death of a child is no panacea for grief.      Hance writes that her friends persuaded her to have another child as a way of coping with the \\"torture\\" that she has felt since her girls died, unable even to cook because it reminds her of her daughters' excitement at mealtime.      \\"After the accident so many people suggested that Warren and I consider having another child. They said having a baby was what the girls would want and it would give us a future,\\" she writes.      Experts say the term \\"replacement child\\" is a cruel one, suggesting that a parent wipes out the agonizing grief of the death of one child with the birth of another.      Just last year, actors John Travolta, 57, and his wife Kelly Preston, 48, had a baby boy, Benjamin, after the loss of their 16-year-old son Jett in 2009 after he had a seizure at their vacation villa in the Bahamas.      So, too, did former presidential candidate John Edwards and his then-wife Elizabeth after the death of their son Wade in a North Carolina car crash. The had two children, Emma, now 13, and Jack, 11.      When a child dies, many parents have a \\"natural urge\\" to have another, according to Katherine Shear, professor of psychiatry and social work at Columbia University who specializes in complicated grief.      \\"A lot of parents do wish to have another child to come to terms with the loss,\\" she said. \\"After they've accepted the loss, it's a very natural part of life and can be a very healing thing to do.\\"      \\"When they do this, it's usually with a little bit of sadness and trepidation even when they know it's the right thing for them, and I don't think we should judge them,\\" she said. \\"When they make that decision, it's a hard one to make and we should primarily support them.\\"      Replacement Child Can Compound Grief      Other psychologists say that having another child so quickly after such a tragic loss can compound the devastation, leaving the grief process unresolved. The pain felt by bereaving parents is one of the most intense of all sorrows and the most complicated.      \\"In Western culture, all feelings of hope and meaning and expectations are projected on to the child,\\" said Therese Rando, a Rhode Island psychologist who wrote, \\"How to Go on Living When Someone You Love Dies\\"      Overcoming that grief can be difficult, especially if parents remember times they were angry with the child.      \\"When we lose a child, we feel our expectations are violated,\\" said Rando.      \\"It's like losing a lung, it's so central,\\" she said. \\"There is more guilt, more anger and more shattered pain, and other people in society are terrified of you because if it can happen to your child, it can happen to mine.\\"      As the child's protector, we have \\"basically failed at the task\\" if a child dies, according to Rando. \\"We are assaulted. There is a sense of powerlessness and inability to carry out our role as parents.\\"      Having another child after the \\"work of grieving\\" is over, can be a good idea, but not to replace the loss.      \\"The new pregnancy should not be an attempt to deal with the sadness,\\" she said. \\"They will see this new little person as a distinct member of their family.\\"      Hance said that she had her tubes tied after having her third child, but decided to do IVF after a doctor offered the procedure after hearing her story.      She said her daughters came to her in a dream: \\"I was standing in heaven and I could see Emma, Alyson, and Katie through these big gates. God would not let me inside the gates. He said that I had been given a gift from that doctor and I had to use his gift before I could be with my babies.\\"      Dr. Richard Paulson, director USC Fertility in Los Angeles, said that having another child can sometimes fulfill the dreams of a complete family.      \\"It's not a replacement child, it's a reconstituted family,\\" said \\"Because that person is gone, you don't replace that person,\\" he said.      Paulson said he had worked with many patients seeking another pregnancy after the death of a child.      \\"People variously go through the grieving process and try to figure things out,\\" he said. \\"It's fair to wait a reasonable amount of time, at least a year, and as the grief passes and you learn to live with the fact the person is gone, you can start looking forward.\\"      Complicating Hance's grief is the fact that the woman who is responsible for her daughters' deaths is her sister-in-law, a woman she considered \\"the most responsible person I knew.\\"      She said the accident has torn their family apart. Hance has been unable to even speak to her nephew Bryan, who was the last person to see the girls alive.      \\"I want to reach out and hug him and at the same time try to shake answers out of him, answers he doesn't have,\\" she writes. \\"So for now, I stay away.\\"      The Hances refused to participate in the making of the documentary by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Liz Garbus, which portrays Schuler as a \\"super mom\\" who rarely drank.      Schuler's husband, Daniel, cooperated with documentary producers and has contended all along -- despite lawsuits from the families of the adult crash victims -- that his wife may have had a stroke or other medical complicating factor to cause the accident.      Hance still struggles with allowing her children to go on the camping trip with their relatives.      \\"People always ask how I feel about Diane,\\" writes Hance. \\"You can't imagine how complex that question is. How does a person go from being like a sister to me -- adored by my girls and cherished by my husband -- to being the one who ruined our lives?\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Jackie Hance lost her three daughters Emma, Alyson, and Katie in a tragic car accident in 2009 when her sister-in-law, Diane Schuler, drove the wrong way down New York's Taconic Parkway while under the influence of alcohol and marijuana.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It’s never helpful to tell someone to stop crying or that whatever they are crying about isn’t worth their tears. Crying lets a person feel better. Emotions when vented are better than if they are stored inside because bottled up emotions lead to mental illnesses like depression. If someone is crying, let them cry. Never say things like, \\"Don't cry\\" or \\"This is such a small thing, why are you crying?\\" They are sharing a vulnerable moment with you, so allow them to express what needs to be expressed without telling them how to feel. You might feel awkward or uncomfortable around someone who’s crying. Remember that your role is to offer support in a way that’s helpful to them, and the focus is ultimately not on you. They might want you to stay and listen or they may want some space and alone time. Don’t assume you know what they want because you don’t. Asking what they want and need puts the other person in control and gives you the opportunity to listen and respond. Whatever they ask for or need, respect what they say.  Ask, “What can I do to help?” or “How can I support you?” If they ask that you leave, leave. Refrain from saying things like \\"But you need me to help you!\\", rather just say \\"Okay, fine but if you need something, call or text me.\\" People need space sometimes. You shouldn’t feel like you’re in a rush or need to go do something. Part of being supportive is being there and giving your time for the person. If you’re there to comfort them, give them the time that they need. Your presence alone can be comforting, so sticking around and making sure they are capable of getting on with their day or getting further help can be what they need most. Don’t stop for a few moments then get on with your day. Stay with them and let them know you will stay if they need you. Even if you have work to do, giving a few mins extra won't hurt. If you know your friend likes hugs, give them a hug. However, if they tend to be more physically reserved, you may wish to pat them on the back or perhaps not touch them at all. If you’re helping a stranger, it’s best to ask if they want physical touch. If you’re in doubt, ask if they’d like a hug or for you to hold them. If they don't want physical touch, don't do it. Ask, \\"Mind if I hug you\\"? Your friends or family may want physical touch more than strangers, so make sure you don't make the person more uncomfortable. Summary:","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of allowing people to express their emotions through crying and provides guidance on how to offer support, respect their boundaries, and be empathetic by listening, giving space, and understanding their preferences for physical contact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure. It means that the President could commit capital treason, or any other federal crime, and then immediately pardon himself. \\"It means that he could commit murder in the White House,\\" Koppelman said. \\"It makes no sense within the Constitution as a whole.\\" Asked by reporters Monday about Trump’s comment on his ability to pardon himself, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly replied: \\"The...

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which friend studied less about ethane gas?  Vic and Joe studied chemistry in school. Joe studied alkanes, while his friend Vic studied other acyclic hydrocarbons.  Hint: Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes . The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points. The answer to this question is:","output":"Vic.  Given the information in the paragraph, Joe studied alkanes, a type of hydrocarbon. Ethane is described as an alkane, meaning it would fall under Joe's area of study. On the other hand, Vic studied other acyclic hydrocarbons, which does not explicitly include alkanes.

Further testament to his political significance, Côté held the position once again from 1939 to 1944 with Henri Jolicoeur being his predecessor and successor. This distinguished him as a three-term parliamentarian under the auspices of the Canadian Parliament. His contributions to politics were significant and demonstrated his commitment to the service of his constituents and the wider Canadian populace.

When Martha and Brown have an argument, Brown goes to Mere Catherine's brothel where he discovers that not only has Jones been released, but he's a guest of Captain Concasseur and is enjoying the hospitality of Brown's favourite prostitute, Marie Therese (Cicely Tyson).Jones has gained the favour of the new regime, who are keen to receive a supply of arms. They have paid a down payment, and Jones claims the weapons are impounded in a warehouse in Miami, but the weapons may be imaginary and a confidence trick by Jones. The government will not allow Jones to leave the island until they are sure the weapons exist.Mr. Smith, a former \\"Vegetarian Party\\" candidate for the Presidency of the United States against Harry S. Truman, is given a tour of the new capital, an empty shambles called Duvalierville. He and Mrs. Smith follow a local procession that they believe is a religious ceremony but turns out to be an audience for executions by firing squad. Captain Concasseur and his men enter Brown's hotel and beat him up until Mrs. Smith bluffs the thugs by threatening to inform her husband, the American \\"presidential candidate.\\" The Smiths depart the next day.Brown watches as the Duvalier regime seeks to put down any dissent with an iron fist. He becomes friends with Dr. Magiot (James Earl Jones), the rebel leader.As Brown becomes a reluctant participant in the planned insurrection, the rebels recruit Major Jones to provide military leadership. Jones has been regaling the other expatriates with his tales of heroism as a commando officer in the Burma Campaign that Brown does not quite believe. Brown hosts a meeting of the group, including Magiot, Jones, and Ambassador Pineda. But trouble ensues soon thereafterÂ â Duvalierâs spies from the Tonton Macoute are watching Brownâs Hotel Trianon and his every step.The day after the meeting, three assassins confront Magiot while heâs performing surgery and cut his throat with a scalpel knife. Brown reluctantly agrees to drive Jones, who escapes by dressing as Brown's female cook, wearing drag and blackface. Taking him to a rebel base, Brown suspects that Jones has become involved with Martha Pineda. The inebriated Jones makes matters worse by bragging about his conquest.Driving carelessly up the treacherous, winding road, Brown hits an embankment and breaks the carâs front axle. On foot, they arrive at a remote cemetery, the designated meeting point. They settle in for the night with Jones admitting that his jungle war stories were total fabrication, as was his claimed conquest of Martha. His wartime career involved running a cinema in India, and he'd never been with a woman he hadn't paid \\"or promised to pay.\\"In the morning, Captain Concasseur and one Tonton Macoute accost Brown at the cemetery. Brown denies that the Major is there, talking loudly to warn Jones. But a sleepy Jones approaches anyway. Commanded to stop, Jones turns and runs, but is killed. Brown is ordered into a jeep, but shots from rebels ring out. Concasseur and his henchman drop dead.Asked about Jones, Brown tells the two rebels in dismay: \\"You arrived two minutes too late.\\" The rebels plead with Brown to assume the role of Jones, seeing this as the only hope they have left. Brown hesitates, but relents after being asked whether he wants to continue living like this.The three meet up with a ragtag group of poorly equipped rebels who believe that Brown is Jones. He gives a cynical, taunting speech, apparently without being understood, since the rebels speak French and he English.The Pinedas are leaving the island. Petit Pierre (Roscoe Lee Browne), a journalist friend of Brown, tells them about a battle between government troops and rebels. He says two rebels have been killed, one \\"unidentified.\\" As the plane takes off, Martha notices smoke on a hillside of the island. The question whether Brown has survived remains unanswered., Question: Where does the ship arrive?

In November 2006, the duo performed at several venues, including Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne as well as numerous tour dates throughout 2007.  In 2008, Sasha and Digweed kicked off an American tour with a performance at the Winter Music Conference.  The duo played at mainly larger venues on the weekends and smaller (750-1000 people) shows on weekdays.  Sasha described their music as \\"driving and dark\\" with \\"a little throwback of Twilo sounds\\".Sasha runs a music studio and lives in New York City, and maintains a house in London.  He brings his wife with him on his frequent tours.  Sasha finds the constant touring to be physically tiring, though he also feels that he thrives on it.  While fans may regard Sasha to be a DJ \\"hero\\", he is uneasy with fame; Sasha considers himself \\"shy at heart\\" and is typically uncomfortable discussing his personal life.  He has mentioned on numerous occasions that he is so busy with DJing and production that he rarely has any free time.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Leonard Bernstein gave a concert in Berlin, including Beethoven's Ode to Joy, with the word \\"Joy\\" changed to \\"Freedom\\" in the lyrics sung.The orchestra were drawn from both East and West Germany, as well as the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Freedom was in the air and it was not just for people. The wall between East and West Germany had also kept a large population of wild pigs within the eastern forests of Brandenburg.The wall's falling down made it easier for the big pigs--a very big one can weigh over 300 pounds--to leave the woodlands and walk into the town. Warm winters and easy access to food have helped the population increase. Now about 10,000 wild pigs walk around Berlin. The nature of the beast has added to the boom .\\"The pigs are intelligent,\\" says Marc Franusch, a spokesman for the Berlin forestry department. \\"They learn to use the neighborhoods.They get used to people, dogs, and traffic.\\" The wild pigs tend to travel in small groups and have been found searching rubbish and gardens, feeding their piglets in the shadow of parked cars, and crossing busy roads.On average, the animals are involved in one traffic accident every day. And despite the fact that it's illegal, some Berliners have been known to give the pigs food. Though wild pigs are protected under German law, the city's forestry department is permitted to kill 2,000 of the creatures every year, targeting mostly young adult animals in forests surrounding Berlin. Pigs within city limits are only shot if they make an immediate threat.No humans have yet been seriously wounded by them, but local dogs have been the victims of their tusks. \\"The forestry department is not aiming to get rid of the pigs,\\" explains Franusch, \\"but we do have to reduce dangerous situations.\\" Options: A in Berlin people can never kill any wild pig B it is against law to offer food to wild pigs C wild pigs each weigh more than three hundred pounds D traffic accidents are mainly caused by wild pigs in Berlin Answer: B it is against law to offer food to wild pigs Question: The answer to this question is:","output":"In the context of the article about wild pigs in Berlin, which of the following statements is true?

Ryan was a lawyer in Lincoln, Nebraska, working in the law firm of his wife's father. No kids. After twelve years, she wants a divorce. Ryan leaves Lincoln while the divorce is pending and goes to New York to find himself. He is alone, living in a cheap room, and almost broke. He has an invitation from an old friend to an eclectic/beat party in Greenwich Village. He shows up and meets Gittel Mosca (Shirley MacLaine) at the party. Mosca is a Brooklynite who left home on her own and rented an apartment in Greenwich Village when she was fifteen. She works as a dancer of sorts, and has had a number of relationships. Ryan and Mosca hook up after a day or so and start a relationship. The core theme of the picture is how their relationship expands and develops their self-respect of themselves. The turning point for Mosca comes when she gets sick and, as Ryan is storming down the stairway, she leans over the railing and begs for help. Ryan takes her to the hospital and looks after her when she is released. Mosca discovers intimacy within love. Class rears its ugly head, but they get over it. They are acting like married people in love. Ryan receives notice that the divorce is final, but he is still conflicted about his ex (Tess). After the divorce is final, Tess calls and wants Jerry back. He agrees, but will work on his own in Lincoln and Tess must accept nothing from her father live in poverty with Jerry until his practice gets on its feet. In the final scene the couple have broken up and are in two separate sets in the same dual scene. This technique is used in the theater but rarely in movies.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that the band that released an album in 1983 did not choose to use for the cover design?  In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning... The answer is:","output":"Thorgerson. The last name of the person that the band Pink Floyd, who released an album in 1983, did not choose to use for the cover design is Thorgerson. It is mentioned in the passage that \\"Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design...\\", implying that Thorgerson was the person they did not choose to work with for the design of their album cover."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unlock your phone and open the Gallery application. 2. On the main gallery screen, you will see all your photo albums. To access hidden albums, you need to perform a special gesture on the screen. 3. Touch the screen and, using two fingers, make a \\"pinch-in\\" gesture. This means moving your fingers towards each other on the screen. Make sure the gesture is recognized by the phone. 4. After performing the pinch-in gesture, you will be prompted to enter your Privacy Protection password or use your fingerprint to authenticate. This is to ensure that only authorized users gain access to hidden albums. 5. Once authenticated, you should see all the hidden photo albums in the Gallery application. If you want, you can unhide these albums by selecting them individually and choosing the \\"Unhide\\" option from the menu. 6. If you're not able to view the hidden photos, even after following these steps and enabling the \\"Show hidden albums\\" option in the Settings, it's possible that the files may have either been moved or deleted. In this case, you may need to use a file manager application like Xiaomi's in-built File Manager app or a third-party app like ES File Explorer to navigate to the internal storage and locate the HiddenAlbum folder manually.  7. Within the HiddenAlbum folder, you should find separate folders for each hidden album. Check inside these folders to find the photos you're looking for.

Q: Offset regression is a standard method for spatial localization in many vision tasks, including human pose estimation, object detection, and instance segmentation. However,  if high localization accuracy is crucial for a task, convolutional neural networks will offset regression usually struggle to deliver.   This can be attributed to the locality of the convolution operation, exacerbated by variance in scale, clutter, and viewpoint. An even more fundamental issue is the multi-modality of real-world images. As a consequence, they cannot be approximated adequately using a single mode model.   Instead, we propose to use mixture density networks (MDN) for offset regression, allowing the model to manage various modes efficiently and learning to predict full conditional density of the outputs given the input. On 2D human pose estimation in the wild, which requires accurate localisation of body keypoints, we show that this yields significant improvement in localization accuracy. In particular, our experiments reveal viewpoint variation as  the dominant  multi-modal factor. Further, by carefully initializing MDN parameters, we do not face any instabilities in training, which is known to be a big obstacle for widespread deployment of MDN. The method can be readily applied to any task with a spatial regression component. Our findings  highlight the multi-modal nature of real-world vision, and the significance of explicitly accounting for viewpoint variation, at least when spatial localization is concerned. A:","output":"Offset regression struggles in high localization accuracy tasks due to convolution operation limitations and multi-modality. The proposed solution utilizes mixture density networks (MDN) for better performance, specifically addressing viewpoint variation and improving 2D human pose estimation accuracy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Countess Nicolette de Gobignon pressed a wet cloth tothe King's brow. Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters.\\" Then he panted heavily. \\"Hush, sire,\\" she whispered. \\"Rest easy.\\" Question: The Kings wife: Options:  A. was not in the room  B. was beautiful  C. not enough information  D. was also tall Answer:","output":"C. not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a \\"A).\\" movie review (Choices: A). negative. B). positive.).","output":"A). Negative Movie Review: Title: \\"Disappointment on the Big Screen\\" As a movie aficionado, I always look forward to the opportunity to witness cinematic masterpieces. Unfortunately, my experience watching \\"Disappointment on the Big Screen\\" was far from satisfying. There are multiple factors that contributed to my discontentment with this film, and I will discuss them in this review. Step 1: Analyze the storyline The storyline was one of the major issues in this film. It lacked originality and felt like a rehash of various plotlines from previous films in the genre. As a result, it became increasingly difficult to stay engaged in the movie, as it was all too predictable. Furthermore, the story was riddled with plot holes and inconsistencies that left the audience seeking answers, ultimately causing confusion and frustration. Step 2: Evaluate the character development The characters in the film were underdeveloped, making it challenging to connect or empathize with their experiences. Stereotypical tropes and lazy writing left the characters feeling one-dimensional and unrelatable. Additionally, the dialogues were weak and did not add any substance to the characters or the storyline. Step 3: Assess the direction The direction of the film was lackluster, with poor pacing and a disjointed narrative. The film seemed to meander aimlessly between scenes without any clear direction, leaving its audience feeling disoriented and disconnected from the action on-screen. Step 4: Examine the cinematography The cinematography in the film did not add any artistic value nor enhance the storytelling experience. The camera work was uninspired and poorly executed, leading to bland visuals and lackluster scene compositions. Step 5: Consider the performances The actors' performances were unconvincing and lacked depth, making it more challenging for the audience to connect with them. It is unclear if the blame for this lies with the talent themselves or the script and direction; however, the lackluster portrayals ultimately detracted from the overall experience. Step 6: Reflect on the overall experience In conclusion, \\"Disappointment on the Big Screen\\" was a let-down in multiple areas – from storytelling to character development and direction. The film could have been a much richer experience had these factors been thoroughly addressed and refined. Instead, it remains a prime example of wasted opportunity, leaving viewers longing for a more immersive and enjoyable experience."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.  Question: \\"What did President Clinton offer Musharraf when he pulled him aside?\\" Answer: \\"The Moon\\" Is this answer to the question correct? OPT:  (1). no  (2). yes","output":"(2). yes President Clinton said that he offered Musharraf \\"the moon\\" when they had a one-on-one meeting.

The process of combining eggs in a bowl involves breaking the eggs, beating them, and incorporating any additional ingredients if desired. Depending on the number of eggs and the specific recipe, you may need to use a whisk, a fork, or an electric mixer for this process. The following step-by-step guide outlines how to combine eggs in a bowl successfully: Equipment and supplies: 1. Fresh eggs (as many as required by your recipe) 2. A clean, medium-sized mixing bowl 3. A whisk, fork, or electric mixer 4. A separate small container or cup (for breaking eggs into) 5. A trash receptacle or plastic bag (for disposal of empty eggshells) 6. Measuring cups (for any additional ingredients, such as milk or cream, if required by your recipe) 7. A rubber spatula (optional) Step-by-step process: 1. Prepare your work area: Clean your work surface and gather your equipment and supplies. Ensure that your hands are clean and dry before starting the process. 2. Break the eggs: Hold one egg in your dominant hand. Gently tap the egg against the edge of the small container or cup, applying just enough pressure to create a crack in the shell. Be careful not to use too much force, as this can cause the egg to shatter and create a mess. Carefully pry the eggshell apart over the container, allowing the egg's contents to drop into the container. It's important to break each egg into a separate container before adding it to the mixing bowl. This way, you can ensure that each egg is fresh and free of any shell fragments. 3. Inspect the egg: Examine the small container containing the egg's contents. Check for any bits of eggshell that may have fallen in; if you spot any, carefully remove them using a fork. Additionally, ensure that the egg is fresh; if it appears discolored or has a strong, unpleasant odor, discard it and use another egg. 4. Transfer the egg to the mixing bowl: Once you have determined that the egg is fresh and free of shell fragments, carefully pour it into the mixing bowl. 5. Repeat steps 2 through 4: Continue breaking, inspecting, and transferring the eggs to the mixing bowl until you have added the required number of eggs for your recipe. 6. Add any additional ingredients to the mixing bowl: If your recipe calls for any additional ingredients, such as milk or cream, measure out the appropriate amount and add it to the bowl with the eggs. Some recipes may also require salt or other seasonings; add these according to the recipe's instructions. 7. Beat the eggs: Using a whisk, fork, or electric mixer, begin to beat the mixture in the bowl. Start at a low speed and gradually increase the speed if necessary. Make sure to mix the egg yolks and whites thoroughly, as well as any additional ingredients. If you are using a fork, employ a vigorous, side-to-side stirring motion to ensure proper blending. The finished mixture should be smooth, with a consistent texture and color. 8. Optional step: Scrape down the sides of the bowl using a rubber spatula to ensure that any residual egg or other ingredients are fully incorporated into the mixture. 9. Use the egg mixture in your recipe: Once you have achieved the desired consistency, your combined eggs are ready for use in your chosen recipe, whether you're making scrambled eggs, an omelette, or using the eggs as an ingredient in a baked dish. Enjoy! Remember to thoroughly clean the mixing bowl, whisk or electric mixer, spatula, and other utensils with warm, soapy water when you have finished preparing your meal. Store any remaining eggs safely in your refrigerator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

A: Answer:","output":"The fusion inside a star ends after it reaches the red giant stage.  In general, a star's life progresses from a protostar to a main sequence star, which is a yellow dwarf for stars similar to our Sun. During this stage, the star fuses Hydrogen into Helium in its core through a process known as nuclear fusion, resulting in a substantial amount of energy in the form of light and heat. At a certain point, the hydrogen in the core is almost entirely converted into helium. This leads the core to compress under gravity, which increases the core temperature. The outer layers expand due to the increased heat, transforming the star into a red giant. During the red giant phase, helium atoms in the core fuse to become carbon and oxygen, but this fusion process won't last long. In the case of smaller stars like our Sun, the core fusion ceases after the helium is depleted, and the star becomes a white dwarf. Larger stars may undergo further fusion processes to form heavier elements. Finally, in case of very massive stars, they might end up as neutron stars or black holes after a supernova explosion.  So, the nuclear fusion ends for standard stars like the Sun after their transition from the red giant stage to becoming a white dwarf. This is when they have exhausted the fuel necessary for fusion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. A leopard jumped across a building in Meerut on Feb. 23. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images      A leopard made its way into the wards of a hospital in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh on Sunday, terrifying patients and staff for around 12 hours before wounding a police officer after it smashed its way through a window and fled.      The animal, which was still on the loose on Monday, was first spotted early Sunday in a timber warehouse in a densely-packed market place in the northern city, which has a population of nearly three-and-a-half million.      Within minutes, a large crowd had gathered and “a couple of mischievous elements” attempted to tease the creature, according to Sushant Sharma, a regional forest officer.      Advertisement      It was then that the leopard ran to the Meerut Cantonment Hospital, about a mile away from the market square, and entered a ward where three patients were staying at around 1.30 p.m., said a spokesperson for the Cantonment Board, a committee of supervisors at the military quarters in the city.      There are about 8,000 leopards in India, and nearly 200 are poached each year, said Shekhar Kumar Niraj, who heads the India chapter of TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network run by the World Wildlife Fund. As urban areas encroach on nearby forests the animals are venturing more frequently into populated neighborhoods. Biologically, said Mr. Kumar Niraj, the wild cat is a multi-habitat species leading to clashes with humans.      Mohammed Ali Zafar, the Cantonment Board spokesman, said “there were about three patients in the ward who were evacuated in a matter of a few seconds and the door was shut behind them.” Efforts to cage the animal inside the hospital carried on for nearly 12 hours, Mr. Zafar added.      The leopard escaping the Meerut Cantonment Hospital. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images      At 8 p.m., he said, a team of three officials from the Wildlife Trust of India, a non-profit conservation organization headquartered in Noida, arrived from Bijnor, a neighboring district about 45 miles north of Meerut.      Their attempts to tranquilize the leopard failed, said Mr. Sharma, because a cluster of reporters trying to take photographs of the animal made it irritable and it broke out of a door of the room where it was cornered and smashed through glass window and a concrete wall at the corner of a passageway at the hospital.      As it fled, the leopard bit Gajendra Pal Singh, a police official who was positioned outside cordoning off the hospital complex. Mr. Singh told The Wall Street Journal that he had suffered a wound on the left shoulder, which required seven stitches.      “But I am absolutely fine now and set to hunt the leopard down,” Mr. Singh said.      While the search for the animal continues, the district magistrate of Meerut declared Monday a holiday for schools in the city. He could not be immediately reached for comment.      Killada Satyanarayan, a senior police officer in the city, said that about seven search teams of at least four officers each, were trying to trace the animal. He said that it was “very strange and bizarre for the animal to appear out of nowhere” on the streets of the city.      While it might be unusual in this city, which was the site of the first war of independence in 1857, it is more common in other parts of the country, especially in Mumbai where the forest meets the megacity.      In two incidents in January last year, a 9-year-old boy was killed by a leopard in Mumbai, and an elderly man died in a similar attack in Guwahati, in the east of the country.

The city is on high alert after the animal, who was trapped inside a room of the cantonment hospital, escaped during a rescue operation by wildlife experts around midnight.      The leopard was first spotted at a timber shop in Sadar area on Sunday afternoon, from where it entered the nearby cantonment hospital and was locked inside a room. A team of wildlife experts was summoned from Afzalgarh to capture the animal, who escaped after breaking a window in the room.      The leopard was then spotted at a commercial complex in the posh Abulane market on Monday morning. The CCTV footage showed that the animal entered the complex around 3am. A team of the Wildlife Trust of India reached the market along with forest officials, but failed to locate the animal.      Forest officials and additional staff from five districts have been called for assistance, said divisional forest officer Sudhanshu Sharma.      Senior superintendent of police Onkar Singh said, \\"We have been urging the public not to go near the animal, but some of them went close out of curiosity and the animal attacked them\\"      Seven people sustained minor injuries, including Sadar police station house officer Gajendra Pal, who had to get seven stitches on the shoulder.      Schools and colleges in the city were closed while the examinations scheduled for Monday were postponed. Most shops in and around Sadar area were also shut.      \\"It is a robust animal who broke the window to escape from the hospital room,\\" said chief conservator of forests (west zone) SK Rastogi.      \\"We are expecting the leopard to venture out at night and are prepared to trap him.\\"      Leopard breaks the cemented window of the ward and escapes.

I cried for my husband Simon to dial 999 and within minutes the air ambulance arrived. They quickly took him in the helicopter. During the flight, Freddie was looking at me and I remember thinking was a good sign, but then his eyes began to roll. As the doctors tried to stabilize  him, I couldn't believe what was happening. When we arrived at the hospital in Portsmouth, there were some doctors and nurses waiting for us and they immediately set to work on Freddie. I was hopelessly wishing everything would be alright, but Freddie had broken his skull in two places and blood clots were forming in his brain. He needed surgery , and only a surgeon at another hospital in Bristol could do it. This meant another helicopter ride, but we couldn't go with Freddie because there was no enough space. Simon and I drove the long 130 miles from our home in north Devon in silence. Neither of us dared say what we were thinking, \\"What if we get there and he's dead?\\" \\"Is he going to be brain-damaged?\\" Freddie was just coming out of surgery when we arrived. The surgeon said it had gone well. When I finally saw him, I hardly recognize my child--he was covered in tubes and there were wires coming out of his head.

Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki.  - Mount Parnassus (\\"Parnassos\\") is a mountain of limestone in central Greece that towers above Delphi, north of the Gulf of Corinth, and offers scenic views of the surrounding olive groves and countryside. According to Greek mythology, this mountain was sacred to Dionysus and the Dionysian mysteries; it was also sacred to Apollo and the Corycian nymphs, and it was the home of the Muses. The mountain was also favored by the Dorians. There is a theory that \\"Parna-\\" derives from the same root as that which appears in the Luwian word for \\"House\\".  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read this fact: \\"a plant requires soil for to grow\\" Now answer this question: \\"What requires soil to grow?\\"","output":"A plant requires soil to grow. This is because soil serves as a crucial medium that provides necessary nutrients, minerals, water, and anchorage for the proper growth and development of a plant. Various components within the soil work together to create a conducive environment for the plant's well-being. 1. Nutrients and Minerals: Soil contains essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are vital for plant growth. These nutrients are absorbed by the plant's roots and used to build new cells and synthesize important molecules. Soil also contains minerals like calcium, magnesium, and sulfur that contribute to the plant's overall health. 2. Organic Matter: The presence of organic matter, such as decaying plant and animal materials, contributes to the fertility of the soil. This organic matter decomposes over time, releasing vital nutrients that are absorbed by the plant, further promoting growth. 3. Water: Soil acts as a reservoir for water, which is essential for plants. The plant's roots absorb water from the soil that is then transported to the rest of the plant for various processes such as photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and transpiration. The soil's ability to hold water is critical for plants, especially during periods of drought. 4. Soil Structure: The soil's structure, including the size and arrangement of its particles, plays a significant role in plant growth. A well-structured soil provides enough space for roots to grow and access nutrients and water, while also allowing for proper drainage and aeration, which helps prevent waterlogging and root rot. 5. Soil Microorganisms: A diverse community of microorganisms inhabit the soil, including bacteria, fungi, and other microscopic creatures. These microorganisms help break down organic matter, releasing nutrients for the plant to absorb. They also contribute to the formation of soil structure and play a role in controlling plant diseases and pests. 6. Anchorage: Soil provides a stable structure for a plant's root system, anchoring the plant firmly in the ground. This enables the plant to withstand various environmental conditions, such as strong winds and rainfall, without toppling over or being uprooted. In summary, plants require soil to grow because it provides essential nutrients, water supply, stable structure, organic matter, and a rich microbiome that all contribute to the plant's optimal growth and development. Different plants have adapted to growing in specific types of soil, depending on their native habitat and required conditions for survival. Therefore, understanding the soil's composition and characteristics is crucial for successful plant cultivation and gardening."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It has been argued that hunting and gathering represents an adaptive strategy, which may still be exploited, if necessary, when environmental change causes extreme food stress for agriculturalists. In fact, it is sometimes difficult to draw a clear line between agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies, especially since the widespread adoption of agriculture and resulting cultural diffusion that has occurred in the last 10,000 years.[citation needed] This anthropological view has remained unchanged since the 1960s.[clarification needed][citation needed] Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): It is easy to draw a clear line between what?","output":"Well, little buddy, sometimes people want to know the difference between two types of groups.

Which entity is this text about? Richard was born on 2 October 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle, the twelfth of thirteen children of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and Cecily Neville at the beginning of what has traditionally been labelled the \\"Wars of the Roses\\", a period of \\"three or four decades of political instability and periodic open civil war in the second half of the fifteenth century\\", between supporters of Richard's father (a potential claimant to the throne of King Henry VI from birth)--\\"Yorkists\\"--in opposition to the regime of Henry VI and his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and those loyal to the crown (\\"Lancastrians\\"). When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461. Apart from Shakespeare, Richard appears in many other works of literature. Two other plays of the Elizabethan era predated Shakespeare's work. The Latin-language drama Richardus Tertius (first known performance in 1580) by Thomas Legge is believed to be the first history play written in England. The anonymous play The True Tragedy of Richard III (c. 1590), performed in the same decade as Shakespeare's work, was probably an influence on Shakespeare. Neither of the two plays places any emphasis on Richard's physical appearance, though the True Tragedy briefly mentions that he is \\"A man ill shaped, crooked backed, lame armed\\" adding that he is \\"valiantly minded, but tyrannous in authority\\". Both portray him as a man motivated by personal ambition, who uses everyone around him to get his way. Ben Jonson is also known to have written a play Richard Crookback in 1602, but it was never published and nothing is known about its portrayal of the king.  Marjorie Bowen's 1929 novel Dickon set the trend for pro-Ricardian literature. Particularly influential was The Daughter of Time (1951) by Josephine Tey, in which a modern detective concludes that Richard III is innocent in the death of the Princes. Other novelists such as Valerie Anand in the novel Crown of Roses (1989) have also offered alternative versions to the theory that he murdered them. Sharon Kay Penman, in her historical novel The Sunne in Splendour, attributes the death of the Princes to the Duke of Buckingham. In the mystery novel The Murders of Richard III by Elizabeth Peters (1974) the central plot revolves around the debate as to whether Richard III was guilty of these and other crimes. A sympathetic portrayal of Richard III is given in The Founding, the first volume in The Morland Dynasty series by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles.  One film adaptation of Shakespeare's play Richard III is the 1955 version directed and produced by Laurence Olivier, who also played the lead role. Also notable are the 1995 film version starring Ian McKellen, set in a fictional 1930s fascist England, and Looking for Richard, a 1996 documentary film directed by Al Pacino, who plays the title character as well as himself. The play has been adapted for television on several occasions. Entity:","output":"Richard III"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1964, the first commoner featured on a British postage stamp was?","output":"In 1964, the first commoner to be featured on a British postage stamp was William Shakespeare, the famous playwright and poet. This was a significant event in British philately history, as prior to this, only members of the British Royal Family or depictions of the monarchy were featured on national postage stamps. The decision to feature Shakespeare on a stamp recognized and celebrated his monumental contributions to English literature, drama, and the arts. Born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, William Shakespeare is often referred to as the \\"Bard of Avon.\\" He wrote around 39 plays and 154 sonnets, and his works have had a longstanding impact on the world of literature, ranging from tragedies, comedies, and historical plays to poetry. 1964 was an appropriate year to celebrate the Bard, as it marked the 400th anniversary of his birth. As part of the celebration, the Royal Mail issued a set of six stamps on April 23rd, 1964, featuring images related to Shakespeare's plays. This set included scenes from his most famous works, such as Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, Twelfth Night, Henry V, and A Midsummer Night's Dream. The scenes were created using photographs by Laurence Olivier, an iconic Shakespearean actor and director, and other well-known theater designers. These stamps not only represented a turning point in British postage stamp design, shifting from the traditional focus on the Royal Family to include important cultural icons, but they also signaled the start of a trend that continues to this day. Since 1964, many distinguished British figures from various fields, including literature, science, sports, and entertainment, have appeared on postage stamps. The inclusion of William Shakespeare in the 1964 stamp series demonstrated a growing emphasis on commemorating British history and achievements in various domains. It acknowledged the lasting impact and global influence of Shakespeare's works, which continue to captivate audience members and readers around the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Head Start programs are cutting back; the White House furloughed 480 people; but Congressional salaries will remain intact, because they’re not appropriated by Congress or included in presidential budgets. Lawmakers could pass a bill cutting their salaries—yes, commenters, I know about the 27th amendment, the cut wouldn’t go into effect until the next session—but they haven’t. Alternatively, individual members of Congress could sign over some portion of their wages to the Treasury. Guess who’s doing just that. President Obama announced today that he would give 5 percent of his salary to the Treasury. The president wants “to share in the sacrifice being made by public servants across the federal government that are affected by the sequester,” an administration official said. He probably got the idea from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and his deputy, Ashton B. Carton, who said on Tuesday that they would return a share of their salaries in solidarity with the department’s civilian employees.","output":"So, there was this thing called the sequester which means some people had to cut back on money they spend.

The prehistoric creature had a wingspan of between 6.1 and 7.4 metres and could glide for long distances over the oceans as it searched for fish 25m years ago, according to scientists writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.      Its wingspan was double that of the royal albatross, the largest flying bird alive, and challenges the wingspan of Argentavis magnificens, a prehistoric bird that lived six million years ago and had a wingspan between 5.5 and 7 metres.      The bird, named Pelagornis sandersi, had short, stumpy legs and likely took to the air by hopping off cliff edges or making short runs into the wind to take off from the ground or sea. In flight it reached speeds of up to 60 km/h.      Skeletal reconstruction of P sandersi with a California condor (lower left) and royal albatross (lower right) for scale. Illustration: Liz Bradford/PNAS      \\"This was a remarkable fossil, almost like something out of Game of Thrones,\\" said Daniel Ksepka at North Carolina State University. Its mouth was filled with bony spikes that gave it the menacing look of a dragon, he added.      The remains of the bird, including its skull, shoulder blade, and hollow leg and wing bones, were dug from rock near Charleston airport in 1983, but the full significance of the fossils had not been realised before.      Though no feathers survived, Ksepka extrapolated the mass, wingspan and wing shape from the fossilised bones and fed them into a computer to estimate how the bird might fly. A conservative estimate put the wingspan of P. sandersi at around 6.4 metres.      The computer model showed that like the modern albatross, the prehistoric bird was an extremely efficient glider and barely needed to flap to cover ground. \\"It could probably travel for extreme distances using a very, very small amount of energy,\\" said Ksepka. If the bird was caught on low ground in bad wind conditions, it may have become fatally stuck.      The Charleston specimen likely died at sea, as the excavation site was a prehistoric seabed. Remains of archaic rays, skates, and even a toothed whale have been unearthed at the site in the past. There are no obvious breaks in the bird's bones that point to a particularly violent death, Ksepka said.      Robert Nudds at Manchester University said the bird's dimensions were \\"guesstimates instead of estimates\\", but said the bird would have had a similar flying style to the albatross. \\"It would flap its wings rarely and use wind profiles above the waves to carry it,\\" he said.      Ksepka said the remains of larger flying birds may yet be found. \\"I wouldn't be surprised if something a little bit larger was found some time down the line. I don't think we'll be pushing 10-metre wingspans, but a little bit bigger,\\" he said. ||||| Reconstruction by Liz Bradford      If we had lived 3 million years ago, our holiday beach visits would not have been so pleasant. North American ocean fronts were home to Pelagornis sandersi, the largest known marine bird. It had a wingspan of up to 24 feet. For comparison, imagine the length of four humans head-to-toe, or the height of a two-story building. If its size isn’t terrifying enough, the bird also had pseudoteeth—all the better to impale its prey with.      The first P. sandersi fossil was found in 1983, when crews in South Carolina began construction to expand the Charleston International Airport. Charleston Museum volunteer James Malcom and museum curator Albert Sander removed a stone block containing the fossil and brought it to the museum for further inspection. (The sandersi in the species name is a homage to Sanders.) Nearly 30 years later, paleontologist Daniel Ksepka rediscovered it when he was invited to study the Charleston Museum’s fossils. “I was pretty confident it was a new species right away,” says Ksepka. “The size jumps out at you. I found a single wing bone longer than my arm, so I thought, this must be important.” Ksepka’s results are published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.      Advertisement            The newly described monster bird is part of a family of giant seabirds called Pelagornithids, named for teeth found on the edges of their bills. Unlike human teeth, which have roots and are covered with enamel, pelagornithids’ teeth were made of bone and were likely covered with beak tissue. Scientists believe these birds’ beaks resembled those of modern birds, only with bony, saw-like edges. “They were very sharp, but not made for slicing,” Ksepka says. “They could use them to catch fish or squids near the surface and impale them.”      The pelagornithid family was known for its ubiquity; species within the family have been discovered on every continent. According to Ksepka, it’s fairly rare for bird families to inhabit so many different climates. “Not that many birds make it to Antarctica,” he says.      Based on the structure of its bones, scientists are fairly certain that P. sandersi did fly. This raises one big mystery: How did something so large stay in the air? Bigger animals require more power to keep their bodies in flight. “It’s a scaling problem,” says Ksepka: Theoretically, extremely large birds cannot fly, because the amount of power they need to fly surpasses the power of their muscles. Some researchers calculate that this upper limit is around 17 feet, so by these estimates, a flying Pelagornis sandersi should be impossible. However, these calculations are based on the energy required for birds to stay in flight by flapping their wings; in new calculations, Ksepka proposes that large flying birds could have used other strategies. “They could harvest energy from the environment, like taking advantage of wind gusts,” he says. Like modern-day albatrosses, Pelagornis sandersi could have used their long wings to catch ocean winds and glide across the sky, rather than powering their flight with energy-intensive flapping. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Scientists found a fossil of a huge flying bird that lived 25 million years ago. This bird, named Pelagornis sandersi, had wings twice as big as the biggest bird today, the royal albatross. The bird had a wingspan of 6.1 to 7.4 meters and could fly really far distances over the oceans while looking for fish. This bird was so big and had a mouth with bony spikes that made it look like a dragon. It probably flew by jumping off cliffs or running for a little bit and then lifting off into the air. The bird was very good at gliding and didn't need much energy to fly far distances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois.

The short then focuses to the present day and reveals the pigs now play modern instruments and perform as The Three Little Bops. During a gig at the House of Straw, the Big Bad Wolf appears and proves he is friendly by stating that he wants to join the band. The Wolf happens to be terrible at playing his choice instrument (a trumpet) so the pigs throw him out. Feeling insulted, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down the straw house, forcing the pigs to go to the Dew Drop Inn, the House of Sticks. Things go well (including the piano playing pig doing an imitation of Liberace's \\"I wish my brother George was here\\"), until the Wolf comes in and attempts to play his trumpet again. Like the pigs, the people watching also think the wolf's playing is corny, so they call for the pigs to \\"throw the square out\\", which they do. Again, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down, or \\"dropping out,\\" the Dew Drop Inn. The pigs then realize that in order to escape the Wolf's \\"windy tricks,\\" they will go to the House of Bricks (built in May 1st 1776, according to a cornerstone). Coincidentally, another relevant event related to that date is the foundation of the Illuminati Society. For the pigs, the House of Bricks has a \\"No Wolves Allowed\\" rule, so when the Wolf tries to get in, he is punched in the face by a bouncer. Then he tried to ram the door down with a log but with no success. The Wolf runs out of breath in trying to blow away the club, but thinks he can get in by disguising himself. He reenters in fur coat and ukulele with his perfect rendition of the Charleston song (cut short by slipping on a strategically thrown banana peel). He returns in the disguise of a houseplant with his trumpet but gets blasted outside by a plunger shot from the double bass. For his third try, the Wolf shows up in a drum major outfit playing a big bass drum to the tune of \\"Don't Give Up the Ship\\". A dart is shot into the drum to deflate... My question: When was the House of Bricks built? Answer:","output":"The House of Bricks was built on May 1st, 1776."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Information:  - David Harbater (born December 19, 1952) is an American mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania, well known for his work in Galois theory, algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry.  - \\"Not to be confused with his wife Michèle Raynaud, who is also a French mathematician working in algebraic geometry.\\"   - The term proposition has a broad use in contemporary philosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the primary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other \\"propositional attitudes\\" (i.e., what is believed, doubted, etc.), the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of declarative sentences. Propositions are the sharable objects of attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This stipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including thought- and utterance-tokens which are not sharable, and concrete events or facts, which cannot be false.  - In abstract algebra , Abhyankar 's conjecture is a 1957 conjecture of Shreeram Abhyankar , on the Galois groups of algebraic function fields of characteristic p. The soluble case was solved by Serre in 1990 and the full conjecture was proved in 1994 by work of Michel Raynaud and David Harbater . The problem involves a finite group G , a prime number p , and the function field of nonsingular integral algebraic curve C defined over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic p. The question addresses the existence of Galois extensions L of K ( C ) , with G as Galois group , and with restricted ramification . From a geometric point of view L corresponds to another curve C  , and a morphism  : C   C. Ramification geometrically , and by analogy with the case of Riemann surfaces , consists of a finite set S of points x on C , such that  restricted to the complement of S in C is an étale morphism . In Abhyankar 's conjecture , S is fixed , and the question is what G can be . This is therefore a special type of inverse Galois problem . The subgroup p ( G ) is defined to be the subgroup generated by all the Sylow subgroups of G for the prime number p. This is a normal subgroup , and the parameter n is defined as the minimum number of generators of G / p ( G ) . Then for the case of C the projective line over K , the conjecture states that G can be realised as a Galois group of L , unramified outside S containing s + 1 points , if and only if n  s. This was proved by Raynaud . For the general case , proved by Harbater , let g be the genus of C. Then G can be realised if and only if n  s + 2 g.  - Algebra (from Arabic \\"\\"al-jabr\\"\\" meaning \\"reunion of broken parts\\") is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians.  - In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, an algebraic structure is a set (called carrier set or underlying set) with one or more finitary operations defined on it that satisfies a list of axioms.  - In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate is . An example in three variables is .  - In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers , , and satisfy the equation for any integer value of greater than 2. The cases and have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity.  - In abstract algebra, field extensions are the main object of study in field theory. The general idea is to start with a base field and construct in some manner a larger field that contains the base field and satisfies additional properties. For instance, the set Q(2) = {\\"a\\" + \\"b\\"2 | \\"a\\", \\"b\\"  Q} is the smallest extension of Q that includes every real solution to the equation \\"x\\" = 2.  - In mathematics, more specifically in the area of modern algebra known as Galois theory, the Galois group of a certain type of field extension is a specific group associated with the field extension. The study of field extensions and their relationship to the polynomials that give rise to them via Galois groups is called Galois theory, so named in honor of Évariste Galois who first discovered them.  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - In mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, Galois theory, named after Évariste Galois, provides a connection between field theory and group theory. Using Galois theory, certain problems in field theory can be reduced to group theory, which is, in some sense, simpler and better understood.  - The University of Pennsylvania (commonly known as Penn or UPenn) is a private, Ivy League university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Incorporated as \\"The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\\", Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and one of the nine original colonial colleges.  - Évariste Galois (25 October 1811  31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel.  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words \\"hypothesis\\" and \\"theory\\" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research.  - In algebra, which is a broad division of mathematics, abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras. The term \\"abstract algebra\\" was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from the other parts of algebra.  - In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof has been found. Conjectures such as the Riemann hypothesis (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.  - Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros.  - In mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part . It was proposed by , after whom it is named. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.

The given equation is -70*l - 1814 = -344. We want to isolate the term containing the variable l, which is -70*l. Step 2: Add 1814 to both sides of the equation. To do this, we'll add 1814 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the 1814 term from the left-hand side, resulting in the following equation: -70*l - 1814 + 1814 = -344 + 1814 Simplify the equation: -70*l = 1470 Now we have isolated -70*l on the left side of the equation. Step 3: Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable (l), which is -70. Now we want to isolate the variable l itself, so we divide both sides of the equation by -70: (-70*l) / -70 = 1470 / -70 Step 4: Simplify the equation and solve for l.

Summarize: If you live in a temperate or warm climate, nearly all plant nurseries in your area should sell jacaranda seedlings. If you need help locating a jacaranda plant, or if a nursery has different options to choose from, ask the sales staff for assistance. If there isn’t a plant nursery in your area, you can also visit the Garden section of large retail stores. Retailers like WalMart and Home Depot will stock a large variety of plants, and will likely carry jacaranda seedlings. If you don’t live near a nursery or garden center, there may not be a way for you to purchase a jacaranda seedling in person. In this case, you can find and order a jacaranda online. Check major online plant retailers, such as Annie’s Annuals, Fast Growing Trees, or Nursery Live. Certain retailers will provide a seedling—with others, you may need to order a packet of seeds. Although jacarandas commonly grow in temperate or humid climates, they can survive in cooler areas as well—even regions that receive light frosts. Jacaranda trees grow best in zone 10 in the hardiness scale, which includes warmer climates. If you know a friend or relative with a jacaranda tree, ask if you can take a cutting of their plant. A cutting is segment taken from a branch; the cutting itself should be at least 15 centimeters (6 inches) long, but can be as long as you would like. Place the jacaranda cutting in water until small roots begin to emerge. Then, plant the cutting in a small pot filled with rich soil, water regularly, and let the tree grow. Jacaranda seedlings also tend to spring up around the base of mature jacaranda trees. If you can safely and legally dig up one of these seedlings, you can transplant it into a planter and so begin growing your own tree.","output":"To acquire a jacaranda plant, individuals living in temperate or warm climates can visit local plant nurseries, or large retail stores with garden sections like WalMart and Home Depot.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which country will be less developed as a consequence of their agendas?  Hint: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.  With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Nigeria will be less developed as a consequence of their agendas compared to Niger. Niger focused on developing its infrastructure and communications technology, which would enable a more connected and accessible society.

Three years after I got out, Dio called in those favors. I don’t know if it was because I said something he didn’t like or I didn’t pay him respect or maybe he could sense that I thought he was a vicious prick. Whatever the reason, he gave me the kind of assignment you’d give your worse enemy. It made me wish I never heard of Johnny Dio. He was inside the joint, but he still had power and influence in both the Lucchese and Gambino Families. The son of a capo in Florida was sleeping with the wife of another made guy. If the kid had been made himself, he would have been whacked for messing with the man’s wife. The old dons back in Sicily knew that’s how family feuds began. The Sicilians figured kill the guy right away and you’ll save yourself a lot of carnage. The Family involved — I don’t know if the capo’s kid and the guy whose wife he was f------ were in the same Family or not; I was never told and I knew better than to ask — they consulted Dio in prison and asked him what to do. He suggested they use the old Murder Incorporated punishment. Instead of killing the f-----, they should cut his balls off. Dio said he knew just the man for the job; an ex-con who owed him — me.

News article: Pension freedoms: withdrawal figures ease fears of 'Lamborghini' pensioners wasting savings It still means a worrying proportion of withdrawals – 43pc – were potentially for sums above 4pc. Some 4.2pc were for sums greater than 10pc. It cannot be said with certainty, however, that these retirees have withdrawn unsustainable sums because individuals may have multiple pots, from different employers, for example, or income from defined benefit pension or other investments. The pension freedoms give those with defined contribution savings greater flexibility over how they spend their pot. Money can be taken out in lump sums, with 25pc of each withdrawal tax-free, leaving the remainder invested inside the scheme, or 25pc of the whole fund can be taken tax free and then further withdrawals can be made through “drawdown”. In this case recipients pay income tax at whatever rate the income takes them to. The ABI reported that, in the first year after the reforms were enacted, £4.3bn had been withdrawn in 300,000 lump-sum payments, with an average withdrawal of £14,500, while £3.9bn has been taken out via 1.03 million drawdown payments, with an average payment of £3,800. The changes in the rules free retirees from the obligation to buy an annuity – where rates of return are at record lows – in order to generate a retirement income. Sceptics had predicted that savers would withdraw unsustainable sums or blow their money on frivolities. Before the introduction of the freedoms, the then pensions minister, Steve Webb, said he was relaxed about how pensioners spent their savings – even if they used them to buy a Lamborghini sports car. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. Pension freedom withdrawal figures ease fears of pensioners wasting savings. 2. 43% of withdrawals were potentially for sums above 4%; 4.2% were for sums greater than 10%. 3.

First off, the couches, oh my god. They make it hard for anyone to ever want to get up and leave, especially if one's been drinking.  The drinks are also good. They're priced comparably to other pubs in the area so it's not cheap but it's not expensive either.  But really, the best part about the Brass Monkey is the movie showing every day at 3 PM. It's just such a fun way to hang out and relax with friends. I'm sure it's busier on the weekends but I've only gone during the week and every single time my friends and I got to pick the movie and it was usually just us in the room. They have a pretty large selection but some of their movies are missing. I've heard that you can also bring in your own DVD if you're pretty set on watching something they don't have in the library.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that played at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building? from the following article ?  Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","output":"The given data contains two primary pieces of information about Canis familiaris, also known as the domestic dog. The first piece of data is the accession number \\"XP_852505.1,\\" which is an identifier provided by a nucleotide or protein sequence database. The second piece of information is the dog's common name. In this analysis, I will provide a detailed explanation of both components, as well as any relevant background information. Canis familiaris, the domestic dog, is a highly diverse mammalian species that has been bred and selected over thousands of years for a wide range of physical and behavioral traits, leading to a great variety of breeds and types of dogs. Supported by genomic research, the domestic dog is morphologically, physiologically, and genetically distinguishable from the gray wolf (Canis lupus). The domestication and selective breeding process have created a complex, rich history of relationships between humans and dogs through companionship, work, and support roles. The accession number \\"XP_852505.1\\" is a unique identifier assigned to a specific molecular sequence in a sequence database. These databases store and organize a vast amount of genetic, genomic, and protein sequence information generated through scientific research. In this case, the accession number corresponds to a protein sequence related to the domestic dog (Canis familiaris). The \\"XP\\" prefix in the accession number signifies that the protein sequence is derived from a computationally predicted gene model rather than a directly sequenced protein. These predicted sequences are usually based on evidence from related species and other bioinformatics methods to infer the gene structure. The number following the prefix, \\"852505.1,\\" identifies the specific protein sequence in the database. The \\".1\\" at the end indicates the current revision version. Over time, as more data becomes available and prediction models improve, the sequence may be updated, leading to an incremented version number, such as \\".2,\\" \\".3,\\" etc. Accession numbers play a crucial role in scientific research by enabling scientists to unambiguously refer to and access specific sequences in databases. Through these databases, users can easily find, analyze, and compare sequences for their research projects. Databases like the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and its Entrez System or the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) host numerous accession numbers for a broad range of species, including Canis familiaris. Together, the two main pieces of information given, the accession number and the common name, form a comprehensive package of knowledge that allows researchers to efficiently locate and study the molecular aspects of the domestic dog. By utilizing this information, scientists can better understand the genetics and evolution of this fascinating species, enabling discoveries on topics like dog behavior, physiology, and the impact of domestication on modern dogs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: It was the end of the school term and my son Tom had less than three months left before he would finish his six years at high school. During this time he had developed a love for basketball. Sadly, because of my work over the last twelve months, I had only been able to attend a few of his games; however, I was determined to get to his last game for the school term. Tom's team came out in the first 10 minutes with a burst of goals that saw them leading by just over 20 points at the end of the first half. The second half changed as the other team quickly played themselves back into the game. Tom's team started to miss an increasing number of shots. It was at that point that the coach called his first time out. The noise of the spectators   became quiet as the coach spoke to them. He had the team standing in a half circle, but he squatted   down, looking up at them and fiving some very calm and clear instructions on what they needed to do in the last couple of minutes. As he stood up to allow the team to return to the court, I saw him give some further words of encouragement to all of them. You could see that he knew that the team was fighting to save the game and that he needed to lift them up. By squatting down he placed himself in a position where he was talking up to them, rather than down or at them, and as the players went back onto the court his words of encouragement served to lift their energy and spirits. Well, Tom's team went on to win the final by 5 points. As I drove away I thought about what can happen to us all in our everyday life. One of my favourite quotes is about the half filled glass of water --- \\"Is it half full or is it half empty?\\" Like the coach, the answer to this quote all depends on how you look at things.

Isaac, an adventurous and fun-loving young boy, was swimming with his younger brother Xander when their innocent exploration of the vast ocean took a heartbreaking turn. The two boys found themselves drawn further out to sea, captivated by the mystery and beauty of the underwater world, eager to examine the barnacles clinging to the nearby rocks. Little did Isaac and his family know that this would be the last adventure they'd share together, as an unanticipated incident unfolded before them. The two young siblings, siblings who shared everything from laughter to love for the ocean, ventured out together as they often did. On this fateful day, the seemingly calm waters gave way to a life-altering moment. As they began to get into difficulties off the coast, their father, Adam Nash, quickly came to their rescue. With great courage and determination, he successfully saved Xander from the clutches of the fierce currents. However, tragically, Isaac was swept away before his father could reach him. Adding to the heartbreak, Isaac's grandfather was by his side, desperately trying to hold on to his precious grandson. As they clung to rocks for dear life, a huge wave struck with tremendous force, tearing Isaac from his grandfather's grip and carrying him away. This devastating moment marked a turning point in their lives when the joy of exploring the ocean turned into an unspeakable loss for the Nash family. In the face of this immeasurable and life-altering tragedy, Isaac's parents found solace and comfort in their faith. His mother, Zoe, 35, speaking amidst her immeasurable grief, expressed gratitude and love for her lost son. She said she 'thanked God' for her 'amazing, special boy' who brought immense joy and love into their lives. The memory of Isaac's vivacious spirit and love for life continues to act as a source of strength for the family in their darkest moments. Isaac Nash's story serves as a poignant reminder of the unforeseeable dangers that can arise, even during the most mundane of family outings. Moreover, it speaks to the universal theme of love, loss, and the healing power of faith. Isaac's memory shines brightly, not merely as a cautionary tale but as an enduring beacon of hope to families facing similar tragedies. As the Nash family continues to navigate the murky waters of grief, their determination to honor Isaac's memory highlights the importance of cherishing the time we have with our loved ones. The strength and grace with which Isaac's family faced this crushing adversity is an inspiring lesson in resilience and courage. In the wake of this tragic story, we must look to the Nash family's unwavering faith, and the memory of Isaac's adventurous spirit as a source of strength to face our own life's challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: The Church of Hagia Sophia was always a relatively minor and unimportant Christian church. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"If the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot be true, as they contradict each other. Let's analyze each sentence in detail to understand why this is the case. Sentence 1:  \\"For nearly 1,000 years the Church of Haghia Sophia was the greatest church in Christendom, an architectural wonder built by the Byzantine Empire to impress the world.\\" This sentence states that for almost a millennium, the Church of Hagia Sophia (also known as \\"Haghia Sophia\\") was considered the most significant church in the Christian world. It highlights the building's impressive architecture and suggests that it was constructed with the intent to amaze and captivate everyone's attention. The Byzantine Empire, which built the church, aimed to showcase its grandeur and importance. Some historical background supports the statement in the first sentence. The Hagia Sophia was constructed in 537 AD in the heart of the Byzantine capital, Constantinople (present-day Istanbul, Turkey). It was the largest church of its time and the epitome of Byzantine architectural innovation, featuring massive dome structures supported by pendentives. As the foremost church in the Byzantine Empire, the Hagia Sophia also played a crucial role in religious ceremonies and the empire's political affairs. Sentence 2: \\"The Church of Hagia Sophia was always a relatively minor and unimportant Christian church.\\" In contrast to Sentence 1, this sentence claims that the Hagia Sophia was never a significant or central figure in the Christian world. It is described as a \\"minor\\" and \\"unimportant\\" institution, which opposes the idea in Sentence 1 that it was the \\"greatest church in Christendom.\\" Given the historical evidence supporting the Church of Hagia Sophia's prominence during the Byzantine Empire, the second sentence cannot be true if the first sentence is accurate. Both statements are mutually exclusive, and if the Church of Hagia Sophia was indeed a marvel of architecture and the center of Christian faith for nearly 1,000 years, it cannot be considered an insignificant or minor place of worship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Problem:Automatic question generation from paragraphs is an important and challenging problem, particularly due to the long context from paragraphs. In this paper, we propose and study two hierarchical models for the task of question generation from paragraphs. Specifically, we propose (a) a novel hierarchical BiLSTM model with selective attention and (b) a novel hierarchical Transformer architecture, both of which learn hierarchical representations of paragraphs.   We model a paragraph in terms of its constituent sentences, and a sentence in terms of its constituent words. While the introduction of the attention mechanism benefits the hierarchical BiLSTM model, the hierarchical Transformer, with its inherent attention and positional encoding mechanisms also performs better than flat transformer model.  We conducted empirical evaluation on the widely used SQuAD and MS MARCO datasets using standard metrics.   The results demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the hierarchical models over their flat counterparts.   Qualitatively, our hierarchical models are able to generate fluent and relevant questions.

The text states that the individual went for a big interview \\"yesterday\\" and they were very nervous. Additionally, they mentioned going over their answers \\"all night long.\\" However, this could potentially imply that they prepared for the interview the night before it took place, rather than the interview occurring in the evening. It is essential to remember that people often prepare for significant events like job interviews in advance, and many individuals might study and rehearse their answers during the nights leading up to the interview to ensure they are fully prepared. In conclusion, although the statement about the interview happening yesterday and the person rehearsing their answers \\"all night long\\" can suggest a strong sense of preparation, it does not provide enough context to definitively determine that the interview took place in the evening."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film opens as the shy, soft-spoken Joel Barish and the unrestrained free-spirit Clementine Kruczynski begin a relationship on a Long Island Rail Road train from Montauk, New York to Rockville Centre. They are almost immediately drawn to each other despite their different personalities, though both had felt the need to travel to Montauk that day. Although they do not realize it at the time, Joel and Clementine are, in fact, former lovers, now separated after having spent two years together. After a fight, Clementine had hired the New York City firm Lacuna, Inc. to erase all of her memories of their relationship. Upon discovering this from his friends Rob and Carrie, Joel was devastated and decided to undergo the procedure himself, a process that takes place while he sleeps. Much of the film subsequently takes place in Joel's mind during this memory erasure procedure. As his memories are erased, he tries to evade the erasing effects of the procedure by hiding Clementine in remote parts of his unconscious. Joel finds himself revisiting them in reverse. Upon seeing happier times of love with Clementine from earlier in their relationship, he struggles to preserve at least some memory of her and his love for her. Despite his efforts to either hide the memories or wake up and stop the process, the memories are slowly erased. He comes to the last remaining memory of Clementine, the day he first had met her at a beach house in Montauk. As this memory disintegrates around them, she tells him, \\"Meet me in Montauk.\\" Separate, but related, story arcs, which revolve around the employees of Lacuna, are revealed during Joel's memory erasure. Patrick, one of the Lacuna technicians performing the erasure, uses Joel's memories and mannerisms to seduce Clementine. Mary, the Lacuna receptionist, is dating the other memory-erasing technician, Stan. During Joel's memory wipe, Mary discovers she had previously had an affair with Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the married doctor who heads the company, and had agreed to have this erased... A:","output":"Considering the various story arcs and themes explored in the movie, here's a potential question:  How do the actions of Lacuna, Inc.'s employees, such as Patrick's manipulation of Clementine and Mary's discovery of her affair with Dr. Mierzwiak, reflect upon the ethical implications of memory erasure and its impact on both personal relationships and individual identities?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why is homosexuality accepted but incest isn't? Why is incest taboo but homosexuality is not? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. Both questions seek to understand why homosexuality is accepted while incest is not. Let's analyze each question for a deeper understanding: 1. Why is homosexuality accepted but incest isn't? This question is asking for reasons why society typically accepts homosexuality but considers incest unacceptable. 2. Why is incest taboo but homosexuality is not? This question is essentially asking the same thing but in reverse order, focusing on why incest is generally considered taboo in comparison to homosexuality. To answer the questions: Homosexuality and incest are treated differently by society for several reasons. While they both involve relationships between consenting individuals, the factors that differentiate them include: 1. Biological repercussions: Incestuous relationships, especially between close relatives, can result in offspring with a higher risk of genetic abnormalities due to shared genes. Homosexual relationships do not have this concern as they do not produce biological offspring. 2. Power dynamics: Incestuous relationships often involve familial bonds, which can create imbalanced power dynamics and potential for abuse or coercion. Homosexual relationships generally do not have these imbalances due to familial ties. 3. Cultural and historical context: In many cultures and religious traditions, incest has been considered taboo due to the potential risks it poses to family structures and genetic health. Conversely, attitudes toward homosexuality have evolved over time, and in many places around the world, it is now accepted as a natural variation of human sexuality. 4. Legal implications: In many jurisdictions, incest is explicitly prohibited by law, whereas homosexuality has become decriminalized and, in some cases, legally protected. Although the two questions may be phrased differently, they ultimately inquire about the same information: the reasons behind the differing acceptability of homosexuality and incest in society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is the leader of a gang which commits political crimes for the local politician Tiwari Bhaisaab (Naseeruddin Shah). Ishwar 'Langda' Tyagi (Saif Ali Khan) and Keshav 'Kesu Firangi' Upadhyay (Vivek Oberoi) are his closest lieutenants. The movie starts with Langda Tyagi gate-crashing a baraat and challenging Rajju (Deepak Dobriyal), the bridegroom, to try and stop Omkara from abducting the bride, Dolly Mishra (Kareena Kapoor). Rajju fails and the wedding never takes place. Dollyâs father Advocate Raghunath Mishra (Kamal Tiwari), mostly referred in the movie as vakeel saab (lawyer sir), is furious and confronts Omi. He puts a gun to Omiâs head and demands the return of his daughter. Bhaisaab intervenes and resolves the conflict by mentioning the current political conditions and prevents bloodshed. Still unconvinced, Raghunath grieves to Bhaisaab the next day. To bring an end to this issue, Dolly is made to appear in front of her father and clarify that she eloped with Omi and was not abducted. She also tells the events of how she fell in love with Omkara. The father leaves feeling betrayed and ashamed. The director here references one of the most significant lines of the play Othello, with Dolly's father repeating the couplet almost verbatim, albeit in translation. The original lines read, \\"Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see. She has deceived her father and may thee.\\" After some crafty political arm-twisting, involving an MMS sex scandal, Omkara eliminates a powerful electoral rival. Bhaisaab is elected for parliament and Omkara is promoted from bahubali to the candidate for the upcoming state elections. Omkara appoints Kesu over Langda as his successor once he enters politics himself.

Yeni Demokrasiye yeni lider Translate to English","output":"A New Leader for New Democracy The phrase \\"Yeni Demokrasiye yeni lider\\" in Turkish translates to \\"A New Leader for New Democracy\\" in English. This sentence could have various interpretations and implications, depending on the context in which it is used. In general, it is referring to a fresh, innovative, and capable individual who is taking the lead in a political movement or situation that is focused on promoting and implementing democratic values, ideals, and processes in a society or nation. Let's delve deeper into what this could imply. 1. A change in leadership: This statement might suggest that a political party or movement, referred to as \\"New Democracy,\\" is experiencing a shift in its leadership. This could be a result of an election, reorganization, or an internal decision to change the direction or focus of the group. The new leader is expected to embody the values and principles of the movement and be ready to work towards achieving the organization's goals and objectives. 2. Renewed commitment to democratic values: Another interpretation of this phrase is that it signifies a renewed commitment to promoting and protecting democratic values, such as freedom, justice, equality, and representation. By appointing a new leader, the New Democracy movement is confirming its dedication to fostering a political culture that is transparent, just, and inclusive. 3. Innovative approaches: Further, the statement could indicate that the new leader is expected to bring forward fresh ideas and innovative strategies to strengthen democracy and address contemporary challenges. This may include issues such as political polarization, fake news dissemination, social media influence on public opinion, and addressing economic inequality, among others. 4. Democratisation efforts in a specific context: Another possible interpretation is that the sentence refers to a particular country or geopolitical context where the New Democracy movement is pushing for democratic reforms or political transitions. The new leader might be responsible for guiding the group through these changes, fostering national dialogue, and working with a range of stakeholders to ensure a more democratic future. 5. A response to previous leadership failures: Lastly, the phrase could be understood as a call for change in response to perceived leadership failures within the New Democracy movement or the broader political context. The appointment of a new leader might be an attempt to reinvigorate the organization, redefine its goals, and restore public trust in the principles of democratic governance. In conclusion, the Turkish phrase \\"Yeni Demokrasiye yeni lider\\" translates to \\"A New Leader for New Democracy\\" in English. It can have various interpretations owing to its political, social, and cultural implications, but it generally suggests the appointment of a capable and innovative individual to lead the way in promoting and upholding democratic values and processes in a particular context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first statement, \\"A woman in a black shirt is holding a picture of another person,\\" more details are provided about the person holding the photo and the content of the photo itself. The person is specifically described as a woman wearing a black shirt, which adds a visual element to the description. Moreover, the \\"picture\\" is clarified as being an image of \\"another person.\\" These added details enhance the overall understanding of the situation by providing more context.  On the other hand, the second statement, \\"A person holds a photo,\\" is a more simplified and general version of the first statement. It still accurately conveys the main idea that someone is holding a photograph, but it lacks the specificity and descriptive features found in the first statement. The gender and outfit of the person holding the photo are not mentioned, and the content of the photo is not specified either.

Given the question: Some viruses live in a dormant state inside the body, and although the herpes virus never leaves the body, it can lay dormant for long periods of time. Given these facts, how does herpes stay in a person among the following options: - It reproduces quickly  - hospitalization  - decreases  - It dies and never comes out  - It stays active  - It remains dormant  - They may not survive.  - It helps them survive The answer is:","output":"It remains dormant. The herpes virus is a complex and fascinating microorganism. When infected, a person carries the virus for life due to its ability to remain dormant inside the body. This viral dormancy, also known as latency, is a crucial factor for the herpes virus's survival and persistence in its host. The other options mentioned do not accurately describe the way herpes stays in a person. Herpesviruses belong to a family of viruses known as Herpesviridae. Within this family, there are two key types: herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), which are the primary causes of oral herpes and genital herpes, respectively. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can enter a dormant state within their host, hiding from the immune system and avoiding destruction. Once a person is infected with the herpes virus, the virus enters and replicates within the epithelial cells of the skin or mucous membranes. From there, the virus moves to the sensory nerve endings and travels along the nerve pathway to the nerve ganglia, which are clusters of nerve cells near the spinal cord. HSV-1 typically resides in the trigeminal ganglia, while HSV-2 resides in the sacral ganglia. Within the ganglia, the virus becomes latent, effectively \\"hiding\\" from the body's immune system. During its dormant state, the herpes virus is not actively replicating, which means it is not causing new sores or symptoms. However, the virus can periodically reactivate, traveling back down the nerve pathway to the site of the initial infection. These reactivation events cause the formation of new sores and can be triggered by factors such as stress, illness, hormonal changes, or sun exposure. The latency period varies between individuals, with some experiencing frequent outbreaks and others having only occasional or no outbreaks at all. The frequency of outbreaks typically decreases over time. It is important to note that during these dormant periods without symptoms, the herpes virus can still be transmitted to others through a process known as asymptomatic shedding. This occurs when the virus becomes active on the surface of the skin but does not cause overt symptoms. In summary, the herpes virus remains dormant within the nerve ganglia for extended periods, allowing it to persist in the host's body indefinitely. During periods of dormancy, the virus is not actively replicating, resulting in a lack of visible symptoms. However, occasional reactivation events can lead to the formation of new sores or asymptomatic viral shedding, making the herpes virus a lifelong infection and a public health concern."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An underground garage called Cardok makes this possible, while lending a superspy HQ mystique to your split-level home. Essentially a covered car elevator installed into a pit, the 60,000 device is billed by its creators as a stylish safety solution, particularly for high-dollar vehicles. It not only protects them from the elements, but also makes them more difficult to steal than from a traditional above ground garage. Also, it’s just slightly cooler than an rolling garage door. The top can be paved or decorated to match the surrounding surface, or equipped to support a second car of up to 6,600 pounds, doubling your storage capacity within the same square footage. Unfortunately, you’re mother-in-law won’t be able to move into the apartment above it, since there isn’t one, but you can always park a camper for her there. Lifting is managed by an electro-hydraulic system that the company says is nearly silent, and Cardok comes with a backup generator in case of a power outage.

When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Leonard Bernstein gave a concert in Berlin, including Beethoven's Ode to Joy, with the word \\"Joy\\" changed to \\"Freedom\\" in the lyrics sung.The orchestra were drawn from both East and West Germany, as well as the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Freedom was in the air and it was not just for people. The wall between East and West Germany had also kept a large population of wild pigs within the eastern forests of Brandenburg.The wall's falling down made it easier for the big pigs--a very big one can weigh over 300 pounds--to leave the woodlands and walk into the town. Warm winters and easy access to food have helped the population increase. Now about 10,000 wild pigs walk around Berlin. The nature of the beast has added to the boom .\\"The pigs are intelligent,\\" says Marc Franusch, a spokesman for the Berlin forestry department. \\"They learn to use the neighborhoods.They get used to people, dogs, and traffic.\\" The wild pigs tend to travel in small groups and have been found searching rubbish and gardens, feeding their piglets in the shadow of parked cars, and crossing busy roads.On average, the animals are involved in one traffic accident every day. And despite the fact that it's illegal, some Berliners have been known to give the pigs food. Though wild pigs are protected under German law, the city's forestry department is permitted to kill 2,000 of the creatures every year, targeting mostly young adult animals in forests surrounding Berlin. Pigs within city limits are only shot if they make an immediate threat.No humans have yet been seriously wounded by them, but local dogs have been the victims of their tusks. \\"The forestry department is not aiming to get rid of the pigs,\\" explains Franusch, \\"but we do have to reduce dangerous situations.\\" The following factors contribute to the boom of wild pigs EXCEPT  _  . A) the Berlin Wall B) adequate food C) their own nature D) warm winter The answer to this question is:","output":"A) the Berlin Wall The Berlin Wall's fall in 1989 had a significant impact on the population of wild pigs in the eastern forests of Brandenburg. The absence of the wall allowed the pigs to easily leave the woodlands and move into the city of Berlin. The increase in the wild pig population can be attributed to several factors, including the availability of food, their adaptable nature, and warm winters. The intelligence of the pigs allowed them to learn to navigate urban environments, becoming accustomed to people, dogs, and traffic. While the Berlin Wall's removal facilitated the migration of the wild pigs into the city, it was not a contributing factor to the boom in their population. Rather, it was the combination of other factors, such as adequate food sources, the creature's adaptable nature, and the warmer winters, which allowed the wild pig population to grow. This population growth has caused some challenges for city officials and residents, as wild pigs have become more prominent in urban areas. Traffic accidents involving the animals have become more common, and the pigs have been known to search through rubbish, feed in gardens, and cause harm to local dogs. Additionally, some Berliners have illegally fed the pigs, further encouraging their presence in the city. While wild pigs are protected by German law, the Berlin forestry department is allowed to cull a certain number of them each year, focusing on young adult animals found in forests surrounding the city. Any pigs within the city limits are only shot if they pose an immediate threat. The department's goal is not to eliminate the population entirely, but to reduce the number of dangerous situations caused by the pigs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the term render mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"No, the term \\"render\\" does not carry the same meaning in both the sentences. The word \\"render\\" is versatile and has several meanings depending upon the context in which it's used.  In the first sentence, \\"To render Latin into English\\", the term \\"render\\" pertains to translation or interpretation, meaning to transform content from one language (Latin) into another language (English). Here, \\"render\\" is used in the context of converting or expressing the same ideas in different forms or languages. It relates to the transformational aspect, implying a process of conversion that remains true to the transmission of the original meaning from the source language into the target language.  In the second sentence, \\"Render the town to the enemy\\", the term \\"render\\" is used in the sense of surrender or giving up. It suggests the act of turning over or yielding something to somebody, often under duress. In this instance, it is understood as a relinquishing control of the town to the enemy. This usage of \\"render\\" often involves a transfer of possession and tends to be utilized in more militaristic, confrontatal or legal circumstances.  Therefore, while the term \\"render\\" may appear in both sentences, its interpretation differs substantially reflecting the word's semantic flexibility. It is important to identify context in order to accurately interpret the meaning. Despite sharing grammatical form, these two meanings of \\"render\\" share little in terms of denotational similaries, demonstrating the wide range the english language has for utilizing individual terms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix—for example, the imperfective psát (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-. In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodávat. Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb jít (to go) has the iterative form chodit (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form chodívat (to go regularly).

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the group that had plotted to park \\"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer\\"? from the following article ?  McVeigh later said that he had contemplated assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.A resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The Murrah building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell. The group had plotted to park \\"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer.\\" After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing.The nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed fourteen federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps.

A:","output":"The name of the group that had plotted to park \\"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer\\" in October 1983 was The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA). This white supremacist group included founder James Ellison and Richard Snell, who had targeted the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The bombing plot described in the article, however, ultimately was carried out by Timothy McVeigh in 1995, which was a separate incident from the CSA's 1983 plot. McVeigh had considered other targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas but decided on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building due to its housing of multiple federal law enforcement agencies.

The key point in the sentence is the mention of \\"anumāṇa (inference)\\" as one of the six pramāṇas within Hindu philosophy. Pramāṇas are sources of knowledge, and in this particular context, the focus is on the concept of inference, also known as logical reasoning or drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning. In Hindu philosophy, anumāṇa is considered a crucial aspect of acquiring knowledge and understanding the underlying truths of the world. Hindu philosophy comprises various schools of thought, such as Vedanta, Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Nyāya, and Mīmāṃsā. Each school has its own specific focus and methodology, but they all share the common aim of attaining knowledge and pursuing spiritual realization. Anumāṇa (inference) is recognized by most Hindu philosophical schools, but it assumes particular significance in the Nyāya school, which is known for its emphasis on logic, analysis, and epistemology. The Nyāya school bases its foundation on the Nyāya Sūtras, attributed to the ancient philosopher Ākṣapāda Gautama. This school is built on a systematic approach to acquiring knowledge, which revolves around a well-defined process using perceptive evidence, inference, analogy, and the testimony of reliable sources. It is centered on the idea that accurate knowledge can be attained by identifying valid and reliable sources of information and distinguishing truth from falsehood. In conclusion, the concept of anumāṇa (inference) forms an integral part of Hindu philosophy, particularly in the Nyāya school. The sentence provided delivers a valid answer to the question concerning which aspect of Hindu philosophy is focused on inference by listing anumāṇa as one of the six pramāṇas, pointing out the significance of inference as a means of obtaining accurate knowledge and discovering truths within the philosophical framework of Hinduism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: A:","output":"Chewing insects like dragonflies and grasshoppers possess two primary sets of jaws, which play an essential role in their feeding process. These jaws are known as the mandibles and maxillae. Each set of jaws has its functions and features that enable these insects to process and consume their food effectively. 1. Mandibles: Mandibles are the first set of jaws found in chewing insects. They are powerful and robust, responsible for cutting, crushing, and breaking down food into smaller pieces. These are situated just below the insect's head, and their structure typically consists of two opposing, hinge-like parts that move horizontally against each other. The mandibles can vary in their shape, size, and tooth configuration, depending on the insect's dietary preference. For example, a predatory dragonfly will have sharp and powerful mandibles to seize and devour its prey, while grasshoppers will have mandibles designed to cut and grind plant material. 2. Maxillae: Maxillae are the second set of jaws present in chewing insects. They are smaller and more delicate than mandibles and are primarily used for handling, manipulating, and guiding food towards the mandibles for further processing. Maxillae are paired structures, situated just behind the mandibles, and are composed of several components. The two main parts of the maxillae are the maxillary palp and the galea. The maxillary palp is a sensory organ that helps the insect to taste and manipulate food items, while the galea is a lobe-like structure that covers and protects the other delicate parts of the maxillae. In addition to these two primary sets of jaws, chewing insects also have a labium, which serves as the insect's lower lip. The labium is a fused structure that originates from a pair of secondary maxillae. Like the maxillae, the labium also has sensory structures called labial palps that assist the insect in its feeding process. Altogether, the mandibles, maxillae, and labium form a functional and efficient mouthpart assembly that allows chewing insects like dragonflies and grasshoppers to consume a wide range of food sources. These structures work together to ensure that these insects can efficiently capture, process, and ingest their prey or plant-based food items, providing them with the necessary nutrients for growth, reproduction, and survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Peter Bone put on the stripy, multicoloured woolly headgear, complete with tassels and ear flaps, to raise awareness of a breast cancer charity. But Mr Bercow said he was \\"glad\\" when the MP for Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, removed it. He told Mr Bone he should not wear it again, \\"preferably at any time, but certainly not in the chamber\\". More than a century ago, hats were commonly worn in the Commons, but not when addressing the House, entering or leaving it. They also allowed members to reserve a seat for popular debates. They tended to be top hats and of a less colourful type than Mr Bone's. But the Conservative right-winger had an unlikely sartorial ally in former Labour leader Keir Hardie, who preferred a soft cap, and the radical Liberal Joseph Cowen, who complained that \\"the rigidity of the top hat subjected him to headache\\". And, until 1998, any MP wishing to raise a point of order during a division was required to wear a top hat. Special collapsible versions were kept for this purpose. Standing up in the Commons, Mr Bone, said: \\"Tomorrow is local charities day and we also have very good local charities in our constituencies and one of mine is Crazy Hats.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which township is experiencing fewer tornadoes?  Hint: Atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability, or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere. Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Jolt township is experiencing fewer tornadoes compared to Burr township. This is because Jolt township is situated at a higher altitude with a less windy and less cloudy environment.

Forty-five episodes were made over four series. The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into something larger in scope and impact, including touring stage shows, films, numerous albums, several books, and a stage musical. The Pythons' influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music. The \\"Orlando Sentinel\\" referred to their sketch show as \\"not only one of the more enduring icons of 1970s British popular culture, but also an important moment in the evolution of television comedy.\\"  - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers.

As \\"Fingerprince\\" was originally meant to be a three-sided album (a concept abandoned due to expense and Monty Python's \\"Matching Tie and Handkerchief\\" beating them to the punch), much of the material was abandoned and the third side remained unfinished until November 1977 although most tracks from the EP was shown at the Residents Radio Special in September 1977. Thus, the group reduced the third side to an extended play record entitled '\\"Babyfingers'\\", and released it in 1979 to people who had been waiting for their copy of \\"The Third Reich and Roll\\" box sets. A second printing was made for members of the W.E.I.R.D. fan club in 1981, and a last pressing, on pink vinyl, in 1985.

You decide. Compared with 50 years ago, when I was just four years old, people now make nearly three times as much money, eat one third more food and expect to live one third longer. In fact, it's hard to find any areas of the world that's worse off  now than it was then, even though the world population has more than doubled over that period. One reason we are richer, healthier, taller, cleverer, longer-lived and freer than ever before is that the four most basic human needs--food, clothing, fuel and shelter--have grown much cheaper. Take one example: In 1800, a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work. In the 1880s, the same light from a lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for. In 1950, it was eight seconds. Today, it's half a second. In these terms, we are 43,200 times better off than in1800. In the United States, rivers, lakes, seas and air are getting cleaner all the time. A car today produces less pollution traveling at full speed than a parked car did from leaks   in 1970. Although the world population is growing, the rate   of increase has been falling for 50 years. Across the world, national birth rates are lower now than in 1960, and in the less developed world, the birth rate has almost halved.

Hypothesis: The PLO remained much to the satisfaction of everyone. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.  The conclusion that the PLO's exit would satisfy everyone is not directly inferred from the premise. The premise talks about two primary aspects: firstly, that the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) was forced out, and secondly, that this action was carried out without a lot of support from within Israel. What this means is that a certain body or group compelled the PLO to leave, with the fact being emphasized that this decision or action was not widely or fully supported by Israel.  This might be due to a plethora of reasons. For instance, there might be members or groups within Israel that were either sympathetic to the cause of the PLO, were against the use of force, or believed in a peaceful and negotiated settlement. On the other hand, there could have been those who simply felt this would not solve the underlying issue or those who were unsure of the future implications of this forceful eviction.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that the PLO’s exit was met with universal satisfaction—which is neither mentioned nor implied in the premise. Given the lack of widespread support for the PLO's eviction within Israel, as stated in the premise, it can be inferred that there might have been differing opinions about the expulsion of the PLO. These differences are likely to include dissatisfaction or disagreement from certain quarters.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not an entirely accurate encapsulation or interpretation of the premise. There is ambiguity and the premise does not provide enough information to assert that there was a complete and universal feeling of satisfaction post the PLO's exit. It may be the case that certain parties were satisfied, but the assumption that everyone was satisfied is not supported by the premise. Without specific detail regarding the wider reactions to the event from the parties involved or possibly affected, it cannot be assumed that the exit of the PLO was to everyone's satisfaction. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:This article: Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895. Although Grainger never returned permanently to Australia, he... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that played at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building?, what is it ?

Article: One British survivor of the disaster, which claimed 12 lives with 20 people still missing, branded the offer as \\"insulting\\".      It was disclosed that in an attempt to help survivors the ship's parent company, Carnival, has been telephoning passengers daily asking if they are suffering nightmares or sleepless nights.      But that move also appeared to backfire when a psychologist said such questioning could trigger post traumatic stress rather than relieve it.      A little over a week after the ship capsized off the coast of Tuscany, it also emerged that:      • An emergency services log showed that the Concordia's captain, Francisco Schettino, abandoned ship more than four hours before the last passenger.      • A separate voice recording showed Capt Schettino pledging to be the last man on the ship, suggesting erratic behaviour and that he lied to the authorities.      • Divers recovered the ship's safe from the captain's cabin along with the body of a woman they found in a submerged corridor      The offer for future discounts is being made by Costa Cruises, which operated the Concordia and whose parent company is Carnival, the world's largest cruise operator.      Passengers were also being sent letters by Costa detailing how to claim for lost valuables and offering a full refund on the voyage.      Lawyers plan to sue both in the US and in Italy, with more than 100 passengers already reported to have joined a class action that is to be lodged in Miami this week.      Each is reported to be demanding between £100,000 and £1 million in compensation.      A spokesman for Costa Cruises said: \\"The company is trying to do everything they can for those passengers directly affected.      \\"The company is not only going to refund everybody but they will offer a 30 per cent discount on future cruises if they want to stay loyal to the company.\\"      Costa's chief executive, Pier Luigi Foschi, who estimated that the impact of the disaster on his firm was £60 million, had expressed confidence that the group would be able to \\"find a solution that, in the material sense, would satisfy\\" the passengers.      However, Brian Page, 63, a retired accountant from Southampton, who survived by sliding from one side of the deck to another to find a lifeboat, said: \\"It is a ridiculous and insulting offer. I'm very disappointed in them.      \\"They are not accepting their responsibilities at all. Our only back-up is separate legal action.\\"      Costa Cruises has laid the blame on Capt Schettino, who steered the liner on to rocks and then abandoned ship before all the passengers got off.      But lawyers for the passengers will claim that Costa Cruise ships had \\"regularly\\" deviated from the correct route.      The ongoing civil legal battle is complicated by the criminal case against Capt Schettino and the specific contracts signed by passengers.      Last week, Carnival began phoning British passengers asking if they were suffering nightmares, sleepless nights and needed counselling.      Mr Page and other passengers, including Janice and Ian Donoff, from north London, and Edwin and Liz Gurd, from Hampshire, received calls.      Lawyers, however, have questioned the company's motives.      Clive Garner, head of the travel law team at Irwin Mitchell, who represents at least one British passenger, said: \\"I would advise Carnival to desist from doing this.      \\"In other large-scale incidents, defendants have been very keen to liaise with victims early on with a view to making low offers of settlement.\\"      Jill Greenfield, a personal injury partner at Field Fisher Waterhouse who has successfully sued Carnival in the past, said: \\"The poor people on this ship will still be in shock and not yet realise what they have been through.      \\"It may be that Carnival are genuinely trying to help but what they should be doing is telling these people to get some legal advice.\\"      Jennifer Wild, a consultant clinical psychologist at Oxford University and King's College London, said repeatedly asking victims if they were having nightmares breached guidelines on treating people after disasters.      The questions are likely to feed anxiety and possibly even lead to post-traumatic stress, she said.      \\"They may be doing it because they just want to monitor people but this is not helpful,\\" she said.      Further details of Capt Schettino's erratic behaviour were disclosed with the publication of the official log kept by the harbour master's office, which coordinated the rescue.      The log shows how the captain, who is under house arrest, first played down the crisis and then abandoned ship more than four hours before the last passenger.      Further voice recordings add to the confusion, with Capt Schettino claiming to coastguards that he will remain on ship as the last man.      \\"I'm the only one who will stay here,\\" he told the coastguards in a tape that will be used by prosecutors to support their contention that he lied to port authorities on the night of the disaster and that he abandoned his post in contravention of the naval code.      Divers exploring the cruise ship recovered a safe from the captain's cabin on the instructions of the prosecutors. They believe it may contain documents or other evidence that could help their investigation.      The body of a 12th victim was found inside the hull of the £370 million, 1,000ft vessel. The victim, a woman, was found wearing a life jacket on the fourth deck, close to a muster station. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The Costa Concordia disaster occurred in January 2012 when the cruise ship hit rocks and capsized off the coast of Tuscany, Italy, resulting in 12 deaths and 20 people still missing at the time of this article.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks - Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the given process is \\"Inhalation of air into the lungs.\\" The detailed sequence of the process would be as follows: 1. Inhalation of air into the lungs: The process begins with the action of inhaling air into our lungs. This is accomplished by the expansion of the ribcage and descent of the diaphragm, creating a vacuum that pulls air into the respiratory system. Air flows into the body through the nose or mouth, travels down the trachea, passes through the bronchi, and finally enters the lungs where the bronchioles and alveoli are located. 2. Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream: Once the air reaches the alveoli, the exchange of gases takes place. Oxygen molecules in the inhaled air diffuse across the thin walls of the alveolar sacs into the surrounding capillaries, where they bind to hemoglobin in red blood cells. This oxygen-rich blood is then pumped throughout the body by the circulatory system to provide energy and nutrients to cells. 3. Air is pushed through the vocal cords: When a person decides to talk, their brain sends signals to the muscles associated with speech and vocalization. The diaphragm and the muscles surrounding the ribcage contract, increasing pressure in the lungs. This forces air to travel upward through the trachea and over the vocal cords. The vibration of the vocal cords caused by the flow of air creates sound, which is then shaped into words by the tongue, lips, and other structures in the mouth. 4. A person talks: Once the air has passed through the vocal cords and the sound is generated, the person's brain coordinates a series of complex movements and articulations involving the tongue, lips, and jaw. These movements work together with the breath to produce voiced and unvoiced sounds that make up syllables, words, and sentences. Each of these sounds has specific characteristics such as pitch, intonation, and volume, controlled by the muscles in the larynx and throughout the vocal tract. 5. Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment: After the vocalization process, the remaining air within the lungs is released into the environment. This final part of the process is called exhalation. During exhalation, the diaphragm and surrounding muscles relax, allowing the ribcage to compress and reduce the volume of the lungs. As the lung volume decreases, the pressure within the lungs rises, and air is expelled through the trachea, bronchi, and out of the nose or mouth. This completes the cycle of respiration and vocalization, allowing the process to begin again with the next inhalation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
