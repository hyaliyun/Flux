Article: Seed of Kindness Jim, a successful businessman, told the experience of his childhood. When he was 12, his parents died. He was alone and didn't get on well with others. People always laughed at him. No one showed kindness to him. His only friend was a dog named Tige. He gave his dog enough to eat and drink, but sometimes he was not polite to it. He didn't know that an unkind work sometimes could cut one's heart like a knife. One day as he walked down the street, a young lady was walking in front of him. Suddenly one of her bags dropped from her arms. As she stopped to pick it up, she dropped other bags. He came to help her.\\"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!\\"she said kindly, smiling. A special feeling came to him. These were the first kind words he had ever heard. He watched her until she went far away, and then he whistled to his dog happily and went directly to the river nearby. \\"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!\\"he repeatedthe woman's words. Then in a low voice he said to his dog,\\"You are a nice little dog!\\"Tige raised its ears as if it understood. \\"Uhum! Even a dog likes it!\\"he said,\\"Well, Tige, I won't say unkind words to you anymore.\\"Tige waved its tail happily. The boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw nothing but a dirty boy. He washed his face carefully. Again he looked. He saw a clean nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he had a new life. After telling this, the businessman stopped for a while, and then he said,\\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very place where that kind woman planted in me the first seed of kindness. All of us should learn about kindness. What a great powerit has!\\" Question: Who was Jim's only friend? Answer: A:","output":"Tige (the dog)"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When I was a little kid, a father was like the light in the fridge. Every house had one, but no one really knew what either of them did when the door was shut. My dad left the house every morning and always seemed glad to see every one again at night. He opened the jar of pickles when no one else at home could. He was the only one in the house who wasn't afraid to go into the basement by himself. Whenever it rained, he got into the car and brought it around to the door. When anyone was sick, he went out to get the prescription  filled. He set mousetraps. He cut back the roses so the thorns  wouldn't hurt you when you came to the front door. He oiled my roller skates, and they went faster. When I got my bike, he ran alongside me for at least a thousand miles until I _ . He signed all my report and cards. He took a lot of pictures, but was never in them. He tightened up Mother's sagging  clothesline every week or so. I was afraid of everyone else's father, but not my own. Whenever I played house , the mother doll had a lot to do. I never knew what to do with the daddy doll, so I had him say, \\"I'm going off to work now,\\" and threw him under the bed.

I started by translating the first sentence, with \\"There cannot be any compromise on safety,\\" as \\"Emniyet konusunda herhangi bir taviz verilemez,\\".      - \\"There cannot be any compromise\\" becomes \\"herhangi bir taviz verilemez\\".      - \\"on safety\\" translates to \\"emniyet konusunda\\". 2. I translated the name \\"EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas\\" into \\"AB Ulaştırma Komiseri Siim Kallas\\".      - EU stands for European Union, which is \\"Avrupa Birliği\\" in Turkish. I used \\"AB\\" which is the abbreviation for \\"Avrupa Birliği\\".      - \\"Transport Commissioner\\" translates as \\"Ulaştırma Komiseri\\". 3. I put the day, \\"on Monday,\\" in the sentence with the translated words which gives, \\"Pazartesi günü AB Ulaştırma Komiseri Siim Kallas konuştu.\\"     - \\"on Monday\\" becomes \\"Pazartesi günü\\".     - \\"said\\" is translated as \\"konuştu\\" in Turkish and placed after the subject.  4. I translated the second sentence, \\"All decisions must be based on scientific evidence and expert analysis.\\"      - \\"All decisions\\" becomes \\"Tüm kararlar\\".      - \\"must be based on\\" translates to \\"dayanmalıdır\\".      - \\"scientific evidence\\" is \\"bilimsel kanıtlar\\" in Turkish.      - \\"and expert analysis\\" translates as \\"ve uzman analizlere\\". 5. I put the translated words together coherently, resulting in \\"Tüm kararlar bilimsel kanıtlar ve uzman analizlere dayanmalıdır.\\" These translations are in line with the grammatical structure and syntax rules of the Turkish language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? life 's harshness","output":"Given only the phrase \\"life's harshness,\\" it is not possible to definitively determine whether the review expresses a positive or negative opinion about the movie. The phrase itself does not provide enough context or information to make a clear judgment. This is because opinions will vary about how \\"harshness\\" is conveyed in a movie and whether it is a positive or negative aspect. In some cases, a reviewer might use the phrase \\"life's harshness\\" as a compliment to describe a film that realistically and effectively portrays the struggles and challenges faced by characters. Audiences might appreciate the movie's raw, authentic, and honest depiction of life's difficulties, which could evoke powerful emotions and promote a stronger connection with the characters. In this context, the phrase would convey a positive opinion since the movie successfully communicates the complexities of life and resonates with its viewers. On the other hand, the reviewer might use \\"life's harshness\\" as a criticism to express that the movie is overly bleak, depressing, or disturbing, making it an uncomfortable or unpleasant experience. This interpretation would suggest that the film's portrayal of harsh situations is too overwhelming and might detract from other aspects of the story, such as character development or plot progression. In this case, the phrase would convey a negative opinion, as the movie's focus on life's harshness is viewed as a detrimental aspect. Without further context or details from the review, it is impossible to confidently classify the opinion as positive or negative based solely on the phrase \\"life's harshness.\\" A detailed and long answer would require more information about the reviewer's perspective, the specific aspects of the movie that were praised or criticized, and the overall tone and sentiment of the review."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He admired the inclusion of so many ideas in such a short work. An inclusion in the cytoplasm of the cell.","output":"In these two sentences, the term \\"inclusion\\" is used in different contexts and has different meanings. In the first sentence, \\"He admired the inclusion of so many ideas in such a short work,\\" inclusion refers to the act of incorporating or adding multiple ideas or concepts into a piece of work. In this context, the word signifies the intentional integration and embracing of numerous thoughts, concepts, or perspectives within a limited space, intending to enhance the work's depth and variety. In essence, the admiration for the \\"inclusion\\" in this context is about managing to cover a wide range of ideas in a concise manner. In the second sentence, \\"An inclusion in the cytoplasm of the cell,\\" the term \\"inclusion\\" is used with a specific scientific meaning. In the field of cell biology, an inclusion refers to any distinct foreign or irregular structures or substances that are present within the cell's cytoplasm. Inclusions can be various materials, such as energy storage substances like glycogen, lipids, or pigments, or they can be byproducts of cellular metabolisms, like crystals, granules, or even some pathological findings from diseases, infections, or genetic disorders. In this context, the term \\"inclusion\\" has a more technical and specific meaning, describing physical structures or materials within the cellular environment. This usage does not refer to the integration of concepts or perspectives, as seen in the first sentence. So, while both sentences use the word \\"inclusion,\\" the context and meaning are different. In the first sentence, it refers to the incorporation of various ideas in a work, while in the second sentence, it refers to the presence of particular structures or materials within a cell's cytoplasm."},{"instruction":"Question: Who play a doctor with a transplantation clinic?

A man jogging through suburban London grabs his heart, and collapses. He wakes up in a hospital bed. The nurse tending him give him water. She leaves. He pulls down the bed covers to discover both his legs have been amputated. He screams. An official (Marshall Jones) from an unidentified Eastern European totalitarian state arrives back at his home country. Upon being debriefed by a superior officer, the man steps around the table, places a hand on the man's shoulder, paralyzes him, and kills him. A Metropolitan London detective (Alfred Marks) and his unit, investigate the deaths of several young women in the city. The women, picked up at nightclubs by Keith (Michael Gothard), have apparently been killed by the same individual, and some of the bodies have been drained of blood. The centerpiece of the movie is a near 15 min. long police car-chase/foot-chase sequence through suburban London. Vincent Price plays a doctor whose clinic specializes in limb and organ transplantation. Christopher Lee plays the head of Britain's -unnamed- intelligence services.

As twilight approached, Johnny gathered the group around and began to discuss the plan for the night. He emphasized the importance of keeping their wits about them and being aware of the dangers of climbing the perilous Goth Mountain in the dark. This mysterious peak was notorious for its unpredictable weather and treacherous terrain, with legends of strange creatures lurking in the shadows. The four adventurers began their ascent, their headlamps piercing through the darkness. They knew they were facing not just physical challenges, but also the feeling of unease that came with traversing the enigmatic mountain. As they climbed, Oliver, the geologist, shared his knowledge about the intriguing geological formations they encountered. Lisa, the self-assured mountaineer, had traveled far and wide, her experience evident in the way she tackled each new challenge with ease and confidence. Tim, the nature-savvy naturalist, assisted Johnny in identifying key flora and fauna on their route that might either be beneficial or pose threats to the climb. Despite his companions' reassuring presence, Johnny couldn't help but feel a heavy burden on his shoulders, knowing that Two Bears, his trusted friend and mentor, had entrusted the safety of the group to him and had stayed behind.

They witnessed breathtaking panoramas of twinkling stars above and the vast expanse of the mountain range stretching beneath them, even as they weathered the elements. While the climb was daunting, the group became ever more reliant on each other, with their chemistry and camaraderie carrying them from one challenge to the next. They laughed, shared stories, and navigated life-threatening situations in an effort to keep their morale up as Goth Mountain yielded its secrets to them. Finally, the first rays of sunlight began to crack the horizon, bathing the adventurers in a golden glow. They looked around, exhausted but elated, as the summit of Goth Mountain lay just within reach.

Context: Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. Question: What does the author believe the last self portrait will compare to the first?

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.  Now, I have a new situation: David is an environmental scientist. Last summer he visited the tropical forest in Brazil. He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany.

Solvent molecules from the solution are pushed into the pure solvent.   Q: Applying a pressure greater than the osmotic pressure of a solution will do what?   Choices:  - ultrafiltration  - osmosis  - normal osmosis  - reverse osmosis  A: Answer:","output":"- reverse osmosis  Explanation: Based on the given paragraph, it is implied that when a pressure greater than the osmotic pressure is applied to a solution, the process of reverse osmosis takes place.  In general, osmosis is a process in which solvent molecules move across a semi-permeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration to establish equilibrium. This passive process happens naturally and requires no external energy.  However, when an external pressure greater than the natural osmotic pressure is applied to the side of the solution with a higher solute concentration, the natural flow of solvent molecules is reversed. This process is known as reverse osmosis.  In reverse osmosis, solvent molecules are pushed from the solution (more concentrated area) back into the pure solvent (less concentrated area) against the natural osmotic gradient. This is in contrast to normal osmosis or ultrafiltration where the solvent flows from a less concentrated to a more concentrated area.  Reverse osmosis is effectively used in various applications, such as in water purification processes to remove ions, unwanted molecules, and larger particles from drinking water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: suppose having a weak immune system happens, how will it affect magma stays cool inside of a volcano after a winter storm.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"No effect. A weak immune system is related to an individual's health and their ability to fight off infections and diseases. This factor has no direct impact on the geological processes occurring inside a volcano, such as the cooling of magma. The cooling of magma inside a volcano depends on various factors, like the composition of magma, the surrounding temperature, pressure, and the rate of magma flow, but it is not influenced by a person's immune system or health conditions. Similarly, a winter storm will primarily affect the external conditions around the volcano, such as air temperature and precipitation, but it would have minimal to no effect on the cooling and solidification of magma within the volcano itself. The internal processes that govern magma cooling are largely driven by heat conduction, heat loss through radiation, and convective cooling processes. In conclusion, a weak immune system and winter storms do not have any direct impact on the cooling of magma inside a volcano. The second effect mentioned, which is \\"the volcano's pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano,\\" will also remain unaffected by these factors, as the pressure build-up and eruption dynamics are largely driven by the movement and interaction of molten rock, gases, and other materials deep within the Earth's crust."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With an increasingly multicultural world and the rapid pace of globalization, it is essential to understand the demographic makeup of the global population. One particular aspect of interest is the percentage of people who are not considered 'white.' For the purpose of this article, 'white' refers to people of European descent, while 'non-white' refers to individuals of African, Asian, indigenous, mixed, and other non-European descent. In the following sections, we will examine relevant data on the non-white population, explore regional disparities, and discuss the growing diversity within various countries. Global Statistics According to the United Nations World Population Prospect, the global population currently stands at approximately 7.9 billion, with a broad range of ethnic and racial backgrounds. To understand the percentage of non-white individuals, we must first analyze the global distribution of diverse racial and ethnic populations. Europe – The continent with the highest concentration of white individuals, Europe accounts for approximately 747 million people, or about 9.4% of the global population. Asia – Home to approximately 4.7 billion people, Asia has a diverse population consisting mostly of Asian descent individuals, with a minority of other racial and ethnic groups. Africa – Around 1.4 billion people reside in Africa, with the majority belonging to various indigenous African ethnic groups. North America – With approximately 372 million people, North America is predominantly white but has significant non-white populations, such as African Americans, Native Americans, and other racial/ethnic minorities. South America – Home to around 436 million individuals, South America has sizable populations of both European and indigenous heritages, along with other racial and ethnic groups. Oceania – This region encompasses about 43 million people, composed largely of indigenous populations, such as Pacific Islanders and Aboriginal Australians, alongside European and Asian communities. Percentage of Non-White Populations Considering the global population distribution mentioned above, approximately 6.4 billion individuals or 81% are non-white individuals. This percentage has been increasing in recent decades due to increasing non-white birth rates, migration patterns, and interactions of people from different backgrounds. Regional Disparities and Diversity within Countries While the global percentage provides an overall understanding of non-white populations, regional disparities and the varying degree of diversity within countries merit further attention. Many urban areas across the globe have become increasingly diverse, with people of different races and ethnicities settling in the same locations, often due to economic opportunities, education, and cultural exchanges. In countries like the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, multiracial and multiethnic populations are growing at a rapid pace, with trends showing that larger percentages of non-white individuals reside within these societies. Conclusion Understanding the percentage of non-white populations globally provides an essential foundation for addressing inequalities and building a more inclusive society. With approximately 81% of the global population being non-white, it is evident that the world consists of a rich tapestry of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. As societies continue to become more diverse, it is paramount that individuals, communities, and governments promote equality and inclusivity to shape a better future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Last Boy Scout is a 1991 American action comedy film directed by Tony Scott, starring Bruce Willis, Damon Wayans, Chelsea Field, Noble Willingham, Taylor Negron and Danielle Harris. The film was released in the United States on December 13, 1991. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Last Boy scout only released in the united states.","output":"Based on the information provided, it is not accurate to conclude that \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" was only released in the United States. While the film was indeed released in the United States on December 13, 1991, there is no information to suggest that this was its sole release.  To draw a more comprehensive conclusion, it is essential to consider additional factors and information beyond just the US release date. For instance: 1. International releases: Movies are generally released in other countries over time. It would be helpful to explore the international release dates of The Last Boy Scout to determine if it was only released in the United States or other countries as well. 2. Director and cast background: The director, Tony Scott, was British, making it unlikely that the film would only be released in the United States. Furthermore, the cast members are also widely known, further supporting the notion that the film most likely had a broader release beyond the United States. 3. Distribution company: The film was produced by major film production companies, including Warner Bros., Silver Pictures, and Geffen Pictures. These companies typically organize wide distribution and release for their movies in several countries worldwide to maximize revenue. Therefore, it would be uncommon for a film to be exclusively released in one country. 4. Worldwide Box Office: The Last Boy Scout grossed approximately 59.5 million in the United States and Canada, while its worldwide earnings totaled around 114.5 million. This figure demonstrates that the film was successful not only in the United States but also in other countries, confirming that it saw release beyond the US. 5. Subsequent releases and formats: Films are often made available in various formats and platforms following their theatrical release, such as DVDs, Blu-Rays, streaming services, or television broadcast. It is likely that The Last Boy Scout was also released in such formats, further expanding its accessibility for audiences worldwide. In conclusion, based on the factors mentioned above, it would be incorrect to conclude that The Last Boy Scout was only released in the United States. Although the film did release in the United States on December 13, 1991, multiple factors indicate that the film likely received a broader release at various times and platforms, catering to a global audience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: There is only one soccer field in the area, and people love to play there. Where might the soccer field be? Possible A: country, park, town, countryside, near  Why is \\"town\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Town\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because of the following reasons and justifications: 1. Availability and accessibility: A town typically has various amenities available for its residents, including recreational facilities like a soccer field. It is reasonable to assume that a soccer field might be located in a town since towns are designed to cater to the needs of their citizens. 2. Community gathering: A town often serves as a gathering place for the community. Sports fields, including soccer fields, may be located in towns to provide residents with a common space to gather, socialize, and participate in recreational activities. 3. Population density: Towns typically have a higher population density compared to rural areas such as the countryside. This means that there are more people concentrated in a smaller area, leading to an increased demand for recreational facilities like a soccer field. 4. Maintenance and management: A town usually has a local government or administration responsible for ensuring public spaces, including sports facilities, are well maintained and managed. This makes it more likely for a soccer field to be located in a town, as it would receive proper care and supervision. 5. Comparing the other options:    a. Country and countryside: These two options are similar and refer to rural areas. While it's possible for a soccer field to be located in a country/countryside setting, it is less common due to lower population density and fewer amenities.    b. Park: A park is a possible location for a soccer field, but it is not as comprehensive an answer as \\"town,\\" since a park can commonly be found within a town or an urban setting.    c. Near: The term \\"near\\" doesn't provide enough context or specificity to be a stand-alone answer.

Magnets are able to place a force on certain materials. This force is called a magnetic force. The force a magnet exerts is a little different from the forces you may normally think about. You exert a force on a book when you lift it. You also exert a force on the pedals of your bicycle. In both those cases, those forces cause a change. The change you see in both these cases is called motion. Magnets, too, can produce change. They can produce motion just like you do.

Thats how the maglev train works. Do you know another type of force that does not require objects to touch? These forces are known as non-contact forces. Another type of non-contact force you may be familiar with is gravity. Gravity too can cause changes in motion. Gravity holds our moon in orbit without touching it.

The UK government had estimated that Atos and Capita would earn £512m for Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) assessments between 2013 and 2017. But analysis by the Press Association suggests they will actually get £700m. Labour said the deals were \\"rewarding failure\\", but the government said effective assessments were vital. PIPs are payments for people aged between 16 and 64 who have ill health or a disability, and since 2013 have been gradually replacing the Disability Living Allowance. Money is allocated according to a points system and a person's eligibility is kept under regular review. Atos and Capita assess PIPs in England, Scotland and Wales, with tests devolved in Northern Ireland. Payments averaged £19m a month in the past two years, according to monthly spending data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). If kept at current levels, this could land the DWP with a total bill of more than £700m. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb, made a U-turn on plans to cut PIPs payments when in office in 2016, said officials had underestimated the number of claimants and therefore the cost of the contracts. \\"I think that is probably a fair criticism that could be levelled at the DWP,\\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \\"It hasn't been very good at getting its forecasts right.\\" He added that there had been \\"operational problems\\" with the way the contracts were carried out. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams said: \\"It is beyond belief that this Tory government is rewarding failure. \\"The PIP process is in disarray and these private companies are receiving huge payouts in a time of extreme austerity. It is clear that these costs are spiralling out of control.\\" A DWP spokeswoman said the department worked to ensure disability payments offered \\"best value\\" for taxpayers. She said: \\"We routinely review our work to make sure that we focus our resources on the most viable options and deliver the most effective support for the most vulnerable in society.\\" Capita said it had been selected to carry out the tests via a \\"rigorous procurement process\\". \\"We are paid according to the number of quality controlled assessments we complete for DWP,\\" a spokeswoman said.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: When you're playing a new opponent, whether it's at a competition or during a friendly game at a family outing, you should assess your opponent's game even while you're warming up. You should look for a few main things: if your opponent is more of an aggressive or defensive player, if his forehand or backhand is his dominant shot, and any weaknesses, such as slow footwork or weak drop shot returns, that you can exploit. Don't hit all of your shots to the same location of the court of your opponent will be able to predict your next move every time. Instead, mix things up by hitting a drop shot followed by a shot to the baseline, or by moving your opponent from the right to the left side of the court. Moving from the front to the back of the court is particularly tricky unless your opponent has very nimble feet. Many players are weaker on the backhand side, so try shooting toward your opponent's backhand and see if this makes your opponent return less shots. If so, continue to exploit your opponent's backhand. Your backhand is the left side for right-handed players and the right side for left-handed players. When you're up at the net, simply hit the shuttle short, just barely over to your opponent's side. This will make your opponent run and will catch him off guard. This is a great technique if your opponent is positioned near the back line. If your opponent knows that you are going to do a short shot, you need to flick the shuttle over the opponent or to another side and if you didn't do this, your opponent will fly the shuttle near the back line. If your opponent hits the shuttle straight at you, hit the shuttle in a different direction instead of hitting it right back at your opponent, where he will expect it to go. This will work especially well if the shuttle has generated a lot of momentum. If you're quick on your feet, you can change the direction of the shuttle and not give your opponent enough time to react to a fast-moving shuttle. If you have mastered the drop shot, then use it to make your opponent run all the way to the front of the court. Then return the next shot all the way to the back of the court. Not only will this force your opponent to be quick on his feet, but it will also catch him off guard. This is also a great way to tire your opponent. To do a drop shot, hit the shuttle lightly so it just crosses the net. If you like staying near the net, serve short, hit drop shots, and do whatever you can to make sure that your opponent can't hit the shuttle to the back line. If you're more comfortable at the back line, then serve long and hit speedy long shots so your opponent doesn't have a chance to move you toward the net. Make the opponent lose all control as you play your style of game and maximize your strengths.","output":"The article provides strategies for assessing an opponent's badminton game, exploiting weaknesses, and utilizing various shots and court positions to gain an advantage, ultimately enabling players to control the match and maximize their strengths."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\",  answer the following question.

(CNN) -- \\"The Walking Dead\\" left us hanging with its midseason finale last year, so we knew to expect surprises when the AMC show returned Sunday. And oh, were there surprises. We talked with Danai Gurira -- aka Michonne -- ahead of Sunday's premiere, and she said to watch for a different tone during the remainder of season four as the focus shifted to the journey of individual characters. She conveniently left out that her character's backstory would be explored in a dream sequence, a scene that easily became one of Sunday's highlights. There was much-needed insight into Michonne, including an apparent explanation on why she became so emotional when holding baby Judith -- she had had a son before (not to mention a lover). He was angry with his father,","output":"who had seemingly given up on their survival in the apocalyptic world. The tension between Michonne's lover, Mike, and his father had been building for some time, creating a rift in their already strained relationship. This all came to a head in Sunday's episode, where the truth of their family's past was finally laid bare for viewers to see. In the dream sequence, we learn that Michonne was once a loving and devoted mother, fiercely protective of her young son, Andre. However, the unforgiving circumstances of the zombie apocalypse had begun to take its toll on the family. Mike had become resentful towards his father, who appeared to have lost hope and purpose, seemingly abandoning the fight for survival. This led to heated arguments and further rifts within their small family unit. The hauntingly vivid dream sequence transported Michonne back to a time when life was simpler, yet tinged with despair. As she relives these heart-wrenching memories, we witness the downward spiral that ultimately led her to become the hardened survivor we've come to know and respect. The culmination of this flashback was a chilling scene depicting the heart-wrenching moment Michonne lost everything: her son, her lover, and her sense of normalcy. This revelation, compounded by her inability to save everyone, only cements Michonne's deep-rooted guilt and sorrow for the life and family she once had. But even with these tragic memories, the episode also showed how Michonne's past fortified her resolve to stay alive and help the people she has come to care about in the present. As the story progressed, viewers witnessed Michonne's determination and compassion grow, allowing her to form meaningful bonds with those around her, particularly Rick and Carl. In the end, the dream sequence succeeded in deepening Michonne's character development, making her an even more compelling and relatable character to the audience. The insight into her past was crucial in understanding her actions and motivations throughout the series, and emphasized the strength of her character in overcoming the trauma of losing everything that mattered to her. Moving forward, fans of \\"The Walking Dead\\" are likely to see a more emotionally open Michonne, as she continues to grapple with both her past and the relentless battle for survival. While the scars of her history may never truly heal, the opportunity to explore Michonne's backstory added fascinating depth and complexity to an already beloved character. This new layer of understanding will undeniably serve as a key element in shaping her role in the latter half of the season. In conclusion, Sunday's premiere of \\"The Walking Dead\\" exceeded expectations by delivering a plot that was both suspenseful and deeply moving. By examining Michonne's past through a poignant dream sequence, the show captivated viewers while providing essential insight into her character. It is this ability to surprise and engage its audience that has enabled \\"The Walking Dead\\" to remain a prominent force in the world of television drama."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Oscar-winning actress Joan Fontaine died Sunday, her longtime friend Noel Beutel said Monday. She was 96. Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.  Question: \\"How old was Joan Fontaine when she moved to Saratoga?\\" Response: \\"Three\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. Joan Fontaine moved to Saratoga, California, with her mother in 1919, when she was three years old (born in 1916)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted all 11 of its major languages official status), which was seen by them as \\"a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation.\\" Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as the sole official language of Namibia though only about 3% of the population speaks it as a home language. Its implementation is focused on the civil service, education and the broadcasting system. Some other languages have received semi-official recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools. It is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools, and \\"English language\\" is a compulsory subject.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are three audience levels you need to concern yourself with here:  The interviewer: Usually, a specific journalist will be assigned to your interview. Make sure you know who will be conducting the interview and read his or her past pieces to find out what that interviewer's slant or focus generally is. The media outlet: The tone of an interview usually varies depending on the medium used to deliver it. A blog is one of the most casual, followed by phone interviews, newspaper interviews, and radio interviews. Professional journal interviews and broadcast television interviews tend to be the most formal. The primary audience: The company the reporter works for will have a specific audience. A local news or radio station will ask questions that will concern local viewers, while a national station will ask questions that pertain to a wider audience. A specialized source, like a blog or journal, will focus on issues that affect their readership. If the interview is scheduled in advance, gather all possible information about it as you set up the time and date. Find out what material the interviewer plans on asking about as well as the expected length of the interview. Depending on the content of the interview, the journalist may even be willing to provide you with a list of questions he or she plans to ask. The list may not be comprehensive, but it could at least give you a place to start. If there is information you cannot disclose about a given topic, make sure the reporter knows this ahead of time. He or she may still try to ask about it anyway, but if you firmly explain that you will not answer those questions before the interview, the reporter is less likely to push you for an answer. Since press interviews can be about nearly any topic, it is impossible to generalize about the questions you will be asked during the interview. If the reporter does not provide you with a list in advance, prepare yourself by noting the most important aspects of whatever the subject matter is. Anticipate what others might be curious about and prepare your answers based on that. Conducting a mock interview is often a good way to calm your anxieties about the real interview.  Set aside time in advance for a test run. Ask a trusted associate to practice interviewing with you. Have the associate ask questions you have been informed about or ones that you anticipate and deliver your answers as though you were conducting the actual interview. You can wear anything you want during a phone or email interview, of course, but if you are meeting with the reporter in person, you should wear clean clothes that are suited to your position. This is true regardless of whether you will appear in photographs or video. Summary:","output":"The article discusses how to prepare for interviews with different audience levels, including understanding the interviewer, the media outlet, and its primary audience, and provides advice on gathering information, potential questions, setting boundaries, preparing answers, conducting mock interviews, and dressing appropriately for in-person interviews."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which year was there a break in the monsoon regime?  Hint: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] The answer is:","output":"2019 was the year when there was a break in the monsoon regime. The subtropical ridge, which influences monsoon conditions, was weaker in 2019 compared to 2018. This caused the subtropical ridge to remain farther south than normal, leading to a drier atmosphere across the Desert Southwest and a break in the monsoon regime. In contrast, 2018 experienced a very wet year in the Four Corners area due to the stronger subtropical ridge that extended monsoon moisture and thunderstorms further north."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The shadow chancellor said he always asked for a written record, even if it was just for £10 to cut a hedge, because it was the \\"right thing to do\\". Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said this was \\"absurd\\" and showed Labour did not understand business. He added he did not think anyone in the country would do such a thing. On Sunday Mr Balls told BBC Radio 5's Pienaar's Politics that people should ask for a record of paying somebody, even if it was for small jobs like cutting a hedge, because they have a \\"legal obligation\\" to pay tax. But Mr Duncan Smith told BBC Breakfast Mr Balls's comments demonstrated \\"Labour's complete lack of understanding of how business works and how people get by\\". Analysis, by personal finance correspondent Ian Pollock Cash payments are not dirty. In case you had gained the opposite impression, paying a self-employed person in cash for doing a job around your house or garden is completely legal. Furthermore there is no legal obligation on you to keep a record of the payment, or to account for it to anyone at all. It is your money and you can do what you like with it. All UK tax obligations lie with the self-employed person you are paying. As a matter of fact, a tradesman is not obliged to even offer you a receipt. But they should keep proper records so they can pay the right income tax and pay VAT too, if applicable. Of course, everyone knows that some tradesmen prefer cash because it is hard to trace. That makes it easier for them to dodge their own tax obligations, if they so choose. But so long as you have not colluded with them, there is no onus on you to do anything about it. You aren't even obliged to grass them up, though HMRC would like you to do so. He added: \\"Here we have a man that would be the chancellor who is wandering around saying Big Brother is going to watch you carefully, that if you do any cash transactions and don't keep receipts, somehow they are going to punish you. I find that absurd.\\" And Mr Balls's colleague, shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, also said he did not think most people would keep a receipt for such things. He told BBC Breakfast: \\"I don't think everybody will keep a receipt..I don't necessarily keep a receipt for everything I pay for though it's a good idea to keep a record.\\" The shadow chancellor's comments were made as Labour and the Tories continue to row over alleged tax dodging in light of the HSBC tax scandal. Pressed on the issue Mr Balls said: \\"It's not your job to pay their taxes for them and I think most people you give a tenner to are not going to be VAT-registered. \\"They've got the legal obligation to make sure they pay their taxes if it's that kind of transaction - but I think the sensible thing for anybody is that you've got a record of it and you've done it properly.\\" Mr Balls had been \\"extremely careful\\" about observing such rules ever since entering politics, he explained. Backbench Conservative MP Peter Bone, appearing on the same programme on Sunday, accused him of implying that all small businesses were trying to dodge taxes. \\"There are so many cash businesses,\\" Mr Bone said. \\"If you go into a cafe for a cup of tea you would not expect a receipt for it. If you were running a fish and chip shop you do not always give receipts. \\"It shows a complete lack of understanding of business. Is he trying to imply that if you are a small business that deals in cash, you are trying to dodge tax? \\"I think it shows how completely out of touch he is with small business. There is an implication that everybody is out to fiddle their taxes. It is just wrong.\\" In recent weeks, Mr Balls has been asked to answer accusations that the Labour Party is anti-business, but has insisted it has a track record of supporting an \\"open, dynamic, wealth-creating, entrepreneurial economy\\". What is a summary of this text?","output":"The shadow chancellor said it's important to ask for a written record for small payments, like paying someone to cut a hedge, because it's the \\"right thing to do.\\" The Work and Pensions Secretary thinks this idea is \\"absurd\\" and shows that the Labour party does not understand business.

In fact sharks come in all shapes, sizes and even colors! Follow me please; I'd like to show you a very special small shark commonly known as horn sharks, only found in the coastal waters of north-west North America. Look at this shark, and you can easily see the horns on it and you will know the reason why it is called the horn shark is that it has the broad, flattened head and two large horn-like spines  found behind its eyes and makes it one of the hardiest of all shark species. What makes it unique is that as its enemy attempts to swallow it, the spines on its back will stick into the enemy's mouth and give a good chance for it to get away. The horn shark is brown in color with black spots all over its body. The adults can reach up to a length of 4 feet and weigh up to 10 kg. An interesting fact about the horn shark is that it has five gills . The horn shark is a clumsy swimmer using its flexible pectoral fins to push itself along the bottom of the ocean. The maximum distance that has ever been recorded for a horn shark to have traveled out from its habitat is 10 miles. Today, as so little is known about its population off the Californian coast, they have been listed as being \\"Data Deficient\\" in the World Conservation Union. The horn shark is being threatened both by water pollution and commercial fishing in the area. Though they are not among those sea creatures hunted primarily for food, but they often get caught as a by-catch in fishing expeditions.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2001, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is released from prison after serving eight years for insider trading and securities fraud. Seven years later, Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good?, warning about the coming economic downturn. His estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf), a top proprietary trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jacob is a protÃ©gÃ© of managing director Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), and is trying to raise money for a fusion research project which would create massive amounts of clean energy for the world. Jake is also financially assisting his mother (Susan Sarandon), who has begun a new career selling real estate. When the recession of 2008 hits, Keller Zabel's stock loses more than 50% of its value. Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James (Josh Brolin), head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz, which Louis Zabel had refused to bail out eight years earlier. Zabel kills himself by jumping in front of a subway train because he cannot handle the stress and embarrassment of losing his company. A distraught Jacob proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts, then attends a lecture given by Gordon Gekko and introduces himself afterward. Gekko tells him that Keller Zabel's collapse started when rumors of the company having toxic debt started to spread. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton's career to seek revenge for Zabel's suicide. Jake, aided by Gekko, learns that Bretton James profited from the Keller Zabel collapse. In revenge, Jake spreads rumors about the nationalization of an Equatorial Guinea oil field... Answer:","output":"What event triggers the downfall of Keller Zabel Investments, and how do Jacob Moore and Gordon Gekko plan to seek revenge against Bretton James for his involvement in the company's collapse?"},{"instruction":"It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Question: Question: \\"How do affirmative action programs disincentivize poor white people to work harder?\\"  Context: \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Affirmative action programs, initially designed to remediate past discrimination and promote diversity, sometimes lead to unintended consequences that can disincentivize poor white people to work harder. Terry Eastland and Thomas Sowell have identified multiple reasons that contribute to this disincentive, which are explained below: 1. Misallocation of resources: Sowell argues that affirmative action policies tend to primarily benefit the most fortunate among the preferred groups, such as upper and middle-class minorities. This misallocation of resources means that poor white individuals, who may be equally or more deserving of support, do not receive the same opportunities, leading them to feel that their efforts are futile. 2. Incentive reduction for the non-preferred groups: Affirmative action programs can create a perception among non-preferred groups, such as poor white or Asian individuals, that their hard work and achievements may not be rewarded fairly due to preferential treatment for other groups. This perception may decrease their motivation to perform at their best because they may feel disadvantaged in the competition for resources and opportunities. 3. Encouragement of self-identification with preferred groups: Sowell also notes that affirmative action policies can motivate individuals from non-preferred groups to identify themselves as members of preferred groups, in order to take advantage of the benefits associated with them. This can undermine the original intent of the programs, as resources may not reach those genuinely in need of support. 4. Creation of animosity: Affirmative action programs can unintentionally cause resentment and animosity among non-preferred groups, who may perceive themselves as being unfairly treated. This can further disincentivize them from working hard, as they may feel that the system is inherently biased against them. 5. Stigma and self-doubt in minorities: Eastland points out that affirmative action can generate a sense of entitlement or self-doubt in minorities, as they may question whether their achievements are genuinely based on merit or are instead a result of preferential treatment. This can lead to less motivation and drive in these groups to work hard and excel. In summary, while affirmative action programs aim to redress past discrimination and promote diversity, they can sometimes lead to unintended negative consequences that disincentivize poor white people and other non-preferred groups from working harder. Factors such as the misallocation of resources, reduced incentives, self-identification issues, creation of animosity, and stigma in minorities contribute to this disincentive, ultimately resulting in potential losses for both individuals and society as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher.

Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan.

Felipe Massa is just like you at playtime, always trying his best to win, zooming his Ferrari around the track as fast as he can.

Well, in racing, like in the game, everyone wants to be the first one, and Felipe Massa was the first one this time, in the final practice. But although Kimi Raikkonen didn't get to the finish line first in this practice run, remember how you don't always win in the games you play either, and that's okay, because there's always next time - and that's exactly what Kimi Raikkonen is thinking too. Even if they didn't win this time, Kimi and his Lotus car are ready to give it another try at the real race.

At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him, with little success.During the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant stationed in Cairo, notable for his insolence and knowledge. Over the objections of General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) for drinking from a well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and leave. Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. While strongly fortified against a naval assault, the town is lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Two teenage orphans, Daud (John Dimech) and Farraj (Michel Ray), attach themselves to Lawrence as his servants.They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. Gasim (I. S. Johar) succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. The rest make it to an oasis, but Lawrence turns back for the lost man. Sherif Ali, won over, burns Lawrence's British uniform and gives him Arab robes to wear.Lawrence persuades Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn), the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's plan is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of...

Feel so pressured to \\" be nice \\" when he called me that I would n't have the heart to tell him \\" No , really . I rejected you . Answer the following question: Why is he feeling the way he 's feeling ?","output":"There could be a multitude of reasons as to why he is feeling the way he is, including personal insecurities, fear of rejection, or misperceptions. However, it's crucial to understand that any analysis is speculative, and the feelings and thoughts of an individual may vary greatly depending on their unique experiences and personal circumstances. Here, we will explore some possible factors that contribute to his feelings and behavior. 1. Fear of Rejection: Fear of rejection is a common human emotion, and he might be feeling this way as he does not wish to experience the vulnerability that comes with being rejected. This fear can accentuate the desire for approval, making the person go to great lengths in an attempt to gain acceptance from the other person. 2. Personal Insecurities: Personal insecurities can play a significant role in the way someone reacts to situations in which rejection is involved. He may be feeling insecure about himself (e.g., his looks, achievements, or social status), which could make him overly sensitive to rejection, ultimately affecting how he processes and reacts to your response. 3. Misinterpretation: There could be some level of misinterpretation or misunderstanding on his part about your rejection. He might have thought that you were uncertain or just trying to be polite, so he took it upon himself to actively pursue you further, hoping that he could change your mind. 4. Social Expectations: Societal norms and expectations might be influencing his behavior. He might have been conditioned to believe that he should make more attempts or be more persistent when pursuing someone, thinking that persistence would be rewarded in the end. 5. Emotional Connection: If he has a strong emotional connection or attachment to you, he might find it challenging to accept your rejection, perhaps believing that deep down, you share the same feelings for him, thus making it harder for him to move on. 6. Difficulty in Accepting Rejection: Some individuals may find it difficult to accept rejection, particularly if they have not faced much rejection in their life, causing them to cling onto hope that the situation might change or they can win the other person over. 7. Overconfidence: If he has experienced considerable success in the past when pursuing potential partners, his overconfidence might lead him to think that you will eventually change your mind or that your rejection was not genuine. Overconfidence in his abilities may make him push forward despite the initial rejection. In conclusion, there could be various factors driving his feelings and actions in this situation. It is important to remember that each individual, their feelings, and motivations, are unique, and therefore, any analysis is inherently speculative. To gain a better understanding of his emotions, communication and open dialogue may play a vital role in clarifying his feelings and thought processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strong happened to the large animals; they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived; the large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans. That the seas are being over-fished has been known for years and researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) inanes fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then. Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative  . One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today's vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around noise. Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current among marine...

Thieves got away with 18 mainly Jade Chinese pieces worth about £15m in a raid at Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum in 2012. Several people were jailed but the items have never been located. A further 14 men have been convicted for roles in that and other raids. Roger Keverne, who helped value the £15m jade said if it had been taken to China, \\"that's possibly goodbye\\". On 13 April 2012, thieves broke in through the rear of the museum, smashed display cabinets and made off with artefacts described as being of \\"incalculable cultural significance\\". Five months later three men were jailed and a boy of 16 was given a detention order. More on this and other stories from Cambridgeshire The stolen items, believed to be worth up to £15m, could be worth tens of millions more on the \\"booming\\" Chinese auction market, police said. Despite appeals by the museum and police, and a \\"substantial\\" reward, the jade appears to have been spirited away. Mr Keverne, a London-based dealer who specialises in Chinese ceramics and works of art, was contacted by the Fitzwilliam Museum following the theft. The Fitzwilliam raiders were \\"very fortunate... that they were able to breach the security,\\" he said. Security would \\"always be a problem\\" for museums as \\"the works of art and the treasures they hold have to be to a certain extent accessible to the public\\". Asked whether the Fitzwilliam Museum was likely to get its stolen artefacts back, he said: \\"It looks like they may not. \\"These things do have a habit of turning up eventually - well, they get put back to the market, things get recycled, they get passed on. \\"They move up the chain until they're probably in the hands of someone who doesn't realise they have been stolen.\\" On Monday, 14 men were convicted over their roles in stealing artefacts from the Fitzwilliam and other museums and an auction house. On the open market the haul could be worth up to £57m, investigators said. One of them, Donald Chi Chong Wong, 56, of London, was described in court as a \\"fence\\" who made frequent trips to Hong Kong. A number of these took place around the time of the Fitzwilliam heist and by the summer of 2012 Wong was under police surveillance, having met several times with other members of the gang. It is not known whether he managed to transport any of the museum's artefacts overseas, but Mr Keverne said: \\"If they've gone to mainland China - that's possibly goodbye.\\" The Fitzwilliam Museum declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. The 14 convicted men from Cambridgeshire, Essex, Kent, London, the West Midlands and Northern Ireland will be sentenced on 4 and 5 April.","output":"In 2012, thieves stole 18 mostly jade Chinese artifacts worth around £15m from the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, and though several people have been jailed in connection to the theft, the priceless items remain missing, potentially lost forever if they were smuggled to China."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale, Woody rescues him, only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector, who takes him to his apartment. Buzz Lightyear and all of Andy's toys identify the thief from a commercial as Al McWhiggin, the owner of a toy store called Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex all set out to rescue Woody. At Al's apartment, Woody learns that he is a valuable collectable based on a 1950s[7] TV show called Woody's Roundup and is set to be sold to a toy museum in Tokyo, Japan. While the toys from the showâJessie, Woody's horse Bullseye, and Stinky Peteâare excited about going, Woody intents to return home since he is still one of Andy's toys. Jessie is upset because the museum is only interested in the collection if Woody is in it, meaning they will return to storage if he is absent from the collection. When his arm is torn off completely, Woody attempts to retrieve it and escape but is foiled by someone mysteriously turning on Al's television set.

Ministers discussed how to strengthen EU foreign policy in times of economic crisis. At the informal ministerial meeting held at the prestigious Bella Centre in Copenhagen, significant discussions took place revolving around the pressing issue of strengthening European Union (EU) foreign policy during a time of economic crisis. The meeting occurred over a span of two days, Friday and Saturday, and saw the participation of several ministers. The common consensus was that the European Union needed to focus on enhancing cooperation and collaboration across the member states to improve its overall foreign policy while simultaneously addressing the economic challenges. In light of this, several key strategies were highlighted during this meeting that could potentially lead to successful outcomes in the face of the crisis. One of the primary areas of concern was improving communication and fostering transparency across member states, with an emphasis on understanding the unique challenges faced by each country. By doing this, the EU can work together to find common ground and share resources, knowledge, and expertise more effectively. Additionally, the meeting stressed the importance of maintaining strong diplomatic relations with countries outside of the EU to navigate the complexities of the global economic landscape. This approach would include engaging in meaningful dialogue, fostering trade agreements, and participating in international forums to maintain the influence and strength of the European Union globally. Another critical aspect discussed was the need for the EU to prioritize investment in research and development, particularly in fields such as renewable energy, digital technology, infrastructure, and healthcare. The ministers agreed that creating a solid foundation in these industries would enhance the region's competitive edge in the global market while also promoting job growth and economic development. The ministers in attendance also addressed the necessity of monitoring and controlling the potential risks associated with financial institutions and ensuring that appropriate regulations are in place to mitigate negative economic impacts. They proposed that the EU should strengthen supervision and enforcement mechanisms to maintain stability in the financial markets and avoid future economic downturns. Lastly, the meeting underlined the vital role of collaboration in addressing regional and global challenges, such as climate change, migration, and security threats. The ministers collectively agreed that working together in a unified manner would ultimately lead to the fortification of the EU's foreign policy and better positioning in the face of economic crises. In conclusion, the informal ministerial meeting at Bella Centre in Copenhagen offered insights and practical solutions to bolster the European Union's foreign policy during these economically challenging times. By focusing on enhanced collaboration across member states, maintaining strong diplomatic relations with countries outside the EU, investing in research and development, regulating financial institutions, and addressing global challenges collectively, the EU can emerge from the crisis in a stronger and more resilient position."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, we can analyze the relationship between them and evaluate whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. Let's break down both the premise and the hypothesis and assess them in context. Premise:  According to the premise, an employer makes the drug testing schedule clear to the employees at the time of their hiring process. The employees are informed that the test will happen the next day and that they will continue to be tested every three months while working for the organization. Essentially, the premise suggests that drug testing is conducted on a predetermined and consistent schedule, rather than random testing, with employees being fully aware of it. Hypothesis:  The hypothesis states that if drug testing is not random and is conducted according to a clear schedule, it can be deemed completely fair. Now, let us examine and relate the premise and hypothesis. Given the premise, we know that the employees are informed about the drug testing schedule from the beginning. By doing so, the employer maintains transparency and allows employees to anticipate the drug tests, which may encourage them to comply with regulations and avoid substance abuse. The hypothesis assumes that non-random drug testing that follows a consistent and transparent schedule might be considered fair, as employees are aware of the process and understand the expectations placed upon them. In conclusion, based on the premise provided, we can infer that the hypothesis is likely to be true. If the premise holds where drug testing is conducted according to a predefined schedule and employees are made aware of it, then it stands that such a system could be perceived as fair.

However, there are slight differences in nuance between the two sentences: 1. Sentence 1: \\"Box Hill Senior Secondary College has no feeders - schools, new students are selected from all over Melbourne, but only welcomed after the interview.\\" This sentence emphasizes the selection of students first, and then the process through which they are welcomed into the College. The focus here is more on how the student body is formed by selecting students from all over Melbourne, without a specific feeder school system. The welcoming process is mentioned last, suggesting that the interview is an important procedure before students are officially part of the college community. 2. Sentence 2: \\"Box Hill Senior Secondary College has no feeders - schools, new students are welcomed from all over Melbourne, but are only selected after the interview.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the welcoming nature of the College first, and then the selection process that takes place after the interview.

In conclusion, both sentences essentially communicate the same idea: Box Hill Senior Secondary College has a unique admission process that does not rely on feeder schools, admits students from all over Melbourne, and requires an interview. The difference lies mainly in the order of emphasis and the description of the selection process. Despite these minor nuances, the main takeaway from both sentences is that the College's admission process is independent of a feeder school system and involves a comprehensive interview for students from all over Melbourne."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

G.\\" Wells (21 September 1866  13 August 1946) was an English writer. He was prolific in many genres, including the novel, history, politics, social commentary, and textbooks and rules for war games. Wells is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is called a \\"father of science fiction\\", along with Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback. His most notable science fiction works include \\"The Time Machine\\" (1895), \\"The Island of Doctor Moreau\\" (1896), \\"The Invisible Man\\" (1897), and \\"The War of the Worlds\\" (1898). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times.  - Robert Anson Heinlein (July 7, 1907  May 8, 1988) was an American science-fiction writer. Often called the \\"dean of science fiction writers\\", he was and continues to be an influential and controversial author of the genre.  - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England.   - Mary Elizabeth Parker (b. Schenectady, New York) is an American poet. She is best known for her collection, \\"The Sex Girl\\" (Urthona Press), which won the Urthona Poetry Prize in 1999. Her poetry has been widely anthologized in such journals as \\"Gettysburg Review\\", \\"New Letters\\", \\"Arts & Letters\\", \\"Greensboro Review\\", \\"Madison Review\\" and \\"Confrontation\\".

It was founded in 1996 by literature professor and poet Mary Elizabeth Parker with the financial backing of Michael Dana. The competition is currently based in Greensboro, North Carolina. The judges for the competition include Scottish novelist Margot Livesey.  - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.  - Greensboro (formerly Greensborough) is a city in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is the third-largest city by population in North Carolina and the county seat and largest city in Guilford County and the surrounding Piedmont Triad metropolitan region. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 269,666, and in 2015 the estimated population was 285,342. Three major interstate highways (Interstate 85, Interstate 40 and Interstate 73) in the Piedmont region of central North Carolina were built to intersect at this city.  - Margot Livesey (born 1953) is a Scottish born writer. She is the author of eight novels, numerous short stories, and essays on the craft of writing fiction.  - Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, often with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.  - Leon Eugene Stover (April 9, 1929  November 25, 2006) was an anthropologist, a Sinologist, and a science fiction fan, who wrote both fiction and nonfiction. He was a scholar of the works of H. G. Wells and Robert A. Heinlein and a frequent collaborator with Harry Harrison.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Henrietta Maria of France (25 November 1609  10 September 1669) was queen consort of England, Scotland, and Ireland as the wife of King Charles I. She was mother of his two immediate successors, Charles II and James II.  - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor.  - Ruben Toledo (born 1961, Havana, Cuba) is a Cuban-American artist based in New York City.  - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\"  - Charles I (19 November 1600  30 January 1649) was monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649.  - Laren Stover ( b. Maryland ) is an American writer .

Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia.

Article: Scores on a national test released on November 1 show that students in the U.S.A. have improved in math over the last two years, but mostly stayed the same in reading. This year, 422,000 fourth graders and 343,000 eighth graders took the exams between January and March. Students were asked to read grade-appropriate  materials and answer questions for the reading test. For the math test, students answered questions about geometry, algebra, number properties, measurement and other topics. The U.S Department of Education released the scores in a report called The Nation's Report Card (NAEP). This year, students earned the highest scores ever recorded on the math exam, which has been given since 1990.Fourth graders scored an average of 241.That is a one-point increase from 2009and a 28-point increase from 1990. Eighth graders made similar progress. Then average score this year was 284,up one point from 2009 and 21 points from 1990. In reading, fourth graders scored an average of 221 points, the same average score since 2007.That score is four points above those from 1992, when the first reading test was given. Eighth graders scored an average of 265 points, up one point from 2009 and five points from 1992. Education experts say reading is a harder subject to improve in the classroom than math. While math is largely learned in classrooms, reading results depend on how much kids read outside of school and how much they read in other subjects, such as history and science. On the NAEP, math scores were the highest among students who have limited use of calculators  during math lessons, compared with students who have unlimited use or no use. Reading scores were the highest among students who said they read for fun on their own time almost every day.

It goes beyond the mundane storytelling and transcends into a realm of captivating visuals, awe-inspiring performances, and a unique narrative that is sure to leave the audience with profound emotions and reflections on life. The film, directed by the visionary filmmaker Alex Sondheim, is a testament to the creative potential of cinema as an art form, refusing to conform to the status quo and daring to challenge the limits of storytelling through the lens of human experience. Set against the backdrop of a picturesque small village by the ocean, the movie follows the life of its protagonist, Emma, played by the incredibly talented and versatile Isabella Anderson. Emma's journey from a reserved and introverted young woman to a strong-willed and passionate leader that brings a transformative change to her village, her family, and her own life, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. The nuanced portrayal of Emma's character by Isabella reflects the struggles and triumphs of an individual who has the courage to overcome societal barriers and dream big. The film’s supporting cast is equally remarkable, bringing an array of interesting characters to life. From the enigmatic and endearing paternal figure of George, played by veteran actor John Simmons, to the dynamic and daring character of Luna, played by the radiant newcomer Michelle Lee, the ensemble display commitment and dedication, which elevates the whole production. Visually, The Radiant Sunrise is a treat for the eyes – every frame being a testament to Sondheim's mastery over the craft. The stunning camerawork by the esteemed director of photography, Laura Crane, captures the true essence of the village, its people, and its authentic lifestyle, making the audience feel an instant connection with the film’s characters and setting. The picturesque landscapes are blended seamlessly with the narrative to create an atmosphere that draws you deeper into the story. The music score composed by the prodigious talent, Oscar Trevino, transforms the emotions on screen into an auditory experience that is truly moving. From the tranquil tunes that accompany Emma's introspective moments to the powerful orchestral pieces that propel the narrative forward during critical junctures, the score elevates the impact of the film on a whole new level. However, the true genius of The Radiant Sunrise lies in its storytelling. Sondheim's unique ability to weave a narrative that simultaneously explores themes of self-discovery, compassion, love, and human resilience sends a powerful and uplifting message to all who watch it. The dialogue is thought-provoking, the character arcs are compelling, and the emotions portrayed are genuine and evocative. In conclusion, The Radiant Sunrise is a cinematic gem that stands out in today's world of formulaic storytelling. It artfully showcases the power of cinema as a medium to explore the depths of human experiences and stirs the soul with its breathtaking visuals, phenomenal performances, and a powerful narrative. This film is a testament to Sondheim's genius and a reminder that cinema can and should be innovative, thought-provoking, and undeniably beautiful."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Katie Bowman claims she is being harrased by police after splitting from her PC boyfriend. A forensic science graduate says her life was made a misery after she was allegedly harassed by police following a split from her PC boyfriend. Katie Bowman, who has never been convicted of a crime, claims police interest in her – which saw her stopped 70 times for suspected offences ranging from drink-driving to assault – meant she could ‘barely leave the house’. The 24-year-old alleges she was targeted over 28 months by Thames Valley Police officers from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, after splitting from Alexander Ash. Miss Bowman says that despite never. securing a conviction against her, the force has kept damaging. intelligence reports on her which are stopping her getting a job. She. has won the support of her local MP, Attorney General Dominic Grieve,. who said he was ‘seriously concerned’ by damning comments held on file. about her, which he said bordered on ‘trivial’. Miss. Bowman claims the harassment started in earnest in 2007 when she was 18. and PC Ash, also based in High Wycombe, was disciplined by his force. for making inappropriate contact with her after their split. PC. Ash, who denies ever having been in a relationship with Miss Bowman,. said this disciplinary action instead related to drunken behaviour on a. night out with friends. Papers. obtained by Miss Bowman’s family suggest that more than ten of the 40. intelligence reports on her were filed by a friend and colleague of PC. Ash. Following. court action by her family, Thames Valley Police launched a review last. year and earlier this year and removed 20 of the reports. However,. the Bowmans have vowed to take legal action to clear her name fully. They also hope to bring the officers they claim are involved to justice. and to seek compensation. Miss. Bowman, now engaged and expecting her first child, says she was. breathtested 70 times – 54 in one year from September 2007. Each time. the result was negative. She. was stopped on suspicion of possessing drugs and given a caution for an. alleged assault – later rescinded after a professional standards. investigation. Her car was seized eight times, and she was given. disorder penalty notices. Miss Bowman, 24, alleges she was targeted over 28 months by Thames Valley Police officers from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, after splitting from PC Alexander Ash (file picture) Her. father Brian Bowman, from Hertfordshire, said: ‘Katie could barely. leave the house without being stopped. Her life was made an utter misery. by a gang – but a gang in police uniform.’ Miss. Bowman says that, with the support of Mr Grieve, she has repeatedly. complained to the force. She has successfully challenged the more. serious allegations which would have led to a criminal record. Mr. Grieve has written to Thames Valley Chief Constable Sara Thornton. twice, branding the reports kept on Miss Bowman as ‘entirely lacking in. substance’. He told the Mail: ‘I am very concerned, her allegation is of. a serious nature.’ One. intelligence report alleges a set of blue LED decorative lights placed. pointing into the footwell of her car amounted to unlawfully displaying. emergency blue lights. Despite. never leading to an arrest, the claims showed up in CRB checks and cost. Miss Bowman her job as an ambulance call handler in 2007 and saw her. sacked from another job as a student paramedic three years later. It. also stopped her becoming a special constable in 2011. In. his letter to the chief constable, Mr Grieve said she ‘is a person of. good character... adversely affected by the numerous derogatory comments. made about her by police’. Having met Miss Bowman twice, he found it ‘difficult’ to match up the image of her as ‘the wayward teenager’ portrayed in police reports. He also raised concerns that the possible motive for the police’s conduct is that she was being punished for getting PC Ash in trouble. Last night PC Ash, 31, who married recently, said: ‘I met her on a night out about six years ago and again when she came for an open day for prospective employees who want to join the force.’ The roads policing officer added: ‘I think she was upset because I wouldn’t go out with her and made several allegations about me. I have absolutely no idea why she would say we were an item.’ Thames Valley Police said: ‘The need to retain the intelligence reports relating to Ms Bowman was reviewed in 2012 (following which a number were removed) and in 2013 following further requests made on her behalf. ‘Thames Valley Police will not be commenting on the details of  the reports, but we seek to comply with all aspects of the Data Protection Act and the national standards for the management of police information.’ The force said it had investigated a complaint from Miss Bowman in 2009 that ‘officers from High Wycombe have harassed her by causing her to be stopped, arrested, her vehicle seized and maliciously prosecuted’. It added: ‘The complaint was found to be unsubstantiated and Miss Bowman’s appeal to the IPCC was not upheld.’ Highlights:","output":"1.

Movie title: Alien Trespass Context: The story begins in 1957 in the star-filled skies above California's Mojave Desert. It is a special night for noted astronomer Ted Lewis, who is preparing a special anniversary dinner with steaks for his beautiful, adoring wife Lana while observing the annual meteor shower of the Perseids. In another part of town, Tammy, a waitress at small local diner with big plans for the future, looks out her window and is excited to see a shooting star, which she takes as a good sign for her dreams. Suddenly \\"something shoots overhead and crashes\\" in the nearby mountains. Assuming it is a fallen meteorite, Ted wants to investigate in person. He reaches the supposed meteorite, which turns out to be an alien spaceship. Then his body is usurped by Urp, a well-meaning, tall, and metallic alien. Urp has discovered that the other passenger of his ship, the one-eyed monster known as Ghota has escaped. He needs to retrieve it and uses a human body to blend in with the locals.[2] The Ghota consumes people in order to grow, multiply, and conquer. Its unquenchable appetite could mean the end of life on Earth.[2] Urp is the only one who knows how to stop the hideous extraterrestrial. He enlists the aid of Tammy, the only human in town willing to believe and trust in his mission. The local police - including Chief Dawson and Officer Vern - are confirmed skeptics and offer little help. Together, Urp and Tammy must hunt down the Ghota and neutralize it before it consumes all the local inhabitants and uses the human fuel to multiply and conquer the world. Urp and Tammy eventually fall in love. But at the finale, he is compelled to return to his home in space and she is left longing for his company. While she remains on Earth, she finally leaves the small town to go in search of her own destiny. [3] Answer:","output":"In the movie Alien Trespass, Urp is the only one who knows how to stop the hideous extraterrestrial, Ghota. Urp is a well-meaning, tall, and metallic alien whose body has usurped noted astronomer Ted Lewis. Ghota, a dangerous alien creature with a single eye, has escaped and threatens to consume people in order to grow, multiply, and conquer. If Ghota's appetite is not quenched, the end of life on Earth is imminent. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, Urp enlists the aid of Tammy, a local waitress who believes and trusts in his mission. They face skepticism from the local police, including Chief Dawson and Officer Vern, who offer little assistance. Despite this, Urp and Tammy form a team and embark on their quest to hunt down Ghota and neutralize it. As Urp and Tammy work together, they gradually fall in love. However, their relationship takes a bittersweet turn when, after successfully completing their mission, Urp must return to his home in space, leaving Tammy longing for his company. Inspired by her experiences with Urp, Tammy finally leaves her small town to pursue her own destiny in search of new adventures. In summary, the only one who knows how to stop the hideous extraterrestrial Ghota in the movie Alien Trespass is Urp, the tall and metallic alien. Urp and Tammy, a human he enlists to help him in his mission, collaborate to hunt down Ghota and neutralize the threat it poses to life on Earth. Although the two fall in love, they must ultimately part ways as Urp returns to his home in space and Tammy sets off to follow her dreams."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What war did the Victory Loan campaign make an effort to raise money for by organizing If Day?  By 1911, Winnipeg was the third largest city in Canada, and remained so until overtaken by Vancouver in the 1920s. A boomtown, it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.Government efforts to violently crush the strike, including a Royal Northwest Mounted Police charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death, had led to the arrest of the movement's leaders. In the aftermath, eight leaders went on trial, and most were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy, illegal combinations, and seditious libel; four were aliens who were deported under the Canadian Immigration Act.The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit especially hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The collapse of the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.Canada entered the Second World War in 1939. Winnipeg was one of the major commands for the British... Answer:","output":"The Second World War"},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you are given a sentence.

Premise: save more um you know so i can go to school full time Hypothesis: \\"I intend to splurge more before going to school full-time.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Pick your answer from: i. yes. ii. it is not possible to tell. iii. no. And the answer is:","output":"iii. no. The hypothesis \\"I intend to splurge more before going to school full-time.\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"save more um you know so i can go to school full time.\\" In fact, these two statements contradict each other. The premise suggests that the individual wants to save more money in order to afford going to school full-time. This indicates a clear focus on financial responsibility and prioritizing education. Saving more money would likely involve cutting unnecessary expenses, spending more wisely, and setting aside a portion of one's income specifically for educational purposes. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the individual wants to splurge more, which means spending more on nonessential items or experiences. This directly contradicts the goal of saving money and would make it harder for the person to achieve their goal of attending school full-time. To save more money to attend school full-time, one might consider the following strategies: 1. Create a budget: List all sources of income and expenses. Calculate the difference between the two and determine how much money can be saved each month. 2. Prioritize expenses: Determine which expenses are essential, such as rent, utilities, and food, and which can be reduced, such as dining out, entertainment, and nonessential purchases. 3. Set savings goals: Define specific, achievable goals for saving money, and create a timeline for reaching them. 4. Open a dedicated savings account: Keep the money intended for school separate from other funds to avoid spending it on nonessential items. 5. Explore additional sources of income: Consider part-time jobs, freelancing, or online gigs to increase earnings and boost savings. 6. Create a plan for unexpected expenses: Establish an emergency fund to cover unforeseen costs, such as medical bills or car repairs, without jeopardizing the funds saved for school. 7. Seek financial assistance: Research scholarships, grants, and financial aid opportunities to help cover the cost of attending school full-time. By implementing these strategies, an individual will be more likely to achieve their goal of saving enough money to attend school full-time, rather than splurging and jeopardizing their educational goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes four years ago, the Colorado teenager says TSA screeners forced her to go through a full-body scanner in Salt Lake City last week, breaking her 10,000 insulin pump in the process.      According to Sandra Barry, Savannah’s mother, her daughter was coming home from a school trip when screeners required to her to go through a full-body scanner despite the fact that the girl had a doctor’s note describing her condition and stating that she should be given a pat-down rather than subjected to screening machines.      “Believe me, being 16 and female, she probably doesn’t want the pat-down but she knows that this is what’s required,” Sandra Barry told msnbc.com. “She tried to advocate for herself and they just shut her down.”      Upon hearing of the situation, the elder Barry called Animas, the maker of Savannah’s pump, and was told that they couldn’t guarantee that the screening machine hadn’t damaged the pump and that her daughter should take the pump off as soon as she landed.      “It was hard to pick her up and tell her she had to disconnect immediately,” said Barry, who says the family has filed a formal complaint with TSA but has only received an e-mailed response requesting a conference call to discuss the incident.      For Barry, the issue goes beyond the specific incident involving her daughter. “It’s bigger than diabetes — there are other people with other medical conditions that need to opt for the pat-down,” she said. “That’s why we’re questioning the education and training of these agents.      “It’s not a one-time thing and we’re going to keep putting the pressure on them.”      In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, TSA said \\"the passenger has reached out ... regarding her screening experience and TSA has attempted to contact her in response.\\"      More stories you might like:      Rob Lovitt is a longtime travel writer who still believes the journey is as important as the destination.

Savannah claimed she was coerced into going through a full-body scanner despite having a letter from her physician explaining her special medical needs for air travel. The letter advised against exposing her insulin pump to the screening technology, recommending a hand inspection or hand wand scan instead. Upon forcing her to go through the scanner, TSA agents also subjected her to a full-body pat-down due to the fruit juice she carried to control her blood sugar levels. Savannah expressed her frustration and humiliation at the incident, pointing out that she had actually requested the pat-down in the first place to avoid damaging her insulin pump. Immediately after the screening, Savannah felt something was wrong. Her mother, Sandra Barry, contacted Animas, the insulin pump manufacturer, who advised her to remove the pump as soon as she landed as they couldn't guarantee that the TSA's scanner hadn't damaged the software. This incident forced Savannah to switch to insulin shots temporarily. The manufacturer, Animas, further affirmed that their insulin pumps should not go through x-ray or full-body scanner technology as it can damage the software and impact insulin delivery. They recommend the device to be inspected either manually or with a hand wand. In response to this incident, and similar past occurrences, Savannah and her family called for better training and education for TSA agents regarding special medical needs and devices, such as insulin pumps for diabetics. Although the TSA stated that they work regularly with advocacy groups to understand passengers' needs and have signage at security checkpoints advising passengers with medical devices that full-body scanning is optional, similar incidents keep happening, indicating a gap in field training. Katharine Gordon, a staff attorney for the American Diabetes Association, echoed these sentiments, stating that these were not isolated incidents and better training for TSA agents is required. Savannah was eventually given a new insulin pump by Animas, but she insists the goal is to obtain improved and uniform regulations for TSA agents regarding passengers with medical needs. Despite TSA's policy that passengers have the right to fly with their insulin and opt for a pat-down, this incident, among others, raised significant concerns about the treatment of passengers with medical conditions and the consistency of TSA's screening procedures in this context. It also highlighted the potential risks associated with exposing certain medical devices to airport security technology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: where did the english first open their factories in eastern india?","output":"The English first opened their factories in Eastern India during the early 17th century, specifically in the regions of present-day West Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. These areas were initially selected by the British due to their strategic location and the prospects for trade and commerce, which would eventually give rise to their economic dominance in the region. To better understand their decision, it is essential to analyze the historical progress of English establishments in Eastern India. 1. Hugli (Haldia) Factory: The first English factory was established in Hugli (now Haldia) on the banks of the river Hooghly in 1651, under permission from the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. This factory was set up as a base for British merchants to conduct trade with the local population. The primary aim of setting up these factories was to gain access to valuable resources like textiles, spices, indigo, and saltpeter, which were in high demand in Europe. 2. The Masulipatnam Factories: In 1611, before the Hugli Factory, the East India Company had established a factory in Masulipatnam, located on the southeastern coast of India (present-day Andhra Pradesh). However, this venture was not directly linked to Eastern India, as it served more like a foothold on the Indian southeastern coast. 3. Patna Factory: In 1620, The British East India Company obtained permission from the Mughal emperor Jahangir to establish a factory in Patna, Bihar. The primary purpose of setting up this factory was to facilitate the trading of indigo and raw silk. However, this factory was subsequently shut down due to unfavorable conditions and lack of resources. 4. The Pipili and Balasore Factories: The English East India Company established factories in Pipili (Orissa) and Balasore (then known as Barshalor, later Odisha) around 1633 to have a stronghold in the strategically important Ganges-Delta region. The factory in Balasore prospered largely due to its prime position on the Bay of Bengal and became one of the centers for exporting salt, textiles, and minerals. 5. Formation of Madras (Chennai) Presidency: In the late 17th century, the English East India Company shifted its focus from Eastern India to Southern India, leading to the formation of the Madras Presidency in 1640. This newly formed region encompassed the entire eastern coast of India, and its factories and businesses operated under its jurisdiction. However, Eastern Indian factories would remain significant for trade with the newly formed Madras Presidency as well as other European nations. As these historical developments suggest, Eastern India played a pivotal role in the expansion of the English East India Company's presence in the Indian subcontinent. The establishment of the Hugli factory marked the beginning of British involvement in Eastern India, which would later serve as the starting point for the colonization and exploitation of India in the following centuries. The British presence in Eastern India laid the groundwork for future imperialistic endeavors, ultimately resulting in the establishment of British rule over the Indian subcontinent."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the context of the given statement, the question seems to be focusing on the perspective of property owners. Step 2: List possible reasons There can be several reasons why a person might need to know the cost of their property. These reasons may include: 1. Selling the property: If a person is planning to sell their property, they will need to know its current market value to set a competitive price and ensure they get a fair return on their investment. 2. Refinancing a mortgage: Property owners might want to refinance their mortgage to get a lower interest rate or better loan terms. Knowing the current value of their property is essential in this process as it helps determine the loan-to-value ratio, which plays a significant role in refinancing approval and terms. 3. Home equity loans or lines of credit: A property owner may want to take out a home equity loan or line of credit to finance major expenses like home renovations, college tuition, or debt consolidation. In this instance, knowing the property's value is essential because it determines the amount they can borrow. 4. Property tax assessment: Local governments assess property taxes based on the current value of the property. Understanding the cost of their property can help owners anticipate potential changes in their property tax bills and possibly appeal assessments they believe are inaccurate. 5. Insurance coverage: Knowing the value of a property, especially after significant improvements or market changes, helps ensure that the homeowner has adequate insurance coverage in case of damage or disaster. 6. Estate planning and wealth management: Accurate knowledge of a property's value is crucial for individuals and families when planning for the future, such as calculating net worth and making long-term financial decisions. Step 3: Provide the answer There are several reasons why someone might need to know the cost of their property, including selling the property, refinancing a mortgage, applying for home equity loans or lines of credit, adjusting property tax assessments, ensuring adequate insurance coverage, and estate planning or wealth management."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then it evolves into something really compelling, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that I agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. As I said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, \\"Ice Age\\" is commendable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt.

There can be instances with no named entities, then return 'None'. Problem:Duitsland : Telekom ( Ullrich ) . Solution:","output":"This task is asking you to identify any named entities in a sentence presented in Dutch. A named entity is a noun that can be categorized as a person's name (PER), the name of an organization (ORG), a location (LOC), or a miscellaneous name (MISC). The acronyms B and I are used to indicate whether a word is the first item in a phrase (B) or not the first word (I). The sentence presented here is: \\"Duitsland : Telekom ( Ullrich ) .\\" The instructions ask to distinguish the parts of the sentence according to the entity they represent. Here's the implementation of these guidelines: - Duitsland: is the name of a country, thus a location. Hence, it falls under the LOC category. - Telekom: is the name of a company, therefore it's categorized as an organization – ORG category. - Ullrich: is a person's name, so it's categorized as person – PER category. So, the solution for this task would be: B-LOC for Duitsland  B-ORG for Telekom B-PER for Ullrich Remember, if there were no named entities in the sentence, you would simply respond with 'None'."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Isolate the variable g To isolate g, we need to eliminate the constant term (20) from the right side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides: 0 - 20 = 5g + 20 - 20 -20 = 5g Step 3: Solve for g Now, to get g by itself, you need to divide both sides of the equation by 5: -20 / 5 = 5g / 5 -4 = g So the solution to the equation 0 = 6g - g + 20 for g is g = -4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the off-season, Souray became an unrestricted free agent and, on July 12, 2007, he signed a five-year, 27 million contract with the Edmonton Oilers, his favourite team growing up. However, his debut season with the Oilers was not the dream he imagined, as injuries limited him to only 26 games played. Already recovering from a shoulder injury when he entered training camp, Souray played through it, but reinjured the shoulder just six games into the season in a fight, and missed the next 55 games. But in 2008-09 NHL season, he bounced back from the injury-shortened campaign to record 23 goals and 53 points and once again become an 57th National Hockey League All-Star Game. He finished third in the hardest shot competition that year, clocking in at 102.3 mph, behind Shea Weber (103.4) of the Nashville Predators, and winner Zdeno Chára (105.4) of the Boston Bruins. But during the Oilers own 2009 Skills Competition, on January 4, Souray set the then-unofficial NHL record for the hardest shot. Clocked at 106.7 mph, his slapshot beat Chad Kilgers old unofficial record of 106.6 mph set at the Toronto Maple Leafs 2006 Skills Competition. The record was deemed unofficial, however, as the League does not recognize individual team Skills Competitions and instead goes by the National Hockey League All-Star Games Skills Competition results. Sourays unofficial shot was not surpassed until January 28, 2012, by Chára, whose 108.8 mph slapshot in the Skills Competition preceding the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game beat Sourays blast and set the official record. Souray also earned a humorous nickname during his strong 2008-09 season, when during the third period of a 5-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on December 3, 2008, the Stars broadcast team referred to Souray as the \\"Studly Wonderbomb\\" as a recognition of his slapshots prowess.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Q: In 1906, Saxton (Christopher Lee), a renowned British anthropologist, is returning to Europe by the Trans-Siberian Express from China to Moscow. With him is a crate containing the frozen remains of a primitive humanoid creature that he discovered in a cave in Manchuria. He hopes it is a missing link in human evolution. Doctor Wells (Peter Cushing), Saxton's friendly rival and Royal Society colleague, is also on board but travelling separately. Before the train departs Shanghai, a thief is found dead on the platform. His eyes are completely white without irises or pupils, and a bystander initially mistakes him for a blind man. A monk named Father Pujardov (Alberto de Mendoza), the spiritual advisor to the Polish Count Marion Petrovski (George Rigaud) and Countess Irina Petrovski (Silvia Tortosa), who are also waiting to board the train, proclaims the contents of the crate to be evil. Saxton furiously dismisses this as superstition. Saxton's eagerness to keep his scientific find secret arouses the suspicion of Wells, who bribes a porter to investigate the crate. The porter is killed by the ape-like creature (Juan Olaguivel) within, which then escapes the crate by picking the lock.The creature finds more victims as it roams the moving train, each victim being found with the same opaque, white eyes. An autopsy suggests that the brains of the victims are being drained of memories and knowledge. When the creature is gunned down by police Inspector Mirov (Julio PeÃ±a), the threat seems to have been vanquished. Saxton and Wells discover that images are retained in a liquid found inside the eyeball of the corpse, which reveal a prehistoric Earth and a view of the planet seen from space. They deduce that the real threat is somehow a formless extraterrestrial that inhabited the body of the creature and now resides within the inspector. Father Pujardov, sensing the greater presence inside the inspector and believing it to be that of Satan, renounces his faith to pledge allegiance to the mysterious entity.News of the murders is wired to the Russian authorities. An intimidating Cossack officer, Captain Kazan (Telly Savalas), boards the train with a handful of his men. Kazan believes the train is transporting rebels; he is only convinced of the alien's existence when Saxton switches off the lights and Mirov's eyes glow, revealing him to be the creature's host. The creature has absorbed the memories of Wells' assistant, an engineer, and others. It seeks the Polish count's metallurgical knowledge too, in order to build a vessel to escape Earth. Kazan fatally shoots Mirov, and the alien transfers itself to the deranged Pujardov.The passengers flee to the freight car while Pujardov murders Kazan, his men, and the count, draining all of their minds. Saxton rescues the countess and holds Pujardov at gunpoint. Saxton, having discovered that bright light prevents the entity from draining minds or transferring to another body, forces Pujardov into a brightly lit area. The creature/Pujardov explains that it is a collective form of energy from another galaxy. Trapped on Earth in the distant past after being left behind in an accident, it survived for millions of years in the bodies of protozoa, fish and other animals, but cannot live outside a living being longer than a few moments. The creature begs to be spared, tempting Saxton with its advanced knowledge of technology and cures for diseases. While Saxton is distracted by the offer, the creature resurrects the count's corpse, which attacks Saxton.Saxton and the countess flee the creature, but it now resurrects all of its victims as zombies. Battling their way through the train, Saxton and the countess eventually reach the caboose, where the other survivors have taken refuge. Once there, Saxton and Wells work desperately to uncouple themselves from the rest of the train. The Russian government sends a telegram to a dispatch station ahead, instructing them to destroy the train by sending it down a dead-end spur. Speculating that it must be war, the station staff switch the points.The creature takes control of the train as it enters the spur. Saxton and Wells manage to separate the last car from the rest of the train. The creature tries to find the brakes to try and stop the train, but fails to even get it to slow down as it rams through the barrier and plunges down the cliff, destroying it as soon as it hits the bottom. The caboose rolls precariously to the end of the track before stopping, inches away from the edge of the cliff. The survivors quickly depart from the caboose while Saxton, Wells and the countess gaze over the ravine to witness the inferno consuming the train and its unearthly inhabitants. The final scene shows the image of the earth., Question: Who does Saxton and the countess find on the train? A:","output":"Saxton and the countess find the ape-like creature, Father Pujardov, and all the victims resurrected as zombies on the train."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Caterpillars can hibernate outside in their containers all winter, or you can put it into the refrigerator. Don’t freeze your caterpillar. Your caterpillar will not eat while it’s hibernating, but it may be lightly active on warmer days. When it’s mildly active, it might eat available food. When your caterpillar wakes up in the spring, it’ll be ready to fatten up in preparation for its metamorphosis into a moth, which will take place later in the spring. Make sure that you provide your caterpillar enough food for it to get ready to turn into a pupa, which is its cocoon-phase. Your caterpillar’s fuzzy skin will slide off once it has fattened up, leaving a smooth black oval called a pupa. This is it’s cocoon phase. You can expect it to shed its exoskeleton during spring. Since you can’t pinpoint the actual date of your moth’s emergence, keep track of its progress each day. While your pupa does not need food, you may want to mist the caterpillar’s home daily to keep it humid. Simply spray a light spritz of water into the container. While their actual time in the pupa can vary, giant leopard moth caterpillars only take a few weeks to metamorphose into a moth. You can choose to keep your moth or set it free.

Fact: chemical splashing can cause harm to the eyes Question: Which would damage the eyes the most in a laboratory setting without protection? What's the answer?","output":"To determine the answer, we will consider a few factors related to laboratory chemicals that could potentially cause the most damage to the eyes. These factors include the chemical’s corrosiveness, concentration, and reactivity. Additionally, we will take into account the likelihood of each chemical splashing and coming into contact with the eyes. Step 1: Identify common laboratory chemicals that can cause harm to eyes. Some common laboratory chemicals that can cause harm to the eyes are acids (e.g. sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid), bases (e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia), solvents (e.g. acetone, methanol, ethanol), oxidizers (e.g. hydrogen peroxide, chromic acid), and reactive chemicals (e.g. phenol, formaldehyde). Step 2: Consider the corrosiveness of the chemicals. Corrosive chemicals like strong acids and bases can cause severe eye damage upon contact. Out of these, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and sodium hydroxide are known to be particularly corrosive and can cause serious harm to the eyes. Step 3: Consider the concentration of the chemicals. Higher concentrations of these corrosive chemicals can cause more severe damage. For example, concentrated sulfuric acid (95-98%) can cause deep and extensive burns, while more dilute concentrations would still cause burns but potentially less severe. Step 4: Consider the reactivity of the chemicals. Some chemicals are more volatile or prone to splashing than others, increasing the likelihood of coming into contact with the eyes. For example, nitric acid can be prone to splashing and cause severe eye damage. Step 5: Evaluate which chemical is most damaging considering all factors. Considering all the factors mentioned above, the most eye-damaging chemical in a laboratory setting without protection would likely be concentrated sulfuric acid. It is highly corrosive, often used at high concentrations, and can cause deep and extensive burns upon contact with the eyes. Always ensure proper protective measures, including safety goggles and face shields, are used to minimize the risk of eye injury while handling chemicals in a laboratory setting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Protect your skin from getting a base tan. Understand tanning beds aren't safer. Keep sun lamps out of your home. Protect yourself when you go outside. Article:","output":"Title: Protect Your Skin: Debunking Tanning Myths and Ensuring Safety Outdoors Introduction: As the warmer months approach, many people look forward to spending time outdoors, soaking up the sun, and achieving that perfect tan. However, the desire for sun-kissed skin may come with unintended consequences, such as increased risk to skin damage and various health risks. In this article, we will dispel some common tanning myths, examine the dangers associated with tanning beds and sun lamps, and offer suggestions for protecting your skin when venturing outside. 1. The myth of the base tan: One popular belief is that obtaining a \\"base tan\\" before sun exposure can protect your skin from burning. This is simply not true. A base tan, in reality, offers minimal sun protection equivalent to an SPF of about 3, which falls far short of the recommended SPF 30 or greater. Furthermore, tanning itself is an indication that your skin has been damaged, as the darkening of the skin is a defense mechanism against further damage from the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Instead of seeking a base tan, opt for a broad-spectrum sunscreen to protect your skin from both UVA and UVB radiation. 2. Tanning beds are not a safe alternative: Some individuals resort to tanning beds, believing that they offer a controlled and safer way to tan. Unfortunately, this is another misconception. Tanning beds are far from safe; they emit UVA and UVB radiation, which can cause skin cancer, premature aging, and other skin damage. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, using indoor tanning devices before the age of 35 can increase the risk of melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, by 59%. To stay safe, avoid tanning beds altogether. 3. Sun lamps should be avoided: Similar to tanning beds, sun lamps are often marketed as a safe way to achieve a tan in the comfort of your own home. However, sun lamps also emit harmful UV radiation. In addition to increasing the risk of skin cancer, they can also contribute to eye damage if protective eyewear is not used. It is important to recognize that there are no safe shortcuts to achieving a golden tan, and introducing sun lamps into your home is a dangerous decision. 4. Tips for outdoor protection: When spending time outdoors, it is crucial to take steps to protect your skin. Consider these safety tips: - Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all exposed skin areas. Reapply every two hours or after swimming or excessive sweating. - Wear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts, wide-brimmed hats, and sunglasses with UV protection. - Seek shade, especially during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), when the sun's rays are strongest. - Be mindful of the UV index, as higher numbers signal a greater risk of skin damage. Check your local weather forecast for this information. Conclusion: Achieving a tan may seem like a harmless pursuit, but the risks associated with unprotected sun exposure and indoor tanning devices should not be taken lightly. By understanding and debunking common tanning myths, saying no to tanning beds and sun lamps, and practicing safe sun protection methods, you can help protect your skin and reduce the risk of skin cancer and other skin damage. Enjoy the outdoors wisely and prioritize your skin health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The Utraquist creed, frequently varying in its details, continued to be that of the established church of Bohemia until all non-Catholic religious services were prohibited shortly after the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620. The Taborite party never recovered from its defeat at Lipany, and after the town of Tábor had been captured by George of Poděbrady in 1452, Utraquist religious worship was established there. The Bohemian Brethren , whose intellectual originator was Petr Chelčický but whose actual founders were Brother Gregory, a nephew of Archbishop Rokycany, and Michael, curate of Žamberk, to a certain extent continued the Taborite traditions, and in the 15th and 16th centuries included most of the strongest opponents of Rome in Bohemia. J. A. Komenský , a member of the Brethren, claimed for the members of his church that they were the genuine inheritors of the doctrines of Hus. After the beginning of the German Reformation, many Utraquists adopted to a large extent the doctrines of Martin Luther and of John Calvin and, in 1567, obtained the repeal of the Compacts which no longer seemed sufficiently far-reaching. From the end of the 16th century the inheritors of the Hussite tradition in Bohemia were included in the more general name of \\"Protestants\\" borne by the adherents of the Reformation. At the end of the Hussite Wars in 1431, the lands of Bohemia had been totally ravaged. The  adjacent Bishopric of Würzburg in Germany was left in such bad shape after the Hussite Wars, that the impoverishment of the people was still evident in 1476. The poor conditions contributed directly to the peasant conspiracy that broke out that same year in Würzburg. What war happened first, Battle of White Mountain or Hussite Wars?","output":"The Hussite Wars happened first. They took place from 1419 to 1434 in response to the execution of Jan Hus, a religious reformer, and featured conflicts between the Hussite factions and the Catholic Church, supported by various European monarchs. The Battle of the White Mountain, on the other hand, occurred on November 8, 1620, during the early stages of the Thirty Years' War. This battle saw Catholic forces, mainly the Spanish and the Holy Roman Empire, defeat the Bohemian Protestants and solidify the Habsburg rule in Bohemia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Josh Bidwell pinned the Broncos at their own 4-yard line. On the first play of the drive, however, Cutler connected with Tony Scheffler for 33 yards, and dug themselves out of the hole. The resulting good field possession allowed Denver to punt, and pin Tampa Bay at their own 11. Brian Griese threw an incompletion, and suffered an injured shoulder on the play. Jeff Garcia took over at quarterback. With a short field, Denver drove 47 yards on only five plays, and took the lead again with a 10-yard touchdown pass by Cutler.

Paragraph: Halting just outside the village, Harry formed his men with a front across the whole road, and directed the lines to advance, twenty yards apart. Then, placing himself at their head, he gave the word, and charged down the street upon the Roundheads. The latter, occupied by their attack upon the houses, were unconscious of the presence of their foe until he was close upon them, and were taken utterly by surprise. The force of the charge was irresistible, and the Roundheads, dispersed and on foot, were cut down in all directions. Groups of twos and threes stood together and attempted resistance, but the main body thought only of regaining their horses. In three minutes after the Royalists entered the village the surviving Roundheads were in full flight, hotly pursued by the victorious Cavaliers. These, being for the most part better mounted, overtook and slew many of the Roundheads, and not more than half the force which had set out returned to their quarters at Didcot. The pursuit continued to within half a mile of that place, and then Harry, knowing that there was a force of Roundhead infantry there, drew off from the pursuit, and returned to Chalcombe.

Swami Vivekananda (Bengali: [Sami bibekanondo] ( listen); 12 January 1863 - 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [norendronath doto]), was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna.  He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. Vivekananda propagated that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Nevertheless, following Ramakrishna, and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta, Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita \\"reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism\\". Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation:  Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy--by one, or more, or all of these--and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details.  Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda's thought. He believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development. He wanted \\"to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest\\".  Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddha (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya (celibacy), believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence. He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, \\"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced\\". Was he a teacher","output":"Yes, indeed Swami Vivekananda was a profound teacher, philosopher, and spiritual leader. He was not a teacher in the typical sense of conducting classes in schools or colleges, but rather, he was a teacher of life, spirituality, and philosophy. His teachings have transcended the four walls of a classroom and have touched the lives of millions all across the globe.  Swami Vivekananda espoused a philosophy that synthesized both Eastern and Western thought. His comprehension of both cultures and his intelligence enabled him to express Hindu philosophies to American and European audiences while also bringing Western philosophy to India. One of his many contributions includes making yoga and the philosophy of Vedanta accessible to Western minds. His intellectual prowess made him an effective and highly influential teacher not just in religious seminars or gatherings, but also in educational institutions including universities and colleges where he was invited as a revered guest speaker. Swami Vivekananda's teachings were centered around developing the human potential. He believed in the innate divinity of the soul and emphasized the importance of self-realization or the pursuit of attaining an understanding of one's true nature. He encouraged individuals to transcend limitations by focusing on the greater self. Moreover, he propagated teachings on nationalism, believing in the power of the people to shape a nation's destiny. He played a pivotal role in instilling feelings of pride and nationalism amongst his fellow Indians during the colonial era. His speeches and writings on India's cultural and spiritual heritage inspired countless Indians to actively participate in the freedom struggle. Swami Vivekananda was also the founder of the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission, organizations that have played significant roles in the educational, social, and spiritual lives of people, both in India and abroad. These institutions continue to disseminate his teachings and principles, a testament to his status as a significant global spiritual teacher. Lastly, his belief in the power of ideas and focused thought, as evident in his famous lecture on Raja Yoga, has served as a guiding principle for many in their personal and professional lives, reinforcing his role as a teacher not just on spiritual matters but also on principles of success and purpose. Therefore, it's accurate to affirm that Swami Vivekananda was a teacher, who imparted wisdom, inspired action, and enriched lives with his deep understanding and interpretation of life and spirituality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Patrick John Neshek (born September 4, 1980) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Minnesota Twins, San Diego Padres, Oakland Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, and Colorado Rockies. The Twins selected him in the sixth round of the 2002 MLB draft from Butler University. Neshek made his MLB debut for the Twins on July 7, 2006, and played for them until 2010, except 2009, which he missed due to Tommy John surgery. The Oakland Athletics traded for Neshek on August 3, 2012, for cash considerations, and immediately called him up from Triple-A Norfolk. To make room for Neshek on the roster along with same-day call-up right-handed pitcher Dan Straily, the A's optioned relievers Jim Miller and Evan Scribner to Triple-A Sacramento River Cats.  On September 22, Neshek gave up the game-tying home run in the bottom of the 13th inning to New York Yankees slugger Raul Ibanez. The A's had scored four runs in the top of the inning, leading to a galling 10-9 loss the next inning. However, the A's defeated the Yankees the next day and went 9-2 to end the season, edging the Texas Rangers out of the American League West championship by one game, including sweeping the final three-game series in Oakland. In 24 games with the A's, Neshek tallied  19 2/3 IP, yielding 10 hits and six walks, with 16 SO and a 1.37 ERA. He relied heavily on the slider, throwing it 83.5 percent of all pitches.  On November 30, 2012, Neshek avoided arbitration by agreeing to a one-year deal with the A's. He started the season well, posted a 2.34 ERA in his first 38 appearances into August, with 30 of them being scoreless. However, he gave up three runs apiece in two different appearances. Neshek attributed his early success to throwing almost exclusively sliders to right-handed hitters. Of all his pitches, he threw the slider 73 percent of the time in 2013.  The A's designated Neshek for assignment on August 26. For the season, he finished with a 3.35 ERA in  40 1/3 IP. He elected free agency November 5. Through the end of 2013, Neshek had faced 555 right-handed batters in his MLB career, holding them to a .181 batting average, .257 OBP and .315 SLG. In 326 PA, opposite-handed hitters, had more success with a .237 AVG, .328 OBP and .432 SLG.

The Minnesota Twins team picked him from his college team at Butler University in 2002, and he started playing in the Major League Baseball in 2006. But he couldn't play for a year in 2009 because he needed surgery on his elbow, they sometimes call it Tommy John surgery. In 2012, a different team, the Oakland Athletics, traded some money for him and he started playing with them. They moved some other players to make space for him. Once, in an important game against the New York Yankees, he made a mistake and the Yankees were able to tie the game, and the Athletics ended up losing that game. But they still did really well that season, and ended up winning the championship of the West part of the American League.  In his games with the Athletics, he did really well in throwing the ball, he threw a type of pitch called a slider most of the times.  But even though he did good, the Athletics decided they didn't want him on their team anymore in 2013, so he was free to pick a new team to play for. Throughout his career until then, he did an especially good job of keeping right-handed batters from hitting his pitches well. Left-handed batters had a bit more luck hitting his pitches.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Instead, on England's first visit north of the border since 1999, the \\"Auld Enemy\\" outclassed Scotland to take another step on the road to rehabilitation after the misery of the World Cup in Brazil. England have not tested their recovery from the trauma of South America against any of football's elite, so the manner in which they have bounced back must be judged in that context - but a clean sweep of victories since that final meaningless, goalless group game against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte is still a very impressive statistic. England's 3-1 win in the intimidating surroundings of Celtic Park, and against a Scotland team on an upward curve under manager Gordon Strachan, was arguably their most complete since the World Cup. Manager Roy Hodgson saw his side open with an intensity that is sometimes missing from the opening phases of their games and maintained it throughout. Scotland boss Strachan was fulsome in his praise for England. Media playback is not supported on this device The tale of the tape reads played six and won six since the World Cup - with 15 goals scored and only two conceded - including four Euro 2016 qualifiers against Switzerland, San Marino, Estonia and Slovenia bookended by friendly wins against Norway and now Scotland. England have not conceded a goal in the first half of any of their last seven games and one of those two goals conceded was Jordan Henderson's deft header into his own net against Slovenia. There can be no question England's cause has been helped by a kind Euro 2016 qualifying draw, but the visit on to footballing enemy ground in Glasgow was perhaps a more realistic test of their standing than most of their qualifiers. And judged on that, the comprehensive manner of this win may have told Hodgson more about his players than routine victories in qualifiers. Scotland may have had only two Premier League players in their starting line-up, Hull City's Andrew Robertson and Everton forward Steven Naismith, and played like a team whose main business for this international break had been concluded with the Euro 2016 qualifying win against the Republic of Ireland, but England did not hang around to wait to find out. In a predictably hostile atmosphere they went straight on to the front foot and never allowed Scotland into the game. It was a test of their mettle, their nerve and their stomach for the fight and they came through with pass marks. And it was a win achieved so comfortably against a Scotland team that ensured England arrived in a country with rapidly increasing optimism, especially after the vital 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifier win against the Republic of Ireland on Friday. Hodgson praised the maturity of his players \\"under the magnifying glass\\", saying: \\"I'm not sure they needed to prove they were real men. I knew that. But this was a game played in a real goldfish bowl.\\" Let's not get carried away as England are still strictly second tier when it comes to world football's elite - but it is churlish to offer too much criticism of such a run of wins when the last time they achieved something similar was in June 2006. Since the World Cup, Hodgson has made tweaks to his squad and his team and there were optimistic signs for the future amid the tumult of Celtic Park. Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne was highly impressive again, both in defence and attack. There is an opening for a right-back in England's team and he has walked through it. He has shown enough to warrant a good run in the team. Jack Wilshere was England's best player against Scotland, a commanding display characterised by the raking, driven pass that created the first goal for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - oddly his first assist on his 26th international appearance. The enthusiasm for the use of Wilshere at the base of England's diamond must be tempered by the simple truth that he has not yet faced top-class opposition in that role. This is the acid test, but he dictated affairs here. Oxlade-Chamberlain was another bonus, scoring for the first time since his goal in the 2-2 draw against Brazil in the Maracana in June 2013. Another significant stat to help his case may be that he is something of a lucky charm for Hodgson. England have never lost a game in which he has figured, with a record of played 20, won 14 and drawn six. The debate raged about whether Wayne Rooney could be considered an England \\"great\\" in the build-up to his 100th appearance when he played against Slovenia on Saturday, but what is not a matter for serious discussion is his worth to this team and manager Roy Hodgson. The numbers are out there. The two goals against Scotland edged him ahead of the great Jimmy Greaves and into third place on his own in the all-time standings with 46, two behind Gary Lineker and three behind all-time record holder Sir Bobby Charlton. Of current significance is his record of 18 goals in 28 appearances under Hodgson. He has now scored in six of his last seven England starts, scoring seven goals in total. Here in Scotland he gave a performance of maturity and class, scoring twice and setting the tone for England's display from the first whistle with his intense, committed - but never out of control - approach. And in the days before the game, captain Rooney made it his business to address the young players in England's squad to make them aware of the special, hostile atmosphere they would face. Forewarned is forearmed and here he showed a sure touch with his team-mates. In the current England set-up, he is indispensible. Just a couple on an otherwise highly satisfactory night for England and Hodgson. Why was Everton's Ross Barkley given a walk-on part of a couple of minutes at the end? What was the point? Surely Celtic Park was the ideal place to give this lavishly talented youngster at least 45 minutes to test out his temperament and decision-making. Media playback is not supported on this device And will the return of Stewart Downing to England's colours for the first time since he played in Hodgson's first game in charge in Norway in May 2012 be a \\"blink and you missed it\\" affair? He had an undistinguished 45 minutes, looking nothing like the player who has excelled for West Ham United this season. However, rather than playing in the more central position he occupies under Sam Allardyce for his club, Downing was shunted out to the left in a 4-3-3 formation and consequently looked like the under-achiever of the past. And Liverpool's Rickie Lambert (barely causing a ripple at Anfield this season) on for 11 minutes? Why not give West Bromwich Albion's Saido Berahino a brief taste of what might be expected of him at international level? England resume in March with what should be another routine Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Lithuania but then face a stern test with a friendly in Italy four days later. The diary of fixtures, mainly the remaining qualifiers, merely reads like a smooth passage to France and perhaps even the opportunity for Hodgson to indulge in some experimentation with the possibility of early qualification. Another friendly against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on 7 June will sharpen the reflexes for a visit to Slovenia a week later - but this excellent win in Scotland ensures 2014 will end with England in good spirits.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. look opposite right twice and look right A:","output":"Part #1: Commands and their corresponding actions. Usage:  - look -> I_LOOK - walk -> I_WALK - run -> I_RUN - jump -> I_JUMP - turn left -> I_TURN_LEFT - turn right -> I_TURN_RIGHT Explanation: These are the basic commands and their equivalent actions that the agent can perform. Part #2: Direction words 'left' and 'right'. Usage: look right -> I_LOOK_RIGHT Explanation: The direction words 'left' and 'right' specify the direction of an action. In this case, 'right' indicates that the agent should perform the action (looking) to the right. Part #3: The word 'opposite'. Usage: look opposite right -> I_LOOK_LEFT Explanation: The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. In this case, 'opposite right' means the agent should look opposite from the right, which is to the left. Part #4: The word 'around'. Usage: look around right -> I_TURN_RIGHT_180, I_LOOK Explanation: The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. In this case, 'around right' means the agent should turn around to the right (180 degrees) and then perform the action (looking). Part #5: The word 'and'. Usage: look left and look right -> I_LOOK_LEFT, I_LOOK_RIGHT Explanation: The word 'and' is used to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope. In this case, 'and' connects two separate commands: 'look left' and 'look right'. Part #6: The word 'after'. Usage: look right after look left -> I_LOOK_LEFT, I_LOOK_RIGHT Explanation: The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope. In this case, 'look right' should be executed after 'look left', resulting in the same sequence as in Part #5. Part #7: The words 'twice' and 'thrice' Usage: look right twice -> I_LOOK_RIGHT, I_LOOK_RIGHT Explanation: The word 'twice' triggers repetition of the command that it scopes over two times, and 'thrice' does so three times. In this case, 'look right twice' means to perform the action of looking right two times."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Who is Lord Dattatreya? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"Firstly, let me address each query separately: 1. \\"Who is Lord Shiva?\\"  This question is asking to explain about Lord Shiva who is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is known as the \\"The Destroyer\\" within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity that includes Brahma and Vishnu. His roles are complex and multifaceted; he is the god of destruction and transformation, yet also a symbol of mercy and compassion. He is also associated with yoga and is often depicted as an ascetic practicing meditation and austerity. 2. \\"Who is Lord Dattatreya?\\"  This question asks for information about Lord Dattatreya, who is a deity in Hinduism. He is considered by devotees to be a combined form of the Hindu trinity Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Lord Dattatreya is often depicted with three heads, symbolizing Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva; past, present, and future; and the three states of consciousness: waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. He is regarded as the ultimate Guru, the embodiment of knowledge, and the destroyer of ignorance. Now, analyzing both questions, they ask for information about two distinct figures in Hinduism, Lord Shiva and Lord Dattatreya. Although Lord Dattatreya embodies elements of Lord Shiva, along with Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu, they are portrayed and worshipped differently in Hindu traditions. Given this, I infer that these questions are not the same. The first question exclusively requests information on Lord Shiva, whilst the second is asking about Lord Dattatreya, who, while incorporating aspects of Shiva, is a distinct deity. Therefore, while there are connections between the subjects of these two questions, the questions themselves are asking for different information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Schwarzenegger was a founding celebrity investor in the Planet Hollywood chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe) along with Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Demi Moore.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Yes, the answer correctly states that Planet Hollywood was modeled on the Hard Rock Cafe, another successful theme restaurant chain. The concept of having celebrity investors and memorabilia as a core part of the restaurant's marketing appeal was borrowed from the Hard Rock Cafe's model. Both chains aimed to create a unique and entertaining dining experience for their guests, with a strong emphasis on popular culture and celebrity memorabilia. The Hard Rock Cafe was established in 1971 in London by Isaac Tigrett and Peter Morton. It quickly became popular for its rock 'n' roll-themed decor, lively atmosphere, and extensive collection of music memorabilia. The successful business model led to a rapid expansion of the brand, with numerous locations opening across the globe. Following the Hard Rock Cafe's success, the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain was launched in 1991, with the aim of taking the theme dining concept to new heights by leveraging the star power of well-known celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, and Demi Moore. Planet Hollywood combined movie memorabilia with an upscale dining menu, while hosting special events and appearances by celebrities to entice guests.

The sentence \\"Student studies English for 4 hours a day\\" can be considered technically acceptable by the strictest standards, although it does seem to lack an article before \\"student.\\" However, this depends on the context in which the sentence is being used.

The sentence should look like this: \\"A student studies English for 4 hours a day.\\" Using the indefinite article 'a' highlights that we are talking about any student who might fit this description. The presence of the article results in a sentence that is more representative of standard English grammar. However, it is important to note that linguists recognize and study the many ways in which language is used and understood across different social contexts, cultures, and dialects. Thus, even if a sentence might not adhere entirely to standard English grammar rules, it could still be viewed as acceptable or understandable in a specific context or dialect.

The lady told me that Megan was always a critic about everything unlike Amy, due to  Available choices: 1. Megan being pessimistic.; 2. Amy being pessimistic.;","output":"The lady told me that Megan was always a critic about everything unlike Amy, due to Megan being pessimistic. This particular disposition of Megan, characterized by a consistent tendency to see the worst in every situation and maintain a negative outlook on life, also known as pessimism, sets her apart from Amy. Moreover, it predisposes her to find flaws, issues, or potential problems in virtually any circumstance, making her highly critical of people and things around her.  Pessimism might stem from various factors that could have shaped Megan's worldview and personality. For instance, she might have experienced a string of disappointments, failures, or hardships that led her to develop a sense of disillusionment with the world and the belief that things are unlikely to turn out well. Alternatively, she might have been influenced by the attitudes and beliefs of her family, friends, or cultural environment, which might have contributed to fostering this negative outlook. In contrast, Amy's approach to life is not influenced by pessimistic tendencies, making her less prone to criticize everything she encounters. She might have a more balanced or even optimistic perspective, which allows her to appreciate the positive aspects of people and experiences, rather than focusing exclusively on their shortcomings. This difference in their attitudes could be attributed to a variety of reasons, such as their individual life experiences, personality traits, or the influence of their social circles. The distinction between Megan's pessimistic and critical nature and Amy's more open-minded and less judgmental disposition offers a valuable lesson about the impact of one's mindset on their interactions with others and their overall quality of life. By cultivating a more positive outlook and addressing the factors that contribute to pessimism, individuals like Megan might be able to reduce their critical tendencies, improve their relationships, and increase their sense of happiness and satisfaction. On the other hand, it highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced perspective and embracing openness, tolerance, and understanding, as demonstrated by Amy's more accepting attitude."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To clean a dirty window","output":"To clean a dirty window, one would need to follow these steps: 1. Gather supplies: In order to accomplish this goal, one would need to have some essential cleaning supplies at hand. This typically includes a window cleaner solution (commercial or homemade with a mixture of water, vinegar, and a drop of dish soap), microfiber cloth or newspaper, a squeegee, a bucket, and possibly a ladder or extendable tool for hard-to-reach areas. 2. Prepare the area: Before starting the cleaning process, it's important to prepare the area around the window. Clear any furniture, decorations, or curtains that may obstruct access to the window or could potentially be damaged. Lay down an old sheet or cloth underneath the window to capture any drips. 3. Remove loose dirt and debris: Using a soft brush, dry cloth, or a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment, remove any loose dirt or cobwebs from the window surface and surrounding frame. 4. Apply the window cleaner solution: Pour window cleaner solution into a bucket (if using a microfiber cloth) or spray it directly onto the window glass (if using a squeegee). When using a spray-on cleaner, be careful not to oversaturate the glass since excessive liquid can make it difficult to achieve a streak-free finish. 5. Wipe or scrub the window: Dip the microfiber cloth into the bucket of window cleaner solution and thoroughly scrub the window surface. Alternatively, if using a squeegee, use a sponge or squeegee applicator to spread the solution evenly on the glass. This step is crucial for removing dirt, grime, and fingerprints from the glass. 6. Remove the cleaning solution: If using a microfiber cloth, wipe the window surface with a clean, dry microfiber cloth until the glass is streak-free. Alternatively, if using a squeegee, pull it firmly across the surface of the glass in a horizontal (left-to-right) or vertical (top-to-bottom) motion. After each pass, wipe the squeegee blade with a clean, dry cloth to remove excess liquid. 7. Dry the edges and window frame: Once the glass is clean and streak-free, use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to wipe the edges and frame of the window, removing any remaining cleaning solution. This also helps prevent watermarks and streaks from forming. 8. Clean the other side of the window: If the window is accessible from both sides, follow the same process to clean the exterior side of the glass. This will ensure optimal clarity and an even, streak-free appearance from both inside and outside. 9. Inspect and touch up: Once both sides of the window have been cleaned, inspect the glass for any remaining streaks or spots. If necessary, touch up any problem areas using a bit of window cleaner solution and a clean, dry microfiber cloth. 10. Restore the area: Once the window is clean, return any furniture, decorations, or curtains to their original positions. Dispose of or clean any used cleaning supplies (such as microfiber cloths), and store them for future use.

Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem. It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner, rather than later. After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance. Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that.

I tried to order a long island iced tea, a zombie, and a mojito, the bartenders couldn't make it and I was left with a simple jack n coke. A bit of a disappointment when you are paying 5-7 for a drink... The rest of the night was just crowded and no place to dance. It doesn't have the space to support the volume on a crowded night. I guess that speaks for the crowd it brings in which is a non dancing crowd. A lot of people just stand and occupy the dance floor while they get pissed at the dancers pushing them aside. Smoking is aloud here which adds to some of the 'flavor' however depending on how many people are smoking it can get congested.

Article: There is a saying, \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\\" Although eating properly is important, being kind to others is also good tor your health. Studies show that people who perform kind acts are more relaxed, happier, and healthier than other people. In one study at Arizona State University researchers, found that many volunteers experienced a sudden feeling of joy, followed by a long period of calm, after performing a kind act.  This feeling, called \\"a help's high\\" may actually help reduce stress   as the body releases   naturally painkillers. Stress can cause' serious health problems, and heart depression, and .sleeping problems. However, the study found that volunteers had fewer *stress-related health problems when they did helpful things for other people. The study also found that people who did nice things for others felt better about themselves as well. They had higher self-esteem  , and were' happier. Many believe this is because volunteers spend more of their time with other people. People who are more outgoing are often healthier. Another study at the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center confirmed the health benefits of volunteering.

The studies mentioned in the article from Arizona State University and the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center reaffirm that engaging in kind acts and volunteering has numerous health benefits, such as reducing stress, improving self-esteem, and even increasing longevity.

The word \\"therefore\\" indicates that the term \\"Opson\\" has been previously discussed, and the writer is emphasizing its similarity to \\"Banchan\\" and \\"Okazu.\\" However, the sentence structure could be improved by having the equivalents to Korean and Japanese cuisines mentioned consistently. The revised sentence would be: \\"Opson\\" is therefore equivalent to \\"Banchan\\" in Korean cuisine and \\"Okazu\\" in Japanese cuisine. 2. \\"Opson\\" is therefore equivalent to Banchan in Japanese and Okazu in Korean cuisine. This sentence is similar to the first one, but the placement of \\"Japanese\\" and \\"Korean cuisine\\" is switched, which might cause some ambiguity. The revised sentence should clarify the relationship between the terms and their respective cuisines: \\"Opson\\" is therefore equivalent to \\"Banchan\\" in Korean cuisine and \\"Okazu\\" in Japanese cuisine. Now both sentences convey the same meaning and are structured consistently. To recap, the term \\"Opson\\" is used to describe a concept that is similar to \\"Banchan\\" in Korean cuisine, which consists of various side dishes served alongside rice, and \\"Okazu\\" in Japanese cuisine, where it refers to the dishes accompanying the main course of rice in a traditional meal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d.  Question: \\"What were the Romans' first two settlements?\\" Answer: \\"At Marseilles and Nice\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer to the question is not completely correct. According to the text, the first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Marseilles) around 600 BC, followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. However, the Romans' first two settlements are not explicitly mentioned. They did conquer the Gallic barbarians and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence) in 125 BC. Furthermore, they established the province of Provincia (now Provence) stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées. Some of the towns mentioned in the text, such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, were developed under Roman rule, but it is unclear if they were the first two settlements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Everyone seems intrigued with Wittgenstein; however, Bradley is far more comprehensive and profound. Plus, he writes very good English. Bradley distinguishes subtle naunces in meaning between words and in this way is a precursor to language philosophy. I also recommend C. S. Lewis's book, A Study in Words.I'm amazed that all the books I have on language philosophy exclude F H Bradley. He did everything language philosophers did before they did it. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review is primarily positive. The reviewer acknowledges that they disagree with Bradley's conception of reality but expresses great appreciation for his work. They highlight that Bradley's writing is comprehensive, profound, and well-written. The reviewer also notes that Bradley is a precursor to language philosophers, indicating their respect for his intellectual impact. Additionally, they recommend a related book, C.S. Lewis's \\"A Study in Words,\\" which further supports their interest in the topic. The reviewer's amazement at the exclusion of F.H. Bradley from other books on language philosophy indicates a desire to see his work recognized and appreciated more widely.

Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby (first name generally given as Irv, Irve or Irving; born August 22, 1950) is an American lawyer and former advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney. From 2001 to 2005, Libby held the offices of Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs and Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States and Assistant to the President during the administration of President George W. Bush. In October 2005, Libby resigned from all three government positions after he was indicted on five counts by a federal grand jury concerning the investigation of the leak of the covert identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame Wilson. He was subsequently convicted of four counts (one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements), making him the highest-ranking White House official convicted in a government scandal since John Poindexter, the national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the Iran-Contra affair. On March 6, 2007, the jury convicted him on four of the five counts but acquitted him on count three, the second charge of making false statements when interviewed by federal agents about his conversations with Time reporter Matthew Cooper.  After being questioned by the FBI in the fall of 2003 and testifying before a Federal grand jury on March 5, 2004, and again on March 24, 2004, Libby pleaded not guilty to all five counts. According to the Associated Press, David Addington, Cheney's legal counsel, described a September 2003 meeting with Libby around the time that a criminal investigation began, saying that Libby had told him, \\"'I just want to tell you, I didn't do it'... I didn't ask what the 'it' was.'\\"  Libby retained attorney Ted Wells of the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to represent him. Wells had successfully defended former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy against a 30-count indictment and had also participated in the successful defense of former Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan.  After Judge Reggie Walton denied Libby's motion to dismiss, the press initially reported that Libby would testify at the trial. Libby's criminal trial, United States v. Libby, began on January 16, 2007. A parade of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists testified, including Bob Woodward, Walter Pincus and Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post and Judith Miller and David E. Sanger of The New York Times. Despite earlier press reports and widespread speculation, neither Libby nor Vice President Cheney testified. The jury began deliberations on February 21, 2007.

Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition).

I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft.

I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so impressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on.

During the 1880s Sydney became a prosperous city, commerce and industry flourished, and the suburbs expanded. As more churches were built and fewer people lived in the heart of the city, the congregation of St James' Church shrank. The challenge that it faced was to minister effectively to city workers, rather than dwellers, to serve the poor of the city, and to attract those whose preference was for the style of worship and intellectual, topical preaching that distinguished St James' from many of the newly created parish churches. The young Henry Latimer Jackson, from Cambridge, was appointed in 1885. He introduced weekday services and a magazine called The Kalendar, one of Australia's first parish papers. He also lectured at Sydney University, addressed conferences, spoke at synod and acted as secretary to the newly established Sydney Church of England Boys' Grammar School. However, his sermons were described as \\"not so much opposed, as simply not understood\\". He resigned in 1895 after accepting a position in the Diocese of Ely. Although Sydney was prospering, St James' had an acute shortage of money and \\"the government considered resuming the site for a city railway\\". The trustees at this time leased the parsonage and, in 1894, used the money for urgent restoration to the exterior of the building. The architect Varney Parkes replaced the old spire, using copper that was pre-weathered so that there was no radical change in its appearance. He removed infilling from the north portico and designed a new portico and entrance to the tower to match that of the eastern vestry. The result was to make the north face of the building its most significant aspect.Jackson's successor was William Carr Smith, a man with socialist ideals and a commitment to social reform and spiritual outreach. He preached long and engaging sermons inside the church and for a time in the open air in The Domain as well.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  In 1993, Michael Jackson was accused of sexually molesting 13-year-old Jordan Chandler. Jackson denied the claims and settled the civil case out of court for a payment of 15 million plus legal fees; the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. No criminal charges were filed. In 2005, following further allegations, prompted by the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson in which he was holding hands with a boy named Gavin Arvizo and talked about his sleepovers with children, Jackson was acquitted of child sexual abuse charges.In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old. In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck after seeing an interview with Robson, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten. Both had previously testified in defense of Jackson — Safechuck as a child during the 1993 investigation, Robson both as a child in 1993 and as a young adult in 2005. In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds that it had been filed too late, and in 2017 it was ruled that neither of the corporate entities formerly owned by Jackson could be held accountable for Jackson's alleged actions.In the film, Robson, Safechuck, and their respective families describe their relationship with Jackson. Safechuck and Robson allege that Jackson sexually abused them at his home, Neverland Ranch, and at his other residences across California.Reed described his film as a \\"study of the psychology of child sexual abuse, told through two ordinary families who were groomed for 20 years by a paedophile masquerading as a trusted friend\\".  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who was holding hands with Gavin?

Write highlights for this article: In 2010, the American Board of Internal Medicine suspended or revoked the certification of 139 physicians for giving away or soliciting examination questions for a board review company. CNN subsequently reported on residents preparing for certification examinations using questions reproduced by people who took previous exams. Residents taking the American Board of Radiology medical physics examination wrote down test questions (\\"recalls\\"), and shared them with future examinees. Dermatology residents also reproduced questions (\\"airplane notes\\") minutes after the certification examination. Question reproduction violates copyright policies. However, some physicians CNN interviewed said that recall use is like preparing with a study guide since questions are used to confirm underlying knowledge, not rote memorization of answers. Consistent with this view, only 43% of medical students surveyed at a UK medical school thought it was clearly wrong to convey information about test content to another student examinee. However, such behavior should create concern for the quality and integrity of patient care. Medical students who cheat on examinations are more likely to falsify information in a patient's medical record. Patients want physicians to be certified based on a valid assessment of the knowledge necessary to provide high-quality care. If patients cannot trust the knowledge that board certification is expected to measure, the medical profession loses the public's confidence. Moreover, certification should indicate the ability to care for patients, rather than efficient test preparation. Notably, although patients express a highly favorable view of certification, it is not required by most hospitals and health care plans. The distinction between cheating and guided study is crucial. Old test questions and recent examination experience are routinely used to create study materials. The American College of Physicians produces a summary of concepts and information most likely to appear on the ABIM certification exam. The content of this summary is shaped by post-examination residents. The First Aid series for medical students is updated annually based on examinee reports. Using a focused study guide created based on examinees' input bears some similarity to studying from practice questions that may have been on a recent examination. The difference lies in the detail and specificity of the information conveyed. Nevertheless, from the public's perspective, both practices represent \\"shortcuts\\" for examination success. Drivers of dishonest behavior. Cheating in education and sports creates unfairness between \\"competitors.\\" Unlike performance-enhancing drugs, the use of Ritalin and Valium to improve test performance is not considered cheating. Difficulty concentrating and anxiety are perhaps considered abnormal disadvantages from which examinees deserve sparing. The unfairness perspective is reflected in a dean's observation in the CNN report -- since use of reproduced questions is so pervasive, this norm does not cause any unfair advantage. Unfortunately, 57% of surveyed medical students claimed that others' cheating had unfairly disadvantaged them. The difficult content of the radiology physics exam is one reason for the use of reproduced questions. For most physicians, the exhaustive study of biochemistry and pharmacology is a rite of passage based on knowledge rarely used. In fact, the physicians interviewed by CNN said that the necessity to demonstrate proficiency of arcane material unimportant for practice was a root cause of residents using reproduced questions for exam preparation. In other words: Test content that medical students view as unnecessary for clinical care makes them more likely to cheat. Of course, a desire to succeed underlies the decision to cheat: 40% of 665 medical students across six schools admitted to doing something unethical to avoid a poor evaluation. However, fear of failure is not generally sufficient -- social context is important. Academic dishonesty is strongly connected to peer behavior. Many medical students believe certain forms of cheating can be justified if the motivation is to assist friends. Of 2,459 medical students from 31 schools, 41% had cheated during high school and 59% thought that cheating was too common to eliminate. When misconduct becomes an established norm, as it apparently has among certifying residents, it does not become acceptable, but can be difficult to stop. How to limit unethical behavior. The use of reproduced questions for board examination preparation threatens medicine's integrity and public trust. Moreover, indisputably dishonest behaviors are far too common among trainees. Punishments and honor codes do little to reduce academic dishonesty in medical education. Responses to unethical acts have also been hampered by divergent opinions about the severity of specific violations and appropriate punishments. However, peer behavior has a strong impact on ethical decisions. The image of dermatology residents writing down test questions together in a restaurant suggests this has become an established norm. Trainees find it more acceptable to engage in unethical conduct when their friends are as well. The best way to limit unethical behavior is to embed academic honesty into institutional cultures, perhaps through role models and curricula that emphasize the respect that a virtuous professional may earn. Case-based ethics training may improve moral reasoning, although the impact on conduct is unknown. Examination content must be highly relevant for the patient-care activities that will be endorsed. Esoteric questions suggestive of academic hazing should be eliminated. Not reusing test questions would reduce the incentive to reproduce questions in verbatim form, but might jeopardize the consistency of passing standards, while increasing expenses. In the end, successful certification must demonstrate that physicians are vested with the trust of both their peers and the public. Sponsoring rigorous examinations that cover material critical for patient care will bolster what the profession provides patients. Ultimately, the integrity of the medical profession and the faith that patients place in physicians demand the highest moral standards. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gregory Ruhnke. Highlights:","output":"- In 2010, 139 physicians had their certification suspended or revoked by the American Board of Internal Medicine for sharing or soliciting examination questions. - CNN reported on residents preparing for certification exams using questions reproduced from previous exams, violating copyright policies but some argue it is similar to using study guides. - Cheating on exams may compromise the quality and integrity of patient care, as medical students who cheat are more likely to falsify patient records. - The public's trust in the medical profession may be damaged if they cannot trust the knowledge that board certification represents. - Addressing this issue may involve embedding academic honesty into institutional cultures or creating rigorous exams that cover material crucial for patient care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Developers have said the project would generate enough \\"green\\" energy to meet the needs of 3,200 houses. Campaigners are worried half an acre of the centuries-old Fairy Glen Wood would be destroyed by the build. In a statement, NRW said it wanted more time to look through the details before reaching a conclusion. Snowdonia National Park Authority rejected the project's planning proposals in March. NRW head of planning Richard Ninnes said an extraction permit would only be issued it it was satisfied the plans \\"make it clear that it can operate safely, without harming the environment or local communities\\". He added: \\"The Conwy Valley is a rich environment, home to a diverse variety of wildlife and popular with locals and residents alike. \\"This is one of the largest hydro power applications we have had to deal with and is particularly complex. \\"Among the issues we have had to consider are the impact of the scheme on the river's ecology, its fish and wildlife and on other water users.\\" This article was about:","output":"RWE Innogy is a company that wants to build a hydro power project in Betws y Coed, a beautiful place with lots of nature.

Oficialii români sunt optimişti că ţara va fi în stare să încheie la timp toate pregătirile de aderare la UE, pentru a atinge obiectivul integrării în 2007. Translate to English","output":"Romanian officials are optimistic that the country will be able to complete all the preparations for EU accession on time, in order to achieve the goal of integration in 2007. Romanian officials are expressing optimism about the country's ability to finalize all necessary preparations required for accession to the European Union in a timely manner. They are keen on meeting the target of becoming an integrated member of the EU by the year 2007.  The process of joining the EU involves a series of important steps. These include adopting and implementing the EU's body of legislation, known as the acquis communautaire, as well as demonstrating the necessary administrative capacity to enforce these laws and regulations. In addition to this, prospective member states must ensure that they have stable institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. They must also possess a functioning market economy capable of coping with competitive pressures and market forces within the EU.  Romanian officials are confident that their country can successfully meet all these criteria and complete the required preparations. This confidence is fueled by the significant progress Romania has made since its accession negotiations began. The country has managed to adopt many necessary legal reforms, modernize its infrastructure, and strengthen its economy. Furthermore, Romanian authorities have worked diligently to enhance the capacity of their institutions and administrative bodies in order to effectively enforce EU legislation. It should be noted that the target date of 2007 is significant because it is the same year that Bulgaria, another Eastern European country, successfully joined the EU. Given that Bulgaria and Romania share similar cultural, historical, and political backgrounds, the officials in Romania believe that the country has the potential to achieve integration at the same time as its neighbor. In conclusion, Romanian officials are optimistic about completing all necessary preparations for EU accession before the targeted date of 2007. They believe that the country possesses the required capacity and resources to achieve this goal and successfully become an integrated member of the European Union.

Eugene Louis Vidal was born in the cadet hospital of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, the only child of Eugene Luther Vidal (1895-1969) and Nina S. Gore (1903-1978). Vidal was born at the West Point cadet hospital because his first lieutenant father was the first aeronautics instructor of the military academy. The middle name, Louis, was a mistake on the part of his father, \\"who could not remember, for certain, whether his own name was Eugene Louis or Eugene Luther\\". In the memoir Palimpsest (1995), Vidal said, \\"My birth certificate says 'Eugene Louis Vidal': this was changed to Eugene Luther Vidal Jr.; then Gore was added at my christening [in 1939]; then, at fourteen, I got rid of the first two names.\\" In the multi-volume memoir The Diary of Anais Nin (1931-74), Anais Nin said she had a love affair with Vidal, who denied her claim in his memoir Palimpsest (1995). Vidal also said that he had an intermittent romance with the actress Diana Lynn, and alluded to possibly having fathered a daughter. Yet, regarding Nin, in the online article \\"Gore Vidal's Secret, Unpublished Love Letter to Anais Nin\\" (2013), author Kim Krizan said she found an unpublished love letter from Vidal to Nin, which contradicts his denial of a love affair with Nin. Krizan said she found the love letter while researching Mirages, the latest volume of Nin's uncensored diary, to which Krizan wrote the foreword. Moreover, he was briefly engaged to the actress Joanne Woodward before she married the actor Paul Newman; after marrying, they briefly shared a house with Vidal in Los Angeles.  In 1950, Gore Vidal met Howard Austen, who became his partner for the next 53 years. He said that the secret to his long relationship with Austen was that they did not have sex with each other, \\"It's easy to sustain a relationship when sex plays no part, and impossible, I have observed, when it does.\\" In Celebrity: The Advocate Interviews (1995), by Judy Wiedner, Vidal said that he refused to call himself \\"gay\\" because he was not an adjective, adding \\"to be categorized is, simply, to be enslaved. Watch out. I have never thought of myself as a victim... . I've said - a thousand times? - in print and on TV, that everyone is bisexual\\".  In an interview with Esquire in 1969, Gore said \\"Homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality. Notice I use the word natural, not normal.\\" Commenting his life's work and his life, he described his style as \\"Knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.\\"  In the course of his life, Vidal lived at various times in Italy and in the United States. In 2003, as his health began to fail with age, he sold his Italian villa La Rondinaia (The Swallow's Nest) on the Amalfi Coast in the province of Salerno and he and Austen returned to Los Angeles. Howard Austen died in November 2003 and in February 2005 his mortal remains were re-buried at Rock Creek Cemetery, in Washington, D.C., in a joint grave plot that Vidal had purchased for himself and Austen.","output":"This text is about a man named Eugene Louis Vidal, who is better known as Gore Vidal.

Question: After Beauregard takes two sacks of gold powder and 500 out of Sullivan's wallet he then leaves to catch a train to where? Title: My Name Is Nobody Movie plot: Aging gunfighter Jack Beauregard (Henry Fonda), tired of being hounded by people who want to kill him for various reasons, wishes to retire and leave the country for Europe. While he is still trying to come up with the money needed for a ship's passage he encounters a strange and quirky man who just calls himself \\"Nobody\\" (Terence Hill) and professes to be a fan of Jack.Nobody, who is a formidable gunman in his own right, doesn't like the idea of his hero simply vanishing away silently. He wants the name of Jack Beauregard to become a true legend, written down in the history books, and for this purpose he has dreamed up a conflict of truly epic proportions: pitting Jack alone against the 150-man-strong bandit gang, called \\"The Wild Bunch\\".Unable to believe that Nobody could be serious, Jack initially views Nobody as yet another rival gunman, who is just out to make a name for himself by killing Jack - but Nobody is indeed quite serious about his plan.The potential for such a conflict exists because of one Mr. Sullivan (Jean Martin), the owner of a worthless mine, through which the Wild Bunch is laundering stolen gold. Jack Beauregard's brother, called the Nevada Kid, used to be co-owner of the mine, until Sullivan killed him. Now Nobody is hoping that Jack will take revenge upon Sullivan, thereby earning the ire of the Wild Bunch.Sullivan himself expects Jack to come gunning for him as well and has already sent goons after Jack to kill him, on previous occasions. Those were foiled by Jack himself on one occasion and by Nobody on another. When Sullivan wants to hire gunmen for another attempt on Jack's life, Nobody pretends to take the job and - after some confrontational banter and gun-play - warns Jack of the ambush waiting for him, helping him dispatch the other two gunmen lurking in hiding.Jack, however, disappoints Nobody and defies Sullivan's expectations; he declines to exact blood vengeance for a brother who, he claims, was just as much of a crook as Sullivan.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.

Q: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts.

The year is 1976 when NASA's Viking Project became the first U.S. mission to land a spacecraft on the surface of Mars and send photos back to earth. Frank Langella (Oscar nominee for Frost/Nixon) is wonderfully sinister as an elegant stranger with a hole in his cheek who shows up — the box in hand — at the home of NASA engineer Arthur Lewis (James Marsden) and his teacher wife, Norma (Cameron Diaz). His proposition: Push the button on the box and win a million bucks. The catch: Somebody dies, but it's somebody you don't know.      Get more news and reviews from Peter Travers on the Travers Take.      The couple, in a financial pinch regarding their son, Walter (Sam Oz Stone), agonizes over it. But it's Norma who does the button pushing. Later, another woman will do the same thing while hubby holds back. Does this indicate a misogynist streak in Kelly? The movie gets bogged down in so much exposition that you stop caring. Diaz and Marsden look narcotized throughout. But the images Kelly creates of an alien infiltration of the suburbs harks back to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. This gives the alleged festivities around the wedding of Norma's sister a genuine chilling effect, notably a dance sequence set to the tune of 'When Joanna Loved Me.' What a shame that Kelly's pacing doesn't run as fast as his imagination. Instead of sweeping you along, The Box just sits there like something unclaimed at lost and found. Damaged goods. ||||| Movie Review      The Box      'The Box': Don't even bother opening this one      Cameron Diaz in 'The Box,' a movie from director Richard Kelly that misses the mark completely.      A couple makes a potentially deadly choice. With Cameron Diaz, James Marsden. Director: Richard Kelly (1:55). PG-13: Violence, disturbing images. At area theaters.      Some directors, it must be said, only have one really good movie in them. We're starting to worry that Richard Kelly may be among this select group.      Kelly impressed legions of college kids with his 2001 debut, \\"Donnie Darko.\\" He followed that edgy cult hit with the disastrous \\"Southland Tales,\\" so his third time out is especially important. And the best to be said is that it's not \\"Southland Tales.\\"      But \\"The Box\\" is its own kind of awful, a disconnected mess that never finds its reason for being. Based on Richard Matheson's \\"Button, Button,\\" a (great) short story that was turned into a (pretty good) \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode, Kelly's attempt misses the mark completely. Where the two previous versions were pointedly precise, \\"The Box\\" sprawls sloppily, encompassing unexplained aliens, a screechy score, preposterous special effects, and two stars with no idea what they're doing.      As a NASA engineer in 1976, James Marsden's Arthur has been directly involved in a mission to Mars. This may or may not be why a creepy stranger (Frank Langella) delivers the titular gift to his home.      Arthur's wife, Norma (Cameron Diaz), is given a choice: She can pass the box on, or push the button inside. If she chooses the latter, she'll earn 1 million, and a stranger will die.      Norma takes the bait, but it's the movie that immediately expires. Rather than ending the story with a punch, as Matheson did, Kelly wanders aimlessly, leaving crater-sized gaps in his wake. All we learn for sure is that women always push the button, and their husbands are always loyal and loving enough to forgive them just before they're cruelly punished for their greed.      It's no great reflection on Kelly that Marsden - normally so charismatic - sleepwalks through the movie. But Diaz fares worst of all, having chosen (or been instructed) to make vacant idiocy Norma's defining trait.      So now you have your own choice to consider: Spend your time and money on Kelly's take, or watch the original \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode at home on YouTube.      If only all decisions were this easy.      eweitzman@nydailynews.com ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This news article talks about a movie called \\"The Box.\\" The movie is about a mysterious stranger who gives a couple a box.

Answer the following question: Q: Why is water important for the nervous system?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  There are many choices you can make to keep your nervous system healthy. One obvious choice is to avoid using alcohol or other drugs. Not only will you avoid the injury that drugs themselves can cause, but you will also be less likely to get involved in other risky behaviors that could harm your nervous system. Another way to keep the nervous system healthy is to eat a variety of healthy foods. The minerals sodium, calcium, and potassium, and vitamins B 1 and B 12 are important for a healthy nervous system. Some foods that are good sources for these minerals and vitamins include milk, whole grains, beef steak, and kidney beans (shown in Figure below ). Your brain also needs healthy fats like those in nuts and fish. Recall that fats insulate the axons of neurons. These fats help build new connections between nerves and brain cells. These fats may improve memory and increase learning and intelligence. Water is also important for the nervous system, so drink plenty of water and other fluids. This helps prevent dehydration, which can cause confusion and memory problems. And get plenty of rest. Your brain requires plenty of rest so it can strengthen circuits that help with memory. A good night’s sleep will help keep your brain functioning at its best.

Bend your front knee inward while pivoting your entire body. Keep your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle while rotating into the target.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Maximizing Efficiency and Power in Martial Arts Techniques: The Dynamics of Turning, Pivoting and Rotating Introduction Martial arts, as both a form of physical exercise and self-defense, have been practiced around the world for centuries. From ancient Asian disciplines such as Kung Fu and Karate to more modern boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, one thing that these styles share in common is the efficient use of body mechanics to generate power and reduce the potential for injury. In this article, we will examine a fundamental martial arts technique (turn your dominant hand down while raising your elbow, bend your knee inward while pivoting your body, and keep your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle while rotating into the target) to understand how it optimizes force and stability during combat. Step 1: Turning Your Dominant Hand Down and Raising Your Elbow The dynamics of this movement serve multiple purposes. Firstly, by turning your dominant hand down, you position your fist for a powerful strike- the proper fist alignment keeps the knuckles flat and the wrist straight, reducing the risk of injury. Simultaneously, raising your elbow creates an angle that enables a more effective transfer of energy from your arm to your target. As your elbow ascends, your shoulder and back muscles engage, driving the force of your strike from a broader, more stable base. Step 2: Bending Your Front Knee Inward and Pivoting Your Entire Body In martial arts, much of your striking power comes from your lower body. Bending your front knee inwards and pivoting your entire body allows you to capitalize on the torque generated from your strong lower body muscles. As you pivot on the ball of your foot, your hips rotate, transferring force from the ground up through your legs, hips, and torso. Consequently, your strike becomes more powerful and versatile. In addition to increased striking power, bending your knee ensures that your stance remains stable and grounded, making it difficult for your opponent to off-balance or take you down. Step 3: Maintaining a 90-Degree Angle at Your Elbow and Rotating into the Target The 90-degree angle at your elbow serves as an essential aspect of this technique. By maintaining this angle, your arm becomes a lever capable of generating greater force and follow-through. Furthermore, this position enables your muscles to engage evenly, creating a more stable and controlled strike. Rotating your body into the target ensures that the full momentum of your strike is directed towards the intended point of impact. This results in both increased power and precision – a combination that is critical to an effective martial arts technique. Conclusion The technique described in this article (turn your dominant hand down, raise your elbow, bend your knee inward, pivot your entire body, and maintain a 90-degree angle at the elbow while rotating into the target) exemplifies the interplay of biomechanics in martial arts. Each movement works in harmony to generate power, stability, precision, and efficiency—all traits that are essential for an effective martial artist, regardless of their chosen discipline. By understanding and refining these mechanics, practitioners can maximize their potential and develop a deeper appreciation for the art of combat. Whether you are training for self-defense, competition, or personal growth, integrating these principles will help you become a stronger, more efficient martial artist with a solid foundation for success in your practice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This dramatic video shows the moment a Utah woman smashed her SUV into an office building, with the alleged intent of hitting her estranged husband. Surveillance footage captures 26-year-old Brenda White ramming her Ford Explorer car into the foyer of the building, knocking her ex, John White, to the ground. He drags himself up and runs for his life, dodging out the way of the car, having been chased through a parking garage and into the building. Scroll down for video. Shocking: The SUV smashes through the glass, hitting Mr White. In court: Brenda White said she did not set out to injure her estranged husband. In a 911 recording, obtained by Abc, a distressed-sounding woman can be heard saying: 'This SUV just drove into our building, he's chasing some guy down. 'The car's all the way inside the building. He went through going like 70 miles an hour.' At the time of the incident the pair were in the midst of an 'ugly divorce' police said. Mr White was taken to hospital where. he was treated for broken legs and given 63 stitches over his legs, arms. and face. Mrs White was arrested and charged with attempted murder. She was later released on 500,000 bail. Savage: Mr White is floored by the attack. Injured: Mr White drags himself up off the ground. Mrs White's attorney said she was on a. large amount of anxiety medication and was 'not in her right mind' when. she chased down her former husband. 'On that day, Brenda White's body was behind the wheel of that Ford Explorer,' Jason Schatz said. 'What's in dispute is why this happened.' On trial: Brenda Christine White faces charges of attempted murder and criminal mischief stemming from the 2006 incident. The. incident happened in 2006 but there have been several appeals because. her attorneys have tried to use the defense that she was under. extreme emotional distress. Lawyers argued that she had taken too much Xanax which was partially to blame for the incident. Rare side-effects of taking the drug can include outbursts of anger, delusions and aggressive behavior. Mrs White has since apologised for the attack, which she claims not to remember. Asked what she recalled of the incident she sobbed: 'I don’t. [Being in the parking lot] is the last thing I remember. The next thing I remember, I was inside a building.' She added: 'It was not me. Jon was my husband. He was my best friend, my lover. I would not want to hurt him,' the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Mrs. White claimed to have blacked out after hearing her former husband. speaking on a cell phone and telling another woman he loved her. She. said she had taken a handful of pills on the drive there but had not set. out with the intention of injuring him. 'At some point. in our lives we have all done or said something that we wouldn't have. done if we were in total control of our body,' Mr Schatz added. In his testimony White said he ran from the parking garage when he saw his ex-wife in the SUV. He said he dodged between two parked cars, jumping over a concrete wall, and into the office. At that point, he testified, his ex-wife smashed through the glass and into the building, knocking him to the ground. After being struck he was still able. to get up and continue to run but she drove down a hallway and chased. him, hitting him again. Long process: White's attorneys have pushed for appeals over the past six years, arguing that she was 'not in her right mind' because she had taken too much Xanax before the attack. He said he hid in a closet until a maintenance man found him. Mr White claimed that before the attack, during his lunch break, Mrs White came to his office and played the song Angry Johnny by the singer and songwriter Poe, which includes the lyrics: 'I wanna kill you/I wanna blow you away.' When that lyric came up, she mimicked a gun with her hands and pointed it at his head, he claimed. If convicted Brenda White faces up to five years in jail.

Paragraph: Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a major concern to healthcare systems around the world. They are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, in addition to increased hospitalization costs. Recent outbreaks, including those caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus, have highlighted the importance of infection control. Moreover, HAIs, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods, have become a top global priority. Although adequate approaches and guidelines have been in existence for many years and have often proven effective in some countries, the implementation of such approaches in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is often restricted due to limited resources and underdeveloped infrastructure. While evidence-based infection prevention and control (IPC) principles and practices are universal, studies are needed to evaluate simplified approaches that can be better adapted to LMIC needs, in order to guide IPC in practice.

The island nation has numerous coastal regions that face the Pacific, which plays a significant role in terms of climate, trade connections, and biodiversity. The Pacific Ocean influences Japan's humid and wet climate, with seasonal monsoons that bring considerable rainfall and typhoons that sometimes cause extensive damage to its coasts. Apart from being a natural divider, the strategic location of Japan on the edge of the Asian continent and the Pacific Ocean has played a crucial role in shaping its culture, history, and global influence. Historically, Japan has both benefited and faced challenges due to its unique geographic position. Its accessibility to maritime trade and exchange of ideas has enriched and diversified its culture, but this proximity to other nations has also exposed Japan to invasions and diplomatic tensions. In summary, the archipelago nation of Japan separates the Sea of Japan from the Pacific Ocean. Its unique geography and surrounding marine environment have played a vital role in shaping Japan's culture, history, and global relations throughout the centuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Solve -16*w = -19*w + 3 for w.","output":"To solve the equation -16*w = -19*w + 3 for w, we must isolate the variable w on one side of the equation. Here's a step-by-step solution: 1. The equation is:    -16*w = -19*w + 3 2. Our goal is to isolate 'w', so we'll start by adding 19*w to both sides of the equation to remove '-19*w' from the right side. This yields:    -16*w + 19*w = -19*w + 19*w + 3 3. Simplify the equation by combining like terms:    3*w = 3 4. Now, we want to isolate 'w' completely, so we'll divide both sides of the equation by 3:    (3*w) / 3 = 3 / 3 5.

And for the last 24 of them, it turns out she's had a secret weapon -- the nice Ella Slack. The former BBC manager has, unknown to anyone except a handful of key advisers, spent the last quarter of a century acting as the Queen's official stand-in at rehearsals   for royal events. The 69-year-old has never accepted a penny for her royal service, considering it \\"a pleasure and an honour\\" to ensure that everything runs smoothly for the Queen. \\"How many people in the world have had a chance to sit in a royal landau   or walk onto the dais   at Windsor Castle even before the Queen has done so?\\" she said. While Miss Slack may not resemble the Queen facially, she has a similar figure to the Queen, standing just 5 foot. The Queen is 5 foot 2 inch. She began her remarkable role in 1988, when she was working as manager of the BBC's sports and events department. A producer asked her if she could stand in for the Queen to check camera angles at a rehearsal -- and her second career was born. Since then, from the State Opening of Parliament   to the 50th anniversary of Victory day, wherever the Queen is on duty Miss Slack is likely to have been there first. She has perfected her own version of the Queen's clothes, including a black patent handbag she bought in a charity shop for PS1, and even styles her hair like the Queen.

Options: - commercial area - razor - water - city - scissors  Explain why a human would choose \\"razor\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"razor\\" as the most important tool the barber uses in a barbershop due to the central role it plays in achieving a wide range of haircuts, styles, and grooming services. Razors are versatile instruments that have been used by barbers for many centuries and continue to serve as an essential piece of equipment in the modern barbershop. Here, we explore the compelling reasons why the razor is considered the most important tool in a barbershop. 1. Versatility: Razors offer unmatched versatility in the wide array of haircuts, styles, and grooming services they can accomplish. They are employed in cutting, trimming, and shaping various hair lengths, while also allowing for precise detailing and edging. This range of functions extends to facial hair grooming, where razors are critical for shaving, outlining, and maintaining facial hair styles. 2. Precision: One of the primary reasons a razor is considered essential is the precision it offers. Razors enable barbers to make very exact cuts, allowing for highly customized and detailed styling. The close cutting a razor provides is essential for achieving clean lines, seamless fades, and well-defined edges. 3. Shaving services: A key component of barbershop services is shaving. While scissors are predominantly used for cutting, razors are reputed for their ability to provide a close, smooth shave. As a cornerstone of men’s grooming, shaving is integral to the barbering experience. With a traditional straight razor or a modern safety razor, barbers are able to provide customers with consistently high-quality shaves, setting them apart from standard hair salons. 4. Skill demonstration: The art of using a razor is an important aspect of professional barbering, requiring extensive training and expertise. Mastering the razor is a prestigious accomplishment, demonstrating to clients the barber’s dedication to honing their skills. As a prominent symbol associated with the barbering profession, the razor highlights a barber's finesse and craftsmanship. 5. Tradition and heritage: The razor has a rich and storied history, dating back thousands of years. Showcasing the cultural legacy of barbering, razors connect the modern profession to its roots. The use of a razor in a barbershop reinforces this bond and demonstrates an appreciation for the timeless tradition of men's grooming. 6. Client satisfaction: By offering a high level of precision, versatility, and control, razors enable barbers to achieve desirable results while catering to individual client preferences. The razor’s role in providing tailored haircuts and grooming services enhances client satisfaction, making it an indispensable tool in the barbershop. In conclusion, a human would choose the \\"razor\\" as the most important tool the barber uses due to the comprehensive range of functions it serves within a barbershop setting. The razor's versatility, precision, and cultural significance establish it as a central element in barbering, allowing professionals to deliver high-quality services that promote client satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Education and learning are essential aspects of life. While formal education in schools, colleges, or universities can provide a framework for gaining specific knowledge or qualifications, it is important to recognize that learning can extend beyond the traditional classroom setting. The option \\"continue learning\\" is in line with common sense and is the most relevant answer to the question. Continuing to learn throughout life can take many forms. It can be through personal development by reading books, attending workshops, training sessions, and conferences or learning from others, such as engaging in conversations with experts in a specific field, mentors, and peers. Furthermore, individuals can learn from their personal experiences, successes, and failures. Nowadays, with the help of technology, people have access to a vast amount of information and resources at their fingertips. Online courses, webinars, and educational videos are easily accessible and can cover various subjects at differing levels, providing the opportunity to gain new skills and expand one's understanding of the world. Additionally, informal learning experiences can be gained through participation in hobbies or joining clubs and organizations. This type of learning typically stems from curiosity and the desire to gain knowledge and skills in a particular area. By doing so, individuals can develop various competencies, build relationships, and create an overall personal and professional growth. It is important to embrace lifelong learning as it has numerous benefits. For instance, continual learning can lead to a more fulfilling and enriched life, keeping the mind active and engaged. It encourages personal growth and development, empowers individuals by cultivating critical thinking skills, and paves the way for an increased understanding of oneself and the world.

In fact when I worked for them they deserved theyre Fortune 500 rating for one of the best employers. But, this place was a dump. With all the financial hardships they are currently going through I can totally understand with this kinda dead weight. The security was SLOPPY! He was a nice guy, but the uniform material was unpressed and hung sloppy. The armed officer looked like barney fife outta mayberry withh is duty belt slung low. Then the woman at the Amigo cards desk totally blew me away and its times like that they should be lucky my wife has a tight chain on me. First of all I didnt know that kids even toddlers have been banned from the casino floor unless they are on the platform of an eatery. So, when Im standing 10 feet away from my wife waiting for her to get the amigo card the woman at the desk was like you HAVE TO stand at McDonalds you cannot be here with anyone under 21. Im like WTF? Shes 2, what the hell do you have to worry about???? and in a STROLLER! What is she gonna slap a waitress on the ass order a jack a coke, take a drag off a found cigarette butt and pop in her bus money and take a chance on the reels like some honky? No! Was she screaming? NO! Did she scream when I had to take her away from my wife? YES! Stupid fucking laws, you know why casinos are loosing money? Because they are overly dependent on Dincs  (double income no children), retirees and transients! WAKE THE FUCK UP VEGAS! If a casino is connected to a hotel, an attraction (like the ice rink outback), a movie theater, bowling alley etc.. then HELLO! Your gonna have families and kids! If you are harassing my two year old because you cant control the hood rats then find the revenue to pay for COMPOTENT security not barney fife! Ive done casino security for years and Im damn good at it. Never had an insurance liability issue in all the years Ive worked in a casino. So this new anti family laws are bullshit and its why your loosing money. Because of how poorly you treated us and how my daughter was made to feel like a prisoner having to be only on the tiled areas, keeping a family SEPERATED while one takes care of player card stuff and check cashing we cant be together? Thats fucking stupid. Bring on the state tax cause if this is how you treat paying LOCAL customers who would have ate theyre had it not been for your poor staff and nazi like regime then I can totally see why LOCAL casinos are going belly up!

HOWEVER I have better service at the Klondike off sunset and its PURELY a gamblers place, no ice rink or hotel so no reason for kids to be theyre but when we go for breakfast they have never treated us harshly or cruely like Fiestas employees.

Please answer the following question: This week I shot my Interview with Claire Bridge. Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future.

The answer to the question: To whom is Millar referring when he observes that, positively, any comparisons undertaken would demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm? is inside the article: In his field and day, Wright was certainly eclipsed by his rival the more prolific Lely, to whom he is often compared. One critic, Millar, observes that any comparisons undertaken would \\"ruthlessly expose Wright's weaknesses and mannerisms\\" but that positively \\"they would also demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm, the sources of which must partly lie in his unusual origins, fragmented career and attractive personality\\". Millar suggests that a particularly useful comparison can be made between Lely and Wright's respective portrayals of the Duchess of Clevland (Barbara Villiers) (above). Whereas Lely portrayed her as a \\"full-blown and palpably desirable strumpet\\", the more seriously minded Wright, who was not really in sympathy with the morality of the new court and its courtesans, rendered a more puppet-like figure.However, even if Lely was considered the more masterly and fashionable of the two in seventeenth-century Britain, Wright is generally accepted as portraying the more lively and realistic likenesses of his subjects, a fact that reinforces Pepys's observation that Lely's work was \\"good but not like\\". Neither should Wright's realism be confused with a prudishness; as can be seen, for example, in his portrait the lady, thought to be Ann Davis (right). The picture, with the sitter's clothing left undone and her modesty barely preserved by a red drape, has been described as exhibiting a fresh – even risky – reality: erotic by contemporary standards. Whereas Wright's contemporaries might have used the ‘disguise’ of presenting the sitter in the guise of a classical goddess to protect against accusation of  salaciousness, Wright's portrait rather depends on his realism, notably in his flesh tones, and depth., can you guess it ?","output":"Yes, based on the provided information in the article, Millar is referring to the painter John Michael Wright when he observes that any comparisons undertaken would demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity, and charm.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: It was evening rush hour on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach, CA. Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous.  On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car.  While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude. If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else.  This kindness spreads. Someone does something nice for you and in turn you're likely to do something nice for that person or for someone else.  A simple act of kindness could have a widespread effect.

Since then, U.S. dollar banknotes have only been issued in seven denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100. Is it true that was there ever a bill larger than 100?","output":"Yes, it is true that there were bills larger than 100 in the United States. These large denominations of United States currency were indeed circulated by the United States Treasury until 1969. The primary purpose of these high-denomination bills was to facilitate large transactions between banks and other financial institutions, rather than serving the general public's transactional needs. The decision to discontinue these denominations was driven by several factors, including the increasing use of checks, electronic payment systems, and the belief that it would help combat money laundering and other illicit activities. The large denomination bills that existed included: 1. 500 Bill: William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States, was portrayed on the front of the 500 bill. This bill was last issued in 1945 and was officially discontinued in 1969. These bills are now considered collector's items, and as such, their value significantly exceeds their face value. 2. 1,000 Bill: The 1,000 bill featured a portrait of Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President of the United States. Like the 500 bill, the issuance of this denomination ceased in 1945 and was discontinued in 1969. Similar to the 500 bill, the 1,000 bill's value now lies primarily as a collector's item, often fetching a price many times higher than its face value. 3. 5,000 Bill: James Madison, the 4th President and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, appeared on the 5,000 bill. This denomination experienced very limited production, and it was often used for transactions between Federal Reserve Banks. Given their rarity, these bills carry an even higher premium for collectors today. 4. 10,000 Bill: The 10,000 bill featured a portrait of Salmon P. Chase, who served as the 6th Chief Justice of the United States and the Secretary of the Treasury under President Lincoln. Although never widely circulated due to its high value, this bill was used for large transactions between banks. As with the other high-denomination bills, the 10,000 bill is now a rare collector's item that can fetch a significant premium. 5. 100,000 Bill: The 100,000 bill is the largest denomination of U.S. currency ever produced and is considered a gold certificate rather than a standard banknote. It featured a portrait of Woodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States. However, the 100,000 bill was never circulated among the general public. It was solely used for transactions between the Federal Reserve Banks and the U.S. Treasury. Since it was never issued for public circulation, this bill is not considered legal tender, and collectors are not allowed to possess it. In conclusion, there were U.S. currency denominations significantly larger than 100 in the past. However, they were mostly used for transactions between financial institutions and were discontinued in 1969. Today, these high-denomination bills are considered collector's items and can often be found trading for substantially more than their face value."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stomach walls.","output":"In these two sentences, the term \\"wall\\" is used to describe two different concepts that share some similarities but primarily serve different purposes and functions. Let's analyze each of them. 1. \\"We're adding another wall in this room during the remodeling.\\" In this sentence, the \\"wall\\" refers to a structural component of a building or a room, which typically serves as a barrier, provides support, or defines the boundaries of an enclosed space. Walls are essential in the architectural and structural aspects of buildings, as they can separate spaces, provide privacy, and support the overarching structure of a building. Walls in this context are usually made from materials including bricks, stones, concrete blocks, wood, or metal, depending on the requirements of the specific building. They can be interior or exterior walls and can be designed in various styles and thicknesses. 2. \\"Stomach walls.\\" In the context of this sentence, the term \\"wall\\" refers to the muscular layers and lining of the stomach, which is a crucial component of the human body's digestive system. Stomach walls are composed of four layers: the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, and serosa. Each of these layers serves a unique function in the process of digestion, from secreting enzymes and acids for breaking down food to pumping the partially digested food towards the intestines for further absorption. Stomach walls also undertake important tasks of mixing and moving food through the digestive tract while protecting the stomach lining from harsh digestive enzymes and gastric acid. In conclusion, although in both sentences the term \\"wall\\" signifies a somewhat enclosing or barrier-like structure, the context and meaning behind the instances are considerably different. The first sentence refers to a physical architectural construct in a building, whereas the second sentence describes a biological component of the human body's digestive system.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Unfortunately not all fashion accessories can be worn at all ages, the snapback being one of them. In some countries, like Europe, boys and men often share the same style, but in countries like the United States, wearing a snapback at an older age can make it seem like you are stuck in the past or don't know how to best dress for your age.  You can still be quite stylish at an older age, and you can definitely still wear hats, but wearing a snapback is generally common among teens and young adults, so you might try sticking to styles that complement your age instead of making it look like you are trying to look much younger. If you really want to wear a snapback, you definitely can. Some people want to stand out and don't want to fit in with societal norms, which is totally fine, but just remember that others may not consider it the best style option. Snapbacks are great fashion accessories that can really boost your style, but should only be worn at appropriate times. If you are attending a formal event, or going to a job interview, avoid wearing a hat as this can often be too casual. There are other ways to show your style and uniqueness, so before you throw on your snapback, think about the place you are going and the people that will be there. Before you wear a snapback, make sure you are wearing it for the right reasons. You want to feel comfortable in your snapback and it should complement your personality. If you're going to feel insecure in the snapback you have chosen or feel like a poser then maybe it's best to save the style change for a later time or choose a snapback that better fits you. The point is, snapbacks require confidence, and if you don't feel confident in one then it will likely be noticeable. Wear it because it fits you, not because you are trying to fit into a certain group of people.

Jews originated as a national and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE, in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel. The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel, associated with the god El, somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE. The Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold with the emergence of the Kingdom of Israel, and the Kingdom of Judah. Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews'. Though few sources in the Bible mention the exilic periods in detail, the experience of diaspora life, from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant, to Assyrian Captivity and Exile, to Babylonian Captivity and Exile, to Seleucid Imperial rule, to the Roman occupation, and the historical relations between Israelites and the homeland, became a major feature of Jewish history, identity and memory.

Lennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \\"Hammer A Nail\\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \\"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\\" Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, \\"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\\" Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work Apple, much to her fury.Ono began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \\"avant-garde bullshit\\". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they \\"made love at dawn\\".

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

North China's Tianjin Port resumed a temperature reporting system on Sunday. Any passengers through the port with a temperature above 38 degrees Celsius would be provided medical observation and reported to relevant authorities. Zhong Nanshan, a well-known anti-SARS scientist during the last outbreak, said it was unlikely the SARS virus would die out naturally and it would definitely come back, but predicted no widespread epidemic outbreak and the epidemic would not cause serious damage again. Caught unprepared this spring, Chinese authorities have learned to act quickly before the epidemic can take a hold. Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Yi Thursday urged strictly implementing the daily SARS epidemic reporting system and warned that people delaying reporting or hiding the true situation would be severely punished. In Beijing, the disease control center in Dongcheng District has recovered a 24 hour schedule for possible epidemic breakout. Every afternoon before 3:00 o'clock, the center receives SARS reports from every hospital in the district and then reports to the Beijing municipal disease control center and health bureau. In Beijing Xiehe Hospital, plans are ready for fever patients to receive treatment in a special section. Doctors in that ward, wearing protective clothing, will observe patients for any possible respiratory diseases. Patients with high fever and symptoms of respiratory diseases are required to be observed for one or two weeks.

Movie plot title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? cotton ball","output":"It seems like you want to know how someone would go about accomplishing a goal that involves a cotton ball. I'll assume the goal is to create a simple cotton ball craft. Here are the step-by-step process and justification for each step: 1. Gather materials: To start any craft, it's essential to have all the necessary materials on hand. For a cotton ball craft, you'll need cotton balls, glue, a base material like paper or cardboard, and any additional decorative items you'd like to include, such as googly eyes, pipe cleaners, or markers.    Justification: Gathering materials beforehand ensures a smooth and uninterrupted crafting session. 2. Choose a design or theme: Decide what you want to create with your cotton balls. Ideas could include animals, shapes, or abstract art. You can look for inspiration online or use your imagination.    Justification: Having a clear idea of what you want to create helps guide the crafting process, ensuring a better outcome. 3. Plan your design: Sketch out or visualize your design on the base material. This can be a simple outline or a more detailed plan, depending on your preference.    Justification: Planning your design before starting to glue the cotton balls helps to avoid mistakes and achieve a more polished final result. 4. Apply glue: Apply glue to the base material where you plan to place each cotton ball. You can either apply glue directly to the area or put glue on the cotton balls before sticking them onto the base.    Justification: Using glue to adhere the cotton balls to the base material ensures that the cotton balls stay in place once the craft is finished. 5. Attach the cotton balls: Press the cotton balls onto the glued areas on the base material, following the plan or outline you've created. You can adjust the amount of fluffiness by pulling apart the cotton balls for a fuller look or compressing them for a flatter appearance.    Justification: Attaching the cotton balls according to your design creates the desired visual effect. 6. Add any additional decorations: Use any additional decorative items such as googly eyes, pipe cleaners, or markers to further embellish and personalize your cotton ball craft.    Justification: Embellishments enhance the overall appearance of the craft, making it more interesting and unique. 7. Allow the glue to dry: Leave the cotton ball craft aside to dry for the recommended amount of time mentioned on the glue's packaging to ensure that everything stays in place and sets properly.    Justification: Allowing the glue to dry fully prevents the cotton balls and embellishments from falling off. 8. Display or share your cotton ball craft: Once the glue is dry, you can display your finished craft in your home or give it as a gift to someone.    Justification: Sharing and displaying your completed craft allows you to enjoy the results of your creativity and effort. By following these steps, a person would be able to accomplish their goal of creating a cotton ball craft."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"a peaceful rowboat during dusk.\\", can we conclude \\"The boat is in stormy water at the sun sets.\\"?","output":"Based on the given statement, \\"a peaceful rowboat during dusk,\\" we cannot definitively conclude that \\"The boat is in stormy water as the sun sets.\\" Let's break down each element of the statements to further understand the reasoning behind this conclusion. 1. \\"A peaceful rowboat during dusk\\": The phrase describes a rowboat that is in a calm and tranquil state during dusk, which is the time just before the sun sets. This suggests that the environment surrounding the boat is likely serene, possibly indicating smooth water, little to no wind, and a general sense of peace. It also emphasizes the time of day, indicating that the boat's peaceful state is specifically occurring during dusk. 2. \\"The boat is in stormy water as the sun sets\\": This statement describes a boat that's within a turbulent, stormy environment while the sun sets. The phrase \\"stormy water\\" suggests rough conditions such as high waves, strong winds, or even rainfall which is contrary to the \\"peaceful rowboat\\" description provided earlier. Additionally, it identifies that these conditions take place as the sun sets, which may coincide with dusk, but it focuses more on the stormy environment rather than the tranquility suggested in the first statement. When comparing these two statements, they present contrasting environments - a peaceful rowboat versus a boat in stormy water. The first statement suggests a calm, serene setting during dusk, while the second statement implies turbulent, stormy conditions as the sun sets. These conflicting descriptions lead us to the conclusion that we cannot definitively say that \\"The boat is in stormy water as the sun sets\\" based on the information provided in the phrase \\"a peaceful rowboat during dusk.\\" It is essential to recognize that the absence of information about the weather conditions or the presence of storms in the first statement doesn't automatically confirm that these conditions don't exist. However, given that \\"peaceful\\" and \\"stormy\\" are contrasting adjectives describing the rowboat's environment, it becomes less likely that the second statement is a valid conclusion based solely on the first statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Get several, if you can, in case you mess up your first try. Put the bottlecap down on the table, with its top upward. Stick a flathead screwdriver through the vertical side, under the bottlecap, and through the other side. This pair of holes should be very close to the lower rim. Make the holes wide enough to fit a popsicle stick. Rotate the cap 90º. The holes will now be on the left and right. The side in front of you will have no holes in it. Push the screwdriver through in this direction to make holes at a 90º angle to the others. These holes will be halfway up the cap's sides. Leave room below and above them. These should also be wide enough to fit a popsicle stick. One popsicle stick goes through the two lowest holes, just poking out one end. A second stick goes through the middle holes, poking out equally on each sides. Now you have a † shape through the bottle cap. Keep the cap pointed the same direction. Poke the screwdriver high up on the sides, near the flat top. Make these holes small, and keep them straight over the lower stick. You can use a larger, Philips head screwdriver to make the holes round without making them wider. Take a wide rubber band. Place it over the bottle cap, above the sticks.

Paragraph: This paper is dedicated to Professor Joep Lange, a Dutch pioneer in AIDS research and a great protagonist of access to effective antiretroviral therapy for all. On July 17 this year, Joep died in the plane crash in Ukraine on his way to the AIDS conference in Australia. a b s t r a c t At any given moment, our body is under attack by a large variety of pathogens, which aim to enter and use our body to propagate and disseminate. The extensive cellular and molecular complexity of our immune system enables us to efficiently eliminate invading pathogens or at least develop a condition in which propagation of the microorganism is reduced to a minimum. Yet, the evolutionary pressure on pathogens to circumvent our immune defense mechanisms is immense, which continuously leads to the development of novel pathogenic strains that challenge the health of mankind. Understanding this battle between pathogen and the immune system has been a fruitful area of immunological research over the last century and will continue to do so for many years. In this review, which has been written on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Dutch Society for Immunology, we provide an overview of the major contributions that Dutch immunologists and infection biologists have made in the last decades on the inflammatory response to viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections. We focus on those studies that have addressed both the host and the pathogen, as these are most interesting from an immunological point of view. Although it is not possible to completely cover this comprehensive research field, this review does provide an interesting overview of Dutch research on inflammatory responses to infection.   Title: Inflammatory responses to infection: The Dutch contribution","output":"Step-by-Step Analysis and Justification: 1. The paragraph talks about the paper dedicated to Professor Joep Lange, an AIDS researcher - Title does not mention anything about Professor Joep Lange, but this is not essential for the title. 2. The paragraph discusses the battle between pathogens and the immune system and the extensive complexity of our immune system - The title refers to \\"Inflammatory responses to infection,\\" which is related to the immune system and its response to pathogens. 3. The paragraph focuses on the research work of Dutch immunologists and infection biologists - The title refers to \\"The Dutch contribution,\\" which indicates the paper's focus on Dutch researchers' work. 4. The paragraph reviews the major contributions in the last decades on the inflammatory response to various types of infections - The title explicitly mentions \\"inflammatory responses to infection\\", which agrees with the content of the paragraph. 5. The paragraph focuses on studies related to both host and pathogen - Although the title does not explicitly mention both host and pathogen, it can be inferred from the term \\"inflammatory responses to infection\\" as the response involves both.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  Idaho  for the following movie plot:  Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard Ann (Carole Lombard) and David Smith (Robert Montgomery) are a married couple living in New York who, though happy, often have fights that last for days before they lovingly reconcile. One morning, Ann asks David if he had to do it over again, would he marry her? To her disappointment, although he is very happy with her now and wouldn't marry someone else, he answers that he would not. Later that day, Harry Deever (Charles Halton), an Idaho county official, informs David that due to a jurisdictional mishap, their three-year-old marriage license from Idaho is not valid. Since Deever is a family acquaintance of Ann's from Idaho, he stops by their apartment to tell Ann and her mother (Esther Dale) the same thing. Ann does not mention this to David and thinks he will remarry her that very night, as he just invited her out to a romantic dinner at the fancy restaurant they ate at before they were married. When they arrive at the restaurant, however, they realize that the restaurant has turned into a seedy joint, and they head home. When Ann feels she has given David long enough to propose and leave to get married, she confronts him and accuses him of not wanting to marry her again. While David protests and says he was going to ask her shortly, Ann dismisses that and kicks him out of their apartment. David spends the night at his club, but when he goes home after work the next day, he is not allowed entry by her maid. David waits in the lobby and sees Ann return with an older gentleman suitor.

When Patch finally found his way out of the seed-pod, Toro was gone, and there were rats all around him. Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them. There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \\"Who are you?\\" \\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\\" Patch said. \\"Who are you that asks?\\" \\"I am Snout,\\" the rat replied. \\"Why are you here?\\" \\"I came to look for food.\\" \\"This is our food. These mountains are ours.\\" \\"Your food?\\" Patch asked, bewildered. There was no ownership of food in the Center Kingdom, not until it had actually been eaten. \\"That's ridiculous. It's food. It belongs to whoever finds it first.\\" \\"Then you belong to us,\\" Snout hissed. \\"Because we are the rats who will suck the marrow from your broken bones.\\" Question: After the end of the text, Patch might: === The answer to the above question is","output":"speculative, as the text does not provide a clear indication of Patch's next actions. However, based on the information given, Patch might: 1. Attempt to reason with Snout and the rats, explaining that there is no need for conflict and that they can share the seed-pods as a food source. 2. Challenge Snout and the rats, perhaps hoping to scare them away or establish his dominance in the face of their threats. 3. Seek an escape route to quickly get away from Snout and the rats, avoiding a direct confrontation. 4. Try to find Toro or other friendly squirrels to assist him in dealing with the rats, potentially either through negotiation or confrontation. 5. Use his knowledge of the terrain, his agility, or any other advantages he has as a squirrel to outmaneuver or outsmart the rats. Ultimately, Patch's chosen course of action would depend on his character, the particular circumstances he finds himself in, and the level of danger he perceives from Snout and the rats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: Where are you likely to find the freshest tomatoes? Options: - pizza - squashed - refrigerator - market - on pizza Answer:","output":"You are likely to find the freshest tomatoes at the market.  Here's a detailed explanation of why the market is the best option in line with common sense: 1. Market: Fresh produce, including tomatoes, is typically brought to markets by local farmers and distributors. Markets specifically aim to offer a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables for purchase. As a supply and demand location, vendors at markets ensure that the items they display for sale are at their peak freshness. This way, buyers can expect to find and select from an array of fresh tomatoes that were likely picked and transported within a short time frame. The market is undoubtedly the most logical choice when looking for fresh tomatoes, as other options include either processed or stored versions. 2. Pizza: When it comes to pizza toppings, tomatoes may either be used as a base sauce or as an additional topping. In any case, the tomatoes utilized in this context have gone through significant processing (cooked or at the very least, sliced) and lose their freshness factor, making pizza an inadequate option for finding fresh tomatoes. 3. Squashed: Squashed tomatoes have been damaged and are not suitable for consumption. They may not necessarily be rotten, but their freshness is significantly compromised due to bruising and bacterial exposure. Anyone seeking fresh tomatoes would not consider squashed tomatoes as a viable option. 4. Refrigerator: Although refrigeration preserves the longevity of tomatoes by slowing down the ripening process, it may also alter their taste and texture. The longer a tomato is stored in a refrigerator, the less fresh it becomes. Consequently, considering tomatoes stored in a refrigerator as the freshest choice is far from the most accurate option. 5. On pizza: Similar to the case of finding fresh tomatoes in pizza, tomatoes used as toppings on pizza have already been sliced, processed, and cooked. The high temperatures involved in making pizza rob tomatoes of their freshness. As a result, finding the freshest tomatoes on pizza is not a plausible alternative. In conclusion, based on the given options and taking common sense into account, the market is the most suitable location to find the freshest tomatoes. With vendors providing a variety of ripe and fresh tomatoes, the market outshines the other alternatives where tomatoes have been cooked, altered, or stored for an extended period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Pinocchio Movie plot: After singing the film's signature song \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\", Jiminy Cricket explains that he is going to tell a story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the Tuscany workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio (a name his cat Figaro and fish Cleo both dislike). Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio would be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.     Gideon and Honest John Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. However, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who convince him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings while performing with marionettes of Dutch girls, French can-can girls, and Russian Cossacks. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him up in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy then appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer.

There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc.  - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role.  - Elizabeth Cochran Seaman (May 5, 1864  January 27, 1922), known by her pen name Nellie Bly, was an American journalist. She was also a writer, industrialist, inventor, and a charity worker who was widely known for her record-breaking trip around the world in 72 days, in emulation of Jules Verne's fictional character Phileas Fogg, and an exposé in which she faked insanity to study a mental institution from within. She was a pioneer in her field, and launched a new kind of investigative journalism.  - The New York World was a newspaper published in New York City from 1860 until 1931. The paper played a major role in the history of American newspapers. It was a leading national voice of the Democratic Party. From 1883 to 1911 under publisher Joseph Pulitzer, it became a pioneer in yellow journalism, capturing readers' attention and pushing its daily circulation to the one-million mark.  - Yellow journalism, or the yellow press, is a type of journalism that presents little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines to sell more newspapers. Techniques may include exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering or sensationalism. By extension, the term \\"yellow journalism\\" is used today as a pejorative to decry any journalism that treats news in an unprofessional or unethical fashion.  - Jules Gabriel Verne ( 8 February 1828  24 March 1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright best known for his adventure novels and his profound influence on the literary genre of science fiction.  - Headquarters (HQ) denotes the location where most, if not all, of the important functions of an organization are coordinated. In the United States, the corporate headquarters represents the entity at the center or the top of a corporation taking full responsibility for managing all business activities. In the UK, the term head office is most commonly used for the HQs of large corporations. The term is also used regarding military organizations.  - Phileas Fogg is the protagonist in the 1873 Jules Verne novel \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\".  - The history of American newspapers begins in the early 18th century with the publication of the first colonial newspapers. American newspapers began as modest affairsa sideline for printers. They became a political force in the campaign for American independence. Following independence the first article of U.S. Constitution guaranteed freedom of the press and the American press grew rapidly during the First Party System (1790s-1810s) when both parties sponsored papers to reach their loyal partisans. From the 1830s onward the Penny press began to play a major role in American journalism and technological advancements such as the telegraph and faster printing presses in the 1840s helped expand the press of the nation as it experienced rapid economic and demographic growth. Editors typically became the local party spokesman, and hard-hitting editorials were widely reprinted.  By 1900 major newspapers had become profitable powerhouses of advocacy, muckraking and sensationalism, along with serious, and objective news-gathering. During the early 20th Century, prior to rise of television, the average American read several newspapers per-day. Starting in the 1920s changes in technology again morphed the nature of American journalism as radio and later, television, began to play increasingly important competitive roles.  - Joseph Pulitzer (born József Pulitzer; April 10, 1847  October 29, 1911) was a Hungarian-American newspaper publisher of the \\"St. Louis Post Dispatch\\" and the \\"New York World\\". Pulitzer introduced the techniques of yellow journalism to the newspapers he acquired in the 1880s. He became a leading national figure in the Democratic Party and was elected congressman from New York. He crusaded against big business and corruption, and helped keep the Statue of Liberty in New York.  - In the study of human settlements, an urban agglomeration is an extended city or town area comprising the built-up area of a central place (\\"usually a municipality\\") and any suburbs linked by continuous urban area. INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term \\"unité urbaine\\", which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an \\"agglomeration\\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself.  - A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts.   - Ten Days in a Mad - House is a book by newspaper reporter Nellie Bly . It was initially published as a series of articles for the New York World . Bly later compiled the articles into a book , which was published by Ian L. Munro in New York City in 1887 . The book comprised Bly 's reportage for the New York World while on an undercover assignment in which she feigned insanity at a women 's boarding house , so as to be involuntarily committed to an insane asylum .

My only complaint is that they keep (yes, I am writing while eating) putting the plates across the table rather than within reach.","output":"The review is overall positive. The reviewer highlights several aspects of the Korean BBQ restaurant that they enjoyed, such as its cleanliness, the attentiveness of the staff, the freshness of the meat, and the well-executed marinades.  However, there is a minor negative aspect mentioned at the end, where the reviewer talks about their dissatisfaction with the placement of the plates across the table rather than within reach. Nonetheless, this complaint seems to be relatively insignificant in comparison to the positive aspects of the restaurant that the reviewer appreciated.

The meanings of thousands of everyday perceptions(, ), the bases for the decisions we make, and the roots of our habits and skills are to be found in our past experiences, which are brought into the present by memory.    Memory can be defined as the capacity to keep information available for later use. It includes not only \\"remembering\\" things like arithmetic or historical facts, but also involves any change in the way an animal typically behaves. Memory is involved when a rat gives up eating grain because he has sniffed something suspicious in the grain pile. Memory is also involved when a six-year-old child learns to swing a baseball bat.    Memory exists not only in humans and animals but also in some physical objects and machines. Computers, for example, contain devices from storing data for later use. It is interesting to compare the memory-storage capacity of a computer with that of a human being. The instant-access memory of a large computer may hold up to 100,000 \\"words\\"--ready for instant use. An average prefix = st1 /U. S. teenager probably recognizes the meaning of about 100,000 words of English. However, this is but a fraction(, ) of the total amount of information which the teenager has stored.

It further explains that memory is not only present in humans and animals but also in physical objects and machines like computers. Memory helps us retain information and experiences, which is crucial for our learning, adaptation, and growth. The passage highlights the importance of memory by stating that it is responsible for keeping information accessible for later use and that memory plays a role in animal behavior and human activities, including learning and problem-solving capabilities.

The bars had been restored since he had wrenched them off to give ingress to the family on the day of recapture. He glanced around the room; nothing seemed to have been disturbed. Nevertheless he was uneasy. The suspicions of a frank, trustful nature when once aroused are apt to be more general and far-reaching than the specific distrusts of the disingenuous, for they imply the overthrow of a whole principle and not a mere detail. Clarence's conviction that Susy had seen Pedro recently since his dismissal led him into the wildest surmises of her motives. It was possible that without her having reason to suspect Pedro's greater crime, he might have confided to her his intention of reclaiming the property and installing her as the mistress and chatelaine of the rancho. The idea was one that might have appealed to Susy's theatrical imagination. He recalled Mrs. McClosky's sneer at his own pretensions and her vague threats of a rival of more lineal descent. The possible infidelity of Susy to himself touched him lightly when the first surprise was over; indeed, it scarcely could be called infidelity, if she knew and believed Mary Rogers's discovery; and the conviction that he and she had really never loved each other now enabled him, as he believed, to look at her conduct dispassionately. Yet it was her treachery to Mrs. Peyton and not to himself that impressed him most, and perhaps made him equally unjust, through his affections.  1. What was on the window? 2. Had they been there long? 3. why were they restored? 4. why did wrench the bars? 5. Who did this? 6. Who did Clarence suspect Susy had seen? 7.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:      Q: Which type of muscle fiber can sustain long contractions?   A: Choices: (a). fast fibres (b). intense fibers (c). direct fibers (d). slow fibers A:","output":"The type of muscle fiber that can sustain long contractions is (d). slow fibers. Slow fibers, also known as slow-twitch muscle fibers or Type I muscle fibers, are designed to provide consistent, long-lasting contractions. These fibers have a slower contraction speed compared to fast fibers (or fast-twitch muscle fibers, also known as Type II fibers). Slow fibers contain more mitochondria, which are the energy-producing components of cells, and higher amounts of myoglobin, a protein that binds oxygen. This allows them to generate energy more efficiently through aerobic metabolism. Due to their greater fatigue resistance and ability to generate energy for extended periods, slow fibers are crucial for endurance activities, such as long-distance running, cycling, and swimming. In contrast, fast fibers (Type II) are better suited for high-intensity, short-duration activities, such as sprinting or heavy weightlifting. The other choices provided, intense fibers and direct fibers, are not standard terms for describing muscle fiber types. In summary, slow fibers (d) are the muscle fiber type capable of sustaining long contractions owing to their increased capacity for energy generation through greater mitochondrial content and myoglobin presence. They are essential for endurance-based activities and sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Background: Dinesh Joseph D'Souza (; born April 25, 1961) is an Indian American right-wing political commentator, author, and filmmaker. From 2010 to 2012, he was president of The King's College, a Christian school in New York City. Born in Bombay, D'Souza came to the United States as an exchange student and graduated from Dartmouth College. He became a naturalized citizen in 1991. Context: On July 25, 2016, D'Souza released the documentary film Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party. The film criticizes the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive (and ultimate) Democratic nominee for President of the United States in 2016.  The film was universally panned by professional film critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 4%, based on 27 professional reviews, with an average rating of 1.7/10. The critics consensus on the site reads, \\"Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party finds Dinesh D'Souza once again preaching to the right-wing choir--albeit less effectively than ever.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 2 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". The film has the fifth lowest score of all films on the site. Peter Sobczynski wrote, \\"Hillary's America may well be the single dumbest documentary that I have ever seen in my life.\\" A July 2016 review in Variety characterized D'Souza as \\"a right-wing conspiracy wingnut, the kind of \\"thinker\\" who takes off from Barack Obama birther theories and just keeps going, spinning out a web of comic-book liberal evil.\\"  Other critics and figures viewed the film positively. John Fund of the National Review stated that \\"[the film] is over the top in places and definitely selective, but the troubling facts are accurate and extensively documented in the D'Souza book that accompanies the movie.\\" He also called the film \\"intensely patriotic\\".

Information:  - Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. It is the 14th largest city in the European Union. It is also the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.26 million people, while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million. The city has a temperate climate, with warm summers and chilly winters.  - A libertine is one devoid of most moral or sexual restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour sanctified by the larger society. Libertinism is described as an extreme form of hedonism. Libertines put value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in France and Great Britain. Notable among these were John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, and the Marquis de Sade.  - Don Giovanni (K. 527; complete title: , literally \\"The Rake Punished, namely Don Giovanni\\" or \\"The Libertine Punished\\") is an opera in two acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Italian libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte. It is based on the legends of Don Juan, a fictional libertine and seducer. It was premiered by the Prague Italian opera at the National Theater (of Bohemia), now called the Estates Theatre, on 29 October 1787. Da Ponte's libretto was billed as a \\"dramma giocoso\\", a common designation of its time that denotes a mixing of serious and comic action. Mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an \\"opera buffa\\". Although sometimes classified as comic, it blends comedy, melodrama and supernatural elements.  - Mariano Padilla y Ramos ( 1842 -- 21 November 1906 ) was a Spanish operatic baritone who excelled in the title role of Mozart 's Don Giovanni .  - Don Juan (Spanish), Don Giovanni (Italian) is a legendary, fictional libertine. The first written version of the \\"Don Juan\\" legend was written by the Spanish dramatist Tirso de Molina (\\"nom de plume\\" of Gabriel Téllez). His play, \\"El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra\\" (\\"The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest\\"), was set in the fourteenth century and published in Spain around 1630. The name \\"Don Juan\\" is a common metaphor for a \\"womanizer\\".  - Dramma giocoso (Italian, literally: drama with jokes; plural: \\"drammi giocosi\\") is a genre of opera common in the mid-18th century. The term is a contraction of \\"dramma giocoso per musica\\" and describes the opera's libretto (text). The genre developed in the Neapolitan opera tradition, mainly through the work of the playwright Carlo Goldoni in Venice. A \\"dramma giocoso\\" characteristically used a grand \\"buffo\\" (comic or farce) scene as a dramatic climax at the end of an act. Goldoni's texts always consisted of two long acts with extended finales, followed by a short third act. Composers Baldassare Galuppi, Niccolò Piccinni, and Joseph Haydn set Goldoni's texts to music.  - Lorenzo Da Ponte (10 March 174917 August 1838) was an Italian, later American opera librettist, poet and Roman Catholic priest. He wrote the libretti for 28 operas by 11 composers, including three of Mozart's greatest operas, \\"Don Giovanni\\", \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" and \\"Così fan tutte\\".  - The Estates Theatre or Stavovské divadlo is a historic theatre in Prague, Czech Republic.

Suggestion: Both representatives and senators are chosen through direct election . The answer to this question is:","output":"False. The question is asking about specific powers that are unique to a particular house of Congress, either the House of Representatives or the Senate. The proposed suggestion is not relevant to the question because it focuses on the election process and does not address any specific powers belonging to either house of Congress. To provide a more complete and relevant answer: The United States Congress is divided into two main houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Both houses share many powers, such as the power to pass legislation and declare war. However, each house also has unique powers that are specific to that particular house. For the House of Representatives, the specific powers include: 1. Initiating revenue bills: All bills that deal with raising revenue, such as taxes, must originate in the House of Representatives. This power aligns with the idea that the House is meant to be more responsive to the people, as it has a more direct connection to the population through proportional representation. 2. Impeachment authority: The House of Representatives has the power to impeach a federal official, including the President. This means that they can charge the accused with misconduct and potentially lead to a trial, which is then held by the Senate. For the Senate, the specific powers include: 1. Ratifying treaties: Any treaties made by the President must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate before they go into effect. This acts as a check on the President's foreign policy authority and ensures that the Senate has a role in shaping the nation's international agreements. 2. Confirmations: The Senate has the power to confirm appointments made by the President, such as those of federal judges, cabinet officials, and ambassadors. This process often involves hearings and deliberation before the Senate votes to either confirm or reject the appointment. 3. Trying impeached officials: If the House of Representatives initiates impeachment proceedings against a federal official, the Senate is responsible for holding the trial and deciding whether the individual should be removed from office. A two-thirds majority vote is required for removal. In conclusion, the suggested answer \\"Both representatives and senators are chosen through direct election\\" is false because it does not address the specific powers that belong to particular houses of Congress.

I know that the answer to the question \\"A non-serious violation of Bible principles can be penalized by what?\\" is in \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\".

This practice aims to encourage the individual to rectify their behavior and align themselves with the teachings and principles upheld by the congregation. Unlike disfellowshipping or formal reproof, marking does not involve complete shunning or restriction of spiritual fellowship.

Please answer a question about the following article about Child labour: While full-time work hinders schooling, empirical evidence is varied on the relationship between part-time work and school. Sometimes even part-time work may hinder school attendance or performance. On the other hand, many poor children work for resources to attend school. Children who are not doing well at school sometimes seek more satisfactory experience in work. Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home. In the modern world, school education has become so central to society that schoolwork has become the dominant work for most children, often replacing participation in productive work. If school curricula or quality do not provide children with appropriate skills for available jobs or if children do nor have the aptitude for schoolwork, school may impede the learning of skills, such as agriculture, which will become necessary for future livelihood. What hinders schooling for child labourers?","output":"Several factors hinder schooling for child labourers, as discussed in the article. These factors can be categorized as economic, social, academic, and personal: 1. Economic factors: Many poor children need to work to obtain resources for attending school. Due to financial constraints in their families, they are compelled to engage in part-time or full-time work to cover their educational expenses, such as tuition fees, books, and uniforms. 2. Social factors: The societal pressure to contribute to the family income often leads to children becoming involved in part-time or full-time work. This may result in insufficient time and energy to focus on their schooling, which ultimately affects their regular attendance and academic performance. 3. Academic factors: The article highlights that some children may find school education inadequate in preparing them for the available job opportunities. If the school curriculum does not teach the skills needed for local employment, such as agriculture, children may resort to work to learn practical skills and gain experience for their future livelihood. 4. Personal factors: Children who are not performing well in school may seek a more satisfactory experience in work. A positive relationship with a supervisor at work can provide relief from the stress and tensions experienced at school and home. Consequently, this encourages them to continue working rather than focusing on their studies. To summarize, child labourers face various hurdles in their pursuit of education. Economic factors compel them to work due to financial constraints, social factors place pressure on children to contribute to family income, academic factors create disillusionment when schools don't provide relevant skills, and personal factors lead some children to prioritize work over schooling for emotional and personal satisfaction. Each of these factors contributes to the hindrance of their access to education, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and limiting their opportunities for a better future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paul Louis Broum The answer is:","output":"Title: The Shadow of Deceit Genre: Crime-Mystery-Thriller Plot Summary: Johny Vulkan, a prominent business magnate, is found murdered in his luxurious mansion in the suburbs of an opulent city. The question on everyone's mind is: who would want to kill this influential figure? As the investigation unfolds, Sergeant Anne Cardell, a seasoned detective, discovers a twisted plot of lies, secrecy, and deception that will bring her face to face with some powerful, unexpected suspects, including Paul Louis Broum, the rising star of the art world. Act 1: The story begins with the discovery of Johny Vulkan's lifeless body in his mansion, the crime scene meticulously arranged to look like a suicide. Anne Cardell is assigned to lead the investigation, feeling the pressure from her superiors, as Johny was a widely respected and influential man.  While examining the scene, Anne notices some discrepancies: a muffled gunshot noise caught on a recording, overheard during a phone call—to Paul Louis Broum. This leads her to believe that Johny's death was not a suicide, but a well-planned murder. Anne's investigation takes her deep into the luxurious world of high society and the intertwined lives of the elite. As she delves, she discovers that Johny was more than just a wealthy entrepreneur; he was also involved in several shady deals, including illegal art trafficking and money laundering. This revelation raises the stakes and puts a large target on Anne's back as she faces threats from those who want to keep the truth hidden. Act 2: Anne continues to search for clues and starts questioning the people close to Johny. Among them is Paul Louis Broum, a talented young artist with a seemingly bright future. Anne uncovers that before his death, Johny had been financing Paul's career and gallery exhibitions from the start, leading her to suspect Paul's potential involvement in Johny's murder. After some digging, Anne finds out that Johny and Paul had a bitter falling out when Johny had attempted to exploit and manipulate Paul's artworks for his illegal art trafficking scheme. This sparks Anne's interest in Paul's possible motive for murder.  As Anne investigates Paul further, she uncovers several layers of deceit and a hidden love affair between Paul and Johny's estranged wife, Theresa. She also comes across incriminating evidence that connects Paul to the suspicious purchase of heavy-duty cleaning tools and unregistered firearms, only days before Johny's murder.  Act 3: Pressure from the city's elite intensifies as they demand a swift conclusion to the case. Despite the suspicious circumstances, Anne struggles to establish concrete evidence that Paul committed the murder. As a result, she is pulled from the case and replaced by a new investigator who is swayed by the power and influence of Johny's close associates, effectively abandoning the search for truth. Undeterred, Anne continues privately to pursue Paul and decode the complicated web of lies and deceit. Eventually, she discovers that Paul was framed by one of Johny's corrupt partners, a high-profile city council member who had orchestrated the entire murder to protect his illicit operations. In a climactic showdown, Anne confronts the council member and his gang of armed accomplices. Using her wit and years of experience, she is able to outsmart them and gather enough evidence to expose their crimes to the public. Anne redeems herself professionally and personally while delivering justice for Johny Vulkan. Epilogue: Paul is seen walking out of a courtroom, cleared of all charges. Theresa thanks Anne for her unwavering pursuit of the truth. Their future is uncertain, but the intense shared experience has sparked a new friendship that will endure. Anne continues her career as a detective, embracing the newfound recognition of her talents, knowing that her pursuit of truth can bring justice and resolution for those within the city she serves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:John was studying the history of dinosaurs. He found that dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. He labeled it as era A. Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B. John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history.  Would era A see less or more biodiversity than era B?  Hint: Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's obligate anaerobes. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since: A:","output":"Based on the information provided, era A represents the time when dinosaurs were flourishing before the mass extinction event, which occurred around 66 million years ago. During this time, there would be a variety of species coexisting, competing for environmental niches, and evolving through genetic mutation. Era B, on the other hand, represents the time period of the mass extinction event itself. During a mass extinction, the extinction rate is much higher than usual, and a large number of species are lost. This often results from an accumulation of smaller extinction events that take place in a relatively brief period of time. Considering the hint about the constant extinction of species and the occurrence of mass extinction events, era A would likely show more biodiversity compared to era B. This is because era A represents a time when many species were thriving, whereas era B represents a time when a large number of species experienced extinction. The mass extinction event during era B would have greatly reduced the biodiversity present at that time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options：  A. air  B. rock  C. arctic  D. log  E. field A:","output":"E. Field Insects can be found in various environments, but when it comes to finding them eating something green, a field is the most suitable option among the choices provided. Fields, especially those dominated by plants and grasses, provide an ideal habitat for insects. The green plants and grasses in fields are often rich in nutrients that many insects rely on for sustenance. A diverse array of insects, such as caterpillars, grasshoppers, aphids, and beetles, can be found in fields, munching on leaves, stems, and other green parts of plants. In addition to being a food source, fields offer insects numerous other benefits, such as shelter and hiding spots from predators. The dense vegetation in a field can provide insects with suitable micro-habitats that help them thrive. Comparing the other options: A. Air - While some insects spend part of their lives flying through the air, they generally do not consume food while in the air. An exception would be some adult insects such as moths or butterflies that feed on nectar from flowers while flying. However, the green parts of plants are not typically eaten in the air. B. Rock - Rocks, by nature, are inorganic and do not provide a source of green plants or food for insects. Although certain organisms, like mosses and lichens, can grow on rocks, they are not the preferred food source for most insects. C. Arctic - The extreme cold and harsh conditions of the Arctic limit the prevalence of insects in this environment. Additionally, the vegetation in the Arctic tends to be less diverse and less abundant than in other biomes, leading to fewer opportunities for insects to be found eating green plants. D. Log - While logs can provide habitats for various insects, they are unlikely to find green plants to consume on a log. Many insects that live in and around logs feed on decomposing wood, fungi, or other insects but not green plants. Given these comparisons, the field is the most suitable option for finding insects eating something green. This environment offers a diverse range of green plant life for insects to consume and provides appropriate living conditions for a broader range of insect species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

Stories about animal kindness have really changed my point of view. In fact, some stories are amazing, especially when animals are meeting with people. Here are two stories that interest me.   James, a wildlife writer, told a story that an African woman had placed her baby in the shade of a tree while she was working. An elephant group walked by and saw the baby. Several elephants pulled leafy branches from the tree covered the sleeping baby. Flies can be a problem in Africa and the branches protected the baby from the flies. The elephants were so gentle and quiet that they did not even wake up the baby. Then the elephants walked away.    An English magazine offers another story. Bill, a cat, stayed at home while its master was away on a trip, but the man was injured in a railway accident and died a few days later in a hospital. At the funeral, the Man's brother was surprised to see that Bill was there. The faithful cat had traveled a long way to the hospital, looked at the coffin , and then sadly returned home.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Picture a wasteland of computer monitors and TVs, stretching as far as the eye can see. Imagine towers of boxes, all of them filled with broken glass and old electronic devices. Technology graveyards like this can be found in communities across the country.    Experts say that landfills and warehouses will overflow unless a plan for the disposal and reuse of electronics is put into place. \\"We can't put electronics and glass aside and tell ourselves we'll deal with them later,\\" Lauren Roman, managing director of Transparent Planet said. Roman's group works to improve the disposal of electronic waste. She says about 660 million pounds of tech trash is produced each year in the US.    What's behind the tech trash pile-up? About ten years ago, major advances were made in computer and television technology. Manufacturers began producing devices like flat-paneled LCDs and plasma screen monitors. These new products provide a clearer image and take up less space than older models. It goes without saying that consumers choose them rather than heavy, glass-based technologies.    The new electronics are built with materials that are difficult to recycle. In addition, the new products have decreased the demand for recycled parts from the older monitors and screens. Older, heavier computer monitors and TVs used glass-based components called CRTs.    CRTs have a high lead   content and can be environmentally risky if not recycled properly. If crushed and put in landfills, the lead from CRTs could seep into groundwater and rivers, harming the water supply. For many years, plants and recycling programs safely processed CRTs. The recycled CRTs were reused in the construction of new monitors.    Monitors being made today do not use glass tubes. \\"People are returning old-style TVs with CRTs, but no new ones are being made,\\" said Linnel. This is creating an imbalance in the amount of glass being disposed of and recycled properly. Many recycling companies have shut down. Others no longer have the resources or space to process...

In an April 1964 letter to his agent, Candida Donadio, Pynchon wrote that he was facing a creative crisis, with four novels in progress, announcing: \\"If they come out on paper anything like they are inside my head then it will be the literary event of the millennium.\\"  In the mid-1960s, Pynchon lived at 217 33rd St. in Manhattan Beach, California, in a small downstairs apartment.  In December 1965, Pynchon politely turned down an invitation from Stanley Edgar Hyman to teach literature at Bennington College, writing that he had resolved, two or three years earlier, to write three novels at once. Pynchon described the decision as \\"a moment of temporary insanity\\", but noted that he was \\"too stubborn to let any of them go, let alone all of them.\\"  Pynchon's second novel, The Crying of Lot 49, was published a few months later in 1966. Whether it was one of the three or four novels Pynchon had in progress is not known, but in a 1965 letter to Donadio, Pynchon had written that he was in the middle of writing a \\"potboiler\\". When the book grew to 155 pages, he called it, \\"a short story, but with gland trouble\\", and hoped that Donadio could \\"unload it on some poor sucker.\\"  The Crying of Lot 49 won the Richard and Hilda Rosenthal Foundation Award shortly after publication. Although more concise and linear in its structure than Pynchon's other novels, its labyrinthine plot features an ancient, underground mail service known as \\"The Tristero\\" or \\"Trystero\\", a parody of a Jacobean revenge drama called The Courier's Tragedy, and a corporate conspiracy involving the bones of World War II American GIs being used as charcoal cigarette filters. It proposes a series of seemingly incredible interconnections between these events and other similarly bizarre revelations that confront the novel's protagonist, Oedipa Maas. Like V., the novel contains a wealth of references to science and technology and to obscure historical events, with both books dwelling on the detritus of American society and culture. The Crying of Lot 49 also continues Pynchon's strategy of composing parodic song lyrics and punning names, and referencing aspects of popular culture within his prose narratives. In particular, it incorporates a very direct allusion to the protagonist of Nabokov's Lolita within the lyric of a love lament sung by a member of \\"The Paranoids\\", an American teenage band who deliberately sing their songs with British accents (p. 17). Answer this question \\"What is The Crying of Lot 49?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"The Crying of Lot 49 is Thomas Pynchon's second novel, published in 1966.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the house from which a chancel, separated from the nave by an oak screen, projects eastward from the main plan? is inside the article: The wolf head crest also appears in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in this room is decorated with female caryatids and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have been painted and gilded, and traces of this still remain.William Moreton III used what is today known as the Exhibition Room as a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the adjoining Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style tempera painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house, with a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.The Corn Store adjacent to the Chapel may originally have been used as accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward. By the late 17th century it had been converted into a grain store by raising the floor to protect its contents from damp. Five oak-framed bins inside may have held barley for the Brew-house, which is now used as a toilet block., can you guess it ? The answer is:","output":"The answer to the question is \\"Little Moreton Hall\\". This can be inferred from the sentence \\"The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.\\" My deduction process follows these steps:  1. Identify the main query: The user wants to know the full name of the house with a specific architectural detail – that its chancel, which is separated from the nave by an oak screen, projects eastward from the main plan. 2. Scan the text for relevant information: In the provided text or 'article', the house with the specified architectural characteristics matches \\"Little Moreton Hall\\", as described in the sentence “The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house…”  3. Verify the information: Cross-referencing the identified information with the question, it is confirmed that Little Moreton Hall is indeed the house that fits the description provided.   4. Formulate the answer: Based on the textual evidence and matching the details given in the question, conclude that Little Moreton Hall is the full name of the house in question."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Orrin Hatch accused Sebelius of being \\"untruthful\\" when she said implementation of the law was on track. In an exchange being touted by conservative sites Fox News and the Daily Caller, John Cornyn pointed out that the government didn't require criminal background checks for \\"navigators,\\" the support staff who help people register. \\"So a convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual?\\" Cornyn asked. \\"This is possible,\\" Sebelius replied.","output":"Title: Secretary Sebelius Faces Senate Finance Committee on ObamaCare Implementation Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, faced another round of questioning about the Obama administration's healthcare reform efforts. This time, she appeared before the Senate Finance Committee where she faced bipartisan calls to delay parts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) implementation. However, she rejected these demands as insufficient given the pressing need for healthcare access. During her testimony, Sebelius underscored that delaying the ACA's provisions would not delay the pressing health issues that many Americans face. \\"Delaying the Affordable Care Act would not delay people's cancer or diabetes or Parkinson's disease,\\" she said, according to the New York Times. Sebelius continued by stating that \\"for millions of Americans, delay is not an option.\\" Although recognizing that the initial enrollment figures would likely be low, Sebelius stood firm in her opposition to any delays. Members of the committee from both parties took turns expressing their frustrations and complaints about the problematic rollout of the ACA, which has been plagued by website glitches and issues affecting individual policies. Notably, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch accused Sebelius of being \\"untruthful\\" in previous claims that the implementation of healthcare law was on schedule. The hearing took a contentious turn when Republican Senator John Cornyn raised concerns about the lack of criminal background checks for \\"navigators,\\" the support staff who assist people in registering for the healthcare exchanges. Cornyn questioned whether \\"a convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual.\\" Sebelius responded by acknowledging that such a scenario, under the current guidelines, was indeed possible, sparking increased concern among conservative commentators. This appearance marked another difficult day for Sebelius, who has become the face of the ACA's troubled implementation. The hearings on Capitol Hill also highlight the ongoing debate about the state of healthcare reform and the need for any modifications or delays to the ACA. While the Obama administration acknowledges some issues with the rollout, they remain adamant that accelerating the delay in implementing crucial healthcare protections would be detrimental to the millions of Americans currently without access to adequate care. The hearings underscore the growing tensions between lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with Democrats increasingly voicing their concerns and frustrations with the Obama administration's handling of the healthcare reform efforts. For the moment, both sides have little choice but to wait and watch how the implementation of the ACA unfolds, the public sentiment surrounding it, and potential legislative and administrative changes that may be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: O'Keeffe was born on November 15, 1887, in a farmhouse located at 2405 Hwy T in the town of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O'Keeffe, were dairy farmers. Her father was of Irish descent. Her maternal grandfather George Victor Totto, for whom O'Keeffe was named, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848. O'Keeffe was a legend beginning in the 1920s, known as much for her independent spirit and female role model, as for her dramatic and innovative works of art. Nancy and Jules Heller said, \\"The most remarkable thing about O'Keefe was the audacity and uniqueness of her early work.\\" At that time, even in Europe, there were few arts exploring abstraction. Even though her works may show elements of different modernist movements, such as Surrealism and Precisionism, her work is uniquely her own style. She received unprecedented acceptance as a woman artist from the fine art world due to her powerful graphic images and within a decade of moving to New York City, she was the highest paid American woman artist. She was known for a distinctive style in all aspects of her life. O'Keeffe was also known for her relationship with Stieglitz, in which she provided some insight in her autobiography.  A substantial part of her estate's assets were transferred to the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation, a nonprofit. The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum opened in Santa Fe in 1997. The assets included a large body of her work, photographs, archival materials, and her Abiquiu house, library, and property. The Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio in Abiquiu was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998 and is now owned by the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum.  In 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32 cent stamp honoring O'Keeffe. In 2013, on the 100th anniversary of the Armory Show, the USPS issued a stamp featuring O'Keeffe's Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico/Out Back of Marie's II, 1930 as part of their Modern Art in America series.  A fossilized species of archosaur was named Effigia okeeffeae (\\"O'Keeffe's Ghost\\") in January 2006, \\"in honor of Georgia O'Keeffe for her numerous paintings of the badlands at Ghost Ranch and her interest in the Coelophysis Quarry when it was discovered\\".

Here's an explanation on how I translated it; 1) I started from the beginning of the sentence \\"ANKARA, Turkey --> ANKARA, Türkiye\\" because Turkey is Türkiye in Turkish. 2) Then I proceeded to translate \\"popular artist Bedri Baykam and his assistant\\" to \\"Ünlü sanatçı Bedri Baykam ve asistanı\\". In this case, 'popular' becomes 'ünlü', 'artist' becomes 'sanatçı', and 'his assistant' becomes 've asistanı'. 3) The next part \\"were attacked and stabbed in Istanbul on Monday\\" is translated to \\"Pazartesi günü İstanbul'da saldırıya uğrayıp bıçaklandılar\\". Here, 'were attacked' turns into 'saldırıya uğrayıp', and 'stabbed' is 'bıçaklandı'. 4) Finally, I translated \\"after participating in a meeting to protest the destruction of a controversial monument in the eastern city of Kars\\" to \\"doğu şehri Kars'taki tartışmalı bir anıtın yıkımını protesto etmek amacıyla katıldıkları bir toplantının ardından\\". Here, 'meeting' is 'toplantı',  'to protest' is 'protesto etmek', 'the destruction' is 'yıkımı' and 'a controversial monument in the eastern city of Kars is \\"Kars'taki tartışmalı bir anıt\\".

The term \\"crime\\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\\"a public wrong\\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - The Case of the Lucky Legs is a 1935 mystery film , the third in a series of Perry Mason films starring Warren William as the famed lawyer .  - Perry Mason is a fictional character, a criminal defense lawyer who is the main character in works of detective fiction written by Erle Stanley Gardner. Perry Mason is featured in more than 80 novels and short stories, most of which involve a client's murder trial. Typically, Mason establishes his client's innocence by implicating another character, who then confesses.  - Mystery film is a genre of film that revolves around the solution of a problem or a crime. It focuses on the efforts of the detective, private investigator or amateur sleuth to solve the mysterious circumstances of an issue by means of clues, investigation, and clever deduction.  - Warren William (born Warren William Krech; December 2, 1894  September 24, 1948) was a Broadway and Hollywood actor, immensely popular during the early 1930s; he was later nicknamed the \\"King of Pre-Code\\".

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.\\"?

You could break your arm at gymnastics. Do you want to stop going to the gym?\\" \\"No, of course not!\\" she replied. And with a determined spirit, she stood up and agreed to try again. I held on to the back of her bike until she found the courage to say, \\"Let's go!\\" I spent the rest of the afternoon at the park watching a very brave little girl overcome a fear, and congratulating myself for being an independent single parent. As we walked home, pushing the bike as we made our way along the sidewalk, she asked me about a conversation she'd overheard me having with my mother the night before. \\"Why were you and Grandma arguing last night?\\" \\"It's nothing.\\" I told her. She shrugged  . \\"Grandma said she just wanted you to find someone to love.\\" \\"What Grandma wants is for some guy to break my heart again,\\" I snapped. \\"But Mom ...\\" \\"You're too young to understand.\\" I told her.

I thought that \\"Scary Movie\\" although not a great movie was very good and funny. \\"Scary Movie 2\\" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid. The Exorcist/Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. Now, I'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all. But bad comedy is still bad comedy. Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes drag out way to long. Also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying. The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless. Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie. For example, the 'creaming' I guess you would call it of Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in \\"Scary Movie\\" because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her. But this time around it was out of place and not funny. The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around. The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film. Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie. But I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film. The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film. Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mainly negative. The person who wrote it was disappointed by \\"Scary Movie 2\\" and found it to be boring, not funny, and sometimes stupid. They thought the timing was bad and that the same jokes were repeated too much, making them annoying and less funny. However, they did enjoy a few parts of the movie, like some performances and characters.

Write an article based on this \\"The decision to caution a man who posted revenge porn images online was correct, a police force has said.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Police Force Defends Decision to Caution Man Over Revenge Porn Images Posted Online Introduction The sensitive issue of revenge porn recently gained the spotlight as a police force defended their decision to caution a man who posted explicit images of his ex-partner online. The force justified their decision, stating that the proper procedures were followed, and the decision to caution was deemed most suitable in this particular case. This incident opens up a broader discussion on the prevalence and consequences of revenge porn, as well as the effectiveness of legal penalties in addressing this growing problem. Police Force's Statement In a statement, the unnamed police force made it clear that it believed its decision to caution the offender was the correct course of action. They emphasized that the case was carefully assessed by their investigators and that the force was convinced that administering a caution was proportionate and adequate based on the circumstances and the man's previous criminal history. It is important to note that a caution still carries legal consequences and may appear on the individual's criminal record, potentially affecting their employment prospects and social standing. Moreover, the police force pointed out that the victim was consulted during the decision-making process and was informed of the outcome. The Growing Problem of Revenge Porn Revenge porn refers to the act of sharing explicit or intimate images or videos of an individual without their consent, typically with the intent to cause distress or humiliation. In most cases, it involves former partners seeking to exact revenge on their exes. The rise of social media and the ease of sharing intimate content online have unfortunately created a fertile ground for this malicious activity to flourish. In recent years, countries around the world have acknowledged the potential damage revenge porn can cause, leading to the enactment of laws and regulations criminalizing it. These laws aim to tackle the problem by holding offenders accountable and deterring individuals from engaging in this despicable behavior. In some jurisdictions, victims of revenge porn can also seek damages through civil lawsuits. The Effectiveness of Legal Penalties Determining the best approach to penalize perpetrators of revenge porn remains a subject of debate. Some critics argue that cautions, like the one issued in this case, are too lenient and do little to deter potential perpetrators. They feel that a stronger legal response, such as imprisonment or hefty fines, would be more effective at sending a clear message that revenge porn will not be tolerated. On the other hand, proponents of cautions argue that they can be a suitable option in particular circumstances, provided that they are issued judiciously and with the involvement of the victim. Conclusion The police force's decision to caution a man who posted revenge porn images online has provoked a wider discussion about the adequacy of current legal penalties in addressing this issue. While varying opinions exist on the effectiveness of cautions, it is crucial for law enforcement agencies to thoroughly investigate each case and apply the appropriate legal response in consultation with the victim, as done in this instance. Ultimately, as society continues to grapple with the ever-evolving challenges posed by the digital age, it is essential that laws, law enforcement techniques, and public awareness campaigns continue to adapt and evolve in response to combat revenge porn and support those affected by this harmful behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? does n't deliver a great story ,  Available options: -- negative. -- positive.","output":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"does n't deliver a great story,\\" is negative. This sentence implies that the subject being discussed has not successfully provided a compelling narrative or experience for the reader or viewer. The use of \\"doesn't\\" (with a small typographical error in the sentence) conveys a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction, as it implies a lack of fulfillment in terms of the story being told. The sentence structure and choice of words contribute to a negative sentiment. When constructing a statement, the use of negative contractions (e.g., \\"doesn't,\\" \\"isn't,\\" or \\"wasn't\\") typically conveys a sense opposite to the meaning of the original verb. In this case, \\"deliver\\" implies achievement or satisfaction, but the contraction \\"doesn't\\" negates that meaning, suggesting that the subject falls short of providing a great story. Furthermore, the use of the word \\"great\\" indicates a higher-than-normal expectation of quality or enjoyment for the story. By saying that it doesn't deliver a \\"great\\" story, the speaker is suggesting that the outcome was far from meeting these expectations, which further strengthens the negative sentiment being conveyed. In conclusion, based on the language and structure of the given sentence, the sentiment is clearly negative. This assessment is supported by the presence of the contraction \\"doesn't,\\" which negates the positive verb \\"deliver,\\" and the adjective \\"great,\\" which indicates high expectations that were not met.

The waitress that helped us looked like she literally jumped out of an anime. She was dressed in a maid outfit and looked super cute. Service overall was excellent. I was greeted when I came in and the waitress checked up on us frequently. As for the food, we ordered the tonkotsu and miso ramen with an order of chicken wings. For the ramen, I'm kind of biased because I'm comparing it to Monta.  Miso ramen: Kind of bland. There was some miso flavor but overall it wasn't enough. What I did like though was that it came with a bunch of extra stuff like half an egg, bean sprouts, cha-shiu, onion etc.  Tonkotsu ramen: Kind of salty! Pretty much the opposite of the miso. lol. Once again, I did like how it came with a bunch of extra stuff similar to the miso.  Chicken wings: Yum! Fried perfectly with nice crispy skin on the outside.

I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK would begin their career with a low-budget exploitation horror film like this. Perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their respective careers, Messiah of Evil has potential, but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can't muster the film-making prowess to pull it off. The premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back. It doesn't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity - and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe Messiah of Evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70's exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror. The surreal non-sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the 'blood moon', a scruffy and half-mad alcoholic (played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie) who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley 'eaten by dogs' a little later, the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded, murderous, squirrel-eating albino. Part of the movie's charm is precisely this brand of bargain-basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way. Whereas with Lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator, with Messiah of Evil the boundaries between the 'intentional', the 'unintentional' and the 'didn't really expect it to come out this way but it's good enough - WRAP SCENE' blur hopelessly. Take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug-addled, feverish, stream-of-consciousness way, one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father, and the other narrated by her father's voice as she reads his diary.  While we're still talking about a 'living dead' picture, Messiah of Evil is different and only loosely one - at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be. The origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse, bestowed upon the town by a mysterious 'Dark Stranger' who came from the woods one day. In the meantime Hyuck finds time for snippets of mass-consumption criticism in a flesh-eating supermarket scene that predates DAWN OF THE DEAD by a good number of years (you can hear the MST3K line already: 'man is dead, only his capitalist food tins remain') and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater. I generally think that the surreal works in careful, well measured doses - how is the absurd to work if it's not hidden within the perfectly normal? Hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand. When the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience, amused and satisfied with his own hijinks.  The general film-making level is also pretty low - after the half-way mark, the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either. Add to that the choppy editing, average acting and Hyuck's general inability to capture true atmosphere - the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused - and I'd file Messiah under 'missed opportunity' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even though it's not particularly gory, trashy or sleazy.

What would spur someone to walk up to a war memorial, fatally shoot a soldier guarding it, then rush into Canada's Parliament and open fire? The attacker, identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, may have taken the answer to his grave when he himself was shot dead before he could seriously hurt anyone inside Parliament. Yet, bit by bit, we're learning about the 32-year-old Zehaf-Bibeau, a man with a criminal record and, according to a friend, an unstable mind. Investigators are digging to find out more. One thing they already know, though, is that the bloodshed is \\"a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere in the world,\\" according to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Here's what we know so far about Michael Zehaf-Bibeau:. He's the son of a Libyan father, Canadian mother. He was born October 16, 1982, to father Bulgasem Zehaf and mother Susan Bibeau, according to court documents tied to his parents' 1999 divorce. His father is from Libya, while his mother is Canadian, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said. The Globe and Mail newspaper described the father, Zehaf, as a businessman. Zehaf-Bibeau's mother is the deputy chairwoman of the immigration division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, according to her official profile. She's been with that agency since 1990, having worked as a refugee protection officer, legal adviser and manager of operational support, among other roles. \\"I know that the mother was very caring and a very involved parent. Actually both parents seem to have been,\\" Janice Parnell, a former neighbor, told CNN partner network CTV. \\"The boy seemed to have had a very good upbringing. He had a good home base. He was involved in community things.\\" He lived in several places in Canada. According to Canadian media reports, Zehaf-Bibeau worked as a miner and a laborer at various points in his life. Not only did he change jobs, he changed places. Born in Montreal, Zehaf-Bibeau also lived in Calgary and most recently in Vancouver, according to Paulson. He had a criminal record. One way that authorities traced Zehaf-Bibeau's past was by following his criminal record. Paulson said that  Zehaf-Bibeau's \\"record indicated infractions related to drugs, violence and other criminal activities.\\" Specifically, court documents obtained by CNN partner network CBC reveal Zehaf-Bibeau was charged with drug possession in Quebec in 2004. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. In 2011, he was charged with robbery and uttering threats in Vancouver, CBC reported. He was found guilty of only the second charge and sentenced to a day in jail. What, if anything, does this criminal record have to do with what happened Wednesday? The RCMP commissioner said that Zehaf-Bibeau \\"had a very developed ... non-national security criminality of violence and of drugs and of mental instability.\\" Investigators are trying to determine what role that criminal past, if any, played in Zehaf-Bibeau's radicalization and decision to attack Wednesday, Paulson said. Sergeant-at-arms hailed as 'hero' Prime Minister: 'Terrorist' killed soldier 'in cold blood' He asked to go to jail to overcome crack addiction. In December 2011, as part of a psychiatric evaluation prior to a trial in Vancouver, Zehaf-Bibeau said \\"he wants to be in jail as he believes this is the only way he can overcome his addiction to crack cocaine,\\" according to a psychiatric assessment provided by a Canadian court. The 2011 assessment continues, \\"He has been a devoted Muslim for seven years and he believes he must spend time in jail as a sacrifice to pay for his mistakes in the past.\\" The psychiatric expert who completed the assessment wrote, \\"I am unable to find any features of signs of a mental illness.\\" \\"Although he seems to be making an unusual choice, this is insufficient basis for a diagnosis of mental disorder,\\" the expert said. A convert to Islam, he had 'radical views' As mentioned , Zehaf-Bibeau converted to Islam about a decade ago. At some point after that, he became radicalized -- though officially haven't specified when or who he rubbed elbows with. Paulson, the RCMP commissioner, spoke Thursday about Zehaf-Bibeau's radicalization as well as his \\"association with some individuals who may have shared his radical views.\\" Asked later what he meant by \\"association,\\" the national police commissioner said Zehaf-Bibeau's \\"email was found in the hard drive of somebody who was charged with a terrorist-related offense. \\"What does that mean?\\" the commissioner asked. \\"We need to understand what that means.\\" Some found his behavior troubling. Zehaf-Bibeau was asked to stop attending prayers at the mosque he attended because elders found his behavior \\"erratic,\\" a friend told the Globe and Mail. The friend, Dave Bathurst, said Zehaf-Bibeau once told him the \\"devil is after him,\\" and frequently talked about supernatural spirits. \\"I think he must have been mentally ill,\\" Bathurst told the paper. He wanted to go to Syria, couldn't get passport. Zehaf-Bibeau spoke of wanting to go to the Middle East to study. Bathurst, the friend, told the Globe and Mail that he \\"urged his friend to make sure study was on his mind and not something else.\\" More specifically, his mother told authorities Wednesday that her son \\"wanted to travel to Syria,\\" according to Paulson. He applied for a passport, which was \\"subject to an investigation,\\" at the time of the Ottawa attack, the commissioner said. \\"I think the passport figured prominently in his motives and -- I'm not inside his head -- but I think it was central to what was driving him,\\" Paulson said. He visited the U.S. at least four times. U.S. law enforcement officials are tracing back Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's travel to the United States and interviewing people with whom he came into contact, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation. He visited at least four times, most recently in 2013, the official said. There's no reason to believe he's connected to any extremists in the United States, the official said. He had 'connections' to jihadists, wasn't necessarily part of a big network. Zehaf-Bibeau had \\"connections\\" to jihadists in Canada who shared a radical Islamist ideology, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria, multiple U.S. sources told CNN on Thursday. According to two U.S. counterterrorism officials, Zehaf-Bibeau was connected to Hasibullah Yusufzai through social media. Yusufzai is wanted by Canadian authorities for traveling overseas to fight alongside Islamist fighters in Syria, The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, reported. Other radicalized individuals connected to Zehaf-Bibeau are still believed to be in Canada, two U.S. law enforcement officials said. Early indications are that his connections involved \\"interactions\\" online, including via Islamic extremist websites, a U.S. source told CNN. There is no evidence so far that Zehaf-Bibeau had any \\"operational links\\" to other jihadists, according to the source, who drew a distinction between interacting online and plotting an attack. And when asked Thursday by CNN's Christiane Amanpour if Zehaf-Bibeau is linked to a wider network of jihadists, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird said \\"there's no evidence, at this stage, for us to know that. ... That's something authorities are looking at right now.\\" He was not on a Canadian list of possible extremists. Whatever his associations, Zehaf-Bibeau wasn't high on Canadian authorities radar when it comes to potential terrorist attacks. He was not among about 90 individuals that Canadian authorities are examining for possible Islamic extremist ties. \\"Had we have known that he wanted to travel to Syria, and had we had some basis to suspect that he wanted to do that for a criminal purpose, then he certainly would have been\\" on that list, Paulson said. The commissioner also noted, \\"There is no one path or formula to ... radicalization. And understanding each individual's path to that state is the challenge.\\" He recently came to Ottawa, was staying at shelter. Paulson said  Zehaf-Bibeau had been in the Canadian capital since at least October 2. During those few weeks, he stayed at the Ottawa Mission shelter, according to residents there. One resident, who asked to be identified only as Brian, recalled running into Zehaf-Bibeau -- who was then chanting and praying -- on the shelter's stairs the night before the attack. \\"I just walked by and I started singing (a Christian song),\\" Brian said. \\"And it didn't affect him at all. He just kept going.\\" Perhaps related to his short time there, Zehaf-Bibeau didn't frequent mosques in Ottawa, according to Aymler mosque imam Mohammed Lahlou. \\"We have no clue about that person,\\" Lahlou said. \\"And that kind of person should not have any place in our community.\\" He is believed to have acted alone. All day Wednesday, Canadian officials vacillated back and forth on whether Zehaf-Bibeau acted alone. By Wednesday night, they settled on the answer: yes. \\"It appears there was just one shooter and that shooter is dead,\\" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson told CNN's Anderson Cooper. He's not connected to a similar incident this week. On Monday, a man who Canadian authorities said was \\"radicalized\\" killed a Canadian soldier with his car in Quebec. That man, Martin Rouleau Couture, was then shot and killed. Paulson said Thursday that investigators have not found any link between Couture and  Zehaf-Bibeau. Prime Minister: 'Terrorist' killed soldier 'in cold blood' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was a 32-year-old Canadian man with a criminal record and a history of mental instability. He had converted to Islam around a decade prior to his attack on a war memorial and Canada's Parliament. Zehaf-Bibeau had been staying at an Ottawa shelter before the attack, and authorities now believe he acted alone in the incident. Zehaf-Bibeau was born in Montreal and had also lived in Calgary and Vancouver. He had a criminal record related to drugs, violence, and other criminal activities. Authorities are looking into whether his criminal past played any role in his radicalization. He had expressed a desire to travel to Syria but was unable to get a passport. He was found to have connections to jihadists, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria. Still, Zehaf-Bibeau was not on a Canadian list of possible extremists, and there is no evidence so far that he had any operational links to other jihadists. It is still uncertain what exactly led to Zehaf-Bibeau's attack and his motivations.

It does not have gendered pronouns, and it uses the same word, \\"hän,\\" for both \\"he\\" and \\"she.\\" Additionally, Finnish has 15 grammatical cases, influencing the way words change their forms and endings to denote their function in a sentence.

We have the equation 3289*u - 98 = 3387*u. Think of \\"u\\" as the number of apples you have. We need to find out how many apples you have by solving for \\"u\\". First, we want to have u (apples) by itself on one side of the equation. Step 1: Let's make the number of apples (u) at the same side. To do this, we'll subtract 3289*u from both sides: 3289*u - 3289*u - 98 = 3387*u - 3289*u This simplifies to: -98 = 98*u Now we have -98 = 98*u. Step 2: To find the number of apples (u), we'll divide both sides by 98: (-98) / 98 = (98*u) / 98 This simplifies to: -1 = u So, the answer is u = -1.

From the uninspired plot to the lackluster performances, this movie quickly became a tiresome affair devoid of any genuine emotional depth or engagement. The storyline, which had potential to captivate the audience, unfortunately faltered under the weight of its own predictability. As the plot unfolded, it quickly became apparent that the screenwriters took the easy route and opted for clichés and overused tropes, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed and disconnected from the narrative. The characters, sadly, were no better; they were one-dimensional and failed to evoke any empathy or connection. The actors clearly tried to make the best of their roles, but it felt as though they were being let down by the script. The dialogue was stilted and unrealistic, and it was difficult to see the motives and emotions behind the characters' actions. Visually, the film was lacking in its ability to create memorable scenes or any sense of grandiosity. The special effects were mediocre at best, and it seemed that the budgetary constraints were holding the production back from reaching its full potential. This resulted in a visual experience that was far from immersive or impactful. Ultimately, [Insert Movie Title] is a disappointing film that does not live up to its potential. It is a frustrating experience that leaves you feeling dissatisfied with the end product. Perhaps with a more thought-out storyline, better character development, and improved production values, this movie could have been something worth watching. But, as it stands, it is hard to recommend [Insert Movie Title] to even the most avid cinema-goer. b).

Given the below context:  The Hut Point and Cape Evans huts remain, protected by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government. Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing the names of those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern.The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America.  She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider.  Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War.  He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey.  Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers.  The young wireless operator, Lionel Hooke, joined Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd and was responsible for many technological innovations.  He became the company's managing director in 1945 and its chairman in 1962, having been knighted for services to industry in 1957. Of the four dogs who survived the trek, Con was killed by the other dogs in a fight before the rescue. The others, Oscar, Gunner and Towser, returned in the ship to New Zealand and were placed in Wellington Zoo, where Oscar lived, allegedly, to the age of 25. Near the end of his life Dick Richards, the last survivor of the party, was without regrets and did not regard the struggle as futile.  Rather, he believed, it was something that the human spirit had accomplished, and that no undertaking carried through to conclusion was for nothing.  Guess a valid title for it!

Context: Of course, the most unforgettable classmate I had was also the most vicious bully. I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.  Question: \\"What was the purpose of the many battles in  Spain and how long did it take\\" Response: \\"The purpose of the battle was to rid of the muslims which took about 400 years\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question by stating that the purpose of the many battles in Spain, known as the Reconquest or the Crusades, was to evict the Muslims and that it took about 400 years to accomplish this goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But there may be a benefit to doing so, as a study has found that 3D films exercise the brain and improve short-term functioning in a similar way to brain-training tests. The research found that people who watched a movie in 3D improved cognitive   skills, compared to those who watched it in 2D. The research was led by neuroscientist  Dr Patrick Fagan from Goldsmiths University in London. More than 100 people took part in the experiment, where participants watched Disney filmBig Hero 6in either standard format or RealD 3D. They also carried out a brain-training-style test before and after seeing a section from the film. The test covered memory, reaction times and cognitive function and the results were compared later. According to the research, which was carried out in partnership with science group Thrill Laboratory, participants experienced a 23 percent increase in cognitive processing, as well as an 11 percent increase in reaction times. Dr Fagan said that the results showed enough of an improvement in brain function to suggest that 3D could play a part in improving brain power in the future. \\"These findings are more significant than you might think,\\" he said. \\"It is a fact that people are living longer and there is a noticeable decline in cognitive brain function in old age which can worsen future quality of life. There has never been a better time to look at ways to improve brain function. The initial results of this study show that 3D films may potentially play a role in slowing this decline.\\" A second part of the experiment involved those watching the film being fitted with headsets that scanned brain activity and this too showed heightened   activity when watching 3D.

Your chinchilla should have a supply of good quality timothy hay available to them at all times. Provide it in a bowl or loose on the bottom of the chinchilla's cage.  You can provide timothy hay in racks and hay balls, but be aware that chinchillas are known for getting stuck in them. Providing hay gives your chinchilla necessary fiber. Chewing hay helps them avoid tooth overgrowth. Pellets provide your chinchilla with a variety of vitamins and nutrients. Choose a pellet that is designed for chinchilla nutrition needs and follow the instructions provided with it for portion sizing. Place the pellets in a food dish and make sure that dish is cleaned daily before the pellets are put in it. Most adult chinchillas should eat around 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of pellets every day, depending on what type of pellets they are given. Feeding them other snacks too frequently can cause digestive problems. Safe treats include raisins, carrots, apple, oats, dried blackberry leaves, rose petals from plants that have not been sprayed with poisons of any kind, unsweetened cheerios, unsweetened shredded wheat, dried rose hips, and safe wood chew sticks. However, these should be given in very small servings and should only be given once or twice a week. Never give fruit, vegetables, nuts, or other treats that are not listed as safe. Use either filtered water or chemical-free tap water and place it in a water bottle with a sipper tube on the end of it that is connected to the side of their cage. Make sure that they have water in that bottle at all times and put clean water in it every day, even if it still has water in it from the day before.  Remember to sterilize the water bottle when changing the water. The algae that grows in their water can cause liver problems or severe diarrhea, or even kill a chinchilla.  Chinchillas cannot handle some naturally occurring bacteria or parasites in water like humans, dogs, and cats can, so you need to be sure that the water you give them is clean.

The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence, yet Amyntas III eventually returned to his kingdom with the aid of Thessalian allies. Amyntas III was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379 BC.Alexander II (r. 370 – 368 BC), son of Eurydice I and Amyntas III, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the tagus (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, capturing the city of Larissa. The Thessalians, desiring to remove both Alexander II and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords, appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic hostages including Alexander II's brother and future king Philip II (r. 359–336 BC– ).

Wales wants to stage the BBC's annual Sports Personality of the Year ceremony as well as other major events. \\"It is well recognised that Cardiff needs a bigger arena,\\" said Mr Skates. London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Belfast, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield all have big arenas while Bristol has a £92m venue planned, The Welsh Government wants to ensure south Wales can compete with other areas of the UK for major music concerts and sporting events. Cardiff council acknowledge it is a \\"major priority\\" and Russell Goodway, cabinet member for investment and development, said: \\"We intend to bring forward our plans in the next few months.\\" London, Manchester and Birmingham, for example, are hosting Lady Gaga on her 2017 world tour while the recently-opened Glasgow's SSE Hydro hosted star American gymnast Simone Biles at the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championship. The government's major events team, which helped bring football's 2017 Champions League and Ashes cricket Tests to Cardiff, want a venue capable of staging similar events. Any new arena would also be used to host Commonwealth Games events such as gymnastics and boxing, if Wales does plan to bid. \\"There are proposals in Cardiff,\\" said Mr Skates. \\"An arena is going to be crucially important for Cardiff in particular, but for Wales as well, capturing new and more major events. \\"In the council and neighbouring authorities, that's well recognised now. That's a piece of work that needs to be taken forward, they know it and we are in discussions with them.\\" Callaghan Square, near Cardiff Central railway station, has been suggested as a potential location for any new indoor arena while the Cardiff Blues rugby region also wants to build a 15,000 arena as part of a £150m development of the Arms Park in Cardiff city centre. \\"There are large events, such as Sports Personality of the Year, which we'd love to host,\\" added Mr Skates. \\"We'd need an arena if we were to host Sports Personality.

Affirmed was also known for his famous rivalry with Alydar, whom he met ten times, including in all three Triple Crown races. Affirmed was the last horse to win the Triple Crown for a 37-year period, which was ended in 2015 by American Pharoah. Affirmed won fourteen Grade Affirmed returned to racing in early August in the Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga. He nearly became an upset loser to the front-running Sensitive Prince but closed in the last 100 yards in a race that Laz Barrera considered one of Affirmed's finest efforts.  Alydar and Affirmed met once more, in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga. Affirmed, piloted by Hall of Fame jockey Laffit Pincay substituting for the injured Cauthen, cut off Alydar entering the far turn, causing his rival to hit the rail and almost go down, losing six lengths before recovering his stride. Affirmed finished first but was disqualified and placed second. The horses never met again, and the final winning tally stood at Affirmed 7, Alydar 3.  Affirmed then prepared to meet another major rival: 1977 Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew. The 1978 Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap marked the first time in racing history that two Triple Crown winners ever met in a race. Seattle Slew was a speed horse and got the first quarter mile in 24 seconds under jockey Angel Cordero, who never allowed Affirmed to get close. Seattle Slew won by three lengths in 1:45 4/5 for the one-turn mile and 1/8. The two horses met once more, in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. This time, Affirmed was to be aided by his stablemate Life's Hope, who was entered in the race to extend Seattle Slew in the early stages. However, Affirmed's saddle slipped during the race, leaving his jockey with almost no control. He tired to finish unplaced for the only time in his career as Exceller and jockey Willie Shoemaker defeated Seattle Slew by a nose.  As a three-year-old, Affirmed won 8 of 11 starts with 2 seconds and 1 unplaced run, for earnings of 901,541.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Question: What could happen to guns if they are wet? Options: - misfire - explode - jam - break - take life  The answer is \\"misfire\\" because Answer:","output":"When guns are exposed to water or moisture, several issues can arise that may impact their performance and safety. The four primary effects of wet conditions on guns include misfire, jam, break, or, in rare cases, explode.  1. Misfire: A misfire occurs when the primer in the cartridge fails to ignite the gunpowder due to the presence of water or moisture. This prevents the gun from firing properly and can be a common issue with wet firearms.  2. Jam: A jam is when the gun's moving parts do not cycle correctly, preventing proper loading, chambering, or ejecting ammunition. Wet conditions can cause rust, corrosion, or debris accumulation, which can lead to jamming issues.  3. Break: Wet conditions can cause metal components of the gun to rust and weaken over time, which may lead to them breaking. Additionally, wooden parts of the gun may absorb moisture, causing them to warp or crack.  4. Explode: Explosions can happen in rare instances when water seeps into the barrel and gets trapped between the bullet and the chamber. When the gun is fired, the water cannot escape quickly enough, and the pressure buildup can cause the barrel or chamber to rupture, resulting in an explosion. This is an uncommon occurrence, but it is still a potential risk with wet firearms.  While \\"take life\\" is not a direct consequence of a gun being wet, it is essential to note that mishandling firearms or using them in unsafe conditions can lead to unintended harm or even fatalities. All firearms should be treated with respect and stored, cleaned, and used according to proper safety guidelines."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: As a part of his engineering job Keith is measuring the vapor pressure of two locomotives, engine A and engine B.  Engine A has a high vapor pressure, but engine B has a low vapor pressure. He noticed that to increase the speed of the engines he needed to increase the vapor pressure.  and a hint : Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases.  Please answer this question : Would engine A have higher or lower temperature than engine B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Engine A would have a higher temperature than Engine B. The relationship between vapor pressure and temperature is directly proportional, meaning that as the temperature of a substance increases, so does its vapor pressure. In the given situation, Engine A has a higher vapor pressure compared to Engine B. Consequently, this implies that Engine A's temperature is higher than that of Engine B. The vapor pressure is a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when the substance is in equilibrium, with the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases remaining constant. An increase in temperature provides the liquid molecules in the two engines with more kinetic energy, enabling more of them to overcome the intermolecular forces, escape the liquid phase, and enter the gas phase. As a result, the vapor pressure rises. Since Engine A has a higher vapor pressure, it is evident that a greater number of its liquid molecules have overcome the intermolecular forces and passed into the gas phase. This increased vapor pressure contributes to an augmentation of the engine's overall speed. In comparison, Engine B, which has a lower vapor pressure, will operate at a lower temperature, and subsequently, lower speed. In summary, Engine A's higher temperature ensures that a larger number of liquid molecules can successfully escape into the gas phase, leading to elevated vapor pressure. Consequently, this higher vapor pressure allows Engine A to operate at a faster speed than Engine B, which has a lower temperature and vapor pressure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages.

One study involved sixty-eight healthy young women and men who ran at least twenty-four kilometers a week. The runners were observed on a treadmill machine  . Sometimes they wore running shoes. Other times they ran barefoot  . Researchers from the JKM Technologies company in Virginia, the University of Virginia and the University of Colorado did the study. They found that running shoes create more stress that could damage knees, hips and ankle joints than running barefoot. They observed that the effect was even greater than the effect reported earlier for walking in high heels. The study appeared in the official scientific journal of The American Academy of Physical Medicine. The other study appeared in the journal Nature. It compared runners in the United States and Kenya. The researchers were from Harvard University in Massachusetts, Moi University in Kenya and the University of Glasgow in Scotland. They divided the runners into three groups. One group had always run shoeless. Another group had always run with shoes. And the third group had changed to shoeless running. Runners who wear shoes usually come down heel first. That puts great force on the back of the foot. But the study found that barefoot runners generally land on the front or middle of their foot. That way they ease into their landing and avoid striking their heel. Harvard's Daniel Lieberman led the study. He says the way most running shoes are designed may explain why those who wear them land on their heels. The heel of the shoe is bigger and heavier than other parts of the shoe, so it would seem more likely to come down first. Also, the heel generally has thick material under it to soften landings. But the researchers do not suggest that runners immediately start running barefoot. They say it takes some training. And there can be risks, like running when your feet are too cold to feel if you get injured. The study was partly supported by Vibram,... What's the main idea of the passage? A) Walking in high heels could cause less serious effects than running barefoot. B) Two new discoveries encourage people to run in high heels. C) Running in shoes is partly good to runners. D) Two new studies prove running without shoes is beneficial to runners in most cases.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I'm not going to comb over TLPS's obvious peterbogdanovichian flaws. Instead, I shall take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy of a film. 1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be endured in its entirety. This fact alone places the movie high up above and all the way up to the top of his lame filmography. 2. Bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky boyfriends can be, by sharing Cybill Shepherd's (his then-gal) fabulous body and breasts with his male audience - and not just on one but on two occasions. Brava! The unquestionable highlights of this cinematic festa del siesta. 3. TLPS has barely a scene without stereotypical country music doodling in the background. (Peter tried to make the obvious point that the movie is set in America's Deep South (as if it weren't bleedin' obvious) so he hammered that point on and on and on...) How is this an advantage, you might ask? Well, when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases massaging your tired ear-drums, you start experiencing a strange exhilaration: \\"The movie's finally over!\\" It's pure joy. 4. The movie gives all women who look like Cloris Leachman hope. Hope that they, too, may one day snatch a much younger and maybe even good-looking boyfriend. 5. Cloris Leachman's biography (which I realize isn't technically a part of TLPS) gives hope to all women that look like that, that they too may one day win a Miss Chicago beauty pageant. (Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury with.) (You think I'm joking abut Cloris having won a beauty pageant, huh? Well, check out her bio and then we'll see who laughs last...)  6. The movie was shot in black and white which spared us the sight of Cloris Leachman's face in its original, natural non-glory. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?  *negative. *positive....I think the answer is","output":"Negative. The reviewer had a lot of criticisms about the movie, even though they did mention some positive aspects. But overall, they seemed to not really enjoy it.

It met the emphatic approval of the circle of friends of the then Crown Prince ( later King Frederick William IV of Prussia ) , which was composed of men of anti-revolutionary views , influenced by Romanticism and by Karl Ludwig von Haller . Jarcke assumed the editorship of the periodical Politische Wochenblatt , founded by these men in 1831 to promote their ideas .

The official language is Slovak, a member of the Slavic language family.  - The Margraviate of Brandenburg was a major principality of the Holy Roman Empire from 1157 to 1806. Also known as the March of Brandenburg (\\"), it played a pivotal role in the history of Germany and Central Europe.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - The Duchy of Prussia or Ducal Prussia was a duchy in eastern Prussia established during the Protestant Reformation in 1525. It was the first Lutheran duchy with a dominant German-speaking population, as well as Polish and Lithuanian minorities. In old texts and in Latin, the term \\"Prut(h)enia\\" refers alike to \\"Ducal Prussia\\", its western neighbor Royal Prussia, and their common predecessor, Teutonic Prussia. The adjectival form of the name was \\"Prut(h)enic\\".  - The concept of Germany as a distinct region in central Europe can be traced to Roman commander Julius Caesar, who referred to the unconquered area east of the Rhine as \\"Germania\\", thus distinguishing it from Gaul (France), which he had conquered. The victory of the Germanic tribes in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (AD 9) prevented annexation by the Roman Empire, although the Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior were established along the Rhine. Following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Franks conquered the other West Germanic tribes. When the Frankish Empire was divided among Charlemagne's heirs in 843, the eastern part became East Francia. In 962, Otto I became the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, the medieval German state.  - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - A unitary state is a state governed as a single power in which the central government is ultimately supreme and any administrative divisions (sub-national units) exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. The majority of states in the world have a unitary system of government. Of the 193 UN member states, 165 of them are governed as unitary states.  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr.  - The German Revolution or November Revolution was a civil conflict in the German Empire at the end of the First World War that resulted in the replacement of Germany's Imperial government with a republic. The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the establishment in August 1919 of a republic that later became known as the Weimar Republic.  - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs. It was established in 1947 and is published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the International Organization Foundation. The editor-in-chief is Jon Pevehouse (University of WisconsinMadison).  - Centrope is an Interreg IIIA project to establish a multinational region in the Central Europe encompassing four European countries: Slovakia, Austria, Hungary and Czech Republic.  - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, , or OPEP in several other languages) is an intergovernmental organization of 13 nations, founded in 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela), and headquartered since 1965 in Vienna. As of 2015, the 13 countries accounted for an estimated 42 percent of global oil production and 73 percent of the world's \\"proven\\" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by American-dominated multinational oil companies.  - Brandenburg (Lower Sorbian: \\"Bramborska\\") is one of the sixteen federated states of Germany. It lies in the northeast of the country covering an area of 29,478 square kilometers and has 2.48 million inhabitants. The capital and largest city is Potsdam.

Movie title: Sick Girl Movie plot: Ida Teeter (Angela Bettis) is a shy entomologist who has a wide variety of insects all over her home, which caused her girlfriend to break up with her. Ida is introduced to the beautiful and strange girl Misty Falls (Erin Brown a.k.a. Misty Mundae), and is drawn to her. A mysterious package arrives for Ida one day, containing a large unidentifiable mantis-like insect. Landlady Lana Beasley is concerned with Ida's âpetsâ and the effect that may be laid upon her ten-year-old granddaughter Betty, who likes to disguise herself as a ladybug. Betty in turn looks up to Ida, much to Beasleyâs dismay, and Ida promises to keep the insects under check. Later that night, she examines the new insect, which she fondly names âMickâ, and informs her friend Max of the creature. Meanwhile, âMickâ escapes from his tank and attacks Beasleyâs pet dog, consuming the animal. The next day, Ida asks Misty out. They go on a date, and Misty asks if they can watch a movie about âTexas Pixiesâ on Ida's DVD player, which Ida accepts. Misty is introduced to Betty and the apartment, though Ida keeps her away from the bedroom where all her insects are hidden. The two get closer until interrupted by Max. Ida returns to find Misty asleep on the couch. She returns with a pillow (that has Mick inside) to give to Misty. In gratitude for Ida allowing her to stay, Misty returns the favor by seducing Ida. Unknowingly, Mickâs proboscis nips Misty's ear, which Misty dismisses. The next morning, Ida awakens to find that Misty has discovered her secret bug stash and has a great interest in bugs. They spend more time together, although Misty becomes weak and begins displaying unusual tendencies. Misty later comes across the pillow with Mick in it, and discovers that she has strange urges to lie next to it; the insect invades her much-chewed and saliva-doused ear with its proboscis.

This is one of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers films, or at least one of my favorites. Most of the A-R movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories. This still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other films. This movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs. The music is the central theme here and what's nice is the addition of a tap solo by Rogers. She not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure. She dances also with Fred, of course, and they're always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor. Growing up in the 1950s watching \\"Ozzie & Harriet\\" on television, it was a real kick the first time I saw this to see such a young Harriet Hilliard. No surprise than Ozzie fell for this beauty. Although she had that short early '30s hairstyle, I recognized her voice right away. Also in this movie are quick appearances by Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit that I have yet to out Ball. I can't find her, but I know she's in here. Astaire, except for some obnoxious gum-chewing in the first third of the film, was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - although better in westerns - is likable, too. This is simply a nice, feel-good film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is decidedly positive. The reviewer clearly views the film in high regard, appreciating not only the classic elements of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' performances but also the distinctive features the film offers.  The reviewer commends the film's strong musical component, celebrates the presence of multiple likable characters, and appreciates the addition of a tap solo by Rogers to the movie. The reviewer finds joy in recognizing Harriet Hilliard from \\"Ozzie & Harriet\\" and seems to emotionally connect with seeing her in a much earlier role in her career. Although the reviewer comments on Astaire's gum-chewing as obnoxious, this appears more of an amusing curiosity rather than a substantive criticism of the film. Similarly, the note about Randolph Scott being better in westerns serves as a mild critique that doesn't significantly detract from the reviewer's overall appreciative outlook. Another strong marker of the review's positive sentiment is the language the reviewer uses, with descriptions like \\"not just great dancing but likable characters,\\" \\"always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor,\\" and \\"a nice, feel-good film.\\" These phrases ooze positivity and enthusiasm toward the film. Finally, the fondness felt when the reviewer mentions being unable to spot Lucille Ball is potentially another indication of their positive sentiment—the act of trying to engage with the film at deeper, even trivial, levels often reflects an affinity for it. In summary, the reviewer reflects ample enjoyment and appreciation for the film, resulting in an overwhelmingly positive review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

New President’s Council to Focus on Kids and Money President Obama has authorized a private-sector advisory council focused squarely on young people's ability to learn about money. Student debt and early retirement saving are high on the hit list. Flying somewhat under the radar, President Obama last month authorized another commission to help raise financial awareness—this one focused solely on young people. Members will be selected from the private sector over the next few months, and the group should hold its first meeting by the end of the year. We already have a Financial Literacy and Education Commission comprising the heads of 21 federal agencies including Treasury and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This group put together our national strategy for financial education and runs MyMoney.gov, an impartial personal finance website. We also have had a President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability comprising private-sector leaders in finance and education. This group issued its final report in January offering ideas for improving personal finance education and was responsible for two helpful websites—moneyasyougrow.org, which details what kids should know about money at what age, and moneyasyoulearn.org, which offers teachers tools to integrate personal finance lessons into subject areas like math and English. Now we have the new President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans. As the name suggests, this puts the federal government’s focus on young people. That is precisely where it should be as it relates to raising the financial I.Q. of Americans. The new group’s mission will be to: Countries such as Australia and Britain have mandated that financial education be part of every school’s curricula, signaling the importance of reaching young people and making money decisions a natural part of their life. We have no such mandate in the U.S. and likely never will. But we’re making progress. The JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy and the Council for Economic Education, two leading nonprofits in the fight against global financial illiteracy, have crafted standards to help schools in all 50 states begin to teach personal finance. They were instrumental in creating a model that encourages and instructs teachers interested in taking on the mission. There is now a broad effort to get personal finance incorporated into the common core initiative, which 46 states have agreed to. Private sector organizations like the credit card company Visa and accounting firm PwC have contributed millions of dollars to train teachers. Personal financial know-how on a broad scale is seen as the best way to avoid another financial crisis. After all, if you understand that you can’t afford the mortgage when the teaser rate expires, you probably won’t buy the house. Adults need help too, and that’s partly why we have the CFPB—to keep financial institutions from preying on those with little money savvy. But a council dedicated solely to young people puts the financial literacy mission squarely where it belongs. This is a long-term approach. We might as well get started.

Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"In order to accurately determine whether the suggested answer should be validated, it is important to first examine the question and provided information thoroughly and to consider the context. The original question posed was \\"how does Lex Luthor die in Superman?\\" It is clear that the individual is seeking information about a specific event or storyline relating to the character Lex Luthor's death within the Superman context. The suggested answer provided offers general information about Lex Luthor, stating that he is a fictional character, a supervillain, appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. Although this information is accurate, it does not directly answer the original question regarding Lex Luthor's death in Superman. Therefore, the suggested answer should not be validated as it fails to address the original query. Instead, a more appropriate response would delve into instances where Lex Luthor has died or faced life-threatening situations in different Superman storylines.  For instance, one of Lex Luthor's most notable deaths occurred in the 1996 storyline \\"The Final Night.\\" In this arc, Luthor sacrifices himself to save Earth from an impending catastrophe. However, as often happens with comic book characters, Luthor is later revealed to be alive, having used a clone body to fake his death. Throughout various Superman comics, cartoons, and movies, Lex Luthor has faced death or near-death situations only to somehow reemerge, thanks to alternate timelines, alternate realities, or the limitless possibilities of fiction.  In conclusion, the suggested answer should not be validated as it lacks relevance to the original question. A more appropriate response would explore different instances of Luthor's death or life-threatening events in the Superman universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We get a film , or a book , and we want more , and if we do not get more , we write fanfiction . I know this is not exactly a thing that begun in the XXth century , but I think that Tolkien and Tezuka are two of the key authors that helped turn the world of entertainment into what it is today . There are , of course , lots of differences as well . Their mindsets could not be more different . Question: Why do they believe Tolkien and Tezuka are key authors ?","output":"The user believes that Tolkien and Tezuka are key authors because they both played significant roles in shaping the world of entertainment in the 20th century. Here's a step-by-step justification for this belief: 1. Impact on their respective fields: Both Tolkien and Tezuka had a strong impact on their respective fields. Tolkien, as a prominent author in the fantasy literature genre, created the well-known Middle-earth universe and various novels, including 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings.' Tezuka, on the other hand, was a Japanese manga artist, writer, and animator who is considered the \\"father of manga\\" and \\"godfather of anime.\\" He created Astro Boy, Kimba the White Lion, and Black Jack, among others.  2. Influence on future generations: Their works have left a lasting impression on authors and artists alike. Tolkien popularized the fantasy genre and inspired countless authors, including George R.R. Martin and J.K. Rowling. Tezuka, as a pioneer in the manga and anime industry, also inspired future creators like Hayao Miyazaki and Satoshi Kon. 3. Creation of expansive universes: Both Tolkien and Tezuka created intricate worlds with deep lore and characters. Tolkien's Middle-earth is a carefully crafted universe with its languages, history, and mythology. Tezuka's vast body of work features interconnected stories and recurrent characters while exploring various themes, which allows fans to immerse themselves even deeper into his creations. 4. Fostering fan communities and engagement: The significant impact of Tolkien and Tezuka's works generated substantial fan communities who bonded over shared love and appreciation for their storytelling. This led to the creation of fanfiction - stories written by fans that use the original works' characters and settings as a base. This increases engagement and keeps their legacies alive. 5. Variety in themes and messages: Despite their different mindsets, both Tolkien and Tezuka tackled various themes and imparted messages in their works. This allowed them to resonate with their readers/viewers on multiple levels and transcend cultural barriers, further establishing their significance as key authors in their respective fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

President Donald Trump suffered a political setback Tuesday when Democrats won easy victories in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration.

Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century.  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. The first is that their back story will be available online so there is no need to ask about it. The second is that there would not be enough time anyway. Debbie Jevans, the chief executive of next year's England 2015 Rugby World Cup was different - is different - which perhaps explains why the Guardian named her the most influential woman in British sport earlier this year. A cynic might say that sounds a bit like topping a list of famous Belgians, Welsh World Cup heroes or English lacrosse legends, and Jevans would probably agree. When the main funding bodies in British sport declared they wanted female representation of at least 25% on the boards of national governing bodies by 2017, Jevans did not mince her words. \\"Is it ambitious enough? I don't think so,\\" she said. \\"Surely we've got to be aiming at 50%. \\"The talent is out there, the problem is that too often the default position is to see jobs in sport as male.\\" But the thing about default positions is they are usually triggered when something goes wrong - Jevans' life in sports administration seems to be an exercise in preventing that from ever happening. A former junior champion at Wimbledon, Jevans had a professional playing career that probably went under the radar at the time but would earn her a fortune now. Between 1979 and 1983, she played in 10 Grand Slam singles tournaments, with the highlight a run to the fourth round of Wimbledon that was ended by Virginia Wade. She also played a lot of doubles, reaching the quarter-finals of the mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 1978. Her partner was Andrew Jarrett, a man she would later marry. He is now Wimbledon's tournament referee. After her time on the pro circuit came to an end Jevans moved smoothly into the ranks of officialdom. By 1987, aged just 27, she was director of the women's game at the International Tennis Federation, and four years later she became general secretary. She then set up her own consultancy firm, working at one stage for the International Rugby Board in its bid to get rugby union back into the Olympics. But the really big break, or brave move, came in 2003 when she joined London's bid team for the 2012 Olympics. Her job was to draw up the budget and strategy for staging the sports (not building the venues!), a job she saw through to glorious completion nine hard, but happy, years later. Having managed 20,000 staff and a budget of £160m so successfully, it was not a surprise when she was given the chance to lead England Rugby 2015, an event that some claim is now the third biggest sports event in the world. Yet hers is a name the vast majority of British sports fans will not know, a face they have rarely seen on television, a voice they have rarely heard on the radio. And those previous six paragraphs of biography are pretty much all that is available for a woman who is well down the road to delivering her second global sports spectacular in three years. \\"I'd much rather be judged by the work of my team than talk about me,\\" she said when I tried to get her to talk about herself. \\"A public profile isn't important to me. But I will answer personal questions. Or you can at least ask them!\\" I tried for a bit - she is now amicably divorced from Jarrett, no kids, still plays doubles, born in Essex, lives in Chelsea, supports Leeds United. But half of the stuff we know about people with important jobs is none of our business. What matters is that they can do those jobs. Jevans can. \\"When I look back to the Olympics, what really made me happy was sitting in the stadium and just seeing how well everything went,\\" is her greatest memory of the greatest summer most British sports fans can remember. It went so well because Jevans and her team worked methodically from milestone to milestone - \\"proper milestones, not soft deadlines that can be missed\\" is how she describes it. She is following the same strategy for the Rugby World Cup. We were talking on the morning the window for registering for tickets was opened. A week before it had been the announcement of the tournament's training venues. A week later it would be a series of events to mark a \\"year to go\\". Now, a month on, Jevans is dealing with a problem she foresaw at least two years ahead. With demand for tickets, particularly England tickets, outstripping supply, the tournament risks being tarnished by cynical touts and their eye-watering prices. Nobody can accuse Jevans of sleepwalking into this. She spent the first two years of her job cajoling the Government to grant the Rugby World Cup the same legal protection from touts that the Olympics enjoyed and football gets. She failed, or was failed, but it is to her credit that she is not whining about it. \\"We lobbied Government about that but they decided against any new legislation,\\" she told me. \\"They didn't feel it was necessary. We have accepted that and respect the decision.\\" What Jevans did next was to put in place a series of measures that should at least limit the scope for blatant profiteering, and make sure as many genuine fans as possible can get to the games without second mortgages. If last month's public ballot for tickets is an indication of things to come, Jevans is very much on the case: calmly, quietly, but ever so effectively. It is a style that, despite my earlier bad joke about the lack of influential women in British sport, is becoming increasingly, and better-late-than-neverly, common. This year's magnificent Tour de France Grand Depart was understatedly engineered by another woman who earned her stripes with London 2012, Nicky Roche. Last year's well-regarded Rugby League World Cup was partly run by Sally Bolton, whose next trick will be to organise the 2017 World Athletics Championships. Throw Sport England's boss Jennie Price, UK Sport's chief executive Liz Nicholl and the Sports Minister Helen Grant into the mix and you have quite a sisterhood. Not content with shaking up one male-dominated sport, Jevans joined the Football League's board as an independent director this summer. \\"It's definitely getting better,\\" she acknowledged when I asked about the progress so many talented women were making in the higher ranks of British sport now. \\"But if I have a frustration it's that is has taken too long. It's great that people have been overt in their statements about equality, but it was frustrating. \\"We're getting there, though, and not just in sport. It's happening at FTSE-100 companies and in 'male' industries like construction. So the tide is turning.\\" Soon, the likes of Jevans will have washed away the last vestiges of a world where administrators were always, to paraphrase the former England rugby union captain Will Carling, boring, old, windy and male. Jevans is speaking at the Transforming Sport conference at Lord's on Thursday, 30 October.","output":"Debbie Jevans, the most influential woman in British sports, is working hard to organize the 2015 Rugby World Cup and promote gender equality in sports administration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Context: , commonly known as Tokyo Metro, is a rapid transit system in Tokyo, Japan. While it is not the only rapid transit system operating in Tokyo, it has the higher ridership among the two operators: in 2014, the Tokyo Metro had an average daily ridership of 6.84 million passengers, while the other system, the Toei Subway, had 2.85 million average daily rides., History. JR East was incorporated on 1 April 1987 after being spun off from the government-run Japanese National Railways (JNR). The spin-off was nominally \\"privatization\\", as the company was actually a wholly owned subsidiary of the government-owned JNR Settlement Corporation for several years, and was not completely sold to the public until 2002., Served by Shinkansen high-speed rail lines, Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo. It is the busiest station in Japan in terms of number of trains per day (over 3,000), and the fifth-busiest in Eastern Japan in terms of passenger throughput. It is also served by many regional commuter lines of Japan Railways, as well as the Tokyo Metro network., The is the name given to a 159.9 kilometre section of the Thoku Main Line between Ueno Station in Tokyo and Kuroiso Station in Nasushiobara , Tochigi , Japan . It is part of the East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) network . Service on the line has been extended to Tokyo Station via the Ueno - Tokyo Line ., High-speed rail is a type of rail transport that operates significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, using an integrated system of specialized rolling stock and dedicated tracks. While there is no single standard that applies worldwide, new lines in excess of and existing lines in excess of are widely considered to be high-speed, with some extending the definition to include lower speeds in areas for which these speeds still represent significant improvements. The first such system began operations in Japan in 1964 and was widely known as the bullet train. High-speed trains normally operate on standard gauge tracks of continuously welded rail on grade-separated right-of-way that incorporates a large turning radius in its design., Lines. This station serves as the terminal station for two subsections of the JR East Tohoku Main Line, connecting the Utsunomiya Line (for , , and to the south and the Southern Thoku Main Line (for , , and to the north.

It runs through the more sparsely populated Thoku region of Japan's main island, Honshu, and is being extended as the Hokkaido Shinkansen through the Seikan Tunnel to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto (this section opened March 2016) and on to Sapporo by 2030. It has two Mini-shinkansen branch lines, the Yamagata Shinkansen and Akita Shinkansen. The line is operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East)., Tokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kant region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former and the ., The is a network of high-speed railway lines in Japan operated by five Japan Railways Group companies. Starting with the Tkaid Shinkansen in 1964, the network has expanded to currently consist of of lines with maximum speeds of , of Mini-shinkansen lines with a maximum speed of , and of spur lines with Shinkansen services. The network presently links most major cities on the islands of Honshu and Kyushu, and Hakodate on northern island of Hokkaido, with an extension to Sapporo under construction and scheduled to commence in March 2031. The nickname bullet train is sometimes used in English for these high-speed trains., The is a 575.7 km long railway line in Japan operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East). Although officially the line starts from Tokyo Station in Chiyoda, Tokyo, most of the long-distance trains actually begin at Ueno Station in Tait, Tokyo, and pass through such cities as Saitama, Utsunomiya, Fukushima, and Sendai, before reaching the end of the line in Morioka. The line originally extended to Aomori, but was truncated upon the extension of the Thoku Shinkansen beyond Morioka, which mostly parallels the Thoku Main Line., Ueno Station is close to Keisei-Ueno Station, the Tokyo terminus of the Keisei Main Line to Narita Airport Station., , abbreviated or \\"JNR\\", was the body which operated the national railway network of Japan from 1949 to 1987., The is a railway line of Japanese private railway company Keisei Electric Railway connecting Tokyo and Narita, Japan.

Article: Our body clock,or natural body rhythm,influences our energy and alertness.Paying attention to it can help us choose the suitable time of day when we best perform specific tasks. The reality,however,is that most of us organize their time around work demands,school deadlines,commuting or social events.Doing whatever your body feels like doing is a luxury in today's fast-paced modem society. But that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying.Obeying our body clock has significant health benefits.Disrupting our natural body rhythm,on the other hand,has been linked to problems such as depression,obesity,or headache,says Steve Key,a biology professor. When the body clock can synchronize(......)the rhythms of its natural processes,it \\"gives us an advantage in daily life\\",says Key. According to him,when it comes to cognitive work,most adults perform best in the late morning.As our body temperature starts to rise just before awakening in the morning and continues to increase until midday,our memory,alertness and concentration gradually improve. However,he adds,our ability to concentrate typically starts to decrease soon thereafter.Most of us are more easily distracted between noon and 4 pm. Alertness also tends to fall after eating a meal and sleepiness tends to peak around 2 pm,making that a good time for a nap. Surprisingly, tiredness may increase our creative powers.For most adults,problems that require open ended thinking are often best dealt with in the evening when they are tired, according to a study in the journal Thinking & Reasoning. When choosing a time of day to exercise,paying attention to your body clock can improve results.Physical performance is usually best from about 3 to 6 pm,says Michael Smolensky,a professor of biomedical engineering. Of course, not everyone's body clock is the same,making it even harder to synchronize natural rhythms with daily plans. Question: Which of the following is NOT true? Options: A: Our alertness is influenced by our natural body rhythm B: Doing whatever your body feels like is very difficult in our modem society. C: Obeying our body clock is good for our health.

He works as an exterminator and is a crude womanizer. He coaches the Bears, a children's baseball team with poor playing skills. They play their first game and do not even make an out before he forfeits the game. The entire team decides to quit after but Buttermaker forces them out of quitting and promises to be a better coach. Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kane Kraft), a skilled pitcher, is the 12-year-old daughter of one of his ex-girlfriends. After a couple requests, she decides to join the team. Kelly Leak, a local troublemaker but solid hitter, also joins the team, and the Bears start winning games. The Bears eventually make it to the championship game. In the middle of that game, the Bears and Yankees fight after Amanda is shoved during a play at the plate. A few innings later the Yankees coach Ray Bullock (Greg Kinnear) has his son Joey intentionally walk Mike Engleberg, one of the Bears' best hitters. Instead of walking him, he almost hits Engleberg, causing Ray to push Joey to the ground in anger. As revenge, Joey throws Engleberg an easy pitch which he smacks for a home run and would leave the game with his mother. Later, Buttermaker changes the lineup, putting the benchwarmers in and taking out some of the good players which causes the Bears to fall behind heading into the last half of the inning. With two outs, one of the Bears players, Garo, drives in two runs and tries to score to tie the game but is thrown out at the plate on a close call, causing the Bears to lose the championship 8â7. After the game, Buttermaker gives them non-alcoholic beer, and they spray it all over each other. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of trying, knowing that winning is not so important.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Detailed Instructions: Languages typically provide more than one grammatical construction to express certain types of messages. Your task is to generate a senetence with the same meaning as given sentence, but with different grammatical construction. Q: Maria reimbursed a man the funds A:","output":"The task is asking to rewrite the given sentence, which is \\"Maria reimbursed a man the funds,\\" using different grammatical constructions but maintaining the same meaning. The guideline is to vary the sentence's structure without changing the overall message it's conveying. For \\"Maria reimbursed a man the funds,\\" one possible rephrase would be: A: \\"A man was reimbursed the funds by Maria.\\" In this revision, we've transformed the sentence from an active voice construction (Maria - subject, reimbursed - verb, a man the funds - object) to a passive voice construction (A man - subject, was reimbursed - passive verb, the funds by Maria - object). The overall meaning remains the same, but the focus now is on the man who was the recipient of Maria's action."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
